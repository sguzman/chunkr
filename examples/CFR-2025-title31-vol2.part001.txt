59 FR 42162, Aug. 17, 1994, unless otherwise noted.
§ 337.0
Scope of regulations.
The United States Department of the Treasury is the agent of the Federal Housing Administration for transactions in any debentures which have been or may be issued pursuant to the authority conferred by the National Housing Act, 12 U.S.C. 1701
et seq.,
as amended from time to time, including Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund Debentures, Housing Insurance Fund Debentures, War Housing Insurance Fund Debentures, Military Housing Insurance Fund Debentures, and National Defense Housing Insurance Fund Debentures. In accordance with the regulations adopted by the Federal Housing Commissioner and approved by the Secretary of the Treasury, such transactions are governed by regulations of the Department of the Treasury, so far as applicable. The Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Office of Fiscal Service Accounting operates the FHA debenture computer system and performs the day-to-day operations and transactions relating to the debentures.
[66 FR 56432, Nov. 8, 2001]

# Subpart A—Certificated Debentures
§ 337.1
Applicability of Treasury regulations.
The general regulations governing United States securities, part 306 of this chapter, apply, as the regulations for similar transactions and operations in certificated debentures. To the extent that the provisions in this part differ from the provisions in part 306, the provisions in this part shall prevail.
§ 337.2
Transportation charges and risks.
Debentures presented for redemption at call or maturity, or for authorized prior purchase, or for conversion to book-entry form, must be delivered at the expense and risk of the holder. Debentures bearing restricted assignments may be forwarded by registered mail, but for the owner's protection debentures bearing unrestricted assignments should be forwarded by insured registered mail.
[66 FR 56432, Nov. 8, 2001]
§ 337.3
Termination of transfers and denominational exchange transactions.
Debentures, which by their terms are subject to call, may be called for redemption, in whole or in part, at par and accrued interest, on any interest date on three months' notice. No transfers or denominational exchanges in certificated debentures covered by a given call will be made on the books of the Department of the Treasury on or after the announcement of such call. However, this does not affect the right of a holder of such debenture to sell and assign it on or after the announcement of the call date.
§ 337.4
Presentation and surrender.
(a)
For redemption.
To facilitate the redemption of called or maturing debentures, they may be presented and surrendered in the manner prescribed in this section in advance of the call or maturity date, as the case may be. Early presentation by holders will insure prompt payment of principal and interest when due. The debentures must first be assigned by the registered payee or his assignee, or by his duly constituted representative, if required, in the form and manner indicated in § 337.5, and must then be submitted to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service at the address given in § 337.14, accompanied by appropriate written advice. A transmittal advice for this purpose will accompany the notice of call.
(b)
For purchase.
Debentures, the purchase of which has been authorized prior to call or maturity, may be assigned as instructed in paragraph (a) of this section and immediately submitted in accordance with procedures prescribed by HUD for this purpose.
[59 FR 42162, Aug. 17, 1994, as amended at 66 FR 56432, Nov. 8, 2001]
§ 337.5
Assignments.
(a) If the registered payee, or an assignee holding a certificated debenture under proper assignment from the registered payee, desires that payment be made to such payee or assignee, the debenture need not be assigned. If the owner desires for any reason that payment be made to another, without intermediate assignment, the debentures should be assigned to “The Federal Housing Commissioner for redemption (or, purchase) for the account of ____,” inserting the name and address of the person to whom payment is to be made. Proof of the authority of the individual assigning on behalf of an owner will be required in accordance with part 306 of this chapter.
(b) An assignment in blank or other assignment having similar effect will be recognized, but in that event the debenture would be, in effect, payable to bearer, and payment will be made in accordance with the instructions received from the person surrendering the debenture for redemption or purchase. For the owner's protection, such assignments should be avoided unless the owner is willing to lose the protection afforded by registration.
(c) Debentures submitted for conversion to book-entry form should be assigned to “The Federal Housing Commissioner for conversion to book-entry debentures for the account of ____.” The registration on the book-entry account and/or the account number in which the debentures should be deposited should be indicated.
(d) All assignments must be made on the debentures themselves unless otherwise authorized by the Department of Treasury.
§ 337.6
Conversions to book-entry.
Upon implementation of the book-entry debenture system, to be announced in advance by separate public notice, all new debentures will be issued only in book-entry form, and may not thereafter be converted to certificated form.
Certificated debentures may, upon the owner's request in accordance with § 337.5(c), be converted to book-entry. If such action is taken, the owner shall be deemed to have irrevocably waived the right to hold such debenture in certificated form.
§ 337.7
Servicing transactions.
Upon implementation of the book-entry debenture system, to be announced in advance by separate public notice, any transfer or denominational exchange of certificated debentures generally will be made in book-entry form. If certificated debentures are desired, the owner should so request in writing, before the book-entry debentures are issued.
§ 337.8
Payment of mortgage insurance premiums.
When certificated debentures are tendered for purchase prior to maturity in order that the proceeds thereof be applied to pay for mortgage insurance premiums, any difference between the amount of the debentures purchased and the amount of the mortgage insurance premium will generally be issued to the owner in the form of a book-entry debenture in the exact amount of such difference, provided it is one dollar ($1.00) or more. However, if the owner so requests, such difference will be settled with certificated debenture(s), together with a cash adjustment, if any. Such request should be made in writing, before the book-entry debenture in the amount of the difference is issued.
§ 337.9
Payment of final interest.
Final interest on any debenture, whether purchased prior to or redeemed on or after the call or the maturity date, will be paid with the principal. In all cases the payment of principal and final interest will be mailed or directed to the payment address given in the form of advice accompanying the debenture surrendered.
§ 337.10
Payments.
Payments on certificated debentures will be made by fiscal agency check in accordance with part 355 of this chapter, or, upon request, by direct deposit (electronic funds transfer) in accordance with part 370 of this chapter. Information as to the deposit account at the financial institution designated to receive a direct deposit payment shall be provided on the appropriate form(s) designated by the Department.

# Subpart B—Book-Entry Debentures
§ 337.11
Original issue and conversions.
Upon implementation of the book-entry debenture system, to be announced in advance by separate public notice, all new debentures will be issued only in book-entry form in the exact amount payable to the owner. Once issued in book-entry form, a debenture may not be converted to certificated form.
§ 337.12
Applicability of TREASURY DIRECT regulations.
The regulations governing the TREASURY DIRECT Book-Entry Securities System (TREASURY DIRECT) (part 357 of this chapter) apply to govern transactions in FHA book-entry debentures, with the following exceptions:
(a)
Securities account.
(See § 357.20 of this chapter.) An account in the book-entry debenture system may be established by the Department of the Treasury upon receipt of the request that a new debenture be issued or that a certificated debenture be converted to book-entry form. The statement of account shall contain information regarding the account as of the date of such statement. It will include a unique account number, but will not include price information.
(b)
Transfers.
(See § 357.22 of this chapter.) A book-entry debenture may be transferred only between accounts established in the FHA book-entry debenture system.
(c)
Debentures announced for call.
Debentures, which by their terms are subject to call, may be called for redemption, in whole or in part, at par and accrued interest, on any interest date on three months' notice. For purposes of a transaction request affecting ownership and/or payment instructions with respect to a debenture announced for call, a proper request must be received not less than twenty (20) calendar days
preceding the next payment date. If the twentieth day preceding a payment date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or a Federal holiday, the last day set for the receipt of a transaction request will be the last business day preceding that date. If a transaction request is received less than twenty (20) calendar days preceding a payment date, the Department may, in its discretion, act on such request if sufficient time remains for processing. If a transaction request is received too late for completion of the requested transaction, principal and final interest on the called debentures will be paid to the owner of record and sent to the payment address of record.
(d)
Payments.
(See § 357.26 of this chapter.) Direct deposit (electronic funds transfer) payments with respect to debentures, e.g., principal, interest and cash adjustments, will be made without prenotification messages.
§ 337.13
Payment of mortgage insurance premiums.
When book-entry debentures are being purchased prior to maturity to pay for mortgage insurance premiums, the difference between the amount of the debentures purchased and the mortgage insurance premiums shall be issued to the owner in the form of a book-entry debenture in the exact amount of such difference, provided it is one dollar ($1.00) or more.

# Subpart C—Additional Information
§ 337.14
Address for further information.
Further information regarding the issuance of, transactions in, and redemption of, FHA debentures may be obtained from the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Office of Fiscal Service Accounting, 200 Third Street, P.O. Box 396, Parkersburg, West Virginia 26102-0396.

§ 337.15
General provisions.
As fiscal agents of the United States, Federal Reserve Banks are authorized to perform any necessary acts under this part. The Secretary of the Treasury may at any time or from time to time prescribe supplemental and amendatory regulations governing the matters covered by this part, notice of which shall be communicated promptly to the registered owners of the debentures.

§ 339.0
Offering of Series H bonds in exchange for Series E bonds and savings notes.
The Secretary of the Treasury, pursuant to the authority of the Second Liberty Bond Act, as amended, hereby offers to the people of the United States, U.S. Savings Bonds of Series H in exchange for outstanding U.S. Savings Bonds of Series E and U.S. Savings Notes (freedom shares) without regard to the annual limitation on holdings for the Series H bonds. The Series H bonds offered hereunder are those described in Department Circular No. 905, current revision, except as otherwise specifically provided herein. This offering will continue until terminated by the Secretary of the Treasury.

# Editorial Note:
The sale of U.S. Savings Bonds, Series H, was terminated at the close of business Dec. 31, 1979. See 44 FR 77158, Dec. 31, 1979.
§ 339.1
Definitions of words and terms as used in this circular.
Unless the context otherwise requires or indicates:
(a)
Securities
mean outstanding U.S. Savings Bonds of Series E and U.S. Savings Notes (freedom shares).
(b)
Owner
means an owner of securities, except a commercial bank in its own right (as distinguished from a representative or fiduciary capacity) and a nonresident alien who is a resident of an area with respect to which the Treasury Department restricts or regulates delivery of checks drawn against funds of the United States or any agency or instrumentality thereof. The term includes a registered owner, whether or not a natural person, either coowner (but only the
principal coowner
if Series H bonds are requested in a form of registration different from that on the securities submitted), a surviving beneficiary, or any other person who would be entitled to reissue under the regulation governing U.S. Savings Bonds,
1
such as, but not limited to, any person entitled to succeed to the estate of a deceased owner.
1
Department Circular No. 530, current revision (31 CFR part 315). Copies may be obtained from any Federal Reserve Bank or Branch or the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Washington, DC 20220.
(c)
Commercial bank
means a bank accepting demand deposits.
(d)
Interest
means the increment in value on Series E savings bonds and on savings notes.
(e)
Principal coowner
means a coowner who purchased the securities submitted for exchange with his own funds or received them as a gift, legacy or inheritance or as a result of judicial proceedings and had them reissued in coownership form, provided he has received no contribution in money or money's worth from the other coowner for designating him on the securities.
§ 339.2
Denominations.
Series H bonds, available for use hereunder, are in denominations of $500, $1,000, $5,000 and $10,000.
§ 339.3
Exchanges with privilege of deferring reporting of interest for Federal income tax purposes.
(a)
Tax-deferred exchanges.
Pursuant to the provisions of section 1037(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, the Secretary of the Treasury hereby grants to owners who have not been reporting the interest on their securities on an accrual basis for Federal income tax purposes the privilege of exchanging such securities for Series H bonds and of continuing to defer reporting of the interest on the securities exchanged (except interest referred to in paragraph (b)(5) of this section) for Federal income tax purposes to the taxable year in which the Series H bonds received in exchange are disposed of, are redeemed, or have reached final maturity, whichever is earlier.
2
2
The interest paid semiannually by check on all Series H bonds, whether issued in exchange under this or any other section, or otherwise, is subject to the Federal income tax for the taxable year in which it is received.
(b)
Rules governing the exchange.
(1) Exchange subscription Form PD 3253, completed and executed in accordance with the instructions thereon, the securities, any cash difference (see paragraph (b)(3) of this section), and any supporting evidence which may be required under the governing regulations
3
may be presented or forwarded to any authorized agency.
4
3
For example, a beneficiary named on Series E bonds would have to submit proof of the death of the registered owner in order to exchange such bonds for Series H bonds.
4
Agents authorized to pay Series E bonds and savings notes are authorized to accept and handle exchange subscriptions submitted by natural persons whose names are inscribed on the face of the bonds and notes as owners or coowners in their own right. However, as agents of subscribers they may forward any exchange subscription to a Federal Reserve Bank or Branch or the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Washington, DC 20226, for acceptance and handling.
(2) A Series H bond issued upon exchange will be registered in the name of the owner of the securities submitted in any authorized form of registration. However, the
principal coowner
must be named as owner or coowner.
(3) The total current redemption value of the securities submitted for exchange in any one transaction must amount to $500 or more. If the total current redemption value is in an even multiple of $500, Series H bonds must be requested in that exact amount. If the total current redemption value exceeds $500, but is not in an even multiple of $500, the owner has the option of furnishing cash necessary to obtain Series H bonds of the next higher $500 multiple, or of receiving payment of the difference between the total current redemption value and the next lower multiple of $500. For example, under the rules prescribed in this circular, if the securities submitted for exchange in one transaction total $4,253.33 current redemption value, the owner may elect to:
(i) Receive $4,000 in Series H bonds and the amount of the difference, $253.33, or
(ii) Pay the difference, $246.67, necessary to obtain $4,500 in Series H bonds.
5
5
If a paying agent accepts a subscription solely for the purpose of forwarding it, or if the owner forwards it direct, to a Federal Reserve Bank or Branch or to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, the remittance for the difference, by check or other form of exchange (which will be accepted subject to collection), must be drawn to the order of the Federal Reserve Bank or the United States Treasury, as the case may be. The remittance must accompany the subscription and the securities to be exchanged.
(4) Any amount paid to the owner as a cash adjustment (as in paragraph (3)(i) of this section) must be treated as income for Federal income tax purposes for the year in which it is received up to an amount not in excess of the total interest on the securities exchanged.
6
6
The amount, if any, paid to the owner in excess of the interest is a repayment on account of the purchase price of the securities exchanged, not income.
(5) Each Series H bond issued under this section will be stamped “EX” or “EXCH” to show that it was issued upon exchange. Each bond also will bear a legend showing how much of its issue price represents interest on the securities exchanged. This interest must be treated as income for Federal income tax purposes for the year in which the Series H bond is redeemed, is disposed of, or finally matures, whichever is earlier.
(6) The Series H bonds will be dated as of the first day of the month in which the securities, the exchange subscription, any necessary cash difference and supporting evidence, if any, are accepted for exchange by an authorized agency.
§ 339.4
Exchanges without tax deferral.
Exchanges by owners who:
(a) Report the interest on all of their securities annually for Federal income tax purposes, or
(b) Who elect to report all such interest in the year of the exchange, or
(c) Who are tax-exempt under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 and the regulations issued thereunder,
Will be handled in the same manner and will be governed by the rules prescribed for exchanges under § 339.3. However, the Series H bonds will not bear the legend referred to in § 339.3(b)(5). Any part of the cash adjustment received which represents interest previously reported for Federal income tax purposes need not be accounted for. The Series H bonds may be registered in the name of the owner of the securities submitted in exchange in any authorized form of registration.
§ 339.5
Governing regulations.
All Series H bonds issued under this circular are subject to the regulations, now or hereafter prescribed, contained in Department Circular No. 530, current revision (part 315 of this chapter).
§ 339.6
Fiscal agents.
Federal Reserve Banks and Branches, as fiscal agents of the United States, are authorized to perform such services as may be requested of them in connection with exchanges under these regulations.
§ 339.7
Preservation of rights.
The provisions of Treasury Department Circulars Nos. 530, 653, and 905, as currently revised, are hereby modified and amended to the extent that they are not in accordance with this circular. However, nothing contained
herein shall limit or restrict rights which owners of Series H bonds received in earlier exchanges have heretofore acquired.
§ 339.8
Reservation as to terms of offer.
The Secretary of the Treasury reserves the right to reject any exchange subscription for Series H bonds, in whole or in part, and to refuse to issue or permit to be issued hereunder any such bonds in any case or any class or classes of cases if he deems such action to be in the public interest, and his action in any such respect shall be final.
The foregoing revision and amendment is made for the purpose of granting to owners of savings notes the same privilege afforded owners of Series E savings bonds for exchanging their securities for Series H bonds with or without tax deferral. As good cause exists for making this change, which involves public property and contracts relating to the fiscal and monetary affairs of the United States, I find that notice and public procedures are unnecessary. This action is effected under the provisions of sections 18, 20, and 22 of the Second Liberty Bond Act, as amended (40 Stat. 1309, 48 Stat. 343, 49 Stat. 21, 73 Stat. 621, all as amended; 31 U.S.C. 753, 754b, 757c), and 5 U.S.C. 301.

§ 341.0
Offering of bonds.
The Secretary of the Treasury, under the authority of the Second Liberty Bond Act, as amended, and pursuant to the Self-Employed Individuals Tax Retirement Act of 1962, offers for sale, effective as of January 1, 1963, bonds of the United States, designated as United States Retirement Plan Bonds. The bonds will be available for investment only to:
(a) Bond purchase plans and
(b) Pension and profit-sharing plans, as described in sections 405 and 401, respectively, of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.
This offering of bonds will terminate on April 30, 1982.
[28 FR 405, Jan. 16, 1963, as amended at 47 FR 18596, Apr. 30, 1982]
§ 341.1
Description of bonds.
(a)
Investment yield (interest).
United States Retirement Plan Bonds, hereinafter sometimes referred to as Retirement Plan Bonds, will be issued at par. The investment yields (interest) are as follows:
(1) Bonds with issue dates of January 1, 1963, through May 1, 1966—3.75 percent per annum, compounded semiannually (see Table of Redemption Values in the appendix).
(2) Bonds with issue dates of June 1, 1966, through December 1, 1969—4.15 percent per annum, compounded semiannually (see Table A in the appendix).
(3) Bonds with issue dates of January 1, 1970, through January 1, 1974—5 percent per annum, compounded semiannually (see Table B).
(4) Bonds with issue dates of February 1, 1974, through July 1, 1979—6 percent per annum, compounded semiannually (see Table C).
(5) Bonds with issue dates of August 1, 1979, through October 1, 1980—6.5 percent per annum, compounded semiannually (see Table D).
(6) Bonds with issue dates of November 1, 1980, through September 1, 1981—8 percent per annum, compounded semiannually (see Table E).
(7) Bonds with issue dates of October 1, 1981, or thereafter—9 percent per annum, compounded semiannually (see Table F).
Interest will be paid only upon redemption of the bonds. The accrual of interest will continue until the bonds are redeemed or have reached maturity, whichever is earlier, in accordance with these regulations.
(b)
Term.
The maturity date of any bond issued under this circular shall be indeterminate, but unless sooner redeemed in accordance with the regulations in this part, its investment yield will cease on the interest accrual date coinciding with, or, where no such coincidence occurs, the interest accrual date next preceding, the first day of the sixtieth (60th) month following the date of death of the person in whose name it is registered.
(c)
Denominations—issue date.
Retirement Plan Bonds will be available only in registered form and in denominations of $50, $100, $500, and $1,000. At the time of issue, the issuing agent will enter in the upper right-hand portion of the bond the issue date (which shall be the first day of the month and year in which payment of the purchase price is received by an authorized issuing agent), and will imprint the agent's validating stamp in the lower right-hand portion. The issue date, as distinguished from the date in the agent's validating stamp, will determine the date from which interest will begin to accrue on the bond. A Retirement Plan Bond shall be valid only if an authorized issuing agent receives payment therefor, duly inscribes, dates, stamps, and delivers it.
[28 FR 405, Jan. 16, 1963, as amended at 46 FR 60573, Dec. 11, 1981]
§ 341.2
Registration.
(a)
General.
The registration of Retirement Plan Bonds is limited to the names of natural persons in their own right, whether adults or minors, in either single ownership or beneficiary form. A bond registered in beneficiary form will be inscribed substantially as follows (for example): “John A. Doe payable on death to (or P.O.D.) Richard B. Roe,” No more than one beneficiary may be designated on a bond.
(b)
Inscription.
The inscription on the face of each bond will show the name, address, and date of birth of the registered owner, as well as information as to whether he is a self-employed individual or an employee, and the amount he contributed (if any) out of his own funds toward the purchase price of the bond. In the case of any self-employed individual (who is treated as an employee for the purpose of sections 405 and 401 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954), this amount would be that portion of the purchase price he contributed (if any) as an employee and which he will not take into account in determining the amount deductible for Federal income tax purposes. The name of the beneficiary, if
one is to be designated, will also be shown in the inscription.
[28 FR 405, Jan. 16, 1963, as amended at 71 FR 46857, Aug. 15, 2006]
§ 341.3
Purchase of bonds.
(a)
Agencies.
Retirement Plan Bonds may be purchased over-the-counter or by mail from Federal Reserve Banks and Branches and the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Washington, DC 20226. Customers of commercial banks and trust companies may be able to arrange for the purchase of the bonds through such institutions, but only the Federal Reserve Banks and Branches and the Bureau of the Fiscal Service are authorized to act as official agencies, and the date of receipt of the application and payment by an official agency will govern the dating of the bonds issued.
(b)
Application.
Applications for the purchase of Retirement Plan Bonds should be made on Form PD 3550, accompanied by a remittance to cover the purchase price. Personal checks will be accepted, subject to collection. Checks or other forms of exchange, should be drawn to the Federal Reserve Bank or United States Treasury, as the case may be. Checks payable by endorsement are not acceptable.
(c)
Delivery.
Delivery of bonds will be made in person, or by mail at the risk and expense of the United States, at the address given by the purchaser, but only within the United States, its territories and possessions, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the Canal Zone. No mail deliveries elsewhere will be made. If the registered owner temporarily resides abroad, the bonds will be delivered to such address in the United States as the purchaser directs.
§ 341.4
Proof of purchase.
At the time a Retirement Plan Bond is issued, the issuing agent will furnish therewith to the purchaser, and in cases where the purchaser is different from the person in whose name the bond is inscribed, to the registered owner as well, proof of the purchase on Form PD 3550. The form will show the names and addresses of the purchaser and of the registered owner, the latter's date of birth, social security account number and his classification (
i.e.
, self-employed individual or employee) the number of bonds issued, a description thereof by issue date, serial numbers, denominations, and registration, together with information as to the amount of his contributions (if any) toward the purchase price of the bonds.
§ 341.5
Limitation on holdings.
The limit on the amount of any Retirement Plan Bonds issued during 1974, or in any one calendar year thereafter, that may be purchased in the name of any one person as registered owner is $10,000 (face value).
[39 FR 36114, Oct. 8, 1974]
§ 341.6
Nontransferability.
United States Retirement Plan Bonds are not transferable, and may not be sold, discounted or pledged as collateral for a loan or as security for the performance of an obligation, or for any other purpose.
§ 341.7
Judicial proceedings.
No judicial determinations will be recognized which would give effect to an attempted voluntary transfer inter vivos of a Retirement Plan Bond. Otherwise, a claim against a registered owner will be recognized when established by valid judicial proceedings, but in no case will payment be made to the purchaser at a sale under a levy or to the officer authorized to levy upon the property of the owner under appropriate process to satisfy a money judgement unless or until the bond has become eligible for redemption pursuant to the regulations in this part. Neither the Treasury Department nor any of its agencies will accept notices of adverse claims or of pending judicial proceedings or undertake to protect the interests of litigants who do not have possession of the bond.
§ 341.8
Payment or redemption during lifetime of owner.
(a)
At age 59
1/2
or thereafter.
A Retirement Plan Bond will be redeemable at its current redemption value upon the request of the registered owner (or a person recognized as entitled to act on his behalf), provided he is 59
1/2
years of age or older. The owner's age will be
determined from the date of birth shown on the face of the bond, provided, however, that the Secretary of the Treasury reserves the right in any case or class of cases to require proof, in the form of a duly certified copy of his birth certificate, that the owner has attained the age of 59
1/2
years. If such evidence is unavailable, one of the following documents may be furnished in lieu thereof:
(1) Church records of birth or baptism.
(2) Hospital birth record or certificate.
(3) Physician's or midwife's birth record.
(4) Certification of Bible or other family record.
(5) Military, naturalization or immigration records.
(6) Other evidence of probative value. Similar documentary evidence will also be required to support any claim made by an owner that the date of birth shown on his bond is incorrect.
(b)
Prior to age 59
1/2
years.
A Retirement Plan Bond will be paid at its then current redemption value upon a registered owner's request (or by a person recognized as entitled to act on his behalf) prior to his attainment of age 59
1/2
years upon submission of a physician's statement or any similar evidence showing that the owner has become disabled to such an extent that he is unable to engage in any substantial, gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or to be of long-continued and indefinite duration. The following are examples of impairments which would ordinarily be considered as preventing substantial, gainful activity:
(1) Loss of use of two limbs.
(2) Certain progressive diseases which have resulted in the physical loss or atrophy of a limb, such as diabetes, multiple sclerosis, or Buerger's disease.
(3) Diseases of the heart, lungs, or blood vessels which have resulted in major loss of heart or lung reserve as evidenced by X-ray, electrocardiogram, or other objective findings, so that despite medical treatment breathlessness, pain, or fatigue is produced on slight exertion, such as walking several blocks, using public transportation, or doing small chores.
(4) Cancer which is inoperable and progressive.
(5) Damage to the brain or brain abnormality which has resulted in severe loss of judgment, intellect, orientation, or memory.
(6) Mental diseases (e.g., psychosis or severe psychoneurosis) requiring continued institutionalization or constant supervision of the individual.
(7) Loss or diminution of vision to the extent that the affected individual has a central visual acuity of no better than 20/200 in the better eye after best correction, or has a limitation in the fields of vision such that the widest diameter of the visual fields subtends an angle no greater than 20 degrees.
(8) Permanent and total loss of speech.
(9) Total deafness uncorrectible by a hearing aid.
In any case coming under the provisions of this paragraph, the evidence referred to above must be submitted to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Division of Transactions and Rulings, Parkersburg, WV 26101, for approval before any bonds may be paid. If, after review of the evidence, the Secretary of the Treasury is satisfied that the owner's disability has been established, a letter will be furnished authorizing payment of his Retirement Plan Bonds. This letter must be presented each time any of the owner's bonds are submitted for payment to a Federal Reserve Bank or Branch or to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service.
(c)
Requests for payment
—(1)
By owner.
When redemption of any Retirement Plan Bond is desired by the registered owner under paragraph (a) of this section, it should be presented with the request for payment on the back of the bond signed and duly certified, to a Federal Reserve Bank or Branch or to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Securities Transactions Branch, Washington, DC 20226, or Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Division of Transactions and Rulings, Parkersburg, WV 26101. If payment is requested under paragraph (b) of this section, the letter described therein should accompany the bond.
(2)
By person other than owner.
When redemption of any Retirement Plan
Bond is desired by the legal guardian, committee conservator, or similar representative of the owner's estate under paragraph (a) of this section, it should be presented, with the request signed as described below, to a Federal Reserve Bank or Branch or to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service. If payment is requested under paragraph (b) of this section, the letter described therein should accompany the bond.
1
The request for payment, in either case, should be signed by the representative in his fiduciary capacity before an authorized certifying officer, and must be supported by a certificate or a certified copy of the letters of the appointment from the court making the appointment, under seal, or other proof of qualification if the appointment was not made by a court. Except in the case of corporate fiduciaries, such evidence should state that the appointment is in full force and should be dated not more than one year prior to the presentation of the bond for payment.
1
In any case in which a legal representative has not been appointed for the estate of a registered owner who has attained the age of 59
1/2
years, or who has become disabled, a person seeking payment of a bond on the owner's behalf should furnish a complete statement of the circumstances to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Division of Transactions and Rulings, Parkersburg, WV 26101. Appropriate instructions will then be furnished.
(d)
Partial redemption.
A Retirement Plan Bond in a denomination greater than $50 (face value) which is otherwise eligible for redemption may be redeemed in part, at current redemption value, upon the request of the registered owner (or a person recognized as entitled to act on his behalf), but only in amounts corresponding to authorized denominations. In any case in which partial redemption is desired, before the request for payment is signed, the phrase “to the extent of $__ (face value) and reissue of the remainder” should be appended to the request. Upon partial redemption of the bond, the remainder will be reissued as of the original issue date. No partial redemption of a bond will be made after the death of the owner in whose name it is registered.
[28 FR 405, Jan. 16, 1963, as amended at 42 FR 21611, Apr. 28, 1977]
§ 341.9
Payment or redemption after death of owner.
(a)
Order of precedence where owner not survived by beneficiary.
If the registered owner of a Retirement Plan Bond dies before it has been presented and surrendered for payment, and there is no beneficiary shown thereon, or if the designated beneficiary predeceased the owner, the bond shall be paid in the following order of precedence:
(1) To the duly appointed executor or administrator of the estate of the owner, who should sign the request for payment on the back of the bond in his representative capacity before an authorized certifying officer, such request to be supported by a court certificate or a certified copy of his letters of appointment, under seal of the court, which should show that the appointment is in full force and effect, and be dated within six months of its presentation;
(2) If no legal representative of the deceased registered owner's estate has been or will be appointed, to the widow or widower of the owner;
(3) If none of the above, to the child or children of the owner and the descendants of deceased children by representation;
(4) If none of the above, to the parents of the owner, or the survivor of them;
(5) In none of the above, to other next-of-kin of the owner, as determined by the laws of the domicile of such owner at the time of his death. In any case coming under the provisions of this paragraph, a duly certified copy of the registered owner's death certificate will ordinarily be required. Proof of death of the beneficiary, if any, will be required where he predeceased the owner. Payment of bonds under paragraph (a)(1) of this section will be made by a Federal Reserve Bank or Branch or by the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Securities Transactions Branch, Washington, DC 20226, or Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Division of Transactions and Rulings, Parkersburg, WV 26101. Payment of bonds under paragraphs
(a)(2) to (5) of this section will be made upon receipt of applications on Form PD 3565, together with the bonds and supporting evidence, by the Bureau of the Fiscal Service.
(b)
Order of precedence where beneficiary survived owner.
If the registered owner of a Retirement Plan Bond dies before it has been presented and surrendered for payment, and the beneficiary shown thereon survived the owner, the bond shall be paid in the following order of precedence:
(1) To the designated beneficiary upon his presentation and surrender of the bond with the request for payment signed and duly certified, such payment to be made to the exclusion of any other person who may have been named beneficiary by the registered owner in a bond purchase plan, or under a pension or profit-sharing plan;
(2) If the designated beneficiary survived the registered owner but failed to present the bond for payment during his own lifetime, payment will be made in the order of precedence specified in paragraphs (a) (1) to (5) of this section to the legal representative, surviving spouse, children, parents, or next-of-kin of such beneficiary, and in the manner provided therein.
In any case coming under the provisions of this paragraph, a duly certified copy of the registered owner's death certificate will ordinarily be required. Proof of death of the beneficiary will also be required where he survived the owner but failed to present the bond for payment during his own lifetime. Payment of a bond to a designated beneficiary will be made by Federal Reserve Bank or Branch or by the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Securities Transactions Branch, Washington, DC 20226, or Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Division of Transactions and Rulings, Parkersburg, WV 26101.
(c)
Ownership of redemption proceeds.
The orders of precedence set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, except in case where redemption is made for the account of a registered owner, are for the Department's convenience in discharging its obligation on a Retirement Plan Bond. The discharge of the obligation in accordance therewith shall be final so far as the Department is concerned, but those provisions do not otherwise purport to determine ownership of the redemption proceeds of a bond.
[28 FR 405, Jan. 16, 1963, as amended at 42 FR 21611, Apr. 28, 1977]
§ 341.10
Reissue.
(a)
Addition or change of beneficiary.
A Retirement Plan Bond will be reissued to add a beneficiary in the case of a single ownership bond, or to eliminate or substitute a beneficiary in the case of a bond registered in beneficiary form upon the owner's request on Form PD 3564. No consent will be required to support any reissue transaction from a beneficiary whose name is to be removed from the registration of a Retirement Plan Bond. If the registered owner dies after the bond has been presented and surrendered for reissue, upon receipt of notice thereof by the agency to which the request for reissue was submitted, such request shall be treated as ineffective, provided the notice of death is received by the Federal Reserve Bank or Branch or the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Securities Transactions Branch, Washington, DC, 20226, or Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Division of Transactions and Rulings, Parkersburg, WV 26101, to which the request was sent, in sufficient time to withhold delivery, by mail or otherwise, of the reissued bond.
(b)
Error in issue—change of name.
Reissue of a Retirement Plan Bond will be made where an error in issue has occurred, as well as in cases where the owner's name has been changed by marriage, divorce, annulment, order of court, or in any other legal manner, upon appropriate request supported by satisfactory evidence. Information as to the procedure to be followed in securing such reissue may be obtained from a Federal Reserve Bank or the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Securities Transactions Branch, Washington, DC 20226, or Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Division of Transactions and Rulings, Parkersburg, WV 26101.

§ 341.11
Use of power of attorney.
No designation of an attorney, agent, or other representative to request payment or reissue on behalf of the owner, beneficiary, or other person entitled under § 341.9, other than as provided in the regulations in this part, will be recognized.
§ 341.12
Lost, stolen, or destroyed bonds.
If a Retirement Plan Bond is lost, stolen, or destroyed, a substitute may be issued upon identification of the bond and proof of its loss, theft, or destruction. A description of the bond by denomination, serial number, issue date and registration should be furnished at the time the report of loss, theft, or destruction is made. Such reports should be sent to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Division of Transactions and Rulings, Parkersburg, WV 26101. Full instructions for obtaining substitute bonds will then be given.

§ 342.0
Offering of notes.
The Secretary of the Treasury offered for sale to the people of the United States, United States Savings Notes (also known as “Freedom Shares”, and generally referred to herein as “savings notes” or “notes”). The notes could be purchased only in combination with Series E savings bonds of the same or greater denomination. This offering was effective from May 1, 1967 until the close of business October 31, 1970 when the sale of savings notes was terminated by the Secretary of the Treasury.
§ 342.1
Definition of words and terms used in this part.
(a)
Payroll savings plan
refers to a voluntary program maintained by an employer whereby its participating officers and employees authorize regular withholdings from their salaries or wages for the purchase of savings bonds.
(b)
Quarter
refers to a 3-month period of a year, as follows: January-February-March, April-May-June, July-August-September, or October-November-December.
§ 342.2
Description of notes.
(a)
General.
Savings notes were issued only in registered form and are nontransferable.
(b)
Term.
A savings note was dated as of the first day of the month in which payment of the purchase price was received by an issuing agent. A note had an original maturity period of 4 years and 6 months and has been granted two 10-year extensions of maturity and an additional extension of 5 years and 6 months with interest; it will reach final maturity 30 years from its issue date. A note cannot be called by the Secretary of the Treasury prior to maturity and was not redeemable during the first year from issue date. Thereafter, a note may be redeemed at the option and request of the owner.
(c)
Denominations and purchase prices.
Savings notes were issued on a discount basis. The denominations and purchase prices were as follows:
Denomination
Purchase price
$25
$20.25
50
40.50
75
60.75
100
81.00
Interest is paid as a part of the redemption value. A note increased in value one year after issue date and increases at the beginning of each half-year period thereafter until final maturity, at which time interest ceases to accrue. Interest on a note which is redeemed before maturity ceases to accrue at the end of the interest period next preceding the redemption date, except that if the note is redeemed on a date on which the redemption value increases, interest ceases to accrue on that date.
(d)
Inscription and issue.
At the time of issue, the authorized issuing agent:
(1) Inscribed on the face of each note the name and address of the owner and the name of the beneficiary, if any, or the names of the coowner;
(2) Entered the issue date in the right-hand portion of the note in the space provided for that purpose; and
(3) Imprinted thereunder, by use of the agent's validation indicia for the issue of Series E savings bonds, the date the note was actually inscribed. A note is valid only if an authorized issuing agent received payment therefor and duly inscribed, dated, imprinted validation indicia on the note and delivered it.
§ 342.3
Extended terms and yields for outstanding notes.
(a)
Extended maturity periods.
The terms
extended maturity period
and
second extended maturity period
refer to the 10-year intervals after the original maturity dates during which owners may retain their savings notes and continue
to earn interest thereon. The term
third extended maturity period
refers to the final interval of 5 years and 6 months during which owners may retain notes and continue to earn interest until final maturity, which occurs 30 years after issue date. No special action is required of owners to take advantage of any extension heretofore or herein granted. The following table describes the previous and final maturities of savings notes:

—(1)
General.
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the guaranteed minimum investment yields for outstanding savings notes are as follows:
(i) For savings notes in extended maturity periods prior to November 1, 1982, the guaranteed minimum investment yield was 8.5 percent per annum, compounded semiannually, effective for the period from the first semiannual interest accrual date on or after May 1, 1981, through their next extended maturity dates on or after November 1, 1982.
(ii) For savings notes that entered extended maturity periods during the period of November 1, 1982, through October 1, 1986, the guaranteed minimum investment yield was 7.5 percent per annum, compounded semiannually, for such periods, including notes that entered into an extended maturity period, as shown below:

(iii) For savings notes that entered into extended maturity periods during the period of November 1, 1986, through February 1, 1993, the guaranteed minimum investment yield is 6 percent per annum, compounded semiannually, for such periods, including notes that entered into an extended maturity period, as shown below:
Issue dates—1st day of—
Extension
Entered—1st day of
May 1967-Aug. 1968
3rd (final)
Nov. 1991-Feb. 1993.
(iv) For savings notes that entered or enter extended maturity periods on or after March 1, 1993, the guaranteed minimum investment yield is 4 percent per annum, compounded semiannually, for such periods, or the investment yield in effect at the beginning of such periods, including notes that enter into an extended maturity period, as shown below:
Issue dates—1st day of—
Extension
Entered—1st day of
Sep. 1968-Oct. 1970
3rd (final)
Mar. 1993-Apr. 1995.
(2)
Eleven-year bonus.
If a savings note was held for the 11-year period beginning with the first semiannual interest accrual date that occurred on or after January 1, 1980, its guaranteed minimum investment yield for such period was increased by one-half of one percent per annum, compounded semiannually.
(c)
Market-based variable investment yield.
In order to be eligible for the market-based variable investment yield, notes had to be held at least five years beginning with the first semiannual interest accrual date occurring on or after November 1, 1982. The market-based variable investment yield shall be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury as follows:
(1) For each 6-month period, starting with the period beginning May 1, 1982, the average market yield on outstanding marketable Treasury securities with a remaining term to maturity of approximately 5 years during such period as determined. Such determination by the Secretary of the Treasury or his or her delegate shall be final and conclusive.
(2) For notes which entered an extended maturity period prior to May 1, 1989, the market-based variable investment yield from the first semiannual interest accrual date occurring on or after November 1, 1982 to each semiannual interest accrual date occuring on or after November 1, 1987, will be 85 percent, rounded to the nearest one-fourth of one percent, of the arithmetic average of the market yield averages, as determined in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section, for the appropriate number of 6-month periods involved, starting with the period beginning May 1, 1982.
(3) For notes which entered an extended maturity period on or after May 1, 1989, the market-based variable investment yield from the first semiannual interest accrual date occurring on or after November 1, 1982 to each semiannual interest accrual date occurring on or after November 1, 1989, will be 85 percent, rounded to the nearest one-hundredth of one percent, of the arithmetic average of the market yield averages, as determined in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section for the appropriate number of 6-month periods involved, starting with the period beginning May 1, 1982.
(d)
Determination of redemption values during any extended maturity period.
The redemption value of a note on a given interest accrual date during any extended maturity period will be the higher of the value produced by using the applicable guaranteed minimum investment yield or the value produced by using the appropriate market-based variable investment yield. The calculation of these values is described below:
(1)
Guaranteed minimum investment yield and resulting values during an extended maturity period.
A note has a guaranteed minimum investment yield for each of its extended maturity periods. The applicable guaranteed minimum investment yield for the current extended maturity period and any subsequent periods are specified in paragraph (b) of this section. In order to determine the value of a note during an extended maturity period, the value of the note either at the end of the next preceding maturity period or when the guaranteed minimum investment yield last increased,
1
whichever occurs later, is determined using the applicable guaranteed minimum investment yield. This value is then used as the base upon which interest accrues during the extended maturity period at the guaranteed minimum investment yield in effect for savings bonds at the beginning of that period. The resulting semiannual values are then compared with the corresponding values determined by using the applicable market-based variable investment yields.
1
The 11-year bonus was the last increase in the guaranteed minimum investment yield (see paragraph (b)(2)). Savings notes which were eligible to receive this bonus received it on the first semiannual interest accrual date which occurred on or after January 1, 1991.
(2)
Market-based variable investment yield and resulting values during and extended maturity period.
The market-based variable investment yield from the first semiannual interest accrual date occurring on or after November 1, 1982 to each semiannual interest accrual date occurring on or after November 1, 1987, is determined as specified in paragraph (c) of this section. The value of a note on its first semiannual interest accrual date occurring on or after November 1, 1982 is used as the base upon which interest accrues during an extended maturity period at the applicable market-based variable investment yield. If redeemed, the note will receive the higher of the two values produced by using the applicable guaranteed minimum investment yield and the applicable market-based variable investment yield.
(e)
Market-based variable investment yields and tables of redemption values.
The market-based variable investment yields for notes redeemed during each 6-month period, beginning on May 1 and November 1 of each year, are made available prior to each of those dates by the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Parkersburg, West Virginia 26106-1328, accompanied by tables of the redemption values of notes for the following 6 months, based on either the applicable market-based variable investment yields or guaranteed minimum investment yields.
[57 FR 14282, Apr. 17, 1992, as amended at 58 FR 60937, 60938, Nov. 18, 1993]
§ 342.4
Purchase—registration.
(a)
Purchase.
Savings notes, in combination with Series E bonds, could be purchased from any authorized issuing agent, a Federal Reserve Bank or Branch, or the Bureau of the Fiscal Service. Payment for the notes could be made in the same manner as payment for Series E savings bonds. Issuing agents delivered the notes at the time of purchase, or by mail at the risk and expense of the United States, but only within the United States, its territories and possessions and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. No mail deliveries elsewhere were made.
(b)
Registration.
The following restrictions applied to original issues of savings notes:
(1) They were limited to registration in the name of a natural person (whether adult or minor), alone, or with another natural person as coowner or beneficiary, and
(2) They had to be identical in registration to the Series E bond purchased in combination therewith.
§ 342.5
Limitations.
(a)
Purchases
—(1)
Payroll savings plans.
Under a payroll savings plan, withholdings for notes could not exceed the ratio of $1.08 for the notes to $1 for the Series E bonds and could not exceed $20.25 per weekly pay period, or $40.50 per biweekly or semi-monthly pay period, or $81 per monthly pay period.
(2)
Others.
In combination purchases of notes and Series E bonds, other than under a payroll savings plan, purchases of notes could not exceed $350 (face amount) a quarter, and in no event could the annual limitation of $1,350 (face amount) be exceeded.
(b)
Holdings.
The face amount of savings notes originally issued to any one person during any one calendar year, was limited to $1,350.
§ 342.6
Taxation.
(a)
General.
For the purpose of determining taxes and tax exemptions, the increment in value represented by the difference between the purchase price and the redemption value received for a savings note is considered interest. The interest is subject to all taxes imposed under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The notes are subject to estate, inheritance, gift, or other excise taxes, whether Federal or State, but are exempt from all other taxation now or hereafter imposed on the principal or interest thereof by any State, or any of the possessions of the United States, or by any local taxing authority.
(b)
Federal income tax on notes.
An owner of savings notes who is a cash-basis taxpayer may use either of two methods for reporting the increase in the redemption value of the notes for Federal income tax purposes, as follows:
(1) Defer reporting of the increase to the year of final maturity, actual redemption, or other disposition, whichever is earlier; or
(2) Elect to report the increase for the year in which it accrues, in which case the election applies to all savings notes then owned and those subsequently acquired, as well as to any other similar obligations purchased on a discount basis.
If the method in paragraph (b)(1) of this section is used, the taxpayer may change to the method in paragraph (b)(2) of this section without obtaining permission from the Internal Revenue Service. However, once the election to use the method in paragraph (b)(2) of this section is made, the taxpayer may not change the method of reporting without permission from the Internal Revenue Service. For further information on Federal income taxes, the Service Center Director or District Director, Internal Revenue Service, of the taxpayer's district should be contacted.
§ 342.7
Payment or redemption.
(a)
General.
A savings note is redeemable any time one year or more after the issue date upon its presentation and surrender, with a duly executed request for payment, to any Federal Reserve Bank or Branch referred to in § 342.9, the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, or to any financial institution designated as a paying agent of savings bonds.
(b)
Judgment creditors.
Payment of a savings note to the purchaser at a sale under a levy, or to the officer authorized to levy upon the property of the
owner under appropriate process to satisfy a money judgment, could not be made until one year after the issue date of the note.
[57 FR 14282, Apr. 17, 1992, as amended at 59 FR 10540, Mar. 4, 1994]
§ 342.8

(e)
Conversion to book-entry.
Although not required, any owner of tax and loss bonds held in registered form after the effective date of this regulation, may submit those bonds to the Division of Special Investments, for conversion to book-entry form.

§ 344.1
What special terms do I need to know to understand this part?
As appropriate, the definitions of terms used in this part are those found in the relevant portions of the Internal Revenue Code and the Income Tax Regulations.
Fiscal Service's Web site
refers to
http://www.slgs.gov.
Business day(s)
means any day other than a Saturday or Sunday that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is open for business.
Cost-free option
means the use of any provision(s) in the SLGS program to exploit movements in interest rates, including, but not limited to, those designed to provide marginal flexibility to issuers in structuring their SLGS investments.
Current Treasury borrowing rate
means the prevailing market rate, as determined by Treasury, for a Treasury security with the specified period to maturity. In the case where SLGS rates are needed for maturities currently not issued by Treasury, at our discretion, suitable proxies for Treasury securities and/or a rate setting methodology, as determined by the Secretary, may be used to derive a current Treasury borrowing rate. At any time that the Secretary establishes such proxies or a rate-setting method or determines that the methodology should be revised, we will make an announcement.
Day(s)
means calendar day(s).
Eligible source of funds
means:
(1) Any amounts that are gross proceeds of an issue of tax-advantaged bonds or are reasonably expected to become gross proceeds of such an issue of tax-advantaged bonds;
(2) Any amounts that formerly were gross proceeds of a tax-advantaged bond issue, but no longer are treated as gross proceeds of such issue as a result of the operation of the universal cap on the maximum amount treated as gross proceeds under 26 CFR 1.148-6(b)(2);
(3) Amounts held or to be held together with gross proceeds of one or more tax-advantaged bond issues in a refunding escrow, defeasance escrow, parity debt service reserve fund, or commingled fund (as defined in 26 CFR 1.148-1(b));

Governmental purpose,
under this part, means the issuer's expected use of the invested funds, including but not limited to, financing a construction project, repaying a prior issue of bonds, or funding a debt service reserve. Such use must be consistent with the purposes of the Income Tax Regulations in 26 CFR part 1 under section 148 of the Internal Revenue Code. Generating gain on the proceeds of a bond issue through the use of a cost-free option in purchasing and redeeming SLGS is not a permitted governmental purpose.

Tax-advantaged bond
means tax-advantaged bond as defined in 26 CFR 1.150-1(b).

(e)
What certifications must the issuer or its agent provide?
—(1)
Agent certification.
When a commercial bank or other agent submits a subscription, or performs any other transaction, on behalf of the issuer, it must certify that it is acting under the issuer's specific authorization. Ordinarily, evidence of such authority is not required.
(2)
Yield certifications
—
(i)
Purchase of SLGS securities.
Upon submitting a subscription, or performing any other transaction for a SLGS security, a subscriber must certify that:
(A)
Marketable securities to SLGS securities.
If the issuer is purchasing a SLGS security with any amount received from the sale or redemption (at the option of the holder) before maturity of any marketable security, the yield on such SLGS security does not exceed the yield at which such marketable security was sold or redeemed; and
(B)
Time deposit securities to SLGS securities.
If the issuer is purchasing a SLGS security with any amount received from the redemption before maturity of a Time Deposit security (other than a zero interest Time Deposit security), the yield on the SLGS security being purchased does not exceed the yield that was used to determine the amount of redemption proceeds for such redeemed Time Deposit security.
(ii)
Early redemption of SLGS securities.
Upon submission of a request for redemption before maturity of a Time Deposit security (other than a zero interest Time Deposit security) subscribed for on or after August 15, 2005, the subscriber must certify that no amount received from the redemption will be invested at a yield that exceeds the yield that is used to determine the amount of redemption proceeds for such redeemed Time Deposit security.
(3)
Duration certification.
For each subscription to purchase a Time Deposit SLGS security, the subscriber must certify that the term of the SLGS security subscribed for is no longer than is reasonably necessary to accomplish the issuer's governmental purpose for its purchase of the SLGS security.
(4)
Eligibility certification.
For each subscription to purchase a SLGS security, the subscriber must certify that if, at any point while SLGS securities are outstanding, the issuer becomes ineligible to purchase SLGS securities or the funds used to purchase SLGS securities are no longer an eligible source of funds, the issuer or agent thereof must, as soon as practicable, notify
Treasury of such ineligibility. Such notification will be deemed to be a request for redemption of those outstanding Demand Deposit securities that are affected by the ineligibility.
(f)
What are some practices involving SLGS securities that are not permitted?
—(1)
Impermissible transactions.
(i) To use the SLGS program to create a cost-free option (while the examples in paragraph (f)(2) of this section may specifically use marketable securities for illustration, creating a cost-free option via any means is prohibited);
(ii) To purchase a SLGS security with any amount received from the sale or redemption (at the option of the holder) before maturity of any marketable security, if the yield on such SLGS security exceeds the yield at which such marketable security is sold or redeemed;
(iii) To invest any amount received from the redemption before maturity of a Time Deposit security (other than a Zero Percent Time Deposit security) at a yield that exceeds the yield that is used to determine the amount of redemption proceeds for such Time Deposit security; or
(iv) To purchase a SLGS security with a maturity that is longer than is reasonably necessary to accomplish the issuer's governmental purpose for its purchase of the SLGS security or to purchase a SLGS security with an intention to redeem such SLGS security earlier than is reasonably necessary to accomplish the issuer's governmental purpose for its purchase of the SLGS security.
(2)
Examples
—(i)
Simultaneous purchase of marketable and SLGS securities.
In order to fund an escrow for an advance refunding, the issuer simultaneously enters into a purchase contract for marketable securities and subscribes for SLGS securities, such that either purchase is sufficient to pay the cash flows on the outstanding bonds to be refunded, but together, the purchases are greatly in excess of the amount necessary to pay the cash flows. The issuer plans that, if interest rates decline during the period between the date of starting a SLGS subscription and the requested date of issuance of SLGS securities, the issuer will enter into an offsetting agreement to sell the marketable securities and use the bond proceeds to purchase SLGS securities to fund the escrow. If, however, interest rates do not decline in that period, the issuer plans to use the bond proceeds to purchase the marketable securities to fund the escrow and cancel the SLGS securities subscription. This practice violates the prohibition on cancellation under § 344.5(c) or § 344.8(c), and no exception or waiver would be granted under this part because the ability to cancel in these circumstances would result in the SLGS program being used to create a cost-free option. In addition, this practice is prohibited under paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section.
(ii)
Sale of marketable securities conditioned on interest rates.
The existing escrow for an advance refunding contains marketable securities which produce a negative arbitrage. In order to reduce or eliminate this negative arbitrage, the issuer subscribes for SLGS securities at a yield higher than the yield on the existing escrow, but less than the permitted yield. At the same time, the issuer agrees to sell the marketable securities in the existing escrow to a third party and use the proceeds to purchase SLGS securities if interest rates decline between the date of subscribing for SLGS securities and the requested date of issuance of SLGS securities. The marketable securities would be sold at a yield which is less than the yield on the SLGS securities purchased. The issuer and the third party further agree that if interest rates increase during this period, the issuer will cancel the SLGS securities subscription. This practice violates the prohibition on cancellation under § 344.5(c) or § 344.8(c), and no exception or waiver would be granted under this part because the ability to cancel in these circumstances would result in the SLGS program being used to create a cost-free option. In addition, this practice is prohibited under paragraphs (f)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section.
(iii)
Sale of marketable securities not conditioned on interest rates.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section, except that in this case, the agreement entered into by the issuer with a third party to sell the
marketable securities in order to obtain funds to purchase SLGS securities is not conditioned upon changes in interest rates on Treasury securities. This practice violates the yield gain prohibition in paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section and is prohibited.
(iv)
Simultaneous subscription for SLGS securities and sale of option to purchase marketable securities.
The issuer holds a portfolio of marketable securities in an account that produces negative arbitrage. To reduce or eliminate this negative arbitrage, the issuer subscribes for SLGS securities for purchase in 45 days. At the same time, the issuer sells an option to purchase the portfolio of marketable securities. If interest rates increase, the holder of the option will not exercise its option and the issuer will cancel the SLGS securities subscription. On the other hand, if interest rates decline, the option holder will exercise the option and the issuer will use the proceeds to purchase SLGS securities. This practice violates the prohibition on cancellation under § 344.5(c) or § 344.8(c), and no exception or waiver would be granted under this part because the ability to cancel in these circumstances would result in the SLGS program being used to create a cost-free option. In addition, this practice is prohibited under paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section.
(v)
Early redemption of time deposit security and subsequent purchase of marketable security.
On February 6, 2006, an issuer purchases a Time Deposit security using an eligible source of funds from a debt service reserve fund. The Time Deposit security has a principal amount of $7 million, an interest rate of 3.63 percent, and a maturity date of February 6, 2009. On March 1, 2007, the issuer submits a request to redeem the Time Deposit security on March 15, 2007. The yield used to determine the amount of redemption proceeds is 3.21 percent. On March 5, 2007, the issuer subscribes for the purchase, on March 15, 2007, of a second Time Deposit security. The issuer pays for the second Time Deposit security on March 15, 2007, with the redemption proceeds of the first Time Deposit security. The second Time Deposit security has an interest rate of 2.77 percent and a maturity date of April 16, 2007. On April 9, 2007, the issuer enters into a contract to purchase, on April 16, 2007, a ten-year, marketable Treasury security using the principal and interest to be received at the maturity of the second Time Deposit security. The marketable Treasury security has a yield of 4.02 percent. This transaction satisfies the yield limitation in paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of this section because:
(A) The yield on the second Time Deposit security does not exceed the yield that is used to determine the amount of redemption proceeds for the first Time Deposit security; and
(B) The second Time Deposit security is not redeemed before maturity and therefore the re-investment of the principal and interest received on the second Time Deposit security is not subject to the yield limitation in paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of this section. This transaction constitutes a permissible use of the SLGS program.
(vi)
Early redemption of time deposit security and simultaneous purchase of marketable security.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (f)(2)(v) of this section, except that the issuer subscribes for the second Time Deposit security on March 1, 2007, and enters into the contract to purchase the marketable Treasury security on March 1, 2007. This transaction, if permitted, would enable the issuer to redeem the first Time Deposit security at a yield that is held constant for 12 hours based on the “current Treasury borrowing rate” for March 1, 2007, and to re-invest the redemption proceeds based on a market yield that may fluctuate during that 12-hour period. The use of the SLGS program in this manner would create a cost-free option. Accordingly, this transaction is impermissible under paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section.
(vii)
Purchase of SLGS security with maturity longer than reasonably necessary.
An issuer may purchase SLGS securities to facilitate compliance with arbitrage yield restrictions for investments of various types of proceeds of tax-advantaged bonds, including investments in refunding escrow funds, bond debt service reserve funds, or project construction funds, respectively. The determination of whether a maturity for a SLGS security is longer than is reasonably necessary depends
on the issuer's governmental purpose for the issuance. Thus, the maturities of SLGS securities invested in a refunding escrow fund are reasonably necessary if they are no longer than those necessary to accomplish the defeasance of the underlying refunded bonds until the applicable redemption date or retirement date of the refunded bonds. Maturities of SLGS securities invested in a project construction fund are reasonably necessary if they are no longer than the reasonably expected construction period for the financed project, and early redemptions of such securities are reasonably necessary if they are reasonably related to construction draws for the financed project. Maturities of SLGS securities invested in a debt service reserve fund are reasonably necessary if they are no longer than the earlier of the permitted term of investments in that reserve fund under the bond documents or the term of the secured bonds. Early redemptions of SLGS securities with reasonably necessary maturities are permissible for the above bona fide business reasons, including changes in market interest rates. By contrast, the purchase of SLGS securities with maturities that are longer than the reasonably necessary maturities described above and associated early redemptions of those SLGS securities to obtain the funds within periods that would correspond to an issuer's bona fide governmental purpose for a SLGS investment constitute impermissible practices under paragraph (f)(1)(iv) of this section. Thus, for example, if an issuer purchases SLGS securities to fund a refunding escrow to be used to defease and call refunded bonds at the first call date in five years, the issuer's purchase of SLGS securities with maturities beyond that five-year period and corresponding early redemptions of those SLGS securities within that five-year period constitute an impermissible use of the SLGS program.
(g)
When and how do I pay for SLGS securities?
You must submit full payment for each subscription to Fiscal Service no later than 4 p.m., Eastern time, on the issue date. Submit payments by the Fedwire funds transfer system with credit directed to the Treasury's General Account. Fiscal Service's American Bankers Association (ABA) Routing Number can be found on Fiscal Service's website under the SLGS frequently asked questions (FAQs).
(h)
What happens if I need to make an untimely change or do not settle on a subscription?
An untimely change to a subscription can only be made in accordance with § 344.2(n) of this part. The penalty imposed for failure to make settlement on a subscription that you submit will be to render you ineligible to subscribe for SLGS securities for six months beginning on the date the subscription is withdrawn, or the proposed issue date, whichever occurs first.
(1)
Upon whom is the penalty imposed?
If you are the issuer, the penalty is imposed on you unless you provide the Taxpayer Identification Number of the conduit borrower that is the actual party failing to make settlement of a subscription. If you provide the Taxpayer Identification Number for the conduit borrower, the six-month penalty will be imposed on the conduit borrower.
(2)
What occurs if Treasury exercises the option to waive the penalty?
If you settle after the proposed issue date and we determine that settlement is acceptable on an exception basis, we will waive, under § 344.2(n), the six-month penalty under paragraph (h) of this section. You shall be charged a late payment assessment. The late payment assessment equals the amount of interest that would have accrued on the SLGS securities from the proposed issue date to the date of settlement plus an administrative fee of $100 per subscription, or such other amount as we may publish in the
Federal Register.
We will not issue SLGS securities until we receive the late payment assessment, which is due on demand.
(i)
What happens at maturity?
Upon the maturity of a security, we will pay the owner the principal amount and interest due. A security scheduled for maturity on a non-business day will be redeemed on the next business day.
(j)
How will I receive payment?
We will make payment by the Automated Clearing House (ACH) method for the owner's account at a financial institution as designated by the owner. We
may use substitute payment procedures, instead of ACH, if we consider it to be necessary. Any such action is final.
(k)
How do I contact Fiscal Service?
Fiscal Service's contact information is posted on Fiscal Service's Web site.
(l)
Will the offering be changed during a debt limit or disaster contingency?
We reserve the right to change or suspend the terms and conditions of the offering (including provisions relating to subscriptions for, and issuance of, SLGS securities; interest payments; early redemptions; and rollovers) at any time the Secretary determines that the issuance of obligations sufficient to conduct the orderly financing operations of the United States cannot be made without exceeding the statutory debt limit, or that a disaster situation exists. We will announce such changes by any means that the Secretary deems appropriate.
(m)
What are some of the rights that Treasury reserves in administering the SLGS program?
We may decide, in our sole discretion, to take any of the following actions. Such actions are final. Specifically, Treasury reserves the right:
(1) To reject any SLGSafe Application for Internet Access;
(2) To reject any electronic message or other message or request, including requests for subscription and redemption, that is inappropriately completed or untimely submitted;
(3) To refuse to issue any SLGS securities in any case or class of cases;
(4) To revoke the issuance of any SLGS securities and to declare the subscriber or the issuer ineligible thereafter to subscribe for securities under the offering if the Secretary deems that such action is in the public interest and any security is issued on the basis of an improper certification or other misrepresentation (other than as the result of an inadvertent error) or there is an impermissible transaction under § 344.2(f); or
(5) To review any transaction for compliance with this part, including requiring a subscriber or the issuer to provide additional information, and to determine an appropriate remedy under the circumstances.
(n)
Are there any situations in which Treasury may waive these regulations?
We reserve the right, at our discretion, to waive or modify any provision of these regulations in any case or class of cases. We may do so if such action is not inconsistent with law and will not subject the United States to substantial expense or liability.
(o)
Are SLGS securities callable by Treasury?
No. Treasury cannot call a SLGS security for redemption before maturity.

# Subpart B—Time Deposit Securities

# Source:
70 FR 37911, June 30, 2005, unless otherwise noted.
§ 344.4
What are Time Deposit securities?
Time Deposit securities are issued as certificates of indebtedness, notes, or bonds.
(a)
What are the maturity periods?
The issuer must fix the maturity periods for Time Deposit securities, which are issued as follows:
(1)
Certificates of indebtedness that do not bear interest.
For certificates of indebtedness that do not bear interest, the issuer can fix a maturity period of not less than fifteen days and not more than one year.
(2)
Certificates of indebtedness that bear interest.
For certificates of indebtedness that bear interest, the issuer can fix a maturity period of not less than thirty days and not more than one year.
(3)
Notes.
For notes, the issuer can fix a maturity period of not less than one year and one day, and not more than ten years.
(4)
Bonds.
For bonds, the issuer can fix a maturity period of not less than ten years and one day, and not more than forty years.
(b)
How do I select the SLGS rate?
For each security, the issuer shall designate an interest rate that does not exceed the maximum interest rate shown in the daily SLGS rate table as defined in § 344.1.
(1)
When is the SLGS rate table released?
We release the SLGS rate table to the public by 10 a.m. Eastern time each business day or as soon as practicable thereafter. If the SLGS rate table is not available by 11 a.m. Eastern time on any given business day, the SLGS rate table for the preceding business day applies.
(2)
How do I lock-in a SLGS rate?
The applicable daily SLGS rate table for a SLGSafe subscription is the one in effect on the business day that you start the subscription process. This table is shown on Fiscal Service's Application server.
(3)
Where can I find the SLGS rate table?
The SLGS rate table can be obtained at Fiscal Service's Web site.
(c)
How are interest computation and payment dates determined?
Interest on a certificate of indebtedness is computed on an annual basis and is paid at maturity with the principal. Interest on a note or bond is paid semi-annually. The issuer specifies the first interest payment date, which must be at least thirty days and less than or equal to one year from the date of issue. The final interest payment date must coincide with the maturity date of the security. Interest for other than a full interest period is computed on the basis of a 365-day or 366-day year (for certificates of indebtedness) and on the basis of the
exact number of days in the half-year (for notes and bonds). See the appendix to subpart E to part 306 of this subchapter for rules regarding computation of interest.
[70 FR 37911, June 30, 2005, as amended at 89 FR 15449, Mar. 4, 2024]
§ 344.5
What other provisions apply to subscriptions for Time Deposit securities?
(a)
When is my subscription due?
The subscriber must set the issue date for the securities in the subscription. The issue date must be a business day. The issue date cannot be more than 60 days after the date we receive the subscription. If the subscription is for $10 million or less, we must receive a subscription at least 5 days before the issue date. If the subscription is for over $10 million, we must receive the subscription at least 7 days before the issue date.
Example 1 to paragraph (a):
If SLGS securities totaling $10 million or less will be issued on May 16th, we must receive the subscription no later than May 11th. If SLGS securities totaling more than $10 million will be issued on May 16th, we must receive the subscription no later than May 9th. In all cases, if SLGS securities will be issued on May 16th, we will not accept the subscription before March 17th.
(b)
How do I start the subscription process?
A subscriber starts the subscription process by entering into SLGSafe the following information:

§ 344.6
How do I redeem a Time Deposit security before maturity?
(a)
What is the minimum time a security must be held?
(1) Zero percent certificates of indebtedness of 16 to 29 days. A zero percent certificate of indebtedness of 16 to 29 days can be redeemed, at the owner's option, no earlier than 15 days after the issue date.
(2)
Certificates of indebtedness of 30 days or more.
A certificate of indebtedness of 30 days or more can be redeemed, at the owner's option, no earlier than 25 days after the issue date.
(3)
Notes or bonds.
A note or bond can be redeemed, at the owner's option, no earlier than 30 days after the issue date. Any request for redemption received within 14 days of the issue date will be rejected.
(b)
Can I request partial redemption of a security balance?
You may request partial redemptions in any whole dollar amount; however, a security balance of less than $1,000 must be redeemed in total.
(c)
Do I have to submit a request for early redemption?
Yes. An official authorized to redeem the securities before maturity must submit an electronic request in SLGSafe. The request must show the Taxpayer Identification Number of the issuer, the security number, and the dollar amount of the securities to be redeemed. Upon submission of a request for redemption before maturity of a security subscribed for on or after August 15, 2005, the request must include a yield certification under § 344.2(e)(2)(ii). Fiscal Service must receive the request no less than 14 days and no more than 60 days before the requested redemption date. You cannot submit a request for early redemption for a security which has not yet been issued and you cannot cancel a request once it has been submitted.
(d)
How do I calculate the amount of redemption proceeds for subscriptions on or after October 28, 1996?
For securities subscribed for on or after October 28, 1996, the amount of the redemption proceeds is calculated as follows:
(1)
Interest.
If a security is redeemed before maturity on a date other than a scheduled interest payment date, Treasury pays interest for the fractional interest period since the last interest payment date.
(2)
Redemption value.
The remaining interest and principal payments are discounted by the current Treasury borrowing rate for the remaining term to maturity of the security redeemed. This may result in a premium or discount to the issuer depending on whether the current Treasury borrowing rate is unchanged, lower, or higher than the stated interest rate of the early-redeemed SLGS securities. There is no market charge for the redemption of zero interest Time Deposit securities subscribed for on or after October 28, 1996. Redemption proceeds in the case of a zero-interest security are a return of the principal invested. The formulas for calculating the redemption value under this paragraph, including examples of the determination of premiums and discounts, are set forth in appendix B of this part.
(e)
How do I calculate the amount of redemption proceeds for subscriptions from September 1, 1989, through October 27, 1996?
For securities subscribed for from September 1, 1989, through October 27, 1996, the amount of the redemption proceeds is calculated as follows:
(1)
Interest.
If a security is redeemed before maturity on a date other than a scheduled interest payment date,
Treasury pays interest for the fractional interest period since the last interest payment date.
(2)
Market charge.
An amount shall be deducted from the redemption proceeds if the current Treasury borrowing rate for the remaining period to original maturity exceeds the rate of interest originally fixed for such security. The amount shall be the present value of the future increased borrowing cost to the Treasury. The annual increased borrowing cost for each interest period is determined by multiplying the principal by the difference between the two rates. For notes and bonds, the increased borrowing cost for each remaining interest period to original maturity is determined by dividing the annual cost by two. Present value is determined by using the current Treasury borrowing rate as the discount factor. When you request a redemption date that is less than thirty days before the original maturity date, we will apply the rate of a one month security as listed on the SLGS rate table issued on the day you make a redemption request. The market charge under this paragraph can be computed by using the formulas in appendix A of this part.
(f)
How do I calculate the amount of redemption proceeds for subscriptions from December 28, 1976, through August 31, 1989?
For securities subscribed for from December 28, 1976, through August 31, 1989, the amount of the redemption proceeds is calculated as follows:
(1)
Interest.
Interest for the entire period the security was outstanding shall be recalculated if the original interest rate of the security is higher than the interest rate that would have been set at the time of the initial subscription had the term of the security been for the shorter period. If this results in an overpayment of interest, we will deduct from the redemption proceeds the aggregate amount of such overpayments, plus interest, compounded semi-annually thereon, from the date of each overpayment to the date of redemption. The rate used in calculating the interest on the overpayment will be one-eighth of one percent above the maximum rate that would have applied to the initial subscription had the term of the security been for the shorter period. If a bond is redeemed before maturity on a date other than a scheduled interest payment date, no interest is paid for the fractional interest period since the last interest payment date.
(2)
Market charge.
An amount shall be deducted from the redemption proceeds in all cases where the current Treasury borrowing rate for the remaining period to original maturity of the security prematurely redeemed exceeds the rate of interest originally fixed for such security. You can compute the market charge under this paragraph by using the formulas in appendix A of this part.

# Subpart C—Demand Deposit Securities

# Source:
70 FR 37911, June 30, 2005, unless otherwise noted.
§ 344.7
What are Demand Deposit securities?
Demand Deposit securities are one-day certificates of indebtedness that are automatically rolled over each day until you request redemption.
(a)
How is the rate for Demand Deposit securities determined?
Each security shall bear a rate of interest based on an adjustment of the average yield for 13-week Treasury bills at the most recent auction. A new annualized effective Demand Deposit rate and daily factor for the Demand Deposit rate are effective on the first business day following the regular auction of 13-week Treasury bills and are shown in the SLGS rate table. Interest is accrued and added to the principal daily. Interest is computed on the balance of the principal, plus interest accrued through the preceding day.
(1)
How is the interest rate calculated?
(i) First, you calculate the annualized effective Demand Deposit rate in decimals, designated “I” in Equation 1, as follows:
ER30JN05.001
(Equation 1)
Where:
I = Annualized effective Demand Deposit rate in decimals. If the rate is determined to be negative, such rate will be reset to zero.
P = Average auction price for the most recently auctioned 13-week Treasury bill, per hundred, to six decimals.
Y = 365 (if the year following issue date of the 13-week Treasury bill does not contain a leap year day) or 366 (if the year following issue date of the 13-week Treasury bill does contain a leap year day).
DTM = The number of days from date of issue to maturity for the most recently auctioned 13-week Treasury bill.
MTR = Estimated marginal tax rate, in decimals, of purchasers of tax-exempt bonds.
TAC = Treasury administrative costs, in decimals.
(ii) Then, you calculate the daily factor for the Demand Deposit rate as follows:
DDR
= (1 +
I
)
1/Y
−1
(Equation 2)
(2)
Where can I find additional information?
Information on the estimated average marginal tax rate and Treasury administrative costs for administering Demand Deposit securities, both to be determined by Treasury from time to time, will be published in the
Federal Register.
(b)
What happens to Demand Deposit securities during a debt limit contingency?
At any time the Secretary determines that issuance of obligations sufficient to conduct the orderly financing operations of the United States cannot be made without exceeding the statutory debt limit, we may invest any unredeemed Demand Deposit securities in special 90-day certificates of indebtedness.
(1) Funds left invested in Demand Deposit securities remain subject to the normal terms and conditions for such securities as set forth in this part.
(2) Funds invested in 90-day certificates of indebtedness earn simple interest equal to the daily factor in effect at the time Demand Deposit security issuance is suspended, multiplied by the number of days outstanding. Ninety-day certificates of indebtedness are subject to the same request for redemption notification requirements as those for Demand Deposit securities and will be redeemed at par value plus accrued interest. If a 90-day certificate of indebtedness reaches maturity during a debt limit contingency, we will automatically roll it into a new 90-day certificate of indebtedness, along with accrued interest, that earns simple interest equal to the daily factor in effect at the time that the new 90-day certificate of indebtedness is issued, multiplied by the number of days outstanding. When regular Treasury borrowing operations resume, the 90-day certificates of indebtedness, along with accrued interest, will be reinvested in Demand Deposit securities.
[70 FR 37911, June 30, 2005, as amended at 77 FR 33635, June 7, 2012; 89 FR 15449, Mar. 4, 2024]
§ 344.8
What other provisions apply to subscriptions for Demand Deposit securities?
(a)
When is my subscription due?
The subscriber must set the issue date in the subscription. You cannot change the issue date to require issuance earlier or later than the issue date originally specified; provided, however, you may change the issue date up to 7 days after the original issue date if you establish to the satisfaction of Treasury that such change is required as a result of circumstances that were unforeseen at the time of the subscription and are beyond the issuer's control (for example, a natural disaster). The issue date must be a business day. The issue date cannot be more than 60 days after the date we receive the subscription. If the subscription is for $10 million or less, we must receive the subscription at least 5 days before the issue date. If the subscription is for more than $10 million, we must receive the subscription at least 7 days before the issue date.
(b)
How do I start the subscription process?
A subscriber starts the subscription process by entering into SLGSafe the following information:
(1) The issue date;
(2) The total principal amount;
(3) The issuer's name and Taxpayer Identification Number;
(4) A description of the tax-advantaged bond issue; and
(5) The certifications required by § 344.2(e)(1), if the subscription is submitted by an agent of the issuer.
(c)
Under what circumstances can I cancel a subscription?
You cannot cancel a subscription unless you establish, to
the satisfaction of Treasury, that the cancellation is required for reasons unrelated to the use of the SLGS program to create a cost-free option.
(d)
How do I change a subscription?
You can change a subscription on or before 3 p.m., Eastern time, on the issue date. You may change the aggregate principal amount specified in the subscription by no more than ten percent, above or below the amount originally specified in the subscription.
(e)
How do I complete the subscription process?
The completed subscription must:
(1) Be dated and submitted electronically by an official authorized to make the purchase;
(2) Describe the bond issue. If the tax-advantaged bond issue referenced in paragraph (b)(4) of this section is, or will be, registered or disclosed in the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board's (MSRB) Electronic Municipal Market Access (EMMA®) system, describe the issue exactly as designated in the “issue description” field of EMMA®, or successor system;
(3) Include the issuer's address;
(4) Include the information on the financial institution that will transmit the funds for the purchase of the securities;
(5) Not be more than ten percent above or below the aggregate principal amount originally specified in the subscription;
(6) Include the information required under paragraph (b) of this section, if not already provided; and
(7) Include the certifications required by § 344.2(e)(1) (agent certification), (e)(2)(i) (yield certification), and (e)(4) (eligibility certification).
[70 FR 37911, June 30, 2005, as amended at 89 FR 15450, Mar. 4, 2024]
§ 344.9
How do I redeem a Demand Deposit security?
(a)
When must I notify Treasury to redeem a security?
Demand Deposit securities can be redeemed at the owner's option, if we receive a request for redemption not less than:
(1) One business day before the requested redemption date for total redemptions by an owner of $10 million or less;
(2) Three business days before the requested redemption date for total redemptions by an owner of more than $10 million but less than $500 million; and
(3) Five business days before the requested redemption date for total redemptions by an owner of $500 million or more.
(b)
Can I request partial redemption of a security balance?
You may request partial redemptions in any amount. If your account balance is less than $1,000, it must be redeemed in total.
(c)
Do I have to submit a request for redemption?
Yes. An official authorized to redeem the securities must submit an electronic request through SLGSafe. The request must show the Taxpayer Identification Number of the issuer, the security number, and the dollar amount of the securities to be redeemed. Fiscal Service must receive the request by 3 p.m., Eastern time on the required day. You cannot cancel the request.

# Appendix A to Part 344—Early Redemption Market Charge Formulas and Examples for Subscriptions From December 28, 1976, Through October 27, 1996
(a) The amount of the market charge for bonds and notes subscribed for before October 28, 1996 can be determined by the following formula:
ER13SE00.002
(b) The application of this formula can be illustrated by the following example:
(1) Assume that a $600,000 note is issued on July 1, 1985, to mature on July 1, 1995. Interest is payable at a rate of 8% on January 1 and July 1.
(2) Assume that the note is redeemed on February 1, 1989, and that the current borrowing rate for Treasury at that time for the remaining period of 6 years and 150 days is 11%.
(3) The increased annual borrowing cost is $18,000. ($600,000)x(11%-8%)
(4) The market charge is computed as follows:
ER13SE00.003
ER13SE00.004
(c) The amount of the market charge for certificates of indebtedness subscribed for before October 28, 1996 can be determined by the following formula:
ER13SE00.005
(d) The application of this formula can be illustrated by the following example:
(1) Assume that a $50,000 certificate of indebtedness is issued on March 1, 1987, to mature on November 1, 1987. Interest is payable at a rate of 10%.
(2) Assume that the certificate of indebtedness is redeemed on July 1, 1987, and that the current borrowing cost to Treasury for the 123-day period from July 1, 1987, to November 1, 1987, is 11.8%.
(3) The increased annual borrowing cost is $900. ($50,000) × (11.8%−10%)
(4) The market charge is computed as follows:
ER13SE00.006
Pt. 344, App. B

# Appendix B to Part 344—Formula for Determining Redemption Value for Securities Subscribed for and Early-Redeemed On or After October 28, 1996
(a) This formula results in a premium or discount to the issuer depending on whether the current Treasury borrowing rate at the time of early redemption is lower or higher
than the stated interest rate of the early-redeemed SLGS security. The total redemption value for bonds and notes can be determined by the following two steps. First, calculate accrued interest payable in accordance with § 344.6(d)(1) using the following formula:
ER13SE00.007
Second, calculate the redemption value per § 344.6(d)(2) using the following formula:
ER13SE00.008
(b) The application of this formula can be illustrated by the following examples:
(1) The first example is for a redemption at a premium.
(i) Assume that an $800,000 2-year note is issued on December 10, 1996, to mature on December 10, 1998. Interest is payable at a rate of 7% on June 10 and December 10.
(ii) Assume that the note is redeemed on October 21, 1997, and that the current borrowing rate for Treasury at that time for the remaining period of 1 year and 50 days is 6.25%.
(iii) The redemption value is computed as follows. First, the accrued interest payable is calculated as:
ER13SE00.009
ER13SE00.010
Then, the redemption value is calculated as:
ER13SE00.011
(2) The second example is for a redemption at a discount and it uses the same assumptions as the first example, except the current Treasury borrowing cost is assumed to be 8.00%:
(i) Assume that an $800,000 2-year note is issued on December 10, 1996, to mature on December 10, 1998. Interest is payable at a rate of 7% on June 10 and December 10.
(ii) Assume that the note is redeemed on October 21, 1997, and that the current borrowing rate for Treasury at that time for the remaining period of 1 year and 50 days is 8.00%.
(iii) The redemption value is computed as follows.
First, the accrued interest payable is calculated as:
ER13SE00.012
Then, the redemption value is calculated as:
ER13SE00.013
ER13SE00.014
(c) The total redemption value for certificates of indebtedness can be determined by the following two steps. First, calculate accrued interest payable in accordance with § 344.6(d)(1) using the following formula:
ER13SE00.015
Second, calculate the redemption value per § 344.6(d)(2) using the following equation:
ER13SE00.016
(d) The application of this formula can be illustrated by the following examples.
(1) First, for a redemption at a premium:
(i) Assume that a $300,000 security is issued on December 5, 1996, to mature in 151 days on May 5, 1997. Interest at a rate of 5% is payable at maturity.
(ii) Assume that the security is redeemed on April 9, 1997, and that the current borrowing rate for Treasury at that time for the remaining period of 26 days is 4.00%.
(iii) The redemption value is computed as follows.
First, the accrued interest payable is calculated as:
ER13SE00.017
Then, the redemption value is calculated as:
ER13se00.018
ER13SE00.019
(2) Secondly, for a redemption at a discount:
(i) Assume that a $300,000 security is issued on December 5, 1996, to mature in 151 days on May 5, 1997. Interest at a rate of 5% is payable at maturity.
(ii) Assume that the security is redeemed on April 9, 1997, and that the current borrowing rate for Treasury at that time for the remaining period of 26 days is 6.25%.
(iii) The redemption value is computed as follows.
First, the accrued interest payable is calculated as:
ER13SE00.020
Then, the redemption value is calculated as:

(a)
At maturity.
A certificate may not be called for redemption by the Secretary of the Treasury prior to maturity except when the amount of the unexpended portion of the loan from the Rural Electrification Administration or Rural Telephone Bank is less than the face amount of the certificate. Unless the Treasury has received from the owner, at least one week prior to the maturity date of a certificate, a written request for payment at maturity, it shall automatically redeem the same at maturity, and reinvest in the owner's name the principal amount in a new certificate having the same description in all material respects as the one redeemed. No such automatic reinvestment shall be made, however, in excess of the amount of the unexpended portion of the loan from the Rural Electrification Administration or the Rural Telephone Bank.
(b)
Prior to maturity.
A certificate may be redeemed prior to maturity at par and accrued interest at the owner's option on one week's notice in writing after one month from the issue date. A certificate issued upon reinvestment, as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, shall not be subject to the one-month holding period. A notice to redeem a certificate prior to its maturity date must be given by the official authorized to redeem it, as shown in the subscription for purchase, to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Division of Securities Operations, Washington, DC 20226, by letter or wire.

§ 346.0
Offering of bonds.
The Secretary of the Treasury, under the authority of the Second Liberty Bond Act, as amended, and pursuant to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, offers for sale, beginning January 1, 1975, bonds of the United States, designated as United States Individual Retirement Bonds. The bonds will be available for investment only to individuals eligible to make deductions on their Federal income tax returns for retirement savings, as provided in section 2002 of the latter Act. This offering of bonds will terminate on April 30, 1982.
[40 FR 4240, Jan. 28, 1975, as amended at 47 FR 18596, Apr. 30, 1982]
§ 346.1
Description of bonds.
(a)
Investment yield (interest).
United States Individual Retirement Bonds, hereinafter sometimes referred to as Individual Retirement Bonds, will be issued at par. The investment yields (interest) are as follows:
(1) Bonds with issue dates of January 1, 1975, through July 1, 1979—6 percent per annum, compounded semiannually (see Table of Redemption Values in the appendix).
(2) Bonds with issue dates of August 1, 1979, through October 1, 1980—6.5. percent per annum, compounded semiannually (see Table A in the appendix).
(3) Bonds with issue dates of November 1, 1980, through September 1, 1981—8 percent per annum, compounded semiannually (see Table B).
(4) Bonds with issue dates of October 1, 1981, or thereafter—9 percent per annum, compounded semiannually (see Table C).
Interest will be paid only upon redemption of the bonds. The accrual of interest will continue until the bonds are redeemed or have reached maturity, whichever is earlier, in accordance with these regulations.
(b)
Term.
The maturity date of any bond issued under this circular shall be the first day of the month in which the registered owner thereof has attained the age of 70
1/2
years, or five years after the date of his death, but no later than the first day of the month in which he would have attained the age of 70
1/2
years, if he had lived. Unless sooner redeemed in accordance with these regulations, the investment yield on a bond will cease on the interest accrual date coinciding with, or, where no such coincidence occurs, the interest accrual date next preceding:
(1) The first day of the seventh (7th) month following the 70th anniversary of the birth of the person in whose name it is registered, or
(2) The first day of the sixtieth (60th) month following the date of death of the person in whose name it is registered, except that such date shall be no later than the date on which he would have attained the age of 70
1/2
years, had he lived.
(c)
Denominations—issue date.
Individual Retirement Bonds will be available only in registered form and in denominations of $50, $75, $100 and $500. At the time of issue, the issuing agent will enter in the upper right-hand portion of the bond the
issue date
(which shall be the first day of the month and year in which payment of the purchase price is received by an authorized issuing agent), and will imprint the agent's validating stamp in the lower right-hand portion. The issue date, as distinguished from the date in the agent's validating stamp, will determine the date from which interest will begin to accrue on the bond. An Individual Retirement Bond shall be valid only if an authorized issuing agent receives payment therefor, duly inscribes, dates, stamps, and delivers it.
[40 FR 4240, Jan. 28, 1975, as amended at 42 FR 37520, July 21, 1977; 46 FR 60577, Dec. 11, 1981]
§ 346.2
Registration.
(a)
General.
The registration of Individual Retirement Bonds is limited to the names of natural persons in their own right, whether adults or minors, in either single ownership or beneficiary form. A bond registered in the beneficiary form will be inscribed substantially as follows (for example): “John A. Doe payable on death to (
or
P.O.D.) Richard B. Roe.” No more than one beneficiary may be designated on a bond.
(b)
Inscription.
The inscription on the face of each bond will show the name, address, and date of birth of the registered owner. The name of the beneficiary, if one is to be designated, will also be shown in the inscription.
[40 FR 4240, Jan. 28, 1975, as amended at 71 FR 46857, Aug. 15, 2006]
§ 346.3
Purchase of bonds.
(a)
Agencies.
Individual Retirement Bonds may be purchased over-the-counter or by mail from Federal Reserve Banks and Branches and the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Securities Transactions Branch, Washington, DC 20226. Customers of commercial banks and trust companies may be able to arrange for the purchase of the bonds through such institutions, but only the Federal Reserve Banks and Branches, and the Department of the Treasury itself, are authorized to issue the securities. The date of receipt of the application and payment by such issuing agencies will govern the dating of the bonds issued.
(b)
Applications.
Applications for the purchase of Individual Retirement Bonds should be made on Form PD
4345, accompanied by a remittance to cover the purchase price. Personal checks will be accepted, subject to collection. Checks, or other forms of exchange, should be drawn to the order of the Federal Reserve Bank or the U.S. Treasury, as the case may be. Checks payable by endorsement are not acceptable.
(c)
Delivery.
Delivery of bonds will be made in person, or by mail at the risk and expense of the United States at the address given by the purchaser, but only within the United States, its territories and possessions, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the Canal Zone. No mail deliveries elsewhere will be made. If the registered owner temporarily resides abroad, the bonds will be delivered to such address in the United States as the purchaser directs.
§ 346.4
Proof of purchase.
At the time an Individual Retirement Bond is issued, the issuing agent will furnish therewith to the purchaser a copy of Form PD 4345 for the purchaser's personal records. The form will show the name and address of the registered owner, his date of birth, social security account number, the number of bonds issued, a description thereof by issue date, serial numbers, denominations, and registration.
§ 346.5
Limitation on holdings.
(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the amount of Individual Retirement Bonds which may be registered in any one individual's name is limited to the amount for which an annual deduction may be taken under either section 219 or 220 of the Internal Revenue Code.
1
These limitations are as follows:
1
Note:
Under the Internal Revenue Code, bonds issued during any given year or within 45 days thereafter may be deducted in that year.
(1) In the case of an individual electing to deduct his or her bond purchase under section 219, the face amount of bonds purchased for tax deduction in any given year may not exceed 15 percent of the individual's earned income for that year or $1,500, whichever is less.
(2) In the case of an individual electing to deduct his or her bond purchases under section 220, the total face amount of bonds purchased for tax deduction in any given year in the name of the individual and in the name of his or her nonworking spouse, may not exceed 15 percent of the working spouse's earned income for that year or $1,750, whichever is less.
2
2
Note:
Code section 220 requires, in effect, that the total IRA contributions in each spouse's name to be deducted in any one year be in equal amounts. While it is permissible for an eligible married couple to utilize several different forms of IRA investments within the same year, this means that couples investing solely in bonds must purchase equal amounts of bonds in each spouse's name.
(b) The above limitations do not apply to rollover bond purchases, as described in sections 402(a)(5), 403(a)(4), or 408(d)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.
(26 U.S.C. 220 and 31 U.S.C. 757)
[42 FR 37520, July 21, 1977]
§ 346.6
Nontransferability.
United States Individual Retirement Bonds are not transferable, and may not be sold, discounted or pledged as collateral for a loan or as security for the performance of an obligation, or for any other purpose.
§ 346.7
Judicial proceedings.
No judicial determination will be recognized which would give effect to an attempted voluntary transfer inter vivos of an Individual Retirement Bond. Otherwise, a claim against a registered owner will be recognized when established by valid judicial proceedings, but in no case will payment be made to the purchaser at a sale under a levy or to the officer authorized to levy upon the property of the owner under appropriate process to satisfy a money judgment unless or until the bond has become eligible for authorized redemption pursuant to these regulations. Neither the Department of the Treasury nor any of its agencies will accept notices of adverse claims or of pending judicial proceedings or undertake to protect the interests of litigants who do not have possession of the bond.
§ 346.8
Payment or redemption during lifetime of owner.
(a)
During first 12 months of issue date.
An Individual Retirement Bond is redeemable at any time during the first twelve (12) months of its issue date. No interest will be paid on any bond so redeemed.
(b)
Prior to age 59
1/2
—(1)
With penalty.
Unless redeemed within twelve months of its issue, or except as provided under paragraphs (b)(2) and (c)(2) of this section, if an Individual Retirement Bond is cashed by its owner before he attains age 59
1/2
, he must include on his Federal income tax return for the year of redemption the value of the bond. In addition, there is an additional income tax equal to 10 percent of the value of the bond imposed by section 409(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.
(2)
In case of disability.
An Individual Retirement Bond will be paid at its then current redemption value upon a registered owner's request (or by a person recognized as entitled to act on his behalf) prior to his attainment of age 59
1/2
years upon submission of a physician's statement or any similar evidence showing that the owner has become disabled to such an extent that he is unable to engage in any substantial, gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or to be of long-continued and indefinite duration. The following are examples of impairments which would ordinarily be considered as preventing substantial, gainful activity:
(i) Loss of use of two limbs.
(ii) Certain progressive diseases which have resulted in the physical loss or atrophy of a limb, such as diabetes, multiple sclerosis, or Buerger's disease.
(iii) Disease of the heart, lungs, or blood vessels which have resulted in major loss of heart or lung reserve as evidenced by X-ray, electrocardiogram, or other objective findings, so that despite medical treatment breathlessness, pain, or fatigue is produced on slight exertion, such as walking several blocks, using public transportation, or doing small chores.
(iv) Cancer which is inoperable and progressive.
(v) Damage to the brain or brain abnormality which has resulted in severe loss of judgment, intellect, orientation, or memory.
(vi) Mental diseases (e.g., psychosis or severe psychoneurosis) requiring continued institutionalization or constant supervision of the individual.
(vii) Loss or diminution of vision to the extent that the effected individual has a central visual acuity of not better than 20/200 in the better eye after best correction, or has a limitation in the fields of vision such that the widest diameter of the visual fields subtends an angle no greater than 20 degrees.
(viii) Permanent and total loss of speech.
(ix) Total deafness uncorrectible by a hearing aid.
In any case coming under the provisions hereof, the evidence referred to above must be submitted to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Division of Transactions and Rulings, Parkersburg, WV 26101, for approval before any bonds may be paid. If, after review of the evidence, the Secretary of the Treasury is satisfied that the owner's disability has been established a letter will be furnished authorizing payment of his Individual Retirement Bonds. This letter must be presented each time any of the owner's bonds are submitted for payment to a Federal Reserve Bank or Branch or to the Department of the Treasury.
(c)
Prior to age 70
1/2
—(1)
General.
An Individual Retirement Bond will be redeemable at its current redemption value upon the request of the registered owner (or a person recognized as entitled to act on his behalf), provided he is 59
1/2
years of age or older. The owner's age will be determined from the date of birth shown on the face of the bond, provided, however, that the Secretary of the Treasury reserves the right in any case or class of cases to require proof, in the form of a duly certified copy of his birth certificate, that the owner has attained the age of 59
1/2
years. If such evidence is unavailable, one of the following documents may be furnished in lieu thereof:
(i) Church records of birth or baptism
(ii) Hospital birth record or certificate
(iii) Physician's or midwife's birth record
(iv) Certification of Bible or other family records
(v) Military, naturalization or immigration records
(vi) Other evidence of probative value.
Similar documentary evidence will also be required to support any claim made by an owner that the date of birth shown on his bond is incorrect.
(2)
For change of investment.
Under section 409(b)(3)(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, if an Individual Retirement Plan Bond is cashed at any time before the end of the taxable year in which the owner attains age 70
1/2
, and the entire redemption proceeds are transferred to an individual retirement account, an individual annuity, an employees' trust, or annuity plan, as described in sections 408(a), 408(b), 401(a) and 403(a), respectively, of the Internal Revenue Code, on or before the 60th day after receipt of such proceeds, they shall be excluded from gross income and the transfer shall be treated as a rollover contribution described in section 408(d)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.
(d)
Requests for payment
—(1)
By owner.
When redemption of any Individual Retirement Bond is desired by the registered owner, it should be presented, with the request for payment on the back of the bond signed and duly certified, to a Federal Reserve Bank or Branch or to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Securities Transactions Branch, Washington, DC 20226. If payment is requested on account of disability, the letter described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section should accompany the bond.
3
3
In any case in which a legal representative has not been appointed for the estate of a registered owner who has attained the age of 59
1/2
years, or who has become disabled, a person seeking payment of a bond on the owner's behalf should furnish a complete statement of the circumstances to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Division of Securities Operations, Washington, DC 20226. Appropriate instructions will then be furnished.
(2)
By person other than owner.
When redemption of any Individual Retirement Bond is desired by the legal guardian, committee, conservator, or similar representative of the owner's estate, it should be presented, with the request signed as described below, to a Federal Reserve Bank or Branch or to the Department of the Treasury. If payment is requested on account of disability, the letter described in paragraph (b) (2) of this section should accompany the bond.
3
The request for payment, in either case, should be signed by the representative in his fiduciary capacity before an authorized certifying officer, and must be supported by a certificate or a certified copy of the letters of appointment from the court making the appointment, under seal, or other proof of qualification if the appointment was not made by a court. Except in the case of corporate fiduciaries, such evidence should state that the appointment is in full force and should be dated not more than one year prior to the presentation of the bond for payment.
(e)
Partial redemption.
An Individual Retirement Bond in a denomination greater than $50 (face value), which is otherwise eligible for redemption, may be redeemed in part, at current redemption value, upon the request of the registered owner (or a person recognized as entitled to act on his behalf), but only in amounts corresponding to authorized denominations. In any case in which partial redemption is desired, before the request for payment is signed, the phrase “to the extent of $__ (face value) and reissue of the remainder” should be appended to the request. Upon partial redemption of the bond, the remainder will be reissued as of the original issue date. No partial redemption of a bond will be made after the death of the owner in whose name it is registered.

[40 FR 4240, Jan. 28, 1975, as amended at 42 FR 37520, July 21, 1977]
§ 346.9
Payment or redemption after death of owner.
(a)
Order of precedence where owner not survived by beneficiary.
If the registered owner of an Individual Retirement Bond dies before it has been presented and surrendered for payment, and there is no beneficiary shown thereon, or if the designated beneficiary predeceased the owner, the bond
shall be paid in the following order of precedence:
(1) To the duly appointed executor or administrator of the estate of the owner, who should sign the request for payment on the back of the bond in his representative capacity before an authorized certifying officer, such request to be supported by a court certificate or a certified copy of his letters of appointment, under seal of the court, which should show that the appointment is in full force and effect, and be dated within six months of its presentation;
(2) If no legal representative of the deceased registered owner's estate has been or will be appointed, to the widow or widower of the owner;
(3) If none of the above, to the child or children of the owner and the descendants of deceased children by representation;
(4) If none of the above, to the parents of the owner, or the survivor of them;
(5) If none of the above, to other next-of-kin of the owner, as determined by the laws of the domicile of such owner at the time of his death.
In any case coming under the provisions of this paragraph, a duly certified copy of the registered owner's death certificate will ordinarily be required. Proof of death of the beneficiary, if any, will be required where he predeceased the owner. Payment of bonds under paragraph (a)(1) of this section will be made by a Federal Reserve Bank or by the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Securities Transactions Branch, Washington, DC 20226. Payment of bonds under paragraphs (a) (2) through (5) of this section will be made upon receipt of applications on Form PD 3565-1, together with the bonds and supporting evidence, by the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Division Transactions and Rulings, Parkersburg, WV 26101.
(b)
Order of precedence where beneficiary survived owner.
If the registered owner of an Individual Retirement Bond dies before it has been presented and surrendered for payment, and the beneficiary shown thereon survived the owner, the bond shall be paid in the following order of precedence:
(1) To the designated beneficiary upon his presentation and surrender of the bond with the request for payment signed and duly certified;
(2) If the designated beneficiary survived the registered owner but failed to present the bond for payment during his own lifetime, payment will be made in the order of precedence specified in paragraphs (a) (1) through (5) of this section to the legal representative, surviving spouse, children, parents, or next-of-kin of such beneficiary, and in the manner provided therein.
In any case coming under the provisions of this subsection, a duly certified copy of the registered owner's death certificate will ordinarily be required. Proof of death of the beneficiary will also be required where he survived the owner but failed to present the bond for payment during his own lifetime. Payment of a bond to a designated beneficiary will be made by a Federal Reserve Bank or by the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Securities Transactions Branch, Washington, DC 20226.
(c)
Ownership of redemption proceeds.
The orders of precedence set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, except in cases where redemption is made for the account of a registered owner, are for the Department's convenience in discharging its obligation on an Individual Retirement Bond. The discharge of the obligation in accordance therewith shall be final so far as the Department is concerned, but those provisions do not otherwise purport to determine ownership of the redemption proceeds of a bond.
(26 U.S.C. 220 and 31 U.S.C. 757)
[40 FR 4240, Jan. 28, 1975, as amended at 42 FR 37520, July 21, 1977]
§ 346.10
Reissue.
(a)
Addition or change of beneficiary.
An Individual Retirement Bond will be reissued to add a beneficiary in the case of a single ownership bond, or to eliminate or substitute a beneficiary in the case of a bond registered in beneficiary form upon the owner's request on Form PD 3564. No consent will be required to support any reissue transaction from a beneficiary whose name is to be removed from the registration
of an Individual Retirement Bond. If the registered owner dies after the bond has been presented and surrendered for reissue, upon receipt of notice thereof by the agency to which the request for reissue was submitted, such request shall be treated as ineffective, provided the notice of death is received by the Federal Reserve Bank or the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Division of Transactions and Rulings, Parkersburg, WV 26101, to which the request was sent, in sufficient time to withhold delivery, by mail or otherwise, of the reissued bond.
(b)
Error in issue—change of name.
Reissue of an Individual Retirement Bond will be made where an error in issue has occurred, as well as in cases where the owner's name has been changed by marriage, divorce, annulment, order of court, or in any other legal manner upon an appropriate request. Information as to the procedure to be followed in securing such reissue may be obtained from a Federal Reserve Bank or the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Division of Transactions and Rulings, Parkersburg, WV 26101.
(26 U.S.C. 220 and 31 U.S.C. 757)
[40 FR 4240, Jan. 28, 1975, as amended at 42 FR 37520, July 21, 1977]
§ 346.11
Use of power of attorney.
No designation of an attorney, agent, or other representative to request payment or reissue on behalf of the owner, beneficiary, or other person entitled under § 346.9, other than as provided in these regulations, will be recognized.
§ 346.12
Lost, stolen, or destroyed bonds.
If an Individual Retirement Bond is lost, stolen, or destroyed, relief will be granted upon identification of the bond and proof of its loss, theft, or destruction. A description of the bond by denomination, serial number, issue date and registration should be furnished at the time the report of loss, theft, or destruction is made. Such reports should be sent to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Division of Transactions and Rulings, Parkersburg, WV 26101. Full instructions for obtaining substitute bonds, or payment, in appropriate cases, will then be given.
(26 U.S.C. 220 and 31 U.S.C. 757)
[40 FR 4240, Jan. 28, 1975, as amended at 42 FR 37520, July 21, 1977]
§ 346.13
Taxation.
The tax treatment provided under section 409 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, shall apply to all Individual Retirement Bonds.

Inquiry concerning the application of any Federal tax to these bonds should be directed to the District Director of Internal Revenue for the district in which the taxpayer resides.

Pt. 346, App.

# Appendix to Part 346—Tables
Table of Redemption Values Providing an Investment Yield of 6 Percent per Annum for Bonds Bearing Issue Dates Beginning January 1, 1975
Note:
This table shows how Individual Retirement Bonds bearing issue dates on or after January 1, 1975, by denomination, increase in redemption value during the successive half-year periods following issue. The redemption values provide an investment yield of approximately 6 pct/annum, compounded semiannually, on the purchase price from issue date to the beginning of each half-year period. No increase in redemption value is shown, however, until 1 year after issue date since no interest may be paid on bonds redeemed before that time. The period to maturity is fixed in accordance with the provisions of § 346.1(b) of this circular.

# Subpart B—Maturities, Redemption Values, and Investment Yields of Series EE Savings Bonds

# General Provisions
§ 351.5
What is the maturity period of a Series EE savings bond?
Series EE savings bonds have a total maturity period of 30 years from the issue date, consisting of an original maturity period and one or two periods of extended maturity, which vary depending on the issue date of the bond. The interest on an outstanding bond ceases to accrue 30 years after its issue date.
§ 351.6
When may I redeem my Series EE savings bond?
(a)
Bonds with issue dates on or before January 1, 2003.
You may redeem your Series EE savings bond at any time beginning six months after its issue date.
(b)
Bonds with issue dates on or after February 1, 2003.
You may redeem your Series EE savings bond at any time beginning twelve months after its issue date.
§ 351.7
May Series EE savings bonds be called for redemption prior to final maturity?
The Secretary of the Treasury may not call Series EE bonds for redemption prior to final maturity.
§ 351.8
When is interest payable on Series EE savings bonds?
Interest on a bond accrues and becomes part of the redemption value. Interest earnings are payable upon redemption.
§ 351.9
When will I receive the redemption value of my Series EE savings bonds?
(a) You will be paid the redemption value of your definitive bond when you surrender the bond for payment as provided in these regulations and in 31 CFR part 353.
(b) You will be paid the redemption value of your book-entry bond when it reaches final maturity, if you have not redeemed the bond previously.
§ 351.10
What do I need to know about market yields, or market bid yields, to understand redemption value calculations in this subpart?
We use market yields, or market bid yields, derived from Treasury bills, notes, and bonds, to create a yield curve based on the most actively traded Treasury securities. This curve relates the yield on a security to its time to maturity. Yields at particular points on the curve are referred to as “constant maturity yields” and are determined by the Treasury from this daily yield curve. Six-month and 5-year Treasury securities rates are derived from these yield curves.
§ 351.11
What do I need to know about the short-term savings bond rate, to understand redemption value calculations in this subpart?
We determine this rate by compiling 6-month Treasury securities rates as of the close of business for each day of the previous three months and calculating the monthly average for each month, rounding each monthly average to the nearest one-hundredth of one percent. We then determine the short-term savings bond rate by taking 85 percent of the three-month average and rounding the result to the nearest one-hundredth of one percent. For bonds entitled to interest accruals at the short-term savings bond rate, that rate applies to the bond's first full semiannual interest accrual period following each announcement of the rate.
§ 351.12
What do I need to know about the long-term savings bond rate, to understand redemption value calculations in this subpart?
We determine this rate by compiling 5-year Treasury securities rates as of the close of business for each day of the previous six months and calculating the monthly average for each month, rounding each monthly average to the nearest one-hundredth of one percent. We then determine the long-term savings bond rate by taking 85 percent of the 6-month average and rounding the result to the nearest one-hundredth of one percent. For bonds entitled to interest accruals at the long-term savings bond rate, that rate applies to the bond's first full semiannual interest accrual period following each announcement of the rate.
§ 351.13
What do I need to know about the savings bond rate to understand redemption value calculations in this subpart?
We determine the savings bond rate by compiling 5-year Treasury securities yields as of the close of business for each day of the previous six months and calculating the monthly average to the nearest one-hundredth of one percent. We then determine the savings bonds rate by taking 90 percent of the 6-month average and rounding the result to the nearest one-hundredth of one percent.
§ 351.14
When are rate announcements that apply to Series EE savings bonds announced?
(a) The Secretary will furnish rates that apply to Series EE savings bonds in announcements published each May 1 and November 1.
(b) If the regularly scheduled date for the announcement is a day when we are not open for business, then the Secretary will make the announcement on the next business day. However, the effective date of the rate remains the first day of the month of the announcement.
(c) The Secretary may announce rates at any other time.
§ 351.15
Is the determination of the Secretary on rates and values final?
The Secretary's determination of rates of return and savings bond redemption values is final and conclusive.
§ 351.16
What do I need to know about the base denomination for redemption value calculations?
We base all calculations of interest on a unit with a principal amount of $12.50. We use this unit value to determine the value of bonds in higher denominations. The effect of rounding off the value of the $12.50 unit increases at higher denominations. This can work to your slight advantage or disadvantage, depending on whether the value is rounded up or down.

# Example.
The following hypothetical example illustrates the calculation: A rate of 3.25% will result in a newly purchased $12.50 unit increasing in value after six months to $12.70, when rounded to the nearest cent. Therefore, a $5,000 definitive Series EE bond (with a principal amount of $2,500) will be worth $2,540 after six months ([$2,500 divided by $12.50] × $12.70 = $2,540.) In contrast, if applied directly to a $2,500 principal amount, the rate would render a value of $2,540.63 after six months, a difference of 63 cents. (This example does not account for any interest penalty that might apply if you redeem a bond less than five years after its issue date.)

§ 351.20
What is the investment yield (interest) during the original maturity period of Series EE savings bonds with issue dates from January 1, 1980, through April 1, 1995?
The redemption value of a bond on a given interest accrual date during original maturity will be the higher of the value produced using the applicable guaranteed minimum investment yield or the value produced using the appropriate market-based variable investment yield.
(a)
Guaranteed minimum investment yield
—(1)
Bonds bearing issue dates prior to November 1, 1982.
You may obtain the guaranteed minimum investment yields on bonds bearing issue dates prior to November 1, 1982, by downloading from our website at
www.savingsbonds.gov,
contacting us by email at
savbonds@bpd.treas.gov,
or by writing us at the following address: Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Parkersburg, West Virginia 26106-1328.

or writing to the following address: Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Parkersburg, West Virginia 26106-1328.
(ii)
On or after 5 years from issue date.
The guaranteed minimum investment
yield of a bond from its issue date to each semiannual interest accrual date occurring on or after 5 years from issue up to original maturity will be as follows, compounded semiannually:

(b)
Market-based variable investment yield.
If a bond is held for a period of 5 years after its first semiannual interest accrual period, occurring on or after November 1, 1982, or its issue date, whichever is later, its market-based variable investment yield for such period, and to each successive semiannual interest accrual date up to its original maturity, will be determined as follows:
(1) For each 6-month period, starting with the period beginning on May 1, 1982, we will determine the average market yield on outstanding marketable Treasury securities with a remaining term to maturity of approximately 5 years during such period.
(2) For bonds bearing an issue date prior to May 1, 1989, the market-based variable investment yield from its first semiannual interest accrual date occurring on or after November 1, 1982, or its issue date, whichever is later, to its first semiannual interest accrual date 5 years thereafter will be 85 percent, rounded to the nearest one-fourth of 1 percent, of the arithmetic average of the market yield averages for the ten 6-month periods starting with the 6-month period that most recently ended before such issue date, whichever is later.
(3) For bonds bearing issue dates of May 1, 1989, through April 1, 1995, the market-based variable investment yield from the issue date to the semiannual interest accrual date 5 years thereafter will be 85 percent, rounded to the nearest one-hundredth of 1 percent, of the arithmetic average of the market yield averages for the ten 6-month periods starting with the 6-month period that most recently ended before such issue date.
(4) In determining the market-based variable investment yield for a bond from its first semiannual interest accrual date occurring on or after November 1, 1982, or its issue date, whichever is later, to each successive semiannual interest accrual date occurring after 5 years from issue up to original maturity, the average market yield for each additional 6-month period will be included in the computation.
§ 351.21
How are redemption values determined during any extended maturity period of Series EE savings bonds with issue dates prior to May 1, 1995?
The redemption value of a bond on a given interest accrual date during an extended maturity period or periods will be the higher of the values produced using either the applicable guaranteed minimum investment yield or the appropriate market-based variable investment yield. The calculation of these yields and the resulting redemption values are described below:
(a)
Guaranteed minimum investment yield and resulting values during an extended maturity period.
A bond may be subject to one guaranteed minimum investment yield during its original maturity period and to another such yield during each of its extended maturity periods.
(1)
Bonds entering an extended maturity period from May 1, 1989, through February 1, 1993.
Bonds that entered an extended maturity period from May 1, 1989, through February 1, 1993, had a guaranteed minimum investment yield of 6 percent per annum, compounded semiannually, during that extended maturity period.
(2)
Bonds entering an extended maturity period on or after March 1, 1993.
Bonds that entered or enter an extended maturity period on or after March 1, 1993, have a guaranteed minimum investment yield of 4 percent per annum, compounded semiannually, during that extended maturity period, or the guaranteed minimum investment yield in effect at the beginning of that period.
(3)
Determination of values for a bond during extended maturity periods.
In order to determine values for a bond during its first extended maturity period, we determine the value of the bond at the end of its original maturity period using the guaranteed minimum investment yield applicable to that period. This value is then used as the
base upon which interest accrues during the first extended maturity period at the applicable guaranteed minimum investment yield for that period. We use the value thus attained at first extended maturity as the base upon which interest accrues during the second extended maturity period at the applicable guaranteed minimum investment yield for that period. We then compare the resulting semiannual values with the corresponding values determined using only the applicable market-based variable investment yields.
(b)
Market-based variable investment yield and resulting values during an extended maturity period.
For a bond beginning an extended maturity period, the market-based variable investment yield from its first semiannual interest accrual date occurring on or after November 1, 1982, or its issue date, whichever is later, to each semiannual interest accrual date occurring on or after November 1, 1989, will be 85 percent, rounded to the nearest one-hundredth of one percent, of the arithmetic average of the market yield averages for the appropriate number of 6-month periods involved, beginning with the period from May 1, 1982, or the 6-month period that most recently ended before the issue date, whichever period occurs later. We use the value of a bond on its first semiannual interest accrual date occurring on or after November 1, 1982, or its issue date, whichever is later, as the base upon which interest accrues during the extended maturity period at the applicable market-based variable investment yield. As described above, the bond will receive the higher of the two values: One value produced using the applicable market-based variable investment yield; and, the other value produced using the guaranteed minimum investment yield.
§ 351.22
When does the redemption value increase for bonds issued prior to May 1, 1995?
(a)
Bonds with issue dates from January 1, 1980, through October 1, 1980.
For bonds with issue dates from January 1, 1980, through October 1, 1980, the redemption value increases on the first day of each month from the third through the thirtieth month after issue, and thereafter on the first day of each successive 6-month period.
(b)
Bonds with issue dates from November 1, 1980, through October 1, 1986.
For bonds with issue dates from November 1, 1980, through October 1, 1986, the redemption value increases on the first day of each month from the third through the eighteenth month after issue, and thereafter on the first day of each successive 6-month period.
(c)
Bonds with issue dates from November 1, 1986, through February 1, 1993.
For bonds with issue dates from November 1, 1986, through February 1, 1993, the redemption values increase on the first day of each month from the third through the thirtieth month after issue, and thereafter on the first day of each successive 6-month period.
(d)
Bonds with issue dates of March 1, 1993, through April 1, 1995.
For bonds with issue dates of March 1, 1993, through April 1, 1995, the redemption values increase on the first day of each month from the third through the sixtieth month after issue, and thereafter either on the first day of each month or on the first day of each successive 6-month period, whichever accrual schedule ensures that the actual yield from issue date to redemption date is in no case less than 4 percent per annum, compounded semiannually.
§ 351.23

# Series EE Savings Bonds With Issue Dates From May 1, 1995, Through April 1, 1997
§ 351.24
What are the maturity periods of bonds with issue dates from May 1, 1995, through April 1, 1997?
(a)
Original maturity.
Bonds reach original maturity at 17 years after issue date.
(b)
Final maturity.
Series EE savings bonds have an extended maturity period of 13 years, and reach final maturity at 30 years after the issue date. Bonds cease to earn interest at final maturity.
§ 351.25
What were the interest rates and redemption values for bonds with issue dates from May 1, 1995, through April 1, 1997, during semiannual rate periods in the first 5 years after issue date?
(a)
Interest rates.
The interest rate for a Series EE bond bearing an issue date of May 1, 1995, through April 1, 1997, for semiannual earning periods during the first 5 years from issue date, was the short-term savings bond rate (see § 351.11 for a description of the short-term savings bond rate.)
(b)
Redemption values.
Redemption values for semiannual accrual dates occurring on or before 5 years from issue date are calculated in accordance with § 351.28.
§ 351.26
What are the interest rates and redemption values for bonds with issue dates from May 1, 1995 through April 1, 1997, during semiannual rate periods that begin 5 years or more after issue date?
(a)
Interest rates.
The interest rate for a Series EE bond bearing an issue date of May 1, 1995, through April 1, 1997, for semiannual earning periods beginning 5 years from issue date through original maturity, is the long-term savings bond rate as defined in § 351.12.
(b)
Redemption values.
We calculate redemption values for semiannual accrual dates occurring after 5 years from issue date, through original maturity, in accordance with § 351.28, except that the redemption value at the date of original maturity shall not be less than the denomination (face amount or face value).
§ 351.27
What are the interest rates and redemption values for bonds with issue dates from May 1, 1995, through April 1, 1997, during an extended maturity period?
During an extended maturity period the bond will be subject to the terms and conditions in effect when it is issued, and will continue to earn interest as described in paragraph § 351.26, unless the terms and conditions applicable to an extended maturity period are expressly amended prior to the beginning of such period.
§ 351.28
How are redemption values calculated for bonds with issue dates from May 1, 1995, through April 1, 1997?
We determine the redemption value of a bond on the accrual date immediately following each semiannual earning period as follows:
(a) We convert the applicable long-term or short-term savings bond rate for the semiannual earning period to decimal form by dividing by 100, and adjust it to a semiannual rate by dividing by 2.
(b) Using redemption values for the base denomination, as defined in § 351.16, we then multiply this rate by the redemption value of the bond at the beginning of the semiannual earning period.
(c) We add the resulting interest amount, rounded to the nearest cent, to the redemption value of the bond at the beginning of the earning period to produce the redemption value at the next semiannual accrual date. The redemption value of a bond remains constant between accrual dates.

# Series EE Savings Bonds With Issue Dates of May 1, 1997, Through April 1, 2005

[68 FR 24796, May 8, 2003, as amended at 70 FR 17288, Apr. 5, 2005]
§ 351.30
What are interest rates and monthly accruals for Series EE bonds with issue dates of May 1, 1997, through April 1, 2005, during the original maturity period?
Savings bond rates (defined in § 351.13) apply to earnings during the first semiannual rate period beginning on or after the effective date of the rate. Interest is credited on the first day of each month and compounded semiannually. Interest accrues beginning with the fourth month from the issue date. For example, a bond issued in January has interest first credited on May 1, which represents one month of interest because of the 3-month interest penalty. The following table shows, for any given month of issue with rates announced each May and November, the months making up the semiannual rate period during which interest is earned at the announced rate (disregarding the penalty for bonds redeemed prior to 5 years after the issue date) and the months in which the bonds increase in value. This rate is an annual rate compounded semiannually.
If issue month is—
And rate announcement/effective date is—

§ 351.31
What is the interest penalty for Series EE bonds with issue dates of May 1, 1997, through April 1, 2005, that are redeemed less than 5 years after the issue date?
If you redeem a Series EE savings bond with an issue date of May 1, 1997, through April 1, 2005, less than five years following the issue date, we reduce the overall earning period from the issue date by three months. For example, if you redeem a bond issued January 1, 1998, 9 months later on October 1, 1998, we will determine the redemption value by applying the redemption value calculation formula described in § 351.32 and the savings bonds rate for that bond at 6 months after the issue date on July 1, 1998. The redemption value of a bond subject to the 3-month interest penalty shall not be reduced below the issue price. This penalty does not apply to bonds redeemed 5 years or more after the issue date.

FV = PV × {[1 + (i ÷ 2)]
(m/6)
}

FV (future value) = redemption value on redemption date rounded to the nearest cent.
PV (present value) = redemption value at the beginning of the semiannual rate period
i = savings bonds rate converted to decimal form by dividing by 100.
m = number of full calendar months outstanding during the semiannual rate period.

The following hypothetical example illustrates how this formula is applied:
Example, assume a hypothetical savings bonds rate of 5.00% effective May 1, 2002, for a bond denominated at $25, with an issue
date of September 1, 1997 and a redemption value of $16.00 as of September 1, 2002. The February 1, 2003, redemption value is calculated as follows: Bonds issue dated in September have semiannual rate periods beginning each March 1 and September 1. The first semiannual rate period to begin on or after the effective date of the May 1, 2002, rate would be the period beginning September 1, 2002. PV, the present value, would be the value of the bond at the beginning of the semiannual rate period, on September 1, 2002. The savings bonds rate of 5.00% converted to a decimal would be 0.05. The number of months, m, is 5 since 5 full calendar months (September through January) have lapsed since the beginning of the rate period. FV is then the result of the formula:
FV = $16.00 × {[1 + (0.05 ÷ 2)]
(5/6)
} = $16.33 after rounding to the nearest cent.
Using the example, the FV of a savings bond with a $50 or larger denomination can be determined by applying the appropriate multiple, for example: $16.33 × ($50.00/$25.00) for a bond with a $50.00 face amount; or $16.33 × ($100.00/$25.00) for a bond with a $100.00 face amount.
(b)
Value of bonds at original maturity
—(1)
Definitive bond.
At original maturity, the redemption value of a definitive bond shall not be less than the face amount/denomination of the bond.
(2)
Book-entry bond.
At original maturity, the redemption value of a book-entry bond shall not be less than double the purchase price of the bond.
§ 351.33
What are interest rates and redemption values for Series EE bonds issued May 1, 1997, through April 1, 2005, during an extended maturity period?

What do I need to know about interest rates, penalties, and redemption values for Series EE bonds with issue dates of May 1, 2005, or thereafter?
(a)
Fixed rate or fixed rate of interest.
Fixed rate or fixed rate of interest means the rate of interest for a Series EE savings bond with an issue date of May 1, 2005, or thereafter, established by the Secretary or the Secretary's designee.
(b)
Determination of fixed rate of interest.
(1) The Secretary or the Secretary's designee determines the fixed rate of interest, which is established for the life of the bond, including the extended maturity period, unless, prior to the beginning of such maturity period, the Secretary either announces a different fixed rate applicable to the extended maturity period, or we expressly amend the terms and conditions applicable to the extended maturity period.
(2) The Secretary's determination of rates of interest and savings bond redemption values is final and conclusive.
(c)
Announcement of fixed rate.
(1) The Secretary or the Secretary's designee will furnish a fixed rate of interest in announcements published each May 1 and November 1. The effective date of the rates will be the first day of the month of the announcement.
(2) If the regularly scheduled date for the announcement is a day when the Treasury is not open for business, then the Secretary will make the announcement on the next business day; however, the effective date of the rates remains the first day of the month of the announcement.
(3) The Secretary may announce rates at any other time.
(4) The most recently announced fixed rate applies only to bonds purchased during the six months following the announcement, or for any other period of time announced by the Secretary.
(d)
Monthly accruals.
Interest accrues on the first day of each month; that is, we add the interest earned on a bond during any given month to its value at the beginning of the following month. The accrued interest compounds semiannually.
(e)
Interest penalty for Series EE bonds redeemed less than 5 years after issue date.
If you redeem a bond with an issue date of May 1, 2005, or thereafter, less than five years following the issue date, we reduce the overall earning period from the issue date by three months. However, the redemption value of a bond subject to the 3-month interest penalty shall not be reduced below the issue price. This penalty does not apply to bonds redeemed 5 years or more after the issue date.
(f)
Redemption value of Series EE bonds at original maturity
—(1)

# Appendix to Part 351—Tax Considerations
1. What are some general tax considerations?
General.
Interest on savings bonds is subject to taxes imposed under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The bonds are exempt from taxation by any State or political subdivision of a State, except for estate or inheritance taxes. (See 31 U.S.C. 3124.)
2. What reporting methods are available for savings bonds?
(a)
Reporting methods.
You may use either of the following two methods for reporting the increase in the redemption value of the bond for Federal income tax purposes:
(1)
Cash basis method.
You may defer reporting the increase to the year of final maturity, redemption, or other disposition, whichever is earliest; or
(2)
Accrual basis method.
You may elect to report the increase each year, in which case the election applies to all Series EE bonds that you then own, those subsequently acquired, and to any other obligations purchased on a discount basis.
(b)
Changing methods.
If you use the cash basis method, you may change to the accrual basis method without obtaining permission from the Internal Revenue Service. However, once you elect to use the accrual basis method in paragraph (a)(2), you may change the method of reporting the increase only by following the specific procedures prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service for making a method change. For further information, you may contact the Internal Revenue Service director for your area, or the Internal Revenue Service, Washington, DC 20224.
3. What transactions have potential tax consequences?
The following types of transactions, among others, may have potential tax consequences:
(a) A reissue that affects the rights of any of the persons named on a definitive Series EE savings bond may have tax consequences for the owner.
(b) The transfer of a book-entry Series EE savings bond from one owner to another may have tax consequences for the transferor.
(c) The redemption of a book-entry Series EE savings bond by the secondary owner may have tax consequences for the primary owner.
(d) The purchase of a Series EE savings bond as a gift may have gift tax consequences.

[Reserved]
§ 352.7
Issues on exchange.
(a)
Securities eligible for exchange.
Prior to the close of business on August 31, 2004, owners were permitted to exchange United States Savings Bonds of Series E and EE and United States Savings Notes (Freedom Shares) at their current redemption values for Series HH bonds. Series E bonds and savings notes remained eligible for exchange for a period of one year from the month in which they reached final maturity. Series EE bonds issued on January 1, 2003, or earlier, became eligible for exchange six months after their issue dates. Series EE bonds issued on February 1, 2003, or thereafter, became eligible for exchange 12 months after their issue dates.
(b)
Basis for issue.
Series HH bonds were issued on exchange by an authorized issuing agent upon receipt of a properly executed exchange application with eligible securities, and additional cash, if any, and any supporting evidence that was required under the regulations. If eligible securities were submitted directly to a Federal Reserve Bank referred to in § 351.13, each was required to bear a properly signed and certified request for payment. Checks in payment of additional cash needed to complete a transaction (see paragraph (d) of this section) were required to be drawn to the order of the Federal Reserve Bank.
(c)
Role of financial institutions.
Department of the Treasury Circular No. 750, current revision (31 CFR part 321), authorizes financial institutions qualified as paying agents for savings bonds and notes to redeem eligible securities presented for exchange and to forward an exchange application and full payment to a Federal Reserve Bank referred to in § 351.13 for the issue of Series HH bonds. The securities redeemed on exchange by such an institution were required to be securities that it is authorized to redeem for cash.
(d)
Computation of issue price.
The total current redemption value of the eligible securities submitted for exchange in any one transaction was required to be $500 or more. If the current redemption value was an even multiple of $500, Series HH bonds were required to be issued in that exact amount. If the current redemption value exceeded, but was not an even multiple of $500, the owner had the option either:
(1) To add the cash necessary to bring the amount of the application to the next higher multiple of $500, or
(2) To receive a payment to reduce the amount of the application to the next lower multiple of $500.
(e)
Registration.
A Series HH bond issued on exchange was permitted to be registered in any form authorized in subpart B of Circular No. 3-80, subject to the following restrictions:
(1) If the securities submitted for exchange were in single ownership form, the owner was required to be named as owner or first-named coowner on the Series HH bonds. A coowner or beneficiary was permitted to be named.
(2) If the securities submitted for exchange were in coownership form, and one coowner was the “principal coowner”, that person was required to be named as owner or first-named coowner on the Series HH bonds. A coowner or beneficiary was also permitted to be named. The “principal coowner” was the coowner who purchased the securities presented for exchange with his or her own funds, or received them as a gift, inheritance or legacy, or as a result of judicial proceedings, and had them reissued in coownership form, provided he or she had received no contribution in money or money's worth for designating the other coowner on the securities.
(3) If the securities presented for exchange were in coownership form, and both coowners shared in their purchase or received them jointly as a gift, inheritance, or legacy or as a result of judicial proceedings, both persons were required to be named as coowners on the Series HH bonds.
(4) If the securities presented for exchange were in beneficiary form, the owner was required to be named on the Series HH bonds as owner or first-named coowner. If the owner was deceased, a surviving beneficiary was required to be named as owner or first-named coowner. In either case, a coowner or beneficiary was permitted to be named.
(f)
Issue date.
Series HH bonds issued on exchange were dated as of the first
day of the month in which the eligible securities presented for exchange were redeemed by an authorized paying agent, as evidenced in the payment stamp on the securities and the exchange application.
(g)
Tax-deferred exchanges.
(1) Continuation of tax deferral. Pursuant to the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, an owner who had not been reporting the interest on his or her Series E or EE bonds and savings notes on an accrual basis for Federal income tax purposes, and who exchanged those securities for Series HH bonds, was permitted to continue to defer reporting the interest on the securities exchanged until the taxable year in which the Series HH bonds received in the exchange reach final maturity, are redeemed, or are otherwise disposed of, whichever is earlier. A reissue transaction that affects any of the persons required to be named on the Series HH bonds, as set forth in paragraph (e) of this section, may result in termination of the tax deferral privilege.
(2)
Tax deferral legend.
Each bond issued in a tax-deferred exchange bore a legend showing how much of its issue price represented interest on the securities exchanged. This interest must be treated as income for Federal income tax purposes and reported in accordance with paragraph (g)(1) of this section.
(3)
Reporting of interest paid to owner.
To the extent that it represented interest earned on the securities presented for exchange, an amount paid to an owner in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section was reportable as income for Federal income tax purposes for the year in which it was paid. Pursuant to 26 CFR 1.6049.4, a paying agent was required to report interest income of $10 or more included in any amount paid in an exchange transaction to the payee and to the Internal Revenue Service on Form 1099-INT or an approved substitute. A separate report was permitted to be made for each exchange transaction in which interest in the amount of $10 or more was paid, or all interest paid in both cash redemption and exchange transactions was permitted to be aggregated and reported annually should the total amount be $10 or more.
(h)
Exchanges without tax deferral.
The rules prescribed for exchanges under paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section also applied to exchanges by owners who report the interest earned on their bonds of Series E and EE and savings notes annually for Federal income tax purposes, or elect to report all such interest that was not previously reported for the taxable year of the exchange. Series HH bonds issued in a nontax-deferred exchange were required to show a “0” in the tax-deferral legend.
[69 FR 40318, July 2, 2004]
§ 352.8
Reinvestment of matured Series H bonds.
(a)
General.
Prior to the close of business on August 31, 2004, the proceeds of matured Series H and HH bonds, whether purchased for cash or issued in exchange for other securities, were permitted to be reinvested in Series HH bonds. Tax deferral granted to interest earned on securities exchanged for Series H bonds was not permitted to be continued when the Series H bonds reached final maturity and their proceeds were reinvested in Series HH bonds. The amount appearing in the legend on a matured Series H bond on which tax deferral was granted must be reported for Federal income tax purposes for the year of such final maturity.
(b)
Rules.
The reinvestment transaction were subject to the rules governing exchanges, as set forth in § 352.7 of this Circular, and the Series HH bonds issued on reinvestment were identical in all respects with those issued in a non-tax-deferred exchange.
[54 FR 40249, Sept. 29, 1989, as amended at 69 FR 40319, July 2, 2004]
§ 352.9
Delivery of bonds.
Authorized issuing agents delivered Series HH bonds by mail at the risk and expense of the United States to the address given by the applicant, if it is within the United States, one of its territories or possessions, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. No mail deliveries elsewhere were made. Bonds acquired by a citizen of the United
States residing abroad were delivered only to such address in the United States as the applicant directs.
[54 FR 40249, Sept. 29, 1989, as amended at 69 FR 40319, July 2, 2004]
§ 352.10
Taxation.
The interest paid on Series HH bonds is subject to all taxes imposed under the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended. The bonds are subject to estate, inheritance, gift, or other excise taxes, whether Federal or State, but are exempt from all taxation now or hereafter imposed on the principal or interest by any State or any local taxing authority.
§ 352.11
Reservation as to issue of bonds.
The Commissioner of the Fiscal Service, as delegate of the Secretary of the Treasury, reserved the right to reject any application for Series HH bonds, in whole or in part, and to refuse to issue or permit to be issued any bonds in any case or class of cases, if the action was deemed to be in the public interest. The Commissioner's action in such respect was final.
[54 FR 40249, Sept. 29, 1989, as amended at 69 FR 40319, July 2, 2004]
§ 352.12
Waiver.
The Commissioner of the Fiscal Service, as delegate of the Secretary of the Treasury, may waive or modify any provision of this Circular in any particular case or class of cases for the convenience of the United States or in order to relieve any person or persons of unnecessary hardship if:
(a) Such action would not be inconsistent with law or equity;
(b) It does not impair any existing rights; and
(c) The Commissioner is satisfied that such action would not subject the United States to any substantial expense or liability.
§ 352.13
Fiscal agents.
(a) Federal Reserve Banks and Branches, referred to below, as fiscal agents of the United States, are authorized to perform such services as may be requested of them by the Secretary of the Treasury, or his or her delegate, in connection with the issue, servicing, and redemption of Series HH bonds.

Incompetents.
Bonds may be registered to name as owner, coowner, or beneficiary an incompetent for whose estate a guardian or similar representative has been appointed, except that a coowner or beneficiary may not be named on bonds purchased with funds belonging to the incompetent.

§ 353.13
Employee plans—Conditions of eligibility.
(a)
Definition of plan.
Employee thrift, savings, vacation and similar plans are contributory plans established by the employer for the exclusive and irrevocable benefit of its employees or their beneficiaries. Each plan must afford employees the means of making regular savings from their wages through payroll deductions and provide for employer contributions to be added to these savings.
(b)
Definition of terms used in this section.
(1) The term
assets
means all the employees' contributions and assets purchased with them and the employer's contributions and assets purchased with them, as well as accretions, such as dividends on stock, the increment in value on bonds and all other income; but, notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the right to demand and receive
all assets
credited to the account of an employee shall not be construed to require the distribution of assets in kind when it would not be possible or practicable to make such a distribution; for example, Series EE bonds may not be reissued in unauthorized denominations.
(2) The word
beneficiary
means: (i) The person or persons, if any, designated by the employee in accordance with the terms of the plan to receive the benefits of the plan upon the employee's death or (ii) the estate of the employee.
(c)
Conditions of eligibility.
An employee plan must conform to the following rules in order to be eligible for the special limitation provided in § 353.10.
(1)
Crediting of assets.
All assets of a plan must be credited to the individual accounts of participating employees and may be distributed only to them or their beneficiaries, except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
(2)
Purchase of bonds.
Bonds may be purchased only with assets credited to the accounts of participating employees and only if the amount taken from any account at any time for that purpose is equal to the purchase price of a bond or bonds in an authorized denomination or denominations, and shares in the bonds are credited to the accounts of the individuals from which the purchase price was derived, in amounts corresponding with their shares. For example, if $50 credited to the account of John Jones is commingled with funds credited to the accounts of other employees to make a total of $5,000 with which a Series EE bond in the denomination of $10,000 (face amount) is purchased in December 1980 and registered in the name and title of the trustee, the plan must provide, in effect, that John Jones' account be credited to show that he is the owner of a Series EE bond in the denomination of $100 (face amount) bearing an issue date of December 1, 1980.
(3)
Irrevocable right of withdrawal.
Each participating employee has an irrevocable right to request and receive from the trustee all assets credited to the employee's account (or their value, if the employee prefers) without regard to any conditions other than the loss or suspension of the privilege of participating further in the plan. A plan may limit or modify such right in any manner required for qualification of the plan under section 401 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended (26 U.S.C. section 401).
(4)
Rights of beneficiary.
Upon the death of an employee, his or her beneficiary shall have the absolute and unconditional right to demand and receive from the trustee all assets credited to the account of the employee or their value, if he or she so prefers.
(5)
Reissue or payment upon distribution.
When settlement is made with an employee or his or her beneficiary with respect to any bond registered in the name and title of the plan trustee in which the employee has a share, the bond must be paid or reissued to the extent of the share. If an employee or the beneficiary is to receive distribution in kind, bonds bearing the same issue dates as those credited to the employee's account will be reissued in the name of the employee or the employee's beneficiary to the extent entitled, in authorized denominations, in any authorized form of registration, upon the request and certification of the trustee.
(d)
Application for special limitation.
A trustee of an employee plan who desires to purchase bonds under the special limitation should submit to the designated Federal Reserve Bank or Branch a copy of:
(1) The plan, (2) any instructions issued under the plan that concern Series EE bonds, and (3) the trust agreement, in order to establish the plan's eligibility.
(e)
Vacation plans.
Savings bonds may be purchased under certain vacation plans. Questions concerning the eligibility of these plans to purchase bonds in excess of the general limitation should be addressed to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Parkersburg, WV 26101.

§ 353.20
General.
(a) The Department of the Treasury will not recognize a judicial determination that gives effect to an attempted
voluntary transfer inter vivos of a bond, or a judicial determination that impairs the rights of survivorship conferred by these regulations upon a coowner or beneficiary. All provisions of this subpart are subject to these restrictions.
(b) The Department of the Treasury will recognize a claim against an owner of a savings bond and conflicting claims of ownership of, or interest in, a bond between coowners or between the registered owner and the beneficiary, if established by valid, judicial proceedings specifically listed in this subpart. Escheat proceedings will not be recognized under this subpart. Section 353.23 specifies evidence required to establish the validity of judicial proceedings. Treasury may require any other evidence to establish the validity of judicial proceedings, such as evidence that the proceeding provided due process, complied with this part, and complied with relevant state law.

Payment will be made only to the extent necessary to satisfy the money judgment. The amount paid is limited to the redemption value 60 days after the termination of the judicial proceedings. Except in a case of a levy by the Internal Revenue Service, payment of a bond registered in coownership form pursuant to a judgment or a levy against only one coowner is limited to the extent of that coowner's interest in the bond. That interest must be established by an agreement between the coowners by judgment, decree, or order of a court in a proceeding to which both coowners are parties. Payment of a bond registered in coownership form pursuant to levy by the Internal Revenue Service will be made if the levy is against either coowner on the bond.
(b)
Trustee in bankruptcy, receiver, or similar court officer.
The Department of the Treasury will pay, at current redemption value, a savings bond to a trustee in bankruptcy, a receiver of an insolvent's estate, a receiver in equity, or a similar court officer under the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section.

§ 353.22
Payment or reissue pursuant to judgment.
(a)
Divorce.
The Department of the Treasury will recognize a divorce decree that ratifies or confirms a property settlement agreement disposing of bonds or that otherwise settles the interests of the parties in a bond. Reissue of a savings bond may be made to eliminate the name of one spouse as owner, coowner, or beneficiary or to substitute the name of one spouse for that of the other spouse as owner, coowner, or beneficiary pursuant to the decree. However, if the bond is registered in the name of one spouse with another person as coowner, there must be submitted either:
(1) A request for reissue by the other person or (2) a certified copy of a judgment, decree, or court order entered in proceedings to which the other person and the spouse named on the bond are parties, determining the extent of the interest of that spouse in the bond. Reissue will be permitted only to the extent of that spouse's interest. The evidence required under § 353.23 must be submitted in every case. When the divorce decree does not set out the terms of the property settlement agreement, a certified copy of the agreement must be submitted. Payment, rather than reissue, will be made if requested.
(b)
Gift causa mortis.
A savings bond belonging solely to one individual will be paid or reissued at the request of the person found by a court to be entitled by reason of a gift causa mortis from the sole owner.
(c)
Date for determining rights.
When payment or reissue under this section is to be made, the rights of the parties will be those existing under the regulations current at the time of the entry of the final judgment, decree, or court order.
§ 353.23
Evidence.
(a)
General.
To establish the validity of judicial proceedings, certified copies of the final judgment, decree, or court order, and of any necessary supplementary proceedings, must be submitted. If the judgment, decree, or court order was rendered more than six months prior to the presentation of the bond, there must also be submitted a certification from the clerk of the court, under court seal, dated within six months of the presentation of the bond, showing that the judgment, decree, or court order is in full force.

Trustee in bankruptcy or receiver of an insolvent's estate.

A request for payment by a receiver in equity or a similar court officer, other than a receiver of an insolvent's estate, must be supported by a copy of an order that authorizes the presentation of the bond for redemption, certified by the clerk of the court, under court seal, as being in full force on a date that is not more than six months prior to the presentation of the bond.

# Subpart F—Relief for Loss, Theft, Destruction, Mutilation, Defacement, or Nonreceipt of Bonds
§ 353.25
General.
Relief, by the issue of a substitute bond or by payment, is authorized for the loss, theft, destruction, mutilation, or defacement of a bond after receipt by the owner or his or her representative. As a condition for granting relief, the Commissioner of the Fiscal Service, as designee of the Secretary of the Treasury, may require a bond of indemnity, in the form, and with the surety, or security, he considers necessary to protect the interests of the United States. In all cases the savings bond must be identified by serial number and the applicant must submit satisfactory evidence of the loss, theft, or destruction, or a satisfactory explanation of the mutilation or defacement.
§ 353.26
Application for relief—After receipt of bond.
(a) If the serial numbers of the lost, stolen, or destroyed bonds are known, the claimant should execute an application for relief on the appropriate form and submit it to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Parkersburg, WV 26101.
(b) If the bond serial number is not known, the claimant must provide sufficient information to enable the Bureau of the Fiscal Service to identify the bond by serial number. See § 353.29(c). The Bureau will furnish the proper application form and instructions.
(c) If applicable, a defaced bond and all available fragments of a mutilated bond should be submitted to the Bureau.
(d) The application must be made by the person or persons (including both coowners, if living) authorized under these regulations to request payment of the bond. In addition:

[44 FR 76441, Dec. 26, 1979, as amended at 79 FR 8859, Feb. 14, 2014]
§ 353.27

If a bond issued on any transaction is not received, the issuing agent must be notified as promptly as possible and given all information about the non-receipt. An appropriate form and instructions will be provided. If the application is approved on or before February 14, 2014, relief will be granted by the issuance of a bond bearing the same issue date as the bond that was not received. If the application is approved after February 14, 2014, relief for Series HH bonds will be granted by the issuance of a bond bearing the same
issue date as the bond that was not received, and relief for Series EE bonds will be granted either by the issuance of a book-entry bond bearing the same issue date as the bond that was not received or by payment. Also, relief is authorized for the issuance of bonds for which the Secretary has not received payment, in order to preserve public confidence in dealing with issuing agents.
[79 FR 8859, Feb. 14, 2014]

Claims filed six years after final maturity.
No claim filed six years or more after the final maturity of a savings bond will be entertained unless the claimant supplies the serial number of the bond.

# Subpart G—Interest
§ 353.30
Series EE bonds.
Definitive Series EE bonds were issued at a discount. The accrued interest is added to the issue price at stated intervals and is payable only at redemption as part of the redemption value. Information regarding interest rates and redemption values is found in Department of the Treasury Circular, Fiscal Service Series No. 1-80 (31 CFR part 351).
[44 FR 76441, Dec. 26, 1979, as amended at 76 FR 66856, Oct. 28, 2011]
§ 353.31
Series HH bonds.
(a)
General.
Series HH bonds are current income bonds issued at par (face amount). Interest on a Series HH bond is paid semiannually beginning six months from the issue date. Interest ceases at final maturity, or, if the bond is redeemed prior to final maturity, as of the end of the interest period last preceding the date of redemption. For example, if a bond on which interest is payable on January 1 and July 1 is redeemed on September 1, interest ceases as of the preceding July 1, and no interest will be paid for the period from July 1 to September 1. However, if the redemption date falls on an interest payment date, interest ceases on that date. Information regarding interest rates is found in Department of the Treasury Circular, Fiscal Service Series No. 2-80, current revision (31 CFR part 352).
(b)
Payment of interest.
Series HH bond interest accounts are maintained by the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Parkersburg, WV. Interest on bonds issued on or after October 1, 1989 will be paid on each interest due date by the Automated Clearing House (ACH) method to the owner or coowner's account at a financial institution, unless the Bureau determines that extraordinary circumstances warrant payment by check or other means. Interest on bonds issued prior to October 1, 1989, is payable by check drawn to the order of the owner or both coowners or, upon request, by the ACH method to the owner or coowner's account at a financial institution. Checks will be mailed to the delivery address provided to the Bureau. Deposit account information for ACH payments shall be provided on the form designated by the Bureau. Series H interest payments made by the ACH method are governed by the regulations at 31 CFR part 370.
(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 1535-0094)
(c)
Delivery of interest.
Notices affecting the delivery of interest payments. To ensure appropriate action, notices affecting the delivery of interest payments on Series HH bonds must be received by the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Parkersburg, WV 26102-1328, at least one month prior to the interest payment date. Each notice must include the owner or coowner's name and the taxpayer identifying number appearing on the account under which records of the bonds are maintained.
(d)
Reissue during interest period.
Physical reissue of a Series HH bond may be made without regard to interest payment dates. The Series HH interest accounts maintained by the Bureau of the Fiscal Service will be closed in the first week of the month preceding each interest payment date, and payments will be made pursuant to the information contained in the accounts as of the date they are closed.
(e)
Endorsement of checks.
Interest checks must be endorsed in accordance with the regulations governing the payment of fiscal agency checks, as contained in 31 CFR part 355.
(f)
Payment of interest by the ACH method
—(1)
Submission of deposit account information.
Payments on all Series HH bonds assigned to the same account maintained by the Bureau must be made to the same deposit account at a financial institution.
(2)
Deposit account held by individuals in their own right.
Where the Series HH bonds are registered in the name of individual(s) as sole owner, or as owner and beneficiary, and the deposit account at the financial institution is held in the name of individual(s) in their own right, the owner's name must appear on the deposit account. Where the bonds are registered in the names of two individuals as coowners and the deposit account is held in the name of individual(s) in their own right, the registration of the bonds and the title of the account must contain at least one name that is common to both. The deposit account to which the interest payments are directed should preferably be established in a form identical to the registration of the bonds to ensure that rights of ownership and survivorship can be more easily identified and preserved. Neither the United States nor any Federal Reserve Bank shall be liable for any loss sustained because the interest of the holder(s) of a deposit account to which payments are made are not the same as the owner(s) of the bonds.
(3)
Deposit account held by organization.
Where the deposit account to which interest payments are to be directed is held in the name of the financial institution itself acting as sole trustee, or as co-trustee, or is the name of a commercially-managed investment fund, the owner or coowner should inquire whether the financial institution is able to receive ACH payments; if not, the owner or coowner should make alternative arrangements.
(4)
Financial institution cannot accept ACH payments.
If after submission of deposit account information, it is determined that ACH payments cannot be accepted by the designated financial institution, pending receipt of new deposit account information, payment will be made by check drawn to the registered owner or both coowners and mailed to the address of record.
(5)
Cancellation of ACH arrangement.
(i) Bonds issued on or after October 1, 1989. As set forth in paragraph (b) of this section and in the Series HH offering contained in Circular No. 2-80, interest on Series HH bonds issued on or after October 1, 1989, will be paid by the ACH method. In the absence of extraordinary circumstances, a request to discontinue payment by the ACH method in favor of payment by check will not be accepted.
(ii) Bonds issued prior to October 1, 1989. An ACH arrangement established for Series HH bonds issued prior to October 1, 1989, shall remain in effect until it is terminated by a request from the owner or coowner submitted to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Parkersburg, WV 26102-1328.
(6)
Rules.
Series HH interest payments made by the ACH method are governed by the regulations at 31 CFR part 370.
(7)
Nonreceipt or loss of interest payment.
The Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Parkersburg, WV 26102 should be notified if:
(i) An interest check is not received or is lost after receipt or
(ii) An ACH payment is not credited to the designated account and the financial institution has no record of receiving it. The notice should include the owner or coowner's name and taxpayer identifying number and the interest payment date.
[54 FR 40254, Sept. 29, 1989, as amended at 59 FR 10541, Mar. 4, 1994; 64 FR 40487, July 26, 1999]

# Subpart H—General Provisions for Payment
§ 353.35
Payment (redemption).
(a)
General.
Payment of a savings bond will be made to the person or persons entitled under the provisions of these regulations, except that checks in payment will not be delivered to addresses in areas with respect to which the Department of the Treasury restricts or regulates the delivery of checks drawn against funds of the United States. See Department of the Treasury Circular No. 655, current revision (31 CFR part 211). Payment will be made without regard to any notice of adverse claims to a bond and no stoppage or caveat against payment of a bond will be entered.
(b) A Series EE bond issued on January 1, 2003, or earlier, will be paid at any time after 6 months from its issue date. A Series EE bond issued on February 1, 2003, or thereafter, will be paid at any time after 12 months from its issue date. Bonds will be paid at the current redemption value shown in Department of the Treasury Circular, Fiscal Service Series No. 1-80 (31 CFR part 351).
(c)
Series HH.
A Series HH bond will be paid at any time after six months from issue date. A Series HH bond issued in an authorized exchange or reinvestment transaction will be paid at face value. A Series HH bond issued for cash will be paid at the current redemption value shown in Department of the Treasury Circular, Fiscal Service Series No. 2-80, Second Revision (31 CFR part 352). If the bond is redeemed at less than face value, the difference represents an adjustment of interest. In any case where Series HH bonds are surrendered to a designated Federal Reserve Bank or Branch or the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Parkersburg, WV 26106-1328, for redemption in the month prior to an interest payment date, redemption will not be deferred but will be made in regular course, unless the presenter specifically requests that the transaction be delayed until that date. A request to defer redemption made more than one month preceding the interest payment date will not be accepted.
[44 FR 76441, Dec. 26, 1979, as amended at 51 FR 23754, July 1, 1986; 59 FR 10541, Mar. 4, 1994; 68 FR 2667, Jan. 17, 2003; 68 FR 7427, Feb. 14, 2003]
§ 353.36
Payment during life of sole owner.
A savings bond registered in single ownership form (
i.e.
, without a coowner or beneficiary) will be paid to the owner during his or her lifetime upon surrender with an appropriate request.
§ 353.37
Payment during lives of both coowners.
A savings bond registered in coownership form will be paid to either coowner upon surrender with an appropriate request, and upon payment (as determined in § 353.43), the other coowner will cease to have any interest in the bond. If both coowners request payment, payment will be made by check drawn in the form, “John A. Jones AND Mary C. Jones”.
§ 353.38
Payment during lifetime of owner of beneficiary bond.
A savings bond registered in beneficiary form will be paid to the registered owner during his or her lifetime upon surrender with an appropriate request. Upon payment (as determined in § 353.43) the beneficiary will cease to have any interest in the bond.
§ 353.39
Surrender for payment.
(a)
Procedure for bonds of Series EE, in the names of individual owners or coowners only.
An individual who is the owner or coowner of a Series EE bond may present the bond to an authorized paying agent for redemption. The presenter must be prepared to establish his or her identity in accordance with Treasury instructions and identification guidelines. The owner or coowner must sign the request for payment on
the bond or, if authorized, on a separate detached request, and add his or her address. If the request for payment has been signed, or signed and certified, before presentation of the bond, the paying agent must be satisfied that the person presenting the bond for payment is the owner or coowner and may require the person to sign the request for payment again. If the bond is in order for payment, the paying agent will make immediate payment at the current redemption value without charge to the presenter. Paying agents are not authorized to process any case involving partial redemption or any case in which supporting evidence is required.
(b)
Procedure for all other cases.
In the case of bonds to which the procedure in paragraph (a) of this section, does not apply, or if otherwise preferred, the owner or coowner, or other person entitled to payment, should appear before an officer authorized to certify requests for payment, establish his or her identity, sign the request for payment, and provide information as to the address to which the check in payment is to be mailed. The bond must be forwarded to a designated Federal Reserve Bank or Branch or the Bureau of the Fiscal Service. Usually, payment will be expedited by submission to a designated Federal Reserve Bank or Branch. In all cases, the cost and risk of presentation of a bond will be borne by the owner. Payment will be made by check drawn to the order of the registered owner or other person entitled and will be mailed to the address requested.
(c)
Date of request.
Requests executed more than six months before the date of receipt of a bond for payment will not be accepted. Neither will a bond be accepted if payment is requested as of a date more than three months in the future.
[44 FR 76441, Dec. 26, 1979, as amended at 59 FR 10541, Mar. 4, 1994]
§ 353.40
Special provisions for payment.
(a)

A request for payment, reinvestment, or exchange executed by an attorney-in-fact will be recognized if it is accompanied by a copy of the power of attorney which meets the following requirements:
(1) The power of attorney must bear the grantor's signature, properly certified or notarized, in accordance with applicable State law;
(2) The power of attorney must grant, by its terms, authority for the attorney-in-fact to sell or redeem the grantor's securities, sell his or her personal property, or, otherwise contain similar authority; and
(3) In the case of a grantor who has become incapacitated, the power of attorney must conform with pertinent provisions of State law concerning its durability. Generally, in such circumstances, the power of attorney should provide that the authority granted will not be affected by the subsequent incompetence or incapacity of the grantor. Medical evidence or other proof of the grantor's condition may be required in any case.
[45 FR 64091, Sept. 26, 1980, as amended at 57 FR 39602, Sept. 1, 1992; 59 FR 10541, Mar. 4, 1994]

The Department of the Treasury will treat the receipt of a bond with an appropriate request for payment by:
(a) A Federal Reserve Bank or Branch,

(a)
Withdrawal by owner or coowner.
An owner or coowner, who has surrendered a bond to a Federal Reserve Bank or Branch or to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service or to an authorized paying agent with an appropriate request for payment, may withdraw the request if notice of intent to withdraw is received by the same agency prior to payment either in cash or through the issuance of the redemption check.
(b)
Withdrawal on behalf of deceased owner or incompetent.
A request for payment may be withdrawn under the same conditions as in paragraph (a) of this section by the executor or administrator of the estate of a deceased owner or by the person or persons who could have been entitled to the bond under subpart L, or by the legal representative of the estate of a person under legal disability, unless surrender of the bond for payment has eliminated the interest of a surviving coowner or beneficiary. See § 353.70 (b) and (c).

(1) If the registration shows the name and capacity of the representative;

(b) Appropriate evidence for paragraphs (a) (2) and (3) of this section includes a certified copy of the letters of appointment or, if the representative is not appointed by a court, other proof of qualification. Except in the case of corporate fiduciaries, the evidence must show that the appointment is in full force and be dated not more than one year prior to the presentation of the bond for payment.

§ 353.61

discharge, the representative of the estate will be entitled to obtain payment of a bond to which the ward was solely entitled.
§ 353.62
Payment to minors.
If the owner of a savings bond is a minor and the form of registration does not indicate that there is a representative of the minor's estate, payment will be made to the minor upon his or her request, provided the minor is of sufficient competency to sign the request for payment and to understand the nature of the transaction. In general, the fact that the request for payment has been signed by a minor and certified will be accepted as sufficient proof of competency and understanding.
§ 353.63
Payment to a parent or other person on behalf of a minor.
If the owner of a savings bond is a minor and the form of registration does not indicate that there is a representative of his or her estate, and if the minor is not of sufficient competency to sign the request for payment and to understand the nature of the transaction, payment will be made to either parent with whom the minor resides or to whom legal custody has been granted.

The request must appear on the back of the bond in one of the following forms:
(a)
Request by parent.

§ 353.64
Payment, reinvestment, or exchange—voluntary guardian of an incapacitated person.
(a) Payment of bonds. When an adult owner of bonds is incapable of requesting payment as a result of incapacity and there is no other person legally qualified to do so, the relative, or other person, responsible for the owner's care and support may submit an application for recognition as voluntary guardian for the purpose of redeeming the owner's bonds, if the total redemption value of all of the owner's bonds does not exceed $20,000. The redemption value of the bonds shall be determined as of the date the bonds are received, accompanied by an appropriate request for payment. If the total redemption value exceeds $20,000, a legal representative must be appointed, as set forth in § 315.60.
(b) Reinvestment of bonds. If the bonds have finally matured and it is desired to redeem them and reinvest the proceeds in other savings bonds, the new bonds must be registered in the name of the incapacitated person, followed by words showing that he or she is under voluntary guardianship; for example, “John Jones 123-45-6789, under voluntary guardianship”. A living coowner or beneficiary named on the matured bonds must be designated on the new bonds, unless such person furnishes a certified statement consenting to omission of his or her name. If an amount insufficient to purchase an additional bond of any authorized denomination of either series remains after the reinvestment, the voluntary guardian may furnish additional funds sufficient to purchase another bond of either series of the lowest available denomination. If additional funds are not furnished, the remaining amount will be paid to the voluntary guardian for the use and benefit of the incapacitated person.
(c) Exchange of bonds. The provisions for reinvestment of the proceeds of matured bonds are equally applicable to any authorized exchange of bonds of one series for those of another.
[57 FR 39602, Sept. 1, 1992]
§ 353.65
Reissue.
A bond on which a minor or other person under legal disability is named as the owner or coowner, or in which he or she has an interest, may be reissued under the following conditions:
(a) A minor for whose estate no representative has been appointed may request reissue if the minor is of sufficient competency to sign his or her name to the request and to understand the nature of the transaction.
(b) A bond on which a minor is named as beneficiary or coowner may be reissued in the name of a custodian for the minor under a statute authorizing gifts to minor upon the request of the adult whose name appears on the bond as owner or coowner.
(c) A minor coowner for whose estate no representative has been appointed, may be named sole owner upon the request of the competent coowner.
(d) Reissue to eliminate the name of a minor or incompetent for whose estate a legal representative has been appointed is permitted only if supported by evidence that a court has authorized the representative of the minor's or incompetent's estate to request the reissue. See § 353.23.
Except to the extent provided in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section, reissue will be restricted to a form of registration which does not adversely affect the existing ownership or interest of a minor who is not of sufficient understanding to make a request, or other person under legal disability. Requests for reissue should be executed by the person authorized to request payment under §§ 353.60 and 353.63, or the person who may request recognization as voluntary guardian under § 353.64.

# Subpart L—Deceased Owner, Coowner or Beneficiary
§ 353.70
General rules governing entitlement.
The following rules govern ownership or entitlement where one or both of the persons named on a bond have died without the bond having been surrendered for payment or reissue:
(a)
Single owner bond.
If the owner of a bond registered in single ownership form has died, the bond becomes the property of that decedent's estate, and payment or reissue will be made as provided in this subpart.
(b)
Coowner bond
—(1)
One coowner deceased.
If one of the coowners named on a bond has died, the surviving coowner will be recognized as the sole and absolute owner, and payment or reissue will be made as though the bond were registered in the name of the survivor alone. Any request for reissue by the surviving coowner must be supported by proof of death of the other coowner.
(2)
Both coowners deceased.
If both coowners named on a bond have died, the bond becomes the property of the estate of the coowner who died last, and payment or reissue will be made as if the bond were registered in the name of the last deceased coowner alone. Proof of death of both coowners will be required to establish the order of death.
(3)
Simultaneously death of both coowners.
If both coowners die under conditions where it cannot be established, either by presumption of law or otherwise, which coowner died first, the bond becomes the property of both equally, and payment or reissue will be made accordingly.
(c)
Beneficiary bond
—(1)
Owner deceased.
If the owner of a bond registered in beneficiary form has died and is survived by the beneficiary, upon proof of death of the owner, the beneficiary will be recognized as the sole and absolute owner of the bond. Payment or reissue will be made as though the bond were registered in the survivor's name alone. A request for payment or reissue by the beneficiary must be supported by proof of death of the owner.
(2)
Beneficiary deceased.
If the beneficiary's death occurs before, or simultaneously with, that of the registered owner, payment or reissue will be made as though the bond were registered in the owner's name alone. Proof of death of the owner and beneficiary is required to establish the order of death.
(d)
Nonresident aliens.
If the person who becomes entitled to a bond because of the death of an owner is an alien who is a resident of an area with respect to which the Department of the
Treasury restricts or regulates the delivery of checks drawn against funds of the United States or its agencies or instrumentalities, delivery of the redemption check will not be made so long as the restriction applies. See Department of the Treasury Circular No. 655, current revision (31 CFR part 211).
§ 353.71
Decedent's estate.
(a)
Estate is being administered.
(1) A legal representative of a deceased owner's estate may request payment of savings bonds to the estate, or may distribute the savings bonds to the persons entitled.
(2) Appropriate proof of appointment for the legal representative of the estate is required. Letters of appointment must be dated not more than one year prior to the date of submission of the letters of appointment.
(b)
Estate has been settled previously.
If the estate has been settled previously through judicial proceedings, the persons entitled may request payment or reissue of savings bonds. A certified copy of the court-approved final accounting for the estate, the court's decree of distribution, or other appropriate evidence is required.
(c)
Special provisions under the law of the jurisdiction of the decedent's domicile.
If there is no formal or regular administration and no representative of the estate is to be appointed, the person appointed to receive or distribute the assets of a decedent's estate without regular administration under applicable local law summary or small estates procedures may request payment or reissue of savings bonds. Appropriate evidence is required.
(d)
When administration is required.
If the total redemption value of the Treasury securities and undelivered payments, if any, held directly on our records that are the property of the decedent's estate is greater than $100,000, administration of the decedent's estate will be required. The redemption value of savings bonds and the principal amount of marketable securities will be used to determine the value of securities, and will be determined as of the date of death. Administration may also be required at the discretion of the Department for any case.
(e)
Voluntary representative for small estates that are not being otherwise administered
—(1)
General.
A voluntary representative is a person qualified according to paragraph (e)(3) of this section, to redeem or distribute a decedent's savings bonds. The voluntary representative procedures are for the convenience of the Department; entitlement to the decedent's savings bonds and held payments, if any, is determined by the law of the jurisdiction in which the decedent was domiciled at the date of death. Voluntary representative procedures may be used only if:
(i) There has been no administration, no administration is contemplated, and no summary or small estate procedures under applicable local law have been used;
(ii) The total redemption value of the Treasury securities and held payments, if any, held directly on our records that are the property of the decedent's estate is $100,000 or less as of the date of death; and
(iii) There is a person eligible to serve as the voluntary representative according to paragraph (e)(3) of this section.
(2)
Authority of voluntary representative.
A voluntary representative may:
(i) Redeem the decedent's savings bonds that are eligible for redemption on behalf of the persons entitled by the law of the jurisdiction in which the decedent was domiciled at the date of death;
(ii) Distribute the decedent's savings bonds to the persons entitled by the law of the jurisdiction in which the decedent was domiciled at the date of death.
(3)
Order of precedence for voluntary representative.
An individual eighteen years of age or older may act as a voluntary representative according to the following order of precedence: A surviving spouse; if there is no surviving spouse, then a child of the decedent; if there are none of the above, then a descendant of a deceased child of the decedent; if there are none of the above, then a parent of the decedent; if there are none of the above, then a brother or sister of the decedent; if there are none of the above, then a descendant of a deceased brother or sister of the decedent; if there are none of the above,
then a next of kin of the decedent, as determined by the law of the jurisdiction in which the decedent was domiciled at the date of death. As used in this order of precedence, child means a natural or adopted child of the decedent.
(4)
Liability.
By serving, the voluntary representative warrants that the distribution of payments or savings bonds is to the persons entitled by the law of the jurisdiction in which the decedent was domiciled at the date of death. The United States is not liable to any person for the improper distribution of payments or securities. Upon payment or transfer of the securities at the request of the voluntary representative, the United States is released to the same extent as if it had paid or delivered to a representative of the estate appointed pursuant to the law of the jurisdiction in which the decedent was domiciled at the date of death. The voluntary representative shall indemnify and hold harmless the United States and all creditors and persons entitled to the estate of the decedent. The amount of the indemnification is limited to an amount no greater than the value received by the voluntary representative.
(f)
Creditor.
If there has been no administration, no administration is contemplated, no summary or small estate procedures under applicable local law have been used, and there is no person eligible to serve as a voluntary representative pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section, then a creditor may make a claim for the amount of the debt, providing the debt has not been barred by applicable local law.

If the fiduciaries named in the registration are still acting, no further evidence will be required. In other cases, evidence to support the request will be required, as specified:

(ii)
Boards, committees, commission, etc.
If a bond is registered in the name of a governing body which is empowered to act as a unit, and which holds title to the property of a religious, educational, charitable or nonprofit organization or a public corporation, the request should be signed in the name of the body by an authorized person. Ordinarily, a signed and certified request will be accepted without further evidence.
(iii)
Corporate fiduciaries.
If a bond is registered in the name of a public or private corporation or a governmental body as fiduciary, the request must be signed by an authorized officer in the name of the organization as fiduciary. Ordinarily, a signed and certified request will be accepted without further evidence.
(2)
Trustee of a common trust fund.
A bond held by a financial institution in a fiduciary capacity may be reissued in the name of the institution as trustee of its common trust fund to the extent that participation in the common trust fund is authorized by law or regulation.

(3)
Successor fiduciary.
If the fiduciary in whose name the bond is registered has been replaced by another fiduciary, satisfactory evidence of successorship must be furnished.

§ 353.77

§ 353.84
Payment to certain institutions.

# Subpart O—Escheat and Unclaimed Property Claims by States
§ 353.88
Payment to a State claiming title to abandoned bonds.
(a)
General.
The Department of the Treasury may, in its discretion, recognize an escheat judgment that purports to vest a State with title to a definitive savings bond that has reached final maturity and is in the State's possession, when the State presents evidence satisfactory to Treasury that the bond has been abandoned by all persons entitled to payment under Treasury regulations. A State claiming title to a definitive savings bond as the heir to a deceased owner must comply with the requirements of subpart L, and not this section. Treasury will not recognize an escheat judgment that purports to vest a State with title to a bond that has not reached its final maturity. Treasury also will not recognize an escheat judgment that purports to vest a State with title to a bond that the State does not possess, or a judgment that purports to grant the State custody of a bond, but not title.
(b)
Due process.
At a minimum, a State requesting payment under this section must demonstrate to Treasury's satisfaction that it made reasonable efforts to provide actual and constructive notice of the escheat proceeding to all persons listed on the face of the bond and all persons who may have an interest in the bond, and that those persons had an opportunity to be heard before the escheat judgment was entered.
(c)
Fulfillment of obligation.
Payment to a State claiming title under this section fulfills the United States' obligations to the same extent as if payment had been made to the registered owner.

§ 354.2
Law governing rights and obligations of Federal Reserve Banks, and Sallie Mae; rights of any Person against Federal Reserve Banks and Sallie Mae.
(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the following are governed solely by the book-entry regulations contained in this part 354, the Securities Documentation (to the extent not inconsistent with these regulations) and Federal Reserve Bank Operating Circulars:
(1) The rights and obligations of Sallie Mae and the Federal Reserve Banks with respect to:
(i) A Book-entry Sallie Mae Security or Security Entitlement; and
(ii) The operation of the Book-entry System as it applies to Sallie Mae Securities; and
(2) The rights of any Person, including a Participant, against Sallie Mae and the Federal Reserve Banks with respect to:
(i) A Book-entry Sallie Mae Security or Security Entitlement; and
(ii) The operation of the Book-entry System as it applies to Sallie Mae Securities.
(b) A security interest in a Security Entitlement that is in favor of a Federal Reserve Bank from a Participant and that is not recorded on the books of a Federal Reserve Bank pursuant to § 354.4(c)(1), is governed by the law (not including the conflict-of-law rules) of
the jurisdiction where the head office of the Federal Reserve Bank maintaining the Participant's Securities Account is located. A security interest in a Security Entitlement that is in favor of a Federal Reserve Bank from a Person that is not a Participant, and that is not recorded on the books of a Federal Reserve Bank pursuant to § 354.14(c)(1), is governed by the law determined in the manner specified in § 354.3.
(c) If the jurisdiction specified in the first sentence of paragraph (b) of this section is a State that has not adopted Revised Article 8 (incorporated by reference, see § 354.1), then the law specified in paragraph (b) shall be the law of that State as though Revised Article 8 had been adopted by that State.
§ 354.3
Law governing other interests.
(a) To the extent not inconsistent with the regulations in this part, the law (not including the conflict-of-law rules) of a Securities Intermediary's jurisdiction governs:
(1) The acquisition of a Security Entitlement from the Securities Intermediary;
(2) The rights and duties of the Securities Intermediary and Entitlement Holder arising out of a Security Entitlement;
(3) Whether the Securities Intermediary owes any duties to an adverse claimant to a Security Entitlement;
(4) Whether an Adverse Claim can be asserted against a Person who acquires a Security Entitlement from the Securities Intermediary or a Person who purchases a Security Entitlement or interest therein from an Entitlement Holder; and
(5) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the perfection, effect of perfection or non-perfection and priority of a security interest in a Security Entitlement.
(b) The following rules determine a “Securities Intermediary's jurisdiction” for purposes of this section:
(1) If an agreement between the Securities Intermediary and its Entitlement Holder specifies that it is governed by the law of a particular jurisdiction, that jurisdiction is the Securities Intermediary's jurisdiction.
(2) If an agreement between the Securities Intermediary and its Entitlement Holder does not specify the governing law as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, but expressly specifies that the securities account is maintained at an office in a particular jurisdiction, that jurisdiction is the Securities Intermediary's jurisdiction.
(3) If an agreement between the Securities Intermediary and its Entitlement Holder does not specify a jurisdiction as provided in paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section, the Securities Intermediary's jurisdiction is the jurisdiction in which is located the office identified in an account statement as the office serving the Entitlement Holder's account.
(4) If an agreement between the Securities Intermediary and its Entitlement Holder does not specify a jurisdiction as provided in paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section and an account statement does not identify an office serving the Entitlement Holder's account as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the Securities Intermediary's jurisdiction is the jurisdiction in which is located the chief executive office of the Securities Intermediary.
(c) Notwithstanding the general rule in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, the law (but not the conflict-of-law rules) of the jurisdiction in which the Person creating a security interest is located governs whether and how the security interest may be perfected automatically or by filing a financing statement.
(d) If the jurisdiction specified in paragraph (b) of this section is a State that has not adopted Revised Article 8 (incorporated by reference, see § 354.1), then the law for the matters specified in paragraph (a) of this section shall be the law of that State as though Revised Article 8 had been adopted by that State. For purposes of the application of the matters specified in paragraph (a) of this section, the Federal Reserve Bank maintaining the Participant's Securities Account is a clearing corporation, and the Participant's interest in a Book-entry Security is a Security Entitlement.
§ 354.4
Creation of Participant's Security Entitlement; security interests.
(a) A Participant's Security Entitlement is created when a Federal Reserve Bank indicates by book-entry that a Book-entry Sallie Mae Security has been credited to a Participant's Securities Account.
(b) A security interest in a Security Entitlement of a Participant in favor of the United States to secure deposits of public money, including without limitation deposits to the Treasury tax and loan accounts, or other security interest in favor of the United States that is required by Federal statute, regulation, or agreement, and that is marked on the books of a Federal Reserve Bank is thereby effected and perfected, and has priority over any other interest in the securities. Where a security interest in favor of the United States in a Security Entitlement of a Participant is marked on the books of a Federal Reserve Bank, such Federal Reserve Bank may rely, and is protected in relying, exclusively on the order of an authorized representative of the United States directing the transfer of the security. For purposes of this paragraph, an “authorized representative of the United States” is the official designated in the applicable regulations or agreement to which a Federal Reserve Bank is a party, governing the security interest.
(c)(1) Sallie Mae and the Federal Reserve Banks have no obligation to agree to act on behalf of any Person or to recognize the interest of any transferee of a security interest or other limited interest in favor of any Person except to the extent of any specific requirement of Federal law or regulation or to the extent set forth in any specific agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank on whose books the interest of the Participant is recorded. To the extent required by such law or regulation or set forth in an agreement with a Federal Reserve Bank, or the Federal Reserve Bank Operating Circular, a security interest in a Security Entitlement that is in favor of a Federal Reserve Bank, Sallie Mae, or a Person may be created and perfected by a Federal Reserve Bank marking its books to record the security interest. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, a security interest in a Security Entitlement marked on the books of a Federal Reserve Bank shall have priority over any other interest in the securities.
(2) In addition to the method provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, a security interest, including a security interest in favor of a Federal Reserve Bank, may be perfected by any method by which a security interest may be perfected under applicable law as described in § 354.2(b) or § 354.3. The perfection, effect of perfection or non-perfection and priority of a security interest are governed by such applicable law. A security interest in favor of a Federal Reserve Bank shall be treated as a security interest in favor of a clearing corporation in all respects under such law, including with respect to the effect of perfection and priority of such security interest. A Federal Reserve Bank Operating Circular shall be treated as a rule adopted by a clearing corporation for such purposes.
§ 354.5
Obligations of Sallie Mae; no adverse claims.
(a) Except in the case of a security interest in favor of the United States or a Federal Reserve Bank or otherwise as provided in § 354.4(c)(1), for the purposes of this part 354, Sallie Mae and the Federal Reserve Banks shall treat the Participant to whose Securities Account an interest in a Book-entry Sallie Mae Security has been credited as the person exclusively entitled to issue a Transfer Message, to receive interest and other payments with respect thereof and otherwise to exercise all the rights and powers with respect to such Security, notwithstanding any information or notice to the contrary. Neither the Federal Reserve Banks nor Sallie Mae is liable to a Person asserting or having an Adverse Claim to a Security Entitlement or to a Book-entry Sallie Mae Security in a Participant's Securities Account, including any such claim arising as a result of the transfer or disposition of a Book-entry Sallie Mae Security by a Federal Reserve Bank pursuant to a Transfer Message that the Federal Reserve Bank reasonably believes to be genuine.
(b) The obligation of Sallie Mae to make payments of interest and principal with respect to Book-entry Sallie Mae Securities is discharged at the time payment in the appropriate amount is made as follows:
(1) Interest on Book-entry Sallie Mae Securities is either credited by a Federal Reserve Bank to a Funds Account maintained at such Bank or otherwise paid as directed by the Participant.
(2) Book-entry Sallie Mae Securities are redeemed at maturity or pursuant to a call for redemption in accordance with their terms by a Federal Reserve Bank withdrawing the securities from the Participant's Securities Account in which they are maintained and by either crediting the amount of the redemption proceeds, including both principal and interest where applicable, to a Funds Account at such Bank or otherwise paying such principal and interest, as directed by the Participant.
§ 354.6
Authority of Federal Reserve Banks.
(a) Each Federal Reserve Bank is hereby authorized as fiscal agent of Sallie Mae to perform functions with respect to the issuance of Book-entry Sallie Mae Securities offered and sold by Sallie Mae, in accordance with the Securities Documentation, and Federal Reserve Bank Operating Circulars; to service and maintain Book-entry Sallie Mae Securities in accounts established for such purposes; to make payments of principal and interest with respect to such Book-entry Sallie Mae Securities as directed by Sallie Mae; to effect transfer of Book-entry Sallie Mae Securities between Participants' Securities Account as directed by the Participants; to effect conversions between Book-entry Sallie Mae securities and Definitive Sallie Mae Securities with respect to those securities as to which conversion rights are available pursuant to the applicable Securities Documentation; and to perform such other duties as fiscal agent as may be requested by Sallie Mae.
(b) Each Federal Reserve Bank may issue Operating Circulars not inconsistent with this part, governing the details of its handling of Book-entry Sallie Mae Securities, Security Entitlements, and the operation of the Book-entry System under this part.
§ 354.7
Withdrawal of eligible Book-entry Sallie Mae Securities for conversion to definitive form.
(a) Eligible Book-entry Sallie Mae Securities may be withdrawn from the Book-entry System by requesting delivery of like Definitive Sallie Mae Securities.
(b) A Federal Reserve Bank shall, upon receipt of appropriate instructions to withdraw Eligible Book-entry Sallie Mae Securities from book-entry in the Book-entry System, convert such securities into Definitive Sallie Mae Securities and deliver them in accordance with such instructions. No such conversion shall affect existing interests in such Sallie Mae Securities.
(c) All requests for withdrawal of Eligible Book-entry Sallie Mae Securities must be made prior to the maturity or date of call of such securities.
(d) Sallie Mae Securities which are to be delivered upon withdrawal may be issued in either registered or bearer form, to the extent permitted by the applicable Securities Documentation.
§ 354.8
Waiver of regulations.
The Secretary reserves the right, in the Secretary's discretion, to waive any provision(s) of the regulations in this part in any case or class of cases for the convenience of Sallie Mae, or in order to relieve any person or entity of unnecessary hardship, if such action is not inconsistent with law, does not adversely affect substantial existing rights, and the Secretary is satisfied that such action will not subject Sallie Mae to any substantial expense or liability.
§ 354.9
Liability of Sallie Mae and Federal Reserve Banks.
Sallie Mae and the Federal Reserve Banks may rely on the information provided in a Transfer Message, and are not required to verify the information. Sallie Mae and the Federal Reserve Banks shall not be liable for any action taken in accordance with the information set out in a Transfer Message or evidence submitted in support thereof.
§ 354.10
Additional provisions.
(a)
Additional requirements.
In any case or any class of cases arising under these regulations, Sallie Mae may require such additional evidence and a bond of indemnity, with or without surety, as may in the judgment of Sallie Mae be necessary for the protection of the interests of Sallie Mae.
(b)
Notice of attachment for Sallie Mae Securities in Book-entry System.
The interest of a debtor in a Security Entitlement may be reached by a creditor only by legal process upon the Securities Intermediary with whom the debtor's securities account is maintained, except where a Security Entitlement is maintained in the name of a secured party, in which case the debtor's interest may be reached by legal process upon the secured party. The regulations in this part do not purport to establish whether a Federal Reserve Bank is required to honor an order or other notice of attachment in any particular case or class of cases.

§ 355.0
What does this part cover?
This part governs checks issued for payments in connection with United States securities. These checks, referred to as “fiscal agency checks,” are issued by a designated Federal Reserve Bank in its capacity as fiscal agent of the United States. The checks are drawn on the payor Federal Reserve Bank in its banking capacity. The drawer of a fiscal agency check is the United States, and the drawee is a Federal Reserve Bank. The rights and liabilities of the United States, the Federal Reserve Banks, and others are set out in this part.
§ 355.1
Do any other regulations cover fiscal agency checks?
The regulations governing checks drawn on the United States and on designated depositories of the United States do not apply to fiscal agency checks, unless a statute specifically provides differently, or unless we state differently in this part. If a definition or matter pertaining to fiscal agency checks is not specifically covered in this part, we will apply the provisions of Regulations J of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, at 12 CFR part 210. To the extent not otherwise covered by this part or by Regulation J, we will apply the provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code (U.C.C.)
§ 355.2
What special terms do I need to know to understand this part?
Depository institution
means:
(1) Any insured bank, mutual savings bank or savings bank as defined in 12 U.S.C. 1813, or any institution eligible to become an insured bank under 12 U.S.C. 1815;
(2) Any insured credit union as defined in 12 U.S.C. 1752, or any credit union eligible to become an insured credit union under 12 U.S.C. 1781;
(3) Any member as defined in 12 U.S.C. 1422; and
(4) Any savings association as defined in 12 U.S.C. that is an insured depository institution as defined in the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, 12 U.S.C. 1811
et seq.,
or is eligible to become an insured depository institution under that Act.
Fiscal agency check
means a check for a payment in connection with a United States security drawn upon a Reserve Bank and issued on our behalf by the Reserve Bank in its capacity as fiscal agent of the United States.
Payee (or “you”)
means the person or persons to whom a fiscal agency check is made payable.
Payor Reserve Bank
means the Reserve Bank on which a fiscal agency check is drawn.
Presenting bank
means a depository institution that sends a fiscal agency check directly to a Reserve Bank for payment or collection.
Reserve Bank or Federal Reserve Bank
means any Federal Reserve Bank or any branch of a Federal Reserve Bank.
Security,
for the purpose of this part, means a direct obligation of the United States, including a Treasury bill, note, bond or savings bond/note.
We (or “us”)
refers to the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary's delegates at the Treasury Department and the Bureau of the Fiscal Service. The term also extends to any fiscal or financial agency acting on behalf of the United States when designated to act by the Secretary or the Secretary's delegates. The term does not refer to a United States Savings Bond issuing or paying agent.
§ 355.3
Where can I cash my fiscal agency check?
Presentment of a fiscal agency check must be made to the payor Reserve Bank. The payor Reserve Bank will only cash a fiscal agency check presented by the payee who can be identified to the satisfaction of the Reserve Bank. Otherwise, a fiscal agency check must be presented through banking channels. A refusal to accept or to pay fiscal agency check presented by a person other than the payee, or by a payee who is not reasonably identified, does not constitute dishonor.
§ 355.4
Is there a time limit on cashing a fiscal agency check?
A payor Reserve Bank may refuse to pay a fiscal agency check presented more than six (6) months after the issue date of the check. If the check is not presented within this time, you must follow the procedures in § 355.10.
§ 355.5
What warranties does a presenting bank make?
(a) A presenting bank makes the warranties required of a sender under subpart A of regulation J (12 CFR part 210). This paragraph does not limit any warranty by a presenter or other party arising under State law.
(b) We are not barred from recovering on a breach of warranty solely because:
(1) Our negligence contributed to a fraudulent endorsement or material alteration;
(2) We did not promptly discover an unauthorized signature or alteration;
(3) An impostor fraudulently caused the issuance of a fiscal agency check in the name of any existing payee; or
(4) Our employee fraudulently caused the issuance of a fiscal agency check in the name of any existing payee.
§ 355.6
What happens if the presenting bank breaches its warranty?
If the presenting bank breaches its warranty, the payor Reserve Bank may either return the check to the presenting bank or send notice of the breach to the presenting bank. If the presenting bank does not make prompt restitution when it receives the returned check or notice of breach, we may begin appropriate collection procedures.
§ 355.7
What notice should I give if I do not receive my check or if a check is lost, stolen, or destroyed?
If a fiscal agency check is not received within a reasonable time after a payment is due, or if a check is lost, stolen, or destroyed, you must provide prompt written notification. Your written notice may be sent to us or to the payor Reserve Bank. You may give notice by telephone, but we will not issue a replacement check until you confirm the notice in writing. The
written notice must provide enough information for us to identify the account and the security to which the payment relates. We will stop payment on the fiscal agency check if we have a reasonable time to act before final payment.
§ 355.8
How can I get a replacement fiscal agency check?
The payor Federal Reserve Bank will issue a replacement fiscal agency check if:
(a) You submit written notice:
(b) The check is unpaid;
(c) We determine that recovery of the original check is unlikely; and
(d) The payee and endorsee, if any, of the check execute the required indemnification agreement.
§ 355.9
What should I do if I recover a check reported as lost, stolen, destroyed, or not received?
If you recover the original check you must notify us in writing. If we have not yet issued a replacement check, we will remove the stop payment order against the original check. If we have already issued a replacement check, you must return the original check to us.
§ 355.10
What happens if I present my check to the payor Reserve Bank more than six months after the issue date of the check?
If the payor Reserve Bank refuses payment on a fiscal agency check solely because it is presented more than six (6) months after the issue date of the check, a replacement check will be issued if you:
(a) Surrender the original check; and
(b) Executive the required indemnification agreement.
§ 355.11
What should I do if the endorsement on my check is forged or unauthorized?
If we verify the existence or a forged or unauthorized endorsement on a paid fiscal agency check, the payor Reserve Bank will issue a replacement check to the person entitled. The payee or endorsee must execute an affidavit that there has been a forged or unauthorized endorsement. We may also require an indemnification agreement.
§ 355.12
What requirements apply if the check is payable to two or more persons?
If the fiscal agency check is payable to two or more persons, the requirements of this part apply to all designated payees.
§ 355.13
Are there any additional requirements related to fiscal agency checks?
We may require an indemnification agreement, with or without surety. You must provide any additional evidence we consider necessary. We will require any information necessary for the protection of the interests of the United States.
§ 355.14
Can these regulations be waived?
We reserve the right, in our discretion, to waive any provision of the regulations in this part in any case or class of cases for the convenience of the United States, or to relieve any person of unnecessary hardship, if the waiver is not inconsistent with law and will not subject the United States to substantial expense or liability.
§ 355.15
Can these regulations be amended?
We may, at any time, supplement, amend, or revise the regulations in this part.

# Subpart A—General Information
§ 356.0
What authority does the Treasury have to sell and issue securities?
Chapter 31 of Title 31 of the United States Code authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to issue United States obligations, and to offer them for sale with the terms and conditions that the Secretary prescribes.
§ 356.1
To which securities does this circular apply?
The provisions in this part, including the appendices, and each individual auction announcement govern the sale and issuance of marketable Treasury securities issued on or after March 1, 1993. This part also governs all securities eligible for the STRIPS (Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal of Securities) Program (See § 356.31.). In addition, these provisions and the auction announcements govern any other types of securities we may issue under this part.
§ 356.2
What definitions do I need to know to understand this part?
13-week bill
means a Treasury bill where the security description is “13-Week Bill” as referenced on the Treasury auction announcement.
Accrued interest
means an amount that bidders must pay to us for interest income as part of the settlement amount. Accrued interest compensates us up front for interest that bidders will be paid but did not earn because it is attributable to a period of time prior to the issue date. (See appendix B, section I, paragraph D of this part for additional explanation and examples.)
Adjusted value
means, for an interest component stripped from an inflation-protected security, an amount derived by:
(1) Multiplying the semiannual interest rate by the par amount, and then
(2) Multiplying this value by: 100 divided by the Reference CPI of the original issue date (or dated date, when the dated date is different from the original issue date). (See appendix B, section V of this part for an example of how to calculate the adjusted value.)
Auction
means a bidding process by which we sell marketable Treasury securities to the public.
Autocharge agreement
means an agreement in a format acceptable to Treasury between a submitter or clearing corporation and a depository institution that authorizes us to:
(1) Deliver awarded securities to the book-entry securities account of a designated depository institution in the commercial book-entry system, and
(2) Charge a funds account of a designated depository institution for the settlement amount of the securities.
Bid
means an offer to purchase a stated par amount of securities, either competitively or noncompetitively, in an auction.
Bid-to-cover ratio
means the total par amount of securities bid for in an auction divided by the total par amount of securities awarded. It excludes bids by, and awards to, the Federal Reserve for its own account.
Bidder,
as further defined in appendix A, means a person or an entity that offers to purchase Treasury securities in an auction either directly or through a depository institution or dealer. We may consider two or more persons or entities to be one bidder based on their relationship or their actions in participating in an auction. We consider a controlled account to be a bidder when an investment adviser bids in the name of the controlled account (See § 356.15.).
Bidder Identification Number
means a number we assign to each institutional submitter and to certain other bidders. We assign such numbers either to identify certain bidders or to grant separate bidder status to different parts of the same corporate or partnership structure.
Book-entry security
means a security that is issued or maintained as an accounting entry or electronic record. (

Discount margin
means the margin over the index that equates the present values of the assumed cash flows on a floating rate note to the sum of the price of and accrued interest on the floating rate note. The assumed cash flows are calculated based upon the index rate applicable to the dated date. Bidders in floating rate note auctions bid on the basis of discount margin. (See appendix B.)
Discount rate

See
appendix B for methods and examples for computing the index rate.)
Index ratio
means, for an inflation-protected security, the Reference CPI of a particular date divided by the Reference CPI of the original issue date. (When the dated date is different from the original issue date, the denominator of the index ratio is the Reference CPI of the dated date rather than that of the original issue date.)
Inflation-adjusted principal
means, for an inflation-protected security, the value of the security derived by multiplying the par amount by the applicable index ratio as described in appendix B, section I, paragraph B.
Interest rate

Real yield
means, for an inflation-protected security, the yield based on the payment stream in constant dollars. In other words, the real yield is the yield in the absence of inflation.
Reference CPI
(Ref CPI) means, for an inflation-protected security, the index number applicable to a given date. (See appendix B, section I, paragraph B.)
Reopening
means the auction of an additional amount of an outstanding security.
Security
means a Treasury bill, note, or bond, each as described in this part. Security also means any other obligation we issue that is subject to this part according to its auction announcement. Security includes an interest or principal component under the STRIPS program, as well as a certificate of indebtedness.
Settlement
means final and complete payment for securities awarded in an auction and delivery of those securities.
Settlement amount
means the total of the par amount of securities awarded, less any discount amount or plus any premium amount, and plus any accrued interest.

Single-price auction
means an auction in which all successful bidders pay the same price regardless of the yields, discount rates, or discount margins they each bid.
Spread
means the fixed amount over the life of a floating rate note that is added to the index rate in order to determine the interest rate of the floating rate note. The spread will be determined in the auction of a new floating rate note and is expressed in tenths of a basis point (
i.e.
, to three decimals). Additionally, the spread will be equal to the high discount margin at the time a new floating rate note is auctioned.
STRIPS
(Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal of Securities) means our program under which eligible securities are authorized to be separated into principal and interest components, and transferred separately. These components are maintained and transferred in the commercial book-entry system.

Weighted-average
means the average of the yields, discount rates, or discount margins at which we award securities to competitive bidders in multiple-price auctions weighted by the par amount of securities allotted at
each yield, discount rate, or discount margin.
Yield
means the annualized rate of return to maturity on a non-indexed security. Yield is expressed as a percentage. For an inflation-protected security, yield means the real yield. Yield is also referred to as “yield to maturity.” (See appendix B.)

§ 356.3
What is the role of the Federal Reserve Banks in this process?
The Treasury Department authorizes Federal Reserve Banks, as fiscal agents of the United States, to perform all activities necessary to carry out the provisions of this part, any auction announcements, and applicable regulations.
§ 356.4
What are the book-entry systems in which auctioned Treasury securities may be issued or maintained?
We issue marketable Treasury securities into the commercial book-entry system and into accounts maintained directly on the records of the Department of the Treasury (“securities held directly with Treasury”).
(a)
The commercial book-entry system.
When depository institutions or dealers submit bids for Treasury securities in an auction, securities awarded as a result of those bids are generally held in the commercial book-entry system. Specifically, we maintain book-entry accounts in the National Book-Entry System ® (“NBES”) for Federal Reserve Banks, depository institutions, and other authorized entities, such as government and international agencies and foreign central banks. In their accounts, depository institutions maintain securities held for their own account and for the accounts of others. The accounts held for others include those of other depository institutions and dealers, which may, in turn, maintain accounts for others.
(b)
Securities held directly with Treasury.
Account holders maintain accounts in a book-entry system directly on the records of the Department of the Treasury. Securities held directly with Treasury are subject to the terms and conditions in this part, the auction announcement, and the regulations governing the system in which the securities are held. (
See
subtitle B, chapter II of this title.)

§ 356.5
What types of securities does the Treasury auction?
We offer securities under this part exclusively in book-entry form and as direct obligations of the United States issued under Chapter 31 of Title 31 of the United States Code. When we issue additional securities with the same CUSIP number as outstanding securities, we consider them to be the same securities as the outstanding securities.

# Subpart B—Bidding, Certifications, and Payment
§ 356.10
What is the purpose of an auction announcement?
By issuing an auction announcement, we provide public notice of the sale of bills, notes, and bonds. The auction announcement lists the specifics of each auction, e.g., offering amount, term and type of security, CUSIP number, and issue and maturity dates. The auction announcement and this part, including the Appendices, specify the terms and conditions of sale. If anything in the auction announcement differs from this part, the auction announcement will control. If you intend to bid, you should read the applicable auction announcement along with this part.
§ 356.11
How are bids submitted in an auction?
(a)
General.
(1) All bids must be submitted using an approved method, which depends on the system into which the awarded securities will be issued. (
See
§ 356.4.) The approved submission methods for these respective systems are explained in this section. A bidder must provide its assigned bidder identification numbers if it has been assigned one. We have the option of accepting or rejecting incomplete bids.
(2) We must receive competitive and noncompetitive bids prior to their respective closing times, which are stated in the auction announcement. We
will not include late bids in the auction. For bids other than those submitted on paper forms, our computer time stamp will establish the receipt time. You are bound by your bids after the closing time.
(3) We are not responsible for any delays, errors, or omissions. We are not responsible for any failures or disruptions of equipment or communications facilities used for participating in Treasury auctions.
(4) Submitters are responsible for bids submitted using computer equipment on their premises, whether or not such bids are authorized.
(b)
Commercial book-entry system.
(1) If you are a submitter and the awarded securities are to be issued in the commercial book-entry system, you must submit bids using one of our approved electronic methods except for contingency situations.
(2) You must have an agreement on file with us under which you agree to our terms and conditions for access to our system for participating in our auctions.
(3) In contingency situations, such as a power outage, we may accept bids by a telephone call to designated Treasury employees if you submit them prior to the relevant bidding deadline.
(c)
Securities held directly with Treasury.
You must submit your bids in accordance with the regulations governing the system in which the security will be held. You may reinvest the proceeds of a maturing security held directly with Treasury as permitted by the system in which it is held.
[69 FR 45202, July 28, 2004, as amended at 70 FR 57440, Sept. 30, 2005; 87 FR 40439, July 7, 2022]
§ 356.12
What are the different types of bids and do they have specific requirements or restrictions?
(a)
General.
All bids must state the par amount of securities bid for and must equal or exceed the minimum to bid amount stated in the auction announcement. Bids in larger amounts must be in the multiple stated in the auction announcement.
(b)
Noncompetitive bids
—(1)
Maximum bid.
You may not bid noncompetitively for more than $10 million. The maximum bid limitation does not apply if you are bidding solely through a request to reinvest the proceeds of a maturing security held directly with Treasury, which is a noncompetitive bid.
(2)
Additional restrictions.
You may not bid noncompetitively in an auction in which you are bidding competitively. You may not bid noncompetitively if, in the security being auctioned, you hold a position in when-issued trading or in futures or forward contracts at any time between the date of the auction announcement and the time we announce the auction results. During this same timeframe, a noncompetitive bidder may not enter into any agreement to purchase or sell or otherwise dispose of the securities it is acquiring in the auction. For this paragraph, futures contracts include those:
(i) That require delivery of the specific security being auctioned;
(ii) For which the security being auctioned is one of several securities that may be delivered; or
(iii) That are cash-settled.
(c)
Competitive bids
—(1)
Bid format
—(i)
Treasury bills.
A competitive bid must show the discount rate bid, expressed with three decimals in .005 increments. The third decimal must be either a zero or a five, for example, 5.320 or 5.325. We will treat any missing decimals as zero, for example, a bid of 5.32 will be treated as 5.320. The rate bid may be a positive number or zero.
(ii)
Treasury non-indexed securities.
A competitive bid must show the yield bid, expressed with three decimals, for example, 4.170. We will treat any missing decimals as zero, for example, a bid of 4.1 will be treated as 4.100. The yield bid may be a positive number or zero.
(iii)
Treasury inflation-protected securities.
A competitive bid must show the real yield bid, expressed with three decimals, for example, 3.070. We will treat any missing decimals as zero, for example, a bid of 3 will be treated as 3.000. The real yield may be a positive number, a negative number, or zero.
(iv)
Treasury floating rate notes.
A competitive bid must show the discount margin bid, expressed as a percentage with three decimals, for example, 0.290 percent. We will treat any missing decimals as zero, for example, a bid of 0.29 will be treated as 0.290. The
discount margin bid may be positive, negative, or zero.
(2)
Maximum recognized bid.
There is no limit on the maximum dollar amount that you may bid for competitively, either at a single yield, discount rate, or discount margin, or at different yields, discount rates, or discount margins. However, a competitive bid at a single yield, discount rate, or discount margin that exceeds 35 percent of the offering amount will be reduced to that amount. For example, if the offering amount is $10 billion, the maximum bid amount we will recognize at any one yield, discount rate, or discount margin from any bidder is $3.5 billion. (See § 356.22 for award limitations.)
(3)
Additional restrictions.
You may not bid competitively in an auction in which you are bidding noncompetitively. You may not bid competitively for securities to be held directly with Treasury.
[69 FR 45202, July 28, 2004, as amended at 69 FR 53621, Sept. 2, 2004; 70 FR 57440, Sept. 30, 2005; 74 FR 26086, June 1, 2009; 78 FR 46428, 46429, July 31, 2013; 87 FR 40439, July 7, 2022]
§ 356.13
When must I report my net long position and how do I calculate it?
(a)
Net long position reporting threshold.
(1) If you are bidding competitively in an auction, you must report your net long position when the total of your bids plus your net long position in the security being auctioned equals or exceeds the net long position reporting threshold (
See
table.). We will specify this threshold in the auction announcement for each security (See § 356.10.). The threshold is typically 35 percent of the offering amount, but we may state a different threshold in the auction announcement. To see whether you must report your net long position, follow this table:
If . . .
And if . . .
Then . . .
(i) the total of your bids and your net long position in the security being auctioned equals or exceeds the reporting threshold
you must report your net long position (which does not include your bids).
(ii) the total of your bids in the auction equals or exceeds the reporting threshold
you have no position or a net short position in the security being auctioned
you must report a zero.
(iii) the total of your bids and your net long position in the security being auctioned is less than the reporting threshold
you may either report nothing (leave the field blank) or report your net long position.
(2) Also, if you have more than one bid in an auction and you must report either your net long position or a zero, you must report that figure only once. Finally, if you are a customer and must report either your net long position or a zero, you must report that figure through only one depository institution or dealer. (See § 356.14(d).)
(b)
“As of” time for calculating net long position.
You must calculate your net long position as of one half-hour prior to the closing time for receipt of competitive bids.
(c)
Components of the net long position.
Except as modified in paragragh (d) of this section, your net long position is the sum total of the par amounts of:
(1) Your holdings of outstanding securities with the same CUSIP number as the security being auctioned;
(2) Your holdings of STRIPS principal components of the security being auctioned, and;
(3) Your positions, in the security being auctioned, in:
(i) When-issued trading, including when-issued trading positions of the STRIPS principal components;
(ii) Futures contracts that require delivery of the specific security being auctioned (but not futures contracts for which the security being auctioned is one of several securities that may be delivered, and not futures contracts that are cash-settled); and
(iii) Forward contracts that require delivery of the specific security being
auctioned or of the STRIPS principal component of that security.
(d)
Calculating the net long position in a reopening.
In a reopening (additional issue) of an outstanding security, you may subtract the exclusion amount stated in the auction announcement from:
(1) Your holdings of the outstanding securities (paragraph (c)(1) of this section) combined with
(2) Your holdings of STRIPS principal components of the security being auctioned (paragraph (c)(2) of this section). We will specify the amount of holdings that you may exclude from the net long position calculation in the auction announcement. You may not take the exclusion if your combined holdings are zero or less. The exclusion is optional, but if you take the exclusion, you must include any holdings that exceed the exclusion amount in calculating your net long position. If the exclusion amount is greater than your combined holdings (paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section), you may calculate the combined holdings as zero, but they cannot be included in the calculation as a negative number.
§ 356.14
What are the requirements for submitting bids for customers?
(a)
Institutions that may submit bids for customers.
Only depository institutions or dealers may submit bids for customers (
see
definitions at § 356.2), or for customers of intermediaries, under the requirements set out in this section. If a bid fulfills a guarantee to sell to a customer a specified amount of securities at the price determined in the auction, then the bid is a bid of that customer.
(b)
Payment.
Submitters must remit payment for bids they submit on behalf of customers, including customers of intermediaries, that result in awards of securities in the auction.
(c)
Identifying customers.
Submitters must provide the names of customers whenever they submit bids for them. Submitters must provide the names of their direct customers as well as customers of any intermediaries who are forwarding customer bids. For individuals, submitters must provide the customer's full name (first and last). For institutional customers, submitters must provide the name of the institution, and the bidder identification number if the customer provides it. For trusts or other fiduciary estates (See appendix A.), submitters must provide on the customer list:
(1) The full name or title of the trustee or fiduciary;
(2) A reference to the document creating the trust or fiduciary estate with date of execution; and
(3) The employer identification number (not social security number) of the trust or fiduciary estate. We do not consider trusts to be a separate bidder that have not been assigned, or that do not provide, an employer identification number.
(d)
Competitive customer bids.
For each customer competitive bid, the submitter must provide the customer's name, the amount bid, and the yield, discount rate, or discount margin. The submitter or intermediary must also report the net long position amount if the customer provides it. The submitter must inform a customer of the net long position reporting requirement (See § 356.13.) if the customer is bidding for $100 million or more of securities. If the submitter's or intermediary's personnel know that the customer's position information is not correct, the submitter or intermediary may not submit the customer's bid.
(e)
Noncompetitive customer bids.
For each noncompetitive bid, the submitter must provide the customer's name and the amount bid. Submitters may either provide the customer's name with the bid or, if the list of customers is lengthy, the submitter may provide a summary bid amount covering all noncompetitive customers. If it provides a summary bid amount, the submitter must transmit the list of individual customers and their bid amounts by close of business on the auction day. However, the submitter must be able to provide the customer list details by the noncompetitive bidding deadline if requested.
[69 FR 45202, July 28, 2004, as amended at 74 FR 26086, June 1, 2009; 78 FR 46429, July 31, 2013; 87 FR 40440, July 7, 2022]
§ 356.15
What rules apply to bids submitted by investment advisers?
(a)
General.
The auction rules that apply to investment advisers are determined by the relationship between “investment advisers” and “controlled accounts.” An investment adviser means any person or entity that has investment discretion for the bids or positions of a different person or entity (a controlled account). A person or entity has investment discretion if it determines what, how many, and when securities will be purchased or sold on behalf of another person or entity. We consider a person that is employed or supervised by an investment adviser to be part of that investment adviser. We also consider the bids or positions of controlled accounts to be separate from the bids or positions of the person or entity with which they would otherwise be associated under the bidder categories in appendix A of this part.
(b)
Bidding options.
(1) An investment adviser has two options for whose name to use when bidding on behalf of controlled accounts.
An investment adviser may bid for a controlled account . . .
In such cases, we consider the bidder to be . . .
(i) in the investment adviser's own name
the investment adviser.
(ii) in the name of the controlled account
the controlled account.
(2) Using the first option (paragraph (b)(1)(i)), an investment advisor could bid noncompetitively up to the noncompetitive bidding limit only for itself, as a single bidder. Using the second option (paragraph (b)(1)(ii)), an investment adviser could bid noncompetitively for each separately named controlled account up to the noncompetitive bidding limit. The investment adviser could also bid noncompetitively in its own name in the same auction up to the noncompetitive bidding limit. An investment adviser may not bid for a controlled account both noncompetitively and competitively in the same auction. If an investment adviser is bidding competitively in the name of a controlled account, the controlled account is subject to the award limitations of § 356.22(b).
(c)
Reporting net long positions.
If it is bidding competitively, an investment adviser must calculate the amount of its bids and positions for purposes of the net long position reporting requirement found in § 356.13(a). In addition to its own competitive bids and positions, the investment adviser must also include in the calculation all other competitive bids and positions that it controls. If the net long position is reportable, the investment adviser must report it as a total in connection with only one bid as stated in § 356.13(a). This requirement applies regardless of whether the investment adviser bids in its own name or in the name of its controlled accounts. The following table shows which positions an investment adviser must include to determine whether it meets the net long position reporting threshold in § 356.13(a). If an investment adviser does meet the reporting threshold, the table also shows which positions must be included in, and which may be excluded from, the net long position calculation.
If an investment adviser is bidding competitively, and . . .
Then . . .
(1) the investment adviser has a net long position for its own account
that position must be included in the investment adviser's net long position calculation.
(2) the investment adviser's competitive bid is for a controlled account
any net long position of that account must be included in the investment adviser's net long position calculation.
(3) the investment adviser is not bidding competitively for a controlled account and . . .
(i) the controlled account has a net long position of $100 million or more
that position must be included in the investment adviser's net long position calculation.
(ii) the controlled account has a net long position that is less than $100 million
that position may be excluded from the investment adviser's net long position calculation.
(iii) any net long position is excluded under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this table
all net short positions of controlled accounts under $100 million must also be excluded.
(d)
Certifications.
When an investment adviser bids for a controlled account, we deem the investment adviser to have certified that it is complying with this part and the auction announcement for the security. Further, we deem the investment adviser to have certified that the information it provided about bids for controlled accounts is accurate and complete.
(e)
Proration of awards.
Investment advisers that submit competitive bids in the names of controlled accounts are responsible for prorating any awards at the highest accepted yield, discount rate, or discount margin using the same percentage that we announce.See § 356.21 for examples of how to prorate.
[69 FR 45202, July 28, 2004, as amended at 78 FR 46429, July 31, 2013]
§ 356.16
Do I have to make any certifications?
(a)
Submitters.
If you submit bids or other information in an auction, we deem you to have certified that:
(1) You are in compliance with this part and the auction announcement;
(2) The information provided with regard to any bids for your own account is accurate and complete; and
(3) The information provided with regard to any bids for customers accurately and completely reflects information provided by your customers or intermediaries.
(b)
Intermediaries.
If you forward bids in an auction, we deem you to have certified that:
(1) You are in compliance with this part and the applicable auction announcement; and
(2) That the information you provided to a submitter or other intermediary with regard to bids for customers accurately and completely reflects information provided by those customers or intermediaries.
(c)
Customers.
By bidding for a security as a customer we deem you to have certified that:
(1) You are in compliance with this part and the auction announcement and;
(2) The information you provided to the submitter or intermediary in connection with the bid is accurate and complete.
[69 FR 45202, July 28, 2004, as amended at 72 FR 14938, Mar. 20, 2008]
§ 356.17
How and when do I pay for securities awarded in an auction?
(a)
General.
By bidding in an auction, you agree to pay the settlement amount for any securities awarded to you. (See § 356.25.) For notes and bonds, the settlement amount may include a premium amount, accrued interest, and, for inflation-protected securities, an inflation adjustment.
(b)
Securities held directly with Treasury.
You must pay for your awarded securities by a debit entry to a deposit account that you are authorized to debit or by using the redemption proceeds of your certificate of indebtedness. Payment by debit entry occurs on the settlement date for the actual settlement amount due. (
See
§ 356.25.)
(c)
Commercial book-entry system.
Unless you make other provisions, payment of the settlement amount must be by charge to the funds account of a depository institution at a Federal Reserve Bank.
(1) A submitter that does not have a funds account at a Federal Reserve Bank or that chooses not to pay by charge to its own funds account must have an approved autocharge agreement on file with us before submitting any bids. Any depository institution whose funds account will be charged under an autocharge agreement will receive advance notice from us of the total par amount of, and price to be charged for, securities awarded as a result of the submitter's bids.
(2) A submitter that is a member of a clearing corporation may instruct that delivery and payment be made through the clearing corporation for securities awarded to the submitter for its own account. To do this, the following requirements must be met prior to submitting any bids:
(i) We must have acknowledged and have on file an autocharge agreement between the clearing corporation and a depository institution. By entering into such an agreement, the clearing corporation authorizes us to provide aggregate par and price information to the depository institution whose funds
account will be charged under the agreement. The clearing corporation is responsible for remitting payment for auction awards of the clearing corporation member.
(ii) We must have acknowledged and have on file a delivery and payment agreement between the submitter and the clearing corporation. By entering into such an agreement, the submitter authorizes us to provide award and payment information to the clearing corporation.
[69 FR 45202, July 28, 2004, as amended at 70 FR 57440, Sept. 30, 2005; 70 FR 71401, Nov. 29, 2005; 73 FR 14938, Mar. 20, 2008; 87 FR 40440, July 7, 2022]

# Subpart C—Determination of Auction Awards; Settlement
§ 356.20
How does the Treasury determine auction awards?
(a)
Determining the range and amount of accepted competitive bids
—(1)
Accepting bids.
First we accept in full all non-competitive bids that were submitted by the noncompetitive bidding deadline. After the closing time for receipt of competitive bids we start accepting those at the lowest yields, discount rates, or discount margins, through successively higher yields, discount rates, or discount margins, up to the amount required to meet the offering amount. When necessary, we prorate bids at the highest accepted yield, discount rate, or discount margin as described below. If the amount of noncompetitive bids would absorb all or most of the offering amount, we will accept competitive bids in an amount sufficient to provide a fair determination of the yield, discount rate, or discount margin for the securities we are auctioning.
(2)
Accepting bids at the high yield, discount rate, or discount margin.
Generally, the total amount of bids at the highest accepted yield, discount rate, or discount margin exceeds the offering amount remaining after we accept the noncompetitive bids and the competitive bids at the lower yields, discount rates, or discount margins. In order to keep the total amount of awards as close as possible to the announced offering amount, we award a percentage of the bids at the highest accepted yield, discount rate, or discount margin. We derive the percentage by dividing the remaining par amount needed to fill the offering amount by the par amount of the bids at the high yield, discount rate, or discount margin and rounding up to the next hundredth of a whole percentage point, for example, 17.13%.
(b)
Determining the interest rate for new non-indexed and inflation-protected note and bond issues.
If a Treasury non-indexed or inflation-protected note or bond auction results in a yield lower than 0.125 percent, the interest rate will be set at
1/8
of one percent, and successful bidders' award prices will be calculated accordingly. (
See
appendix B to this part for formulas.)
(1)
Single-price auctions.
The interest rate we establish produces the price closest to, but not above, par when evaluated at the yield of awards to successful competitive bidders.
(2)
Multiple-price auctions.
The interest rate we establish produces the price closest to, but not above, par when evaluated at the weighted-average yield of awards to successful competitive bidders.
(c)
Determining the interest rate for floating rate notes.
The interest rate will be the spread plus the index rate (as it may be adjusted on the calendar day following each auction of 13-week bills) subject to a minimum daily interest accrual rate of zero percent.
(d)
Determining purchase prices for awarded securities.
We round price calculations to six decimal places on the basis of price per hundred, for example, 99.954321 (See appendix B to this part).
(1)
Single-price auctions.
We award securities to both noncompetitive and competitive bidders at the price equivalent to the highest accepted yield, discount rate, or discount margin at which bids were accepted. For inflation-protected securities, the price for awarded securities is the price equivalent to the highest accepted real yield.
(2)
Multiple-price auctions
—(i)
Competitive bids.
We award securities to competitive bidders at the price equivalent to each yield, discount rate, or discount margin at which their bids were accepted.
(ii)
Noncompetitive bids.
We award securities to noncompetitive bidders at
the price equivalent to the weighted average yield, discount rate, or discount margin of accepted competitive bids.
[69 FR 45202, July 28, 2004, as amended at 69 FR 53621, Sept. 2, 2004; 76 FR 11080, Mar. 1, 2011; 78 FR 46429, July 31, 2013; 87 FR 40440, July 7, 2022]
§ 356.21
How are awards at the high yield, discount rate, or discount margin calculated?
(a)
Awards to submitters.
We generally prorate bids at the highest accepted yield, discount rate, or discount margin under § 356.20(a)(2) of this part. For example, if 80.15% is the announced percentage at the highest yield, discount rate, or discount margin, we award 80.15% of the amount of each bid at that yield, discount rate, or discount margin. A bid for $100 million at the highest accepted yield, discount rate, or discount margin would be awarded $80,150,000 in this example. We always make awards for at least the minimum to bid, and above that amount we make awards in the appropriate multiple to bid. For example, Treasury bills may be issued with a minimum to bid of $100 and multiples to bid of $100. Say we accept an $18,000 bid at the high discount rate, and the percent awarded at the high discount rate is 88.27%. We would award $15,900 to that bidder, which is an upward adjustment from $15,888.60 ($18,000 × .8827) to the nearest multiple of $100. If we were to award 4.65% of bids at the highest accepted rate, for example, the award for a $100 bid at that rate would be $100, rather than $4.65, in order to meet the minimum to bid for a bill issue.
(b)
Awards to customers.
The same prorating rules apply to customers as apply to submitters. Depository institutions and dealers, whether submitters or intermediaries, are responsible for prorating awards for their customers at the same percentage that we announce. For example, if 80.15% is the announced percentage at the highest yield, discount rate, or discount margin, then each customer bid at that yield, discount rate, or discount margin must be awarded 80.15%.
[69 FR 45202, July 28, 2004, as amended at 74 FR 26086, June 1, 2009; 78 FR 46430, July 31, 2013]
§ 356.22
Does the Treasury have any limitations on auction awards?
(a)
Awards to noncompetitive bidders.
The maximum award to any noncompetitive bidder is $10 million. This limit does not apply to bidders bidding solely through a request to reinvest the proceeds of a maturing security held directly with Treasury.
(b)
Awards to competitive bidders.
The maximum award is 35 percent of the offering amount less the bidder's net long position as reportable under § 356.13. For example, in a note auction with a $10 billion offering amount, and therefore a maximum award of $3.5 billion, a bidder with a reported net long position of $1 billion could receive a maximum auction award of $2.5 billion. When the bids and net long positions of more than one person or entity must be combined, as is the case with investment advisers and controlled accounts (See § 356.15(c).), we will use this combined amount for the purpose of this 35 percent award limit.
[69 FR 45202, July 28, 2004, as amended at 69 FR 53622, Sept. 2, 2004; 70 FR 57440, Sept. 30, 2005; 87 FR 40440, July 7, 2022]
§ 356.23
How are the auction results announced?
(a) After the conclusion of the auction, we will make the auction results available on our website at
http://www.treasurydirect.gov.
(b) The auction results will include such information as:
(1) The amounts of bids we accepted and the amount of securities we awarded;
(2) The range of accepted yields, discount rates, or discount margins.
(3) The proration percentage;
(4) The interest rate for a note or bond;
(5) A breakdown of the amounts of noncompetitive and competitive bids we accepted from, and awarded to, the public;
(6) The amounts of bids tendered and accepted from the Federal Reserve Banks for their own accounts;
(7) The bid-to-cover ratio; and
(8) Other information that we may decide to include.
[69 FR 45202, July 28, 2004, as amended at 74 FR 26086, June 1, 2009; 78 FR 46430, July 31, 2013; 87 FR 40440, July 7, 2022]
§ 356.24
Will I be notified directly of my awards and, if I am submitting bids for others, do I have to provide confirmations?
(a)
Notice of awards
—(1)
Notice to submitters.
We will provide notice to all submitters letting them know whether their bids were successful or not.
(2)
Notice to clearing corporations.
If we are to deliver awarded securities under a delivery and payment agreement, we will provide notice of the awards to the clearing corporation that is a party to the agreement.
(b)
Notification of awards to customers.
If you are a submitter for customers, you are responsible for notifying them of their awards. You are also responsible for notifying any intermediaries that forwarded successful bids to you. Similarly, an intermediary is responsible for providing notification of any awards to its customers and any intermediaries from whom it received bids.
(c)
Notification of awards and settlement amounts to a depository institution having an autocharge agreement with a submitter or a clearing corporation.
We will provide notice to each depository institution that has entered into an autocharge agreement with a submitter or a clearing corporation of the amount to be charged, on the issue date, to the institution's funds account at the Federal Reserve Bank servicing the institution. We will provide this notification no later than the day after the auction.
(d)
Customer confirmation
—(1)
Customer requirements
—(i)
When and how must a customer confirm its awards?
Any customer awarded a par amount of $2 billion or more in an auction must send us a confirmation in written form or via e-mail containing the information in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section. The confirmation must be sent no later than 10 a.m. Eastern Time on the next business day following the auction. If sent in written form, the confirmation must be signed by the customer or authorized representative. Confirmations sent by e-mail must be sent by the customer or authorized representative. Confirmations signed or sent by an authorized representative must include the capacity in which the representative is acting.
(ii)
What must the customer include in its confirmation?
The information the customer must provide is:
(A) A confirmation of the awarded bid(s), including the name of each submitter that submitted the bid(s) on the customer's behalf, and
(B) A statement indicating whether the customer had a reportable net long position as defined in § 356.13. If a position had to be reported, the statement must provide the amount of the position and the name of the submitter that the customer requested to report the position.
(2)
Submitter or intermediary requirements.
A submitter or intermediary submitting or forwarding bids for a customer must notify the customer of the customer confirmation reporting requirement if we award the customer $2 billion or more as a result of those bids.
[69 FR 45202, July 28, 2004, as amended at 71 FR 76151, Dec. 20, 2006; 74 FR 26086, June 1, 2009; 74 FR 47100, Sept. 15, 2009]
§ 356.25
How does the settlement process work?
Securities bought in the auction must be paid for by the issue date. The payment amount for awarded securities will be the settlement amount as defined in § 356.2. (See formulas in appendix B.) There are several ways to pay for securities:
(a)
Payment by debit entry to a deposit account.
If you are paying by debit entry to a deposit account as provided for in § 356.17(b), we will charge the settlement amount to the specified account on the issue date.
(b)
Payment by authorized charge to a funds account.
Where the submitter's method of payment is an authorized charge to the funds account of a depository institution as provided for in § 356.17(c), we will charge the settlement amount to the specified funds account on the issue date.
(c)
Payment through a certificate of indebtedness.
If you are paying with the redemption proceeds of your certificate
of indebtedness as provided for in § 356.17(b), we will redeem the certificate of indebtedness for the settlement amount of the security and apply the proceeds on the issue date.
[69 FR 45202, July 28, 2004, as amended at 70 FR 57440, Sept. 30, 2005; 73 FR 14938, Mar. 20, 2008; 87 FR 40440, July 7, 2022]

# Subpart D—Miscellaneous Provisions
§ 356.30
When does the Treasury pay principal and interest on securities?
(a)
General.
We will pay principal on bills, notes, and bonds on the maturity date as specified in the auction announcement. Interest on bills consists of the difference between the discounted amount paid by the investor at original issue and the par value we pay to the investor at maturity. Interest on notes and bonds accrues from the dated date. Interest is payable on a semiannual or quarterly basis on the interest payment dates specified in the auction announcement through the maturity date. If any principal or interest payment date is a Saturday, Sunday, or other day on which the Federal Reserve System is not open for business, we will make the payment (without additional interest) on the next business day. If a bond is callable, we will pay the principal prior to maturity if we call it under its terms, which include providing appropriate public notice.
(b)
Treasury inflation-protected securities.
(1) This table explains the amount that we will pay to holders of inflation-protected securities at maturity.
At maturity, if . . .
then . . .
(i) the inflation-adjusted principal is equal to or more than the par amount of the security.
we will pay the inflation-adjusted principal.
(ii) the inflation-adjusted principal is less than the par amount of the security, and the security has not been stripped.
we will pay an additional amount so that the additional amount plus the inflation-adjusted principal equals the par amount.
(iii) the inflation-adjusted principal is less than the par amount of the security, and the security has been stripped.
to holders of principal components only we will pay an additional amount so that the additional amount plus the inflation-adjusted principal equals the par amount.
(2) Regardless of whether or not we pay an additional amount, we will base the final interest payment on the inflation-adjusted principal at maturity.
(c)
Discharge of payment obligations
—(1)
The commercial book-entry system.
We discharge our payment obligations when we credit payment to the account maintained at a Federal Reserve Bank for a depository institution or other authorized entity, or when we make payment according to the instructions of the person or entity maintaining the account. Further, we do not have any obligations to any person or entity that does not have an account with a Federal Reserve Bank. We also will not recognize the claims of any person or entity:
(i) That does not have an account at a Federal Reserve Bank, or
(ii) With respect to any accounts not maintained at a Federal Reserve Bank.
(2)
Securities held directly with Treasury.
We discharge our payment obligations when we make payment to a depository institution for credit to the account specified by the owner of the security, when we make payment for a certificate of indebtedness to be issued and held in the owner's account, or when we make payment according to the instructions of the security's owner or the owner's legal representative.
[69 FR 45202, July 28, 2004, as amended at 70 FR 57441, Sept. 30, 2005; 78 FR 46430, July 31, 2013; 87 FR 40440, July 7, 2022]
§ 356.31
How does the STRIPS program work?
(a)
General.
Notes or bonds (other than Treasury floating rate notes) may be “stripped”—divided into separate principal and interest components. These components must be maintained in the commercial book-entry system. Stripping is done at the option of the holder, and may occur at any time from issuance until maturity. We provide the CUSIP numbers and payment dates for the principal and interest components in auction announcements
and on our Web site at
http://www.treasurydirect.gov.
(b)
Treasury non-indexed securities (notes and bonds other than Treasury inflation-protected securities or Treasury floating rate notes)
—(1)
Minimum par amounts required for STRIPS.
The minimum par amount of a non-indexed security that may be stripped is $100. Any par amount to be stripped above $100 must be in a multiple of $100.
(2)
Principal components.
Principal components stripped from non-indexed securities are maintained in accounts, and transferred, at their par amount. They have a CUSIP number that is different from the CUSIP number of the fully constituted (unstripped) security.
(3)
Interest components.
Interest components stripped from non-indexed securities have the following features:
(i) They are maintained in accounts, and transferred, at their original payment value, which is derived by multiplying the semiannual interest rate and the par amount;
(ii) Their interest payment date becomes the maturity date for the component;
(iii) All interest components with the same maturity date have the same CUSIP number, regardless of the underlying security from which the interest payments were stripped, and therefore are fungible (interchangeable).
(iv) the CUSIP numbers of interest components are different from the CUSIP numbers of principal components and fully constituted securities, even if they have the same maturity date, and therefore are not fungible.
(c)
Treasury inflation-protected securities
—(1)
Minimum par amounts required for STRIPS.
The minimum par amount of an inflation-protected security that may be stripped is $100. Any par amount to be stripped above $100 must be in a multiple of $100.
(2)
Principal components.
Principal components stripped from inflation-protected securities are maintained in accounts, and transferred, at their par amount. At maturity, the holder will receive the inflation-adjusted principal or the par amount, whichever is greater. (See § 356.30.) A principal component has a CUSIP number that is different from the CUSIP number of the fully constituted (unstripped) security.
(3)
Interest components
—(i)
Adjusted value.
Interest components stripped from inflation-protected securities are maintained in accounts, and transferred, at their adjusted value. This value is derived by multiplying the semiannual interest rate by the par amount and then multiplying this value by: 100 divided by the Reference CPI of the original issue date. (The dated date is used instead of the original issue date when the dates are different.) See appendix B, section V of this part for an example of how to do this calculation.
(ii)
CUSIP numbers.
When an interest payment is stripped from an inflation-protected security, the interest payment date becomes the maturity date for the component. All interest components with the same maturity date have the same CUSIP number, regardless of the underlying security from which the interest payments were stripped. Such interest components are fungible (interchangeable). The CUSIP numbers of interest components are different from the CUSIP numbers of principal components and fully constituted securities, even if they have the same maturity date.
(iii)
Payment at maturity.
At maturity, the payment to the holder will be derived by multiplying the adjusted value of the interest component by the Reference CPI of the maturity date, divided by 100. See appendix B, section V of this part for an example of how to do this calculation.
(iv)
Rebasing of the CPI.
If the CPI is rebased to a different time base reference period (See appendix D.), the adjusted values of all outstanding inflation-protected interest components will be converted to adjusted values based on the new base reference period. At that time, we will publish information that describes how this conversion will occur. After rebasing, any interest components created from a security that was issued during a prior base reference period will be issued with adjusted values calculated using reference CPIs under the most-recent base reference period.
(d)
Reconstituting a security.
Stripped interest and principal components may be reconstituted, that is, put back together into their fully constituted
form. A principal component and all related unmatured interest components, in the appropriate minimum or multiple amounts or adjusted values, must be submitted together for reconstitution. Because inflation-protected interest components are different from non-indexed interest components, they are not interchangeable for reconstitution purposes.
(e)
Applicable regulations.
Subparts A, B, and D of part 357 of this chapter govern notes and bonds stripped into their STRIPS components, unless we state differently in this part.
[69 FR 45202, July 28, 2004, as amended at 73 FR 14939, Mar. 20, 2008; 74 FR 26086, June 1, 2009; 78 FR 46428, 46430, July 31, 2013; 81 FR 43070, July 1, 2016]
§ 356.32
What tax rules apply?
(a)
General.
Securities issued under this part are subject to all applicable taxes imposed under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or its successor. Under section 3124 of title 31, United States Code, the securities are exempt from taxation by a State or political subdivision of a State, except for State estate or inheritance taxes and other exceptions as provided in that section.
(b)
Treasury inflation-protected securities.
Special federal income tax rules for inflation-protected securities, including stripped inflation-protected principal and interest components, are set forth in Internal Revenue Service regulations.
(c)
Treasury floating rate notes.
Special federal income tax rules for floating rate notes are set forth in Internal Revenue Service regulations.
[69 FR 45202, July 28, 2004, as amended at 78 FR 46430, July 31, 2013]
§ 356.33
Does the Treasury have any discretion in the auction process?
(a) We have the discretion to:
(1) Accept, reject, or refuse to recognize any bids submitted in an auction;
(2) Award more or less than the amount of securities specified in the auction announcement;
(3) Waive any provision of this part for any bidder or submitter; and
(4) Change the terms and conditions of an auction.
(b) Our decisions under this part are final. We will provide a public notice if we change any auction provision, term, or condition.
(c) We reserve the right to modify the terms and conditions of new securities and to depart from the customary pattern of securities offerings at any time.
§ 356.34
What could happen if someone does not fully comply with the auction rules or fails to pay for securities?
(a)
General.
If a person or entity fails to comply with any of the auction rules in this part, we will consider the circumstances and take what we deem to be appropriate action. This could include barring the person or entity from participating in future auctions under this part. We also may refer the matter to an appropriate regulatory agency.
(b)
Liquidated damages.
If you fail to pay for awarded securities in a timely manner, we may require you to pay liquidated damages of up to one percent of the par amount of securities we awarded to you. Our use of this liquidated damages remedy does not preclude us from using any other appropriate remedy.
§ 356.35
Who approved the information collections?
The Office of Management and Budget approved the collections of information contained in §§ 356.11, 356.12, 356.13, 356.14, and 356.15 and in appendix A of this part under control number 1535-0112.
Pt. 356, App. A

# Appendix A to Part 356—Bidder Categories

# I. Categories of Eligible Bidders
We describe below various categories of bidders eligible to bid in Treasury auctions. You may use them to determine whether we consider you and other persons or entities to be one bidder or more than one bidder for auction bidding and compliance purposes. For example, we use these definitions to apply the competitive and noncompetitive award limitations and for other requirements. Notwithstanding these definitions, we consider any persons or entities that intentionally act together with respect to bidding in a Treasury auction to collectively be one bidder. Even if an auction participant does not fall under any of the categories listed below, it is our intent that no auction
participant receives a larger auction award by acquiring securities through others than it could have received had it been considered one of these types of bidders.
(a)
Corporation
—We consider a corporation to be one bidder. A corporation includes all of its affiliates, which may be persons, partnerships, or other entities. We consider a business trust, such as a Massachusetts or Delaware business trust, to be a corporation. We use the term “corporate structure” to refer to the collection of affiliates that we consider collectively to be one bidder. An affiliate is any:
• Entity that is more than 50-percent owned, directly or indirectly, by the corporation;
• Entity that is more than 50-percent owned, directly or indirectly, by any other affiliate of the corporation;
• Person or entity that owns, directly or indirectly, more than 50 percent of the corporation;
• Person or entity that owns, directly or indirectly, more than 50 percent of any other affiliate of the corporation; or
• Entity, a majority of whose board of directors or a majority of whose general partners are directors or officers of the corporation, or of any affiliate of the corporation.
An entity that is more than 50-percent owned as described in this definition is not an affiliate, however, if:
• The purpose of such ownership is to seek a return on investment and not to engage in the business of the entity;
• The owner does not routinely exercise operational or management control over the entity;
• The owner does not exercise any control over investment decisions of the entity regarding U.S. Treasury securities;
• The corporation has written policies or procedures, including ongoing compliance monitoring processes, that are designed to prevent it from acting together with the entity regarding participation in Treasury auctions or investment strategies regarding Treasury securities being auctioned; and
• The corporation submits notice and certification to us, as provided in this appendix A.
A corporation that plans to make use of this exception to the definition of “affiliate” must inform us of this fact in writing and provide the following certification:
[Name of corporation] hereby certifies that, with regard to any entity of which it owns more than 50 percent as defined in appendix A to 31 CFR part 356, but for which the purpose of such ownership is to seek a return on investment and not to engage in the business of the entity:
• We do not routinely exercise operational or management control over the entity;
• We do not exercise any control over investment decisions of the entity regarding U.S. Treasury securities;
• We have written policies or procedures, including ongoing compliance monitoring processes, that are designed to prevent the corporation from acting together with the entity regarding participation in Treasury auctions or investment strategies regarding Treasury securities being auctioned; and
• We will continue to meet the terms of this certification until we notify the Treasury of a change.
(b)
Partnership
—We consider a partnership to be one bidder if it is a partnership for which the Internal Revenue Service has assigned a tax-identification number. A partnership includes all of its affiliates, which may be persons, corporations, general partners acting on behalf of the partnership, or other entities. We use the term “partnership structure” to refer to the collection of affiliates that we consider collectively to be one bidder. We may consider a partnership structure that contains one or more corporations as a “partnership” or a “corporation,” but not both.
An affiliate is any:
• Entity that is more than 50-percent owned, directly or indirectly, by the partnership;
• Entity that is more than 50-percent owned, directly or indirectly, by any other affiliate of the partnership;
• Person or entity that owns, directly or indirectly, more than 50 percent of the partnership;
• Person or entity that owns, directly or indirectly, more than 50 percent of any other affiliate of the partnership; or
• Entity, a majority of whose general partners or a majority of whose board of directors are general partners or directors of the partnership or of any affiliate of the partnership.
An entity that is more than 50-percent owned as described in this definition is not an affiliate, however, if:
• The purpose of such ownership is to seek a return on investment and not to engage in the business of the entity;
• The owner does not routinely exercise operational or management control over the entity;
• The owner does not exercise any control over investment decisions of the entity regarding U.S. Treasury securities;
• The partnership has written policies or procedures, including ongoing compliance monitoring processes, that are designed to prevent it from acting together with the entity regarding participation in Treasury auctions or investment strategies regarding Treasury securities being auctioned; and
• The partnership submits notice and certification to us, as provided in this appendix A.
A partnership that plans to make use of this exception to the definition of “affiliate” must inform us of this fact in writing and provide the following certification:
[Name of partnership] hereby certifies that, with regard to any entity of which it owns more than 50 percent as defined in appendix A to 31 CFR part 356, but for which the purpose of such ownership is to seek a return on investment and not to engage in the business of the entity:
• We do not routinely exercise operational or management control over the entity;
• We do not exercise any control over investment decisions of the entity regarding U.S. Treasury securities;
• We have written policies or procedures, including ongoing compliance monitoring processes, that are designed to prevent the partnership from acting together with the entity regarding participation in Treasury auctions or investment strategies regarding Treasury securities being auctioned; and
• We will continue to meet the terms of this certification until we notify the Treasury of a change.
(c)
Government-related entity
—We consider each of the following entities to be one bidder:
(1) A state government or the government of the District of Columbia
(2) A unit of local government, including any county, city, municipality, or township, or other unit of general government as defined by the Bureau of the Census for statistical purposes.
(3) A commonwealth, territory, or possession of the United States.
(4) A governmental entity, body, or corporation established under Federal, State, or local law.
(5) A foreign central bank, the government of a foreign state, or an international organization in which the United States holds membership. This type of entity applies only when such entity is not using an account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (See paragraph (f).).
We generally consider an investment, reserve, or other fund of one of the above government-related entities as part of that entity and not a separate bidder. We will consider a government-related entity's fund to be a separate bidder if it meets the definition of the “trust or other fiduciary estate” category, or if applicable law requires that the investments of such fund be made separately.
(d)
Trust or other fiduciary estate
—We consider a legal entity created under a valid trust instrument, court order, or other legal authority that designates a trustee or fiduciary to act for the benefit of a named beneficiary to be one bidder. The following conditions must also be met for us to consider a trust entity to be one bidder:
• The legal entity must be able to be identified by:
1. The name or title of the trustee or fiduciary;
2. Specific reference to the trust instrument, court order, or legal authority under which the trustee or fiduciary is acting; and
3. The unique IRS-assigned employer identification number (not social security number) for the entity.
• The trustee or fiduciary must make the decisions on participating in auctions on behalf of the trust or fiduciary estate.
(e)
Individual
—We consider a person to be one bidder, regardless of whether he or she is acting as an individual, a sole proprietor, or for any entity not otherwise defined as a bidder. If a person meets the definition of an affiliate within a corporate or partnership structure, we will consider him or her to be a bidder in this “individual” category if the corporation or partnership is not bidding in the same auction. We do not consider a person acting in an official capacity as an employee or other representative of a bidder defined in any other category to be an “individual” bidder. We consider a person, his or her spouse, and any children under the age of 21 having a common household to be one “individual” bidder.
(f)
Foreign and International Monetary Authority (“FIMA”)
—We consider one or more parties making up a foreign or international monetary organization that is not private in nature to be a bidder called a FIMA entity if at least one of the parties is a foreign or international entity that is (i) financial in nature, or (ii) not financial in nature but is authorized to open an account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. We consider each of the following entities to be a single FIMA entity:
(1) A foreign central bank or regional central bank.
(2) A foreign governmental monetary or finance entity.
(3) A non-governmental international financial organization that is not private in nature (for example, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, and the Asian Development Bank).
(4) A non-financial international organization that the United States participates in (for example, the United Nations).
(5) A multi-party arrangement of a governmental ministry and/or a foreign central bank or monetary authority with a United States Government Department and/or the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
(6) A foreign or international monetary entity or an entity authorized by statute or by us to open accounts at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
(g)
Other Bidder
—We do not consider a bidder defined by any of the above categories to be a bidder in this category. For purposes of
this definition, “other bidder” means an institution or organization with a unique IRS-assigned employer identification number. This definition includes such entities as an association, church, university, union, or club. This category does not include any person or entity acting in a fiduciary or investment management capacity, a sole proprietorship, an investment account, an investment fund, a form of registration, or investment ownership designation.

# II. How To Obtain Separate Bidder Recognition
Under certain circumstances, we may recognize a major organizational component (e.g., the parent or a subsidiary) in a corporate or partnership structure as a bidder separate from the larger corporate or partnership structure. We also may recognize two or more major organizational components collectively as one bidder. All of the following criteria must be met for such component(s) to qualify for recognition as a separate bidder:
(a) Such component(s) must be prohibited by law or regulation from exchanging, or must have established written internal procedures designed to prevent the exchange of, information related to bidding in Treasury auctions with any other component in the corporate or partnership structure;
(b) Such component(s) must not be created for the purpose of circumventing our bidding and award limitations;
(c) Decisions related to purchasing Treasury securities at auction and participation in specific auctions must be made by employees of such component(s). Employees of such component(s) that make decisions to purchase or dispose of Treasury securities must not perform the same function for other components within the corporate or partnership structure; and
(d) The records of such component(s) related to the bidding for, acquisition of, and disposition of Treasury securities must be maintained by such component(s). Those records must be identifiable—separate and apart from similar records for other components within the corporate or partnership structure. To obtain recognition as a separate bidder, each component or group of components must request such recognition from us, provide a description of the component or group and its position within the corporate or partnership structure, and provide the following certification:
[Name of the bidder] hereby certifies that to the best of its knowledge and belief it meets the criteria for a separate bidder as described in appendix A to 31 CFR part 356. The above-named bidder also certifies that it has established written policies or procedures, including ongoing compliance monitoring processes, that are designed to prevent the component or group of components from:
(1) Exchanging any of the following information with any other part of the corporate [partnership] structure: (a) Yields, discount rates, or discount margins at which it plans to bid; (b) amounts of securities for which it plans to bid; (c) positions that it holds or plans to acquire in a security being auctioned; and (d) investment strategies that it plans to follow regarding the security being auctioned, or
(2) In any way intentionally acting together with any other part of the corporate [partnership] structure with respect to formulating or entering bids in a Treasury auction.
The above-named bidder agrees that it will promptly notify the Department in writing when any of the information provided to obtain separate bidder status changes or when this certification is no longer valid.

The examples in this appendix are given for illustrative purposes only and are in no way a prediction of interest rates on any bills, notes, or bonds issued under this part. In some of the following examples, we use intermediate rounding for ease in following the calculations.

# I. Computation of Interest on Treasury Bonds and Notes

# A. Treasury Non-indexed Securities
1.
Regular Half-Year Payment Period.
We pay interest on marketable Treasury non-indexed securities on a semiannual basis. The regular interest payment period is a full half-year of six calendar months. Examples of half-year periods are: (1) February 15 to August 15, (2) May 31 to November 30, and (3) February 29 to August 31 (in a leap year). Calculation of an interest payment for a
non-indexed note with a par amount of $1,000 and an interest rate of 8% is made in this manner: ($1,000 × .08)/2 = $40. Specifically, a semiannual interest payment represents one half of one year's interest, and is computed on this basis regardless of the actual number of days in the half-year.
2.
Daily Interest Decimal.
We compute a daily interest decimal in cases where an interest payment period for a non-indexed security is shorter or longer than six months or where accrued interest is payable by an investor. We base the daily interest decimal on the actual number of calendar days in the half-year or half-years involved. The number of days in any half-year period is shown in Table 1.

Short First Payment Period.
In cases where the first interest payment period for a Treasury non-indexed security covers less than a full half-year period (a “short coupon”), we multiply the daily interest decimal by the number of days from, but not including, the issue date to, and including, the first interest payment date. This calculation results in the amount of the interest payable per $1,000 par amount. In cases where the par amount of securities is a multiple of $1,000, we multiply the appropriate multiple by the unrounded interest payment amount per $1,000 par amount.

# Example
A 2-year note paying 8
3/8
% interest was issued on July 2, 1990, with the first interest payment on December 31, 1990. The number of days in the full half-year period of June 30 to December 31, 1990, was 184 (See Table 1.). The number of days for which interest actually accrued was 182 (not including July 2, but including December 31). The daily interest decimal, $0.227581522 (See Table 2, line for 8
3/8
%, under the column for half-year of 184 days.), was multiplied by 182, resulting in a payment of $41.419837004 per $1,000. For $20,000 of these notes, $41.419837004 would be multiplied by 20, resulting in a payment of $828.39674008 ($828.40).
4.
Long First Payment Period.
In cases where the first interest payment period for a bond or note covers more than a full half-year period (a “long coupon”), we multiply the daily interest decimal by the number of days from, but not including, the issue date to, and including, the last day of the fractional period that ends one full half-year before the interest payment date. We add that amount to the regular interest amount for the full half-year ending on the first interest payment date, resulting in the amount of interest payable for $1,000 par amount. In cases where the par amount of securities is a multiple of $1,000, the appropriate multiple should be applied to the unrounded interest payment amount per $1,000 par amount.

# Example
A 5-year 2-month note paying 7
7/8
% interest was issued on December 3, 1990, with the first interest payment due on August 15, 1991. Interest for the regular half-year portion of the payment was computed to be $39.375 per $1,000 par amount. The fractional portion of the payment, from December 3 to February 15, fell in a 184-day half-year (August 15, 1990, to February 15, 1991). Accordingly, the daily interest decimal for 7
7/8
% was $0.213994565. This decimal, multiplied by 74 (the number of days from but not including December 3, 1990, to and including February 15), resulted in interest for the fractional portion of $15.835597810. When added to $39.375 (the normal interest payment portion ending on August 15, 1991), this produced a first interest payment of $55.210597810, or $55.21 per $1,000 par amount. For $7,000 par amount of these notes, $55.210597810 would be multiplied by 7, resulting in an interest payment of $386.474184670 ($386.47).

# B. Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities
1.
Indexing Process.
We pay interest on marketable Treasury inflation-protected securities on a semiannual basis. We issue inflation-protected securities with a stated rate of interest that remains constant until maturity. Interest payments are based on the security's inflation-adjusted principal at the time we pay interest. We make this adjustment by multiplying the par amount of the security by the applicable Index Ratio.
2.
Index Ratio.
The numerator of the Index Ratio, the Ref CPI
Date
, is the index number applicable for a specific day. The denominator of the Index Ratio is the Ref CPI applicable for the original issue date. However, when the dated date is different from the original issue date, the denominator is the Ref CPI applicable for the dated date. The formula for calculating the Index Ratio is:
ER28JY04.000
Where Date = valuation date
3.
Reference CPI.
The Ref CPI for the first day of any calendar month is the CPI for the third preceding calendar month. For example, the Ref CPI applicable to April 1 in any year is the CPI for January, which is reported in February. We determine the Ref CPI for any other day of a month by a linear interpolation between the Ref CPI applicable to the first day of the month in which the day falls (in the example, January) and the Ref CPI applicable to the first day of the next month (in the example, February). For interpolation purposes, we truncate calculations with regard to the Ref CPI and the Index Ratio for a specific date to six decimal places, and round to five decimal places.
Therefore the Ref CPI and the Index Ratio for a particular date will be expressed to five decimal places.
(i) The formula for the Ref CPI for a specific date is:
ER28JY04.001
Where Date = valuation date
D = the number of days in the month in which Date falls
t = the calendar day corresponding to Date
CPI
M
= CPI reported for the calendar month M by the Bureau of Labor Statistics
Ref CPI
M
= Ref CPI for the first day of the calendar month in which Date falls, e.g., Ref CPI
April1
is the CPI
January
Ref CPI
M + 1
= Ref CPI for the first day of the calendar month immediately following Date
(ii) For example, the Ref CPI for April 15, 1996 is calculated as follows:
ER28JY04.002
where D = 30, t = 15
Ref CPI
April 1, 1996
= 154.40, the non-seasonally adjusted CPI-U for January 1996.
Ref CPI
May 1, 1996
= 154.90, the non-seasonally adjusted CPI-U for February 1996.
(iii) Putting these values in the equation in paragraph (ii) above:
ER28JY04.003
This value truncated to six decimals is 154.633333; rounded to five decimals it is 154.63333.
(iv) To calculate the Index Ratio for April 16, 1996, for an inflation-protected security issued on April 15, 1996, the Ref CPI
April 16, 1996
must first be calculated. Using the same values in the equation above except that t = 16, the Ref CPI
April 16, 1996
is 154.65000.
The Index Ratio for April 16, 1996 is:
Index Ratio
April 16, 1996
= 154.65000/154.63333 = 1.000107803.
This value truncated to six decimals is 1.000107; rounded to five decimals it is 1.00011.
4.
Index Contingencies.
(i) If a previously reported CPI is revised, we will continue to use the previously reported (unrevised) CPI in calculating the principal value and interest payments.
If the CPI is rebased to a different year, we will continue to use the CPI based on the base reference period in effect when the security was first issued, as long as that CPI continues to be published.
(ii) We will replace the CPI with an appropriate alternative index if, while an inflation-protected security is outstanding, the applicable CPI is:
• Discontinued,
• In the judgment of the Secretary, fundamentally altered in a manner materially adverse to the interests of an investor in the security, or
• In the judgment of the Secretary, altered by legislation or Executive Order in a manner materially adverse to the interests of an investor in the security.
(iii) If we decide to substitute an alternative index we will consult with the Bureau of Labor Statistics or any successor agency. We will then notify the public of the substitute index and how we will apply it. Determinations of the Secretary in this regard will be final.
(iv) If the CPI for a particular month is not reported by the last day of the following month, we will announce an index number based on the last available twelve-month change in the CPI. We will base our calculations of our payment obligations that rely on that month's CPI on the index number we announce.
(a) For example, if the CPI for month M is not reported timely, the formula for calculating the index number to be used is:
ER28JY04.004
(b) Generalizing for the last reported CPI issued N months prior to month M:
ER28JY04.005
(c) If it is necessary to use these formulas to calculate an index number, we will use that number for all subsequent calculations that rely on the month's index number. We
will not replace it with the actual CPI when it is reported, except for use in the above formulas. If it becomes necessary to use the above formulas to derive an index number, we will use the last CPI that has been reported to calculate CPI numbers for months for which the CPI has not been reported timely.

Computation of Interest for a Regular Half-Year Payment Period.
Interest on marketable Treasury inflation-protected securities is payable on a semiannual basis. The regular interest payment period is a full half-year or six calendar months. Examples of half-year periods are January 15 to July 15, and April 15 to October 15. An interest payment will be a fixed percentage of the value of the inflation-adjusted principal, in current dollars, for the date on which it is paid. We will calculate interest payments by multiplying one-half of the specified annual interest rate for the inflation-protected securities by the inflation-adjusted principal for the interest payment date.
Specifically, we compute a semiannual interest payment on the basis of one-half of one year's interest regardless of the actual number of days in the half-year.

# Example
A 10-year inflation-protected note paying 3
7/8%
interest was issued on January 15, 1999, with the first interest payment on July 15, 1999. The Ref CPI on January 15, 1999 (Ref CPI
IssueDate
) was 164, and the Ref CPI on July 15, 1999 (Ref CPI
Date
) was 166.2. For a par amount of $100,000, the inflation-adjusted principal on July 15, 1999, was (166.2/164) × $100,000, or $101,341. This amount was multiplied by .03875/2, or .019375, resulting in a payment of $1,963.48.

# C. Treasury Floating Rate Notes
1.
Indexing and Interest Payment Process.
We issue floating rate notes with a daily interest accrual feature. This means that the interest rate “floats” based on changes in the representative index rate. We pay interest on a quarterly basis. The index rate is the High Rate of the 13-week Treasury bill auction announced on the auction results that has been converted into a simple-interest money market yield computed on an actual/360 basis and rounded to nine decimal places. Interest payments are based on the floating rate note's variable interest rate from, and including, the dated date or last interest payment date to, but excluding, the next interest payment or maturity date. We make quarterly interest payments by accruing the daily interest amounts and adding those amounts together for the interest payment period.
2.
Interest Rate.
The interest rate on floating rate notes will be the spread plus the index rate (as it may be adjusted on the calendar day following each auction of 13-week bills).
3.
Interest Accrual.
In general, accrued interest for a particular calendar day in an accrual period is calculated by using the index rate from the most recent auction of 13-week bills that took place before the accrual day, plus the spread determined at the time of a new floating rate note auction, divided by 360, subject to a zero-percent minimum daily interest accrual rate. However, the rate determined in a 13-week bill auction that takes place in the two-business-day period prior to a settlement date or interest payment date will be excluded from the calculation of accrued interest for purposes of the settlement amount or interest payment. Any changes in the index rate that would otherwise have occurred during this two-business-day period will occur on the first calendar day following the end of the period.
4.
Index Contingencies.
(i) If Treasury were to discontinue auctions of 13-week bills, the Secretary has authority to determine and announce a new index for outstanding floating rate notes.
(ii) If Treasury were to not conduct a 13-week bill auction in a particular week, then the interest rate in effect for the notes at the time of the last 13-week bill auction results announcement will remain in effect until such time, if any, as the results of a 13-week Treasury auction are again announced by Treasury. Treasury reserves the right to change the index rate for any newly issued floating rate note.

# D. Accrued Interest
1. You will have to pay accrued interest on a Treasury bond or note when interest accrues prior to the issue date of the security. Because you receive a full interest payment despite having held the security for only a portion of the interest payment period, you must compensate us through the payment of accrued interest at settlement.
2. For a Treasury non-indexed security, if accrued interest covers a fractional portion of a full half-year period, the number of days in the full half-year period and the stated interest rate will determine the daily interest decimal to use in computing the accrued interest. We multiply the decimal by the number of days for which interest has accrued.
3. If a reopened bond or note has a long first interest payment period (a “long coupon”), and the dated date for the reopened issue is less than six full months before the first interest payment, the accrued interest will fall into two separate half-year periods. A separate daily interest decimal must be multiplied by the respective number of days in each half-year period during which interest has accrued.
4. We round all accrued interest computations to five decimal places for a $1,000 par amount, using normal rounding procedures.
We calculate accrued interest for a par amount of securities greater than $1,000 by applying the appropriate multiple to accrued interest payable for a $1,000 par amount, rounded to five decimal places. We calculate accrued interest for a par amount of securities less than $1,000 by applying the appropriate fraction to accrued interest payable for a $1,000 par amount, rounded to five decimal places.
5. For an inflation-protected security, we calculate accrued interest as shown in section III, paragraphs A and B of this appendix.

# Examples:
(1)
Treasury Non-indexed Securities—(i) Involving One Half-Year:
A note paying interest at a rate of 6
3/4%
, originally issued on May 15, 2000, as a 5-year note with a first interest payment date of November 15, 2000, was reopened as a 4-year 9-month note on August 15, 2000. Interest had accrued for 92 days, from May 15 to August 15. The regular interest period from May 15 to November 15, 2000, covered 184 days. Accordingly, the daily interest decimal, $0.183423913, multiplied by 92, resulted in accrued interest payable of $16.874999996, or $16.87500, for each $1,000 note purchased. If the notes have a par amount of $150,000, then 150 is multiplied by $16.87500, resulting in an amount payable of $2,531.25.
(2)
Involving Two Half-Years:
A 10
3/4%
bond, originally issued on July 2, 1985, as a 20-year 1-month bond, with a first interest payment date of February 15, 1986, was reopened as a 19-year 10-month bond on November 4, 1985. Interest had accrued for 44 days, from July 2 to August 15, 1985, during a 181-day half-year (February 15 to August 15); and for 81 days, from August 15 to November 4, during a 184-day half-year (August 15, 1985, to February 15, 1986). Accordingly, $0.296961326 was multiplied by 44, and $0.292119565 was multiplied by 81, resulting in products of $13.066298344 and $23.661684765 which, added together, resulted in accrued interest payable of $36.727983109, or $36.72798, for each $1,000 bond purchased. If the bonds have a par amount of $11,000, then 11 is multiplied by $36.72798, resulting in an amount payable of $404.00778 ($404.01).
6. For a floating rate note, if accrued interest covers a portion of a full quarterly interest payment period, we calculate accrued interest as shown in section IV, paragraphs C and D of this appendix.

# II. Formulas for Conversion of Non-indexed Security Yields to Equivalent Prices

# Definitions
P = price per 100 (dollars), rounded to six places, using normal rounding procedures.
C = the regular annual interest per $100, payable semiannually, e.g., 6.125 (the decimal equivalent of a 6
1/8
% interest rate).
i = nominal annual rate of return or yield to maturity, based on semiannual interest payments and expressed in decimals, e.g., .0719.
n = number of full semiannual periods from the issue date to maturity, except that, if the issue date is a coupon frequency date, n will be one less than the number of full semiannual periods remaining to maturity. Coupon frequency dates are the two semiannual dates based on the maturity date of each note or bond issue. For example, a security maturing on November 15, 2015, would have coupon frequency dates of May 15 and November 15.
r = (1) number of days from the issue date to the first interest payment (regular or short first payment period), or (2) number of days in fractional portion (or “initial short period”) of long first payment period.
s = (1) number of days in the full semiannual period ending on the first interest payment date (regular or short first payment period), or (2) number of days in the full semiannual period in which the fractional portion of a long first payment period falls, ending at the onset of the regular portion of the first interest payment.

Bidding:
The dollar amount of each bid is in terms of the par amount. For example, if the Ref CPI applicable to the issue date of the note is 120, and the reference CPI applicable to the reopening issue date is 132, a bid of $10,000 will in effect be a bid of $10,000 × (132/120), or $11,000.

Formula:
ER31JY13.000
Example:
The purpose of this example is to demonstrate how a floating rate note price is derived at the time of original issuance. Additionally, this example depicts the association of the July 31, 2012 issue date and the two-business-day lockout period. For a new two-year floating rate note auctioned on July 25, 2012, and issued on July 31, 2012, with a maturity date of July 31, 2014, and an interest accrual rate on the issue date of 0.215022819% (index rate of 0.095022819% plus a spread of 0.120%), solve for the price per 100 (P). This interest accrual rate is used for each daily interest accrual over the life of the security for the purposes of this example. In a new issuance (not a reopening) of a floating rate note, the discount margin determined at auction will be equal to the spread.

As of the issue date the latest 13-week bill, auctioned at least two days prior, has the following information:

0.095022819%
The rationale for using a 13-week bill auction that has occurred at least two days prior to the issue date is due to the two-business-day lockout period. This lockout period applies only to the issue date and interest payment dates, thus any 13-week bill auction that occurs during the two-day lockout period is not used for calculations related to the issue date and interest payment dates. The following sample calendar depicts this relationship for the floating rate note issue date.

Formula:
ER31JY13.003
Example:
The purpose of this example is to demonstrate how a floating rate note auction can result in a price at a premium given a negative discount margin and spread at auction. For a new two-year floating rate note auctioned on July 25, 2012, and issued on July 31, 2012, with a maturity date of July 31, 2014, solve for the price per 100 (P). In a new issue (not a reopening) of a floating rate note, the discount margin established at auction will be equal to the spread. In this example, the discount margin determined at auction is −0.150%, but the floating rate note is subject to a daily interest rate accrual minimum of 0.000%.

Example:
The purpose of this example is to determine the floating rate note prices with and without accrued interest at the time of the reopening auction. For a two-year floating rate note that was originally auctioned on July 25, 2012, with an issue date of July 31, 2012, reopened in an auction on August 30, 2012 and issued on August 31, 2012, with a maturity date of July 31, 2014, solve for accrued interest per 100 (AI), the price with accrued interest per 100 (P
D
) and the price without accrued interest per 100 (P
C
). Since this is a reopening of an original issue from the prior month, Table 2 as shown in the example is used for accrued interest calculations. In the case of floating rate note reopenings, the spread on the security remains equal to the spread that was established at the original auction of the floating rate notes.

D. For calculating interest payments:
Example:
For a new issue of a two-year floating rate note auctioned on July 25, 2012, and issued on July 31, 2012, with a maturity date of July 31, 2014, and a first interest payment date of October 31, 2012, calculate the quarterly interest payments (IP
i
) per 100. In a new issuance (not a reopening) of a new floating rate note, the discount margin determined at auction will be equal to the spread. The interest accrual rate used for this floating rate note on the issue date is 0.215022819% (index rate of 0.095022819% plus a spread of 0.120%) and this rate is used for each daily interest accrual over the life of the security for the purposes of this example.

# Example 2:
Projected interest payment as of the reopening issue date (intermediate values, including rates in percentage terms, are rounded to nine decimal places).
This example demonstrates the calculations required to determine the interest payment due when the reopened floating rate note is issued. This example also demonstrates the need to calculate accrued interest at the time of a floating rate reopening auction. Since this is a reopening of an original issue from 31 days prior, Table 5 as shown in the example is used for accrued interest calculations. For a two-year floating rate note originally auctioned on July 25, 2012 with an original issue date of July 31, 2012, reopened by an auction on August 30, 2012 and issued on August 31, 2012, with a maturity date of July 31, 2014, calculate the quarterly interest payments (IP

Example:
The purpose of this example is to demonstrate how a floating rate note can have a price without accrued interest of less than $100 par value when the issue date occurs after the dated date. An original issue two-year floating rate note is auctioned on December 29, 2011, with a dated date of December 31, 2011, an issue date of January 3, 2012, and a maturity date of December 31, 2013.
Definitions:
Dated date = 12/31/2011.
Issue date = 1/3/2012.
Maturity date = 12/31/2013.
Spread = 1.000% at auction.
Discount margin = 1.000%.
As of the issue date the latest 13-week bill, auctioned at least two days prior, has the following information:

# V. Computation of Adjusted Values and Payment Amounts for Stripped Inflation-Protected Interest Components

# Note:
Valuing an interest component stripped from an inflation-protected security at its adjusted value enables this interest component to be interchangeable (fungible) with other interest components that have the same maturity date, regardless of the underlying inflation-protected security from which the interest components were stripped. The adjusted value provides for fungibility of these various interest components when buying, selling, or transferring them or when reconstituting an inflation-protected security.
Definitions:
c = C/100 = the regular annual interest rate, payable semiannually, e.g., .03625 (the decimal equivalent of a 3
5/8
% interest rate)
Par = par amount of the security to be stripped
Ref CPI
IssueDate
= reference CPI for the original issue date (or dated date, when the dated date is different from the original issue date) of the underlying (unstripped) security
Ref CPI
Date
= reference CPI for the maturity date of the interest component
AV = adjusted value of the interest component
PA = payment amount at maturity by Treasury
Formulas:
AV = Par(C/2)(100/Ref CPI
IssueDate
) (rounded to 2 decimals with no intermediate rounding)
PA = AV(Ref CPI
Date
/100) (rounded to 2 decimals with no intermediate rounding)
Example:
A 10-year inflation-protected note paying 3
7/8
% interest was issued on January 15, 1999, with the second interest payment on January 15, 2000. The Ref CPI of January 15, 1999 (Ref CPI
IssueDate
) was 164.00000, and the Ref CPI on January 15, 2000 (Ref CPI
Date
) was 168.24516. Calculate the adjusted value and the payment amount at maturity of the interest component.
Definitions:
c = .03875
Par = $1,000,000
Ref CPI
IssueDate
= 164.00000
Ref CPI
Date
= 168.24516
Resolution:
For a par amount of $1 million, the adjusted value of each stripped interest component was $1,000,000(.03875/2)(100/164.00000), or $11,814.02 (no intermediate rounding).
For an interest component that matured on January 15, 2000, the payment amount was $11,814.02 (168.24516/100), or $19,876.52 (no intermediate rounding).

# VI. Computation of Purchase Price, Discount Rate, and Investment Rate (Coupon-Equivalent Yield) for Treasury Bills
A.
Conversion of the discount rate to a purchase price for Treasury bills of all maturities:
Formula:
P = 100 (1 − dr / 360).
Where:
d = discount rate, in decimals.
r = number of days remaining to maturity.
P = price per 100 (dollars).
Example:
For a bill issued November 24, 1989, due February 22, 1990, at a discount rate of 7.610%, solve for price per 100 (P).
Definitions:
d = .07610.
r = 90 (November 24, 1989 to February 22, 1990).
Resolution:
P = 100 (1 − dr / 360).
(1) P = 100 [1 − (.07610)(90) / 360].
(2) P = 100 (1 − .019025).
(3) P = 100 (.980975).
(4) P = 98.097500.

# Note:
Purchase prices per $100 are rounded to six decimal places, using normal rounding procedures.
B.
Computation of purchase prices and discount amounts based on price per $100, for Treasury bills of all maturities:
1. To determine the purchase price of any bill, divide the par amount by 100 and multiply the resulting quotient by the price per $100.
Example:
To compute the purchase price of a $10,000 13-week bill sold at a price of $98.098000 per $100, divide the par amount ($10,000) by 100 to obtain the multiple (100). That multiple times 98.098000 results in a purchase price of $9,809.80.
2. To determine the discount amount for any bill, subtract the purchase price from the par amount of the bill.
Example:
For a $10,000 bill with a purchase price of $9,809.80, the discount amount would be $190.20, or $10,000 − $9,809.80.
C.
Conversion of prices to discount rates for Treasury bills of all maturities:
Formula:
ER02SE04.009
Where:
P = price per 100 (dollars).
d = discount rate.
r = number of days remaining to maturity.
Example:
For a 26-week bill issued December 30, 1982, due June 30, 1983, with a price of $95.934567, solve for the discount rate (d).
Definitions:
P = 95.934567.
r = 182 (December 30, 1982, to June 30, 1983).
Resolution:
ER02SE04.010
(2) d = [.04065433 × 1.978021978].
(3) d = .080415158.
(4) d = 8.042%.

# Note:
Prior to April 18, 1983, we sold all bills in price-basis auctions, in which discount rates calculated from prices were rounded to three places, using normal rounding procedures. Since that time, we have sold bills only on a discount rate basis.
D.
Calculation of investment rate (coupon-equivalent yield) for Treasury bills:
1.
For bills of not more than one half-year to maturity:
Formula:
ER02SE04.011
Where:
i = investment rate, in decimals.
P = price per 100 (dollars).
r = number of days remaining to maturity.
y = number of days in year following the issue date; normally 365, but if the period from the issue date to the same date 1 year ahead contains February 29, then y is 366. (e.g., 2020 is a leap year. Suppose the issue date for a 26-week bill is February 28, 2019. The date 1 year ahead is February 28, 2020. That 1-year period from the issue date of the bill does not contain “February 29,” therefore y = 365. Now suppose the issue date of a 26-week bill is March 1, 2019. The date 1 year ahead is March 1, 2020. That 1-year period from the issue date of the bill contains “February 29,” therefore y = 366.)
Example:
For a cash management bill issued June 1, 1990, due June 21, 1990, with a price of $99.559444 (computed from a discount rate of 7.930%), solve for the investment rate (i).
Definitions:
P = 99.559444.
r = 20 (June 1, 1990, to June 21, 1990).
y = 365.
Resolution:
ER02SE04.012
(2) i = [.004425 × 18.25].
(3) i = .080756.
(4) i = 8.076%.
2. For bills of more than one half-year to maturity:
Formula:
P [1 + (r − y/2)(i/y)] (1 + i/2) = 100.
This formula must be solved by using the quadratic equation, which is:
ax
2
+ bx + c = 0.
Therefore, rewriting the bill formula in the quadratic equation form gives:
ER02SE04.013
and solving for “i” produces:
ER02SE04.014
Where:
i = investment rate in decimals.
b = r/y.
a = (r/2y) − .25.
c = (P−100)/P.
P = price per 100 (dollars).
r = number of days remaining to maturity.
y = number of days in year following the issue date; normally 365, but if the period from the issue date to the same date 1 year ahead contains February 29, then y is 366. (e.g., 2020 is a leap year. Suppose the issue date for a 26-week bill is February 28, 2019. The date 1 year ahead is February 28, 2020. That 1-year period from the issue date of the bill does not contain “February 29,” therefore y = 365. Now suppose the issue date of a 26-week bill is March 1, 2019. The date 1 year ahead is March 1, 2020. That 1-year period from the issue date of the bill contains “February 29,” therefore y = 366.)
Example:
For a 52-week bill issued June 7, 1990, due June 6, 1991, with a price of $92.265000 (computed from a discount rate of 7.65%), solve for the investment rate (i).
Definitions:
r = 364 (June 7, 1990, to June 6, 1991).
y = 365.
P = 92.265000.
b = 364 / 365, or .997260274.
a = (364 / 730) − .25, or .248630137.
c = (92.265 − 100) / 92.265, or −.083834607.
Resolution:
ER02SE04.015
(3) i = (−.997260274 + 1.038221216) / .497260274.
(4) i = .040960942 / .497260274.
(5) i = .082373244 or
(6) i = 8.237%.

# Appendix C to Part 356—Investment Considerations

# I. Inflation-Protected Securities

# A. Principal and Interest Variability
An investment in securities with principal or interest determined by reference to an inflation index involves factors not associated with an investment in a non-indexed security. Such factors include the possibility that:
• The inflation index may be subject to significant changes,
• changes in the index may or may not correlate to changes in interest rates generally or with changes in other indices,
• the resulting interest may be greater or less than that payable on other securities of similar maturities, and
• in the event of sustained deflation, the amount of the semiannual interest payments, the inflation-adjusted principal of the security, and the value of stripped components will decrease. However, if at maturity the inflation-adjusted principal is less than a security's par amount, we will pay an additional amount so that the additional amount plus the inflation-adjusted principal equals the par amount. Regardless of whether or not we pay such an additional amount, we will always base interest payments on the inflation-adjusted principal as of the interest payment date. If a security has been stripped, we will pay any such additional amount at maturity to holders of principal components only. (See § 356.30.)

# B. Trading in the Secondary Market
The Treasury securities market is the largest and most liquid securities market in the world. The market for Treasury inflation-protected securities, however, may not be as active or liquid as the market for Treasury non-indexed securities. In addition, Treasury inflation-protected securities may not be as widely traded or as well understood as Treasury non-indexed securities. Lesser liquidity and fewer market participants may result in larger spreads between bid and asked prices for inflation-protected securities than the bid-asked spreads for non-indexed securities with the same time to maturity. Larger bid-asked spreads normally result in higher transaction costs and/or lower overall returns. The liquidity of an inflation-protected security may be enhanced over time as we issue additional amounts or more entities participate in the market.

# C. Tax Considerations
Treasury inflation-protected securities and the stripped interest and principal components of these securities are subject to specific tax rules provided by Treasury regulations issued under sections 1275(d) and 1286 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

# D. Indexing Issues
While the Consumer Price Index (“CPI”) measures changes in prices for goods and services, movements in the CPI that have occurred in the past do not necessarily indicate changes that may occur in the future.
The calculation of the index ratio incorporates an approximate three-month lag, which may have an impact on the trading price of the securities, particularly during periods of significant, rapid changes in the index.
The CPI is reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, a bureau within the Department of Labor. The Bureau of Labor Statistics operates independently of Treasury and, therefore, we have no control over the determination, calculation, or publication of the index. For a discussion of how we will apply the CPI in various situations, see appendix B, section I, paragraph B of this part. In addition, for a discussion of actions that we would take in the event the CPI is: discontinued; in the judgment of the Secretary, fundamentally altered in a manner materially adverse to the interests of an investor in the security; or, in the judgment of the Secretary, altered by legislation or Executive Order in a manner materially adverse to the interests of an investor in the security, see appendix B, section I, paragraph B.4 of this part.

# II. Floating Rate Notes

# A. Interest Variability
An investment in securities with interest determined by reference to a 13-week Treasury bill index involves risks not associated with an investment in a fixed interest rate security. Such risks include the possibility that:
• Changes in the index may or may not correlate to changes in interest rates generally or with changes in other indexes;
• any given interest payment may be more or less than the amount paid on prior interest payment dates;
• the resulting interest payments may be greater or less than those payable on other securities of similar maturities, and
• in the event of sustained falling interest rates, the amount of the quarterly interest payments will decrease.

# B. Trading in the Secondary Market
The Treasury securities market is the largest and most liquid securities market in the world. The market for Treasury floating rate notes, however, may not be as active or liquid as the market for Treasury non-indexed securities or Treasury inflation-protected securities. In addition, Treasury floating rate notes may not be as widely traded or as well understood as these other types of Treasury marketable securities. Prices for floating rate notes may not fluctuate in reaction to interest rate movements in the same manner as other Treasury securities. Lesser liquidity and fewer market participants may result in larger spreads between bid and asked prices for Treasury floating rate notes than the bid-asked spreads for other Treasury marketable securities with the same time to maturity. Larger bid-asked spreads normally result in higher transaction costs and/or lower overall returns. The liquidity of a Treasury floating rate note may be enhanced over time as we issue additional amounts or more entities participate in the market.

# C. Tax Considerations
Treasury floating rate notes are subject to specific tax rules provided by Treasury regulations issued under section 1275(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

# D. Indexing Issues
The Bureau of the Fiscal Service publishes the High Rate immediately following a 13-week bill auction as part of the auction results. The 13-week bill is generally auctioned once per week. Treasury retains the flexibility to increase or decrease the frequency of 13-week bill auctions, which would affect the frequency of index rate resets. The High Rate is subject to various interest rate and market environments over which Treasury has no control. For a discussion of actions that Treasury would take in the event auctions of 13-week bills are discontinued or delayed, see appendix B, section I, paragraph C.4 of this part.

Pt. 356, App. D

# Appendix D to Part 356—Description of the Indexes

# I. Consumer Price Index
The Consumer Price Index (“CPI”) for purposes of inflation-protected securities is the non-seasonally adjusted U.S. City Average All Items Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers. It is published monthly by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), a bureau within the Department of Labor. The CPI is a measure of the average change in consumer prices over time in a fixed market basket of goods and services. This market basket includes food, clothing, shelter, fuels, transportation, charges for doctors' and dentists' services, and drugs.
In calculating the index, price changes for the various items are averaged together with weights that represent their importance in the spending of urban households in the United States. The BLS periodically updates the contents of the market basket of goods and services, and the weights assigned to the various items, to take into account changes in consumer expenditure patterns.
The CPI is expressed in relative terms in relation to a time base reference period for which the level is set at 100. For example, if the CPI for the 1982-84 reference period is 100.0, an increase of 16.5 percent from that period would be shown as 116.5. The CPI for a particular month is released and published during the following month. From time to time, the CPI is rebased to a more recent base reference period. We provide the base reference period for a particular inflation-protected security on the auction announcement for that security.
Further details about the CPI may be obtained by contacting the BLS.

# II. Floating Rate Note Index
The floating rate note index is the 13-week Treasury bill auction High Rate (stop out rate), and converted to the simple-interest money market yield computed on an actual/360 basis.

A Treasury security is maintained in Legacy Treasury Direct if it is credited to a Legacy Treasury Direct account as described in § 357.20 of this part. Treasury securities are held directly by the Department of the Treasury in accounts maintained in the investor's name. A Legacy Treasury Direct account may be accessed through a designated Federal Reserve Bank or the Bureau of the Fiscal Service. See subpart C of this part for rules pertaining to Legacy Treasury Direct.
(3)
TreasuryDirect
®. TreasuryDirect is a book-entry, online system maintained by the Department of the Treasury for purchasing and holding eligible marketable Treasury securities, United States Savings Bonds, and certificates of indebtedness in electronic form as a computer record on the books of Treasury. The regulations governing TreasuryDirect are found at 31 CFR part 363.
(b)
Transferability between Legacy Treasury Direct and other systems.
A Treasury security maintained in Legacy Treasury Direct may be transferred to an account in TRADES or to an account in TreasuryDirect in accordance with § 357.22(a). Securities may not be transferred to Legacy Treasury Direct from other systems.

(4) Upon the determination on December 31 that an owner has not received a statement of account for that current calendar year.
The statement shall contain information regarding the account as of the date of such statement. The price associated with each security in the securities portfolio will also appear on the statement.
1
The statement may be sent to the correspondence address designated in the account master record, or may be sent by electronic means. When the statement is issued as a result of a change in ownership of a security, statements will be sent, where appropriate, to both the former and current owners. Other information regarding the account may be obtained in accordance with § 357.24.
1
IRS regulations require reporting of income information on a security.
(1) If the security is a bill, the price information will be used to comply with this requirement. The earnings reported to IRS for the year of a bill's maturity will be the difference between the par value of the bill and its price.
(a) If a bill was deposited in Legacy Treasury Direct at original issue, the price shown will be the issue price.
(b) If a bill was transferred to Legacy Treasury Direct from TRADES, the price shown will be that included in the transfer wire or supplied subsequently by the bill owner. If a price was not furnished, the price shown will be the weighted average price of the bill of the longest maturity having the identical CUSIP number.
(c) If a bill is transferred from one Legacy Treasury Direct account to another, the price shown in the receiving (transferee's) account will be that shown on the transfer instructions or supplied subsequently by the transferee. If a price is not furnished, the price shown will be the weighted average price at original issue of the bill of the longest maturity having the identical CUSIP number, unless the term of the bill can be determined from the account record in which case the price shown will be the weighted average price at original issue of the bill with that term.
(2) If the security is a note or bond, the earnings reported to IRS for a year will be the periodic interest payments made during that year. If a note or bond is transferred to a Legacy Treasury Direct account between interest payment dates, the earnings reported to IRS for the transferee will show the interest for the entire interest payment period. The price for notes and bonds will be shown on the statement of account for the account owner's information. The price shown will be determined following the procedures described above for bills.
(3) The security owner should report directly to the IRS (a) adjustments to annual earnings amounts arising from acquisition of notes and bonds between interest payment periods and (b) price corrections for bills reported after preparation of the reports to the IRS.
(f)
Confirmation notice.
The Department shall send a confirmation notice (notice):
(1) Upon a change in an account master record;
(2) Upon scheduling or canceling a reinvestment; or
(3) To confirm the interest earned on a Treasury Inflation Indexed Security. The notice shall contain information regarding the account as of the date of such confirmation. The notice may be sent to the correspondence address designated in the account master record, or may be sent by electronic means. All changes reflected in paragraph (f) (1) and (2) of this section will be included in the next regularly scheduled statement of account. See paragraph (e) of this section for the statement schedule.
(g)
Account maintenance fees.
An annual maintenance fee shall be charged for each Legacy Treasury Direct securities account holding securities that in the aggregate exceed a stipulated par amount. The amount of the fee will be published by notice in the
Federal Register.
(h)
Closing an account.
If a Legacy Treasury Direct account has no holdings, we reserve the right to close the account.

§ 357.21
Registration.
(a)
General.
(1) Registration of a security conclusively establishes ownership, except in the case of partnership nominees, in which case the Department reserves the right to treat the registration as conclusive of ownership. The registration may not, except as provided in this subpart, include any restriction on the authority of an owner to change the data in the account master record, transfer the security, or effect any other change in the securities portfolio.
(2) The registration of all securities held by an owner should be uniform with respect to the owner's name. An owner must be identified by the name by which the owner is ordinarily known, preferably including at least one full given name. A suffix, such as
Sr.
or
Jr.,
must be included when ordinarily used, or when necessary to distinguish members of the same family.
(3) If an additional security is deposited in an existing account, the security will be registered in the same name and form of registration that appears in the designated account master record. One who holds a security as
John Allen Doe
should use that name when depositing another security rather than
J. Allen Doe,
or
John A. Doe'. Minor variations in names used in acquiring a security to be deposited in an established account may be resolved by the Department.
(b)
Natural persons.
A security may be registered in the names of one or two individuals, but only in one of the following forms:
(1)
Single ownership.
In the name of one individual.

# Example:
Robert W. Woods
An individual who is sole proprietor of a business conducted under a trade name may include a reference to the trade name.

# Example:
John A. Doe, doing business as Doe's Home Appliance Store.
(2)
Ownership by two individuals
—(i)
“And” form—Joint Ownership
—(A)
Without right of survivorship.
In the names of two individuals, joined by the word “and”, and followed by the words “without right of survivorship”. A security so registered shall conclusively confer on each owner an undivided interest in the security.

# Example:
Elizabeth Black and Jane Brown, without right of survivorship.
Any registration which purports, by its terms, to preclude the right of survivorship, or any registration in the names of two persons without indicating whether survivorship rights attach (other than a registration under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section), will be presumed to be ownership without right of survivorship. If a security is registered in this form, a transaction request, other than a request by one owner to transfer the security to the other owner, and other than a request for reinvestment, must be executed by both owners.
(B)
With right of survivorship.
In the names of two individuals, joined by the word “and”, and followed by the words “with right of survivorship”. A security so registered shall confer on each owner an undivided interest in the security and shall create a conclusive right of survivorship.

# Example:
Mark A. Doe and Mary B. Doe, with right of survivorship.
If a security is registered in this form, a transaction request, other than a request by one owner to transfer the security to the other owner, and other than a request for reinvestment, must be executed by both owners.
(ii)
“Or” form—“Coownership”.
In the names of two individuals, joined by the word “or”. A security so registered shall confer on each owner an undivided interest in the security and shall create a conclusive right of survivorship.

# Example:
Robert Woods or Laura Woods.
If a security is registered in this form, either coowner may make a transaction request, but if the Department receives conflicting requests at or about the same time, it may refuse to process them.
(iii)
Beneficiary.
In the name of one individual followed by the words “Payable on death to” (or “P.O.D.”) another individual.

# Example:
Jack S. Jones, payable on death to Marie Jones.
If a minor or an incompetent is named as a beneficiary, the status of the beneficiary must be identified in the registration. A minor or an incompetent may not be designated as an owner. See paragraphs (b)(3) and (4) of this section.

# Example:
John Perry, P.O.D. John Perry, Jr., a minor.
Registration in this form shall create ownership rights in the beneficiary only if the beneficiary survives the owner. During an owner's lifetime, a transaction request may be executed
by the owner without the consent of the beneficiary. If the beneficiary dies before the owner, the security will be deemed to be registered in the owner's name alone.
(3)
Minors
—(i)
General.
A security may not be registered in the name of a minor in his or her own right as an owner. If a security is so registered and the Department thereafter receives evidence or information of that fact, the Department may suspend processing of any transaction request with respect to the security until either a legal guardian has been appointed or a natural guardian, as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, has been recognized. Where a legal guardian is appointed, the Department will require a certified copy of the court order making such appointment. See § 357.28(c).
(ii)
Natural guardians of minors.
A security may be registered in the name of a natural guardian of a minor for whose estate no legal representative has been appointed. The parent with whom the minor resides will be recognized as the natural guardian. If the minor resides with both parents, either or both may be recognized as natural guardian(s). If the minor does not reside with either parent, the Department may recognize the person who furnishes the minor's chief support as the natural guardian.

# Examples:
Michael Jones, as natural guardian of Alice Jones, a minor.
Michael Jones and Evelyn Jones, as natural guardians of Alice Jones, a minor.
The security may also be registered in one of the forms authorized under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

# Examples:
James Green, as natural guardian of William Green, a minor, and Anne Green, without right of survivorship.
James Green, as natural guardian of William Green, a minor, POD Lynne Green.
(iii)
Custodian under statute authorizing gifts to minors.
A security may be registered as provided under an applicable gift to minors statute.

# Example:
Virginia McDonald, as custodian for Lynne Gorman, under the New York Uniform Gifts to Minors Act.
Any request to alter the rights of ownership of the security must be made as provided in the applicable statute.
(4)
Incompetents
—(i)
General.
A security may not be registered in the name of an individual in his or her own right as an owner if that individual is incompetent. If a security is so registered, or if the owner subsequently becomes incompetent after the security is purchased, and the Department receives evidence or information of that fact, the Department may suspend any transaction with respect to the security until a legal guardian, conservator, or other representative of the incompetent's estate has been appointed, or a voluntary guardian, as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, has been recognized. Where a legal guardian, conservator, or other representative is appointed, the Department will require a certified copy of the court order making such appointment. See § 357.28(c).
(ii)
Voluntary guardian of incompetent.
If a legal guardian has not been appointed, and the face amount of the securities held in one or more accounts in Legacy Treasury Direct ® by an owner who had become incompetent does not exceed, in the aggregate, $20,000 (par amount), upon submission to, and approval by, the Department of an appropriate form, a relative or other person responsible for an incompetent's care and support will be recognized as voluntary guardian for purpose of making a transaction request under § 357.28(b)(4). All persons known by the Department to have an interest in the incompetent's estate, as required by the application form, must agree to the designation of the voluntary guardian. The security may be re-registered in the name of the voluntary guardian.

# Example:
Richard Melrose, as voluntary guardian for James W. Brundige.
(c)
Representatives.
A security may be registered in the name of a representative of an estate. If there is more than one representative, the names of some representatives may be omitted if followed by language that indicates the existence of other representatives. In such cases, those named in the registration shall be conclusively presumed by the Department to have authority to make a transaction request on behalf of all the representatives. The form of registration must identify
the specific capacity of the representative(s) and the estate represented.

# Examples:
ABC National Bank of Chicago, Illinois and Harold Smith, co-executors of the will (or administrators of the estate) of Charles Johnson, deceased.
William Brown, guardian of the estate of Henry Jones, a minor.
Robert Smith, Richard Smith,
et al.,
executors of the will of Lorraine Smith, deceased.
If the representative is a trustee, the form of registration must identify specifically the authority or document creating the trust.

# Examples:
Sarah Jones and XYZ Trust Co., trustees under the will of Matthew Smith, deceased.
Cynthia Doe and Margaret Jones, trustees under agreement with Martha Roe, dated April 13, 1979.
Cynthia Doe, trustee under declaration of trust, dated April 13, 1979.
Richard Smith, James Jones, and Frank Brown, trustees under the will of Henry K. James, deceased.
ABC Corporation, Myrna Banker,
et al.,
trustees of Profit-Sharing Plan of Ace Manufacturing Co., under B/D resolution, dated May 18, 1975.
If there are several trustees designated as a board or authorized to act as a unit, their names should be omitted and the words, “Board of Trustees” substituted.

# Example:
Board of Trustees of Super Co. Retirement Fund, under collective bargaining agreement, dated March 18, 1969.
An organization (other than a bank) or individual seeking to act as trustee or custodian of an Individual Retirement Account (“IRA”), must be authorized to so act by the Internal Revenue Service. As appropriate, registration of the security should be in the form shown below:

# Examples:
ABC Bank, trustee for John Doe IRA, under agreement dated December 21, 1990.
EFG Broker, Inc., custodian for Mary Smith IRA, under agreement dated September 4, 1991.
(d)
Private organizations (corporations, unincorporated associations and partnerships).
A security may be registered in the name of a private corporation, unincorporated association, or partnership. The full legal name of the organization, as set forth in its charter, articles of incorporation, constitution, partnership agreement, or other documents from which its powers are derived, must be included in the registration. The name may be followed by a reference to a particular account or fund, other than a trust fund, such as an escrow account.
(1)
A corporation.
The legal name of a business, fraternal, religious, or other private corporation must be followed by descriptive words indicating the corporate status unless the term
corporation
or the abbreviation
Inc.
is part of the name or the name is that of a corporation or association organized under Federal law, such as a national bank or Federal savings and loan association.

# Examples:
Brown Manufacturing Co., a corporation (Education Fund).
The Apex Manufacturing Corporation.
XYZ National Bank of El Paso, TX.
Goodworks, Unlimited, a not-for-profit corporation.
(2)
An unincorporated association.
Unless the name of a lodge, club, labor union, veterans or religious organization, or similar organization which is not incorporated (whether or not it is chartered by or affiliated with a parent organization which is incorporated) includes the words
an unincorporated association,
the registration must include descriptive words indicating the organization's unincorporated status. A security may not be registered in the name of an unincorporated association if the legal title to its property or the legal title to the funds with which the security is to be purchased is held by trustees. In such a case, the security should be registered in the name of the trustees in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. The term
unincorporated association
should not be used to describe a trust fund, a partnership or a business conducted under a trade name.

# Examples:
Local Union No. 13, Brotherhood of Operating Engineers, an unincorporated association.
The Simpson Society, an unincorporated association.
(3)
Partnership.
Unless the name of a partnership includes the word
partnership,
the registration must include descriptive words indicating partnership status.

# Examples:
Red
Blue, a partnership.
Abco and Co., a nominee partnership.
(e)
Governmental entities and officers.
A security may be registered in the name of a State, county, city, town, village, school district, or other governmental entity, body, or corporation established by law. If a governmental officer is authorized to act as a trustee or custodian, a security may be registered in the title, or name and title, of the governmental officer. The form of registration should reflect the capacity in which the governmental entity or officer is authorized to hold property (e.g., it may be authorized to hold property in its own name or as trustee or custodian).

# Examples:
Laura Woods, Treasurer, City of Twin Falls, Mo.
State of Michigan.
Village of Gaithersburg, Md.
Pennsylvania State Highway Administration (Highway Road Repair Fund).
Insurance Commissioner of Florida, trustee for benefit of policy holders of Sunshine Insurance Co. under F.S.A. Sec. 629.104.
Commonwealth of Virginia, in trust for Virginia Surplus Property Agency.
Gleason County Cemetery Commission, trustee under Md. Code Ann. Sec. 310.29.
(f)
The United States Treasury.
A security may be registered in the name of an individual, with the United States Treasury as beneficiary, provided a reference to the statute which authorizes gifts to be made to the United States to reduce the public debt, is included.

# Example:
John S. Green, payable on death [or P.O.D.] to U.S. Treasury to reduce the public debt (31 U.S.C. 3113).

§ 357.22
Transfers.
(a)
General.
A security may be transferred only as authorized by this part. A security may be transferred from an account in Legacy Treasury Direct® to an account in the commercial book-entry system or to an account in TreasuryDirect®. A security may also be transferred between accounts in
Legacy Treasury Direct.
The Department may delay transfer of a newly purchased security from a Legacy Treasury Direct account to an account in commercial book entry or TreasuryDirect for a period not to exceed (30) calendar days from the date of issue. This provides time for the investor to become aware of any unauthorized debits.
(1)
Identification of securities to be transferred.
The owner must identify the securities to be transferred, in the manner required by the transaction request. If such identification is not provided, the request will not be processed and will be returned.
(2)
Denominational amounts.
A security may be transferred from an account only in a denominational amount authorized by the offering under which the security was issued. Any security remaining in the securities portfolio after the transfer must also be in an authorized denominational amount.
(3)
When transfer effective
—(i)
Transfer within Legacy Treasury Direct.
A transfer of a security within Legacy Treasury Direct is effective when an appropriate entry is made in the name of the transferee on the Legacy Treasury Direct records.
(ii)
Transfer from Legacy Treasury Direct to the commercial book-entry system.
A transfer of a security from Legacy Treasury Direct to the commercial book-entry system is effective as provided in subpart B. If a transfer cannot be completed, and the security is sent back to Legacy Treasury Direct, the Department will redeposit the security in the original account.
(iii)
Transfer from Legacy Treasury Direct to TreasuryDirect.
A transfer of a security from Legacy Treasury Direct to TreasuryDirect is effective as provided in 31 CFR part 363. If the transfer cannot be completed, the Department will redeposit the security in the original account.
(b)
Transfer upon death of an owner
—(1)
Right of survivorship.
If a security is registered in beneficiary form or a
form which provides for a right of survivorship, upon the death of an owner, the beneficiary or survivor shall be the sole and absolute owner, notwithstanding any purported testamentary disposition by the decedent and notwithstanding any State or other law to the contrary. The Department will honor a transaction request by a beneficiary or a survivor (in the case of a security registered in the form described in § 357.21(b)(2)(i)(B)) only upon proof of death of an owner.
(2)
Succession under law of domicile.
If a security is registered in a form that does not provide for a right of survivorship, succession shall be determined in accordance with the applicable law of the deceased owner's domicile at the time of death.
(c)
Representative succession.
If a security is registered in the name of a representative who has died, resigned, or been removed, succession shall be determined in accordance with applicable law and the terms of the document under which the representative was acting.
(d)
Organizational succession
—(1)
Corporation and unincorporated association.
If a security is registered in the name of a corporation or an unincorporated association that has been dissolved, merged or consolidated into another organization, succession shall be determined in accordance with applicable law and the terms of the documents by which the dissolution, merger, or consolidation was effected.
(2)
Partnership.
If a partnership is dissolved or terminated, succession shall be determined in accordance with applicable law and the terms of the partnership agreement.
(e)
Succession of governmental officer.

Judicial proceedings—sovereign immunity.
(a)
Department and Federal Reserve Banks not proper parties.
The Department and the Federal Reserve Banks are not proper defendants in a judicial proceeding involving competing claims to a security held in Legacy Treasury Direct ® nor are they subject to any injunction or restraining order issued with respect to a security. The Department will not recognize a notice of a pending or contemplated judicial or administrative proceeding affecting a security in Legacy Treasury Direct.
(b)
Orders
—(1)
Ownership rights.
The Department will recognize a final order entered by a court that affects ownership rights in a security in Legacy Treasury Direct if:

(2)
Transaction request.
The Department will honor a transaction request submitted by a person appointed by a court and having authority under an order of a court to dispose of the security or payment with respect thereto if:
(i) The ordered disposition of the security or payments with respect thereto is consistent with the provisions of this subpart and the terms and conditions of the security; and
(ii) The Department has received evidence of the appointment and order, as provided in paragraph (c) of this section.
(c)
Evidence required.
Before the Department will recognize an order or determination entered by a court, the Department must have received a certified copy of the judgment, decree, or order and any additional documents deemed necessary by the Department. A certificate from the clerk of the court, bearing the seal of the court, must also be submitted stating that the judgment, decree, or order is still in full force and has not been stayed or appealed, and that the time for filing an appeal has passed. Before the Department will honor a transaction request submitted by a person appointed
by a court, the Department must receive a certified copy of the order making the appointment and describing specifically the person's authority, and any additional documents deemed necessary by the Department.

§ 357.25
Security interests.
(a)
General.
The Department will not recognize any notice or claim of a lien, encumbrance, or security interest of any kind, including a pledge, in a security in Legacy Treasury Direct ® except as provided in § 357.23 and in paragraph (b) of this section.
(b)
Security for the performance of duty or obligation under Federal law.
The Department will accept and hold pursuant to the provisions of 31 U.S.C. 9303, book-entry bonds, notes or bills submitted in lieu of a surety bond as security for the performance of a duty or obligation required by Federal law in accordance with said section.
§ 357.26
Direct Deposit.
(a)
General.
A payment by the Department with respect to a security shall be by direct deposit unless it is deemed necessary by the Department to make payment by another means. Direct Deposit payments are governed by the regulations at 31 CFR part 370.
(b)
Names on account.
Where the Legacy Treasury Direct ® securities account is in the name of individual(s) in their own right, and the deposit account at the financial institution is in the name of individual(s) in their own right, the two accounts must contain at least one name that is common to both.
(c)
Inquiry to financial institution.
Where the deposit account to which payments are to be directed is held in the name of the financial institution itself acting as sole trustee, or as co-trustee, or is in the name of a commercially-managed investment fund, particular inquiry should first be made of the financial institution to make certain that the direct deposit payments can be received, and alternate arrangements made if it cannot do so.
(d)
Payments to master account.
All payments relating to a single account master record must be made to the same designated account at a financial institution.
(e)
Deposit account.
The deposit account to which payments are directed should preferably be established in a form identical to the registration of the securities account, particularly where the securities are registered jointly or with right of survivorship, to assure that the rights of ownership and of survivorship can be more easily identified and preserved. Neither the United States nor any Federal Reserve Bank shall be liable for any loss sustained because the interests of the holder(s) of a deposit account to which payments are made are not the same as the interests of the owner(s) of the security.

§ 357.27
Reinvestment.
(a)
General.
Upon the request of an owner, the redemption proceeds of a security may be reinvested at maturity in a new security in the same form of registration, provided a new security is then being offered by the Department and provision for reinvestment is made in the offering. The new security must be in an authorized denominational amount and will be issued in accordance with the terms of the offering. If the new security is issued at a premium or with accrued interest, an additional payment will be required from the investor. If the new security is issued at a discount, the difference will be remitted to the owner.
(b)
Treasury bills.
A request by an owner for a single or successive reinvestment of a Treasury bill must be made in accordance with the terms prescribed on the tender form submitted at the time of purchase of the original bill, or by a subsequent transaction request received not less than ten (10) business days prior to the maturity date of the bill. A request to revoke a direction to reinvest the proceeds of a bill must be received by the Department not less than ten (10) business days prior to the maturity date of the bill. If either a request for reinvestment or revocation of a reinvestment request is received less than ten (10) business days prior to maturity of the original bill, the Department may in its discretion act on such request if sufficient time remains for processing.
(c)
Issue date not coincidental with maturity date.
If the date on which a security matures or is called does not coincide with the issue date of the security being purchased through reinvestment, the Department may, at its option, hold the redemption proceeds in the same form of registration as the maturing or called security, but no interest shall accrue or be paid on such funds.

§ 357.28
Transaction requests.
(a)
General.
Unless otherwise authorized by the Department, a transaction request must be submitted on a transaction request form. In the case of certain transactions specified by the Department, the owner's signature on the form must be certified or guaranteed, as provided in § 357.31. If the transaction request form is received more than six (6) months after its execution, it will not be honored by the Department and will be returned to the sender for further instructions.
(b)
Individuals
—(1)
General.
A transaction request must be signed by the owner of the security. In addition to any required certification, a transaction request form executed by a person by mark, e.g., “(X)”, must be witnessed by a disinterested person. The following language should be added to the form and be signed by the witness:
Witness to signature by mark
Signature of witness
Address of witness
(2)
Change of name.
If an individual's name has been changed from that appearing in the registration, the individual should sign both names to the transaction request form and state the manner in which the change occurred.

# Example:
Deborah L. Gains, changed by order of court from Deborah G. O'Brien.
The individual must provide evidence, such as a certified copy of a court order, which confirms the change, unless it is indicated that the change of name resulted from marriage.

# Example:
Catherine M. Cole, changed by marriage from Catherine T. Murray.
(3)
Natural guardians.
A transaction request involving a security registered in the name of a natural guardian of a minor may be executed by the natural guardian. If a security is registered in the names of both parents as natural guardians of a minor, both must execute a transaction request. However, the Department will not honor a transaction request by the natural guardian(s):
(i) Which would transfer the security to a natural guardian in his or her own right; or
(ii) After the Department receives notice of the minor's attainment of majority, the qualification of a legal
guardian or similar representative, or the death of the minor.
(4)
Voluntary guardians.
A transaction request involving a security belonging to an owner who has become incompetent may be executed by a voluntary guardian, but only after approval by the Department of the voluntary guardian's application for such designation. However, the Department will not honor a transaction request by the voluntary guardian:
(i) Which would transfer the security to a voluntary guardian in his or her own right; or
(ii) After the Department receives notice of the ward's restoration to competency, the qualification of a legal guardian or similar representative, or the death of the ward. See § 357.21(b)(4).
(c)
Representatives
—(1)
General.
Any representative of an owner's estate, other than a trustee, may execute a transaction request form if the representative submits to the Department properly authenticated evidence of the authority to act. The evidence will not be accepted if dated more than one year prior to the date of submission of the transaction request.
(2)
Decedent's estate has been settled previously.
If a decedent's estate has been settled previously through judicial proceedings, the persons entitled may make a transaction request. A certified copy of the court-approved final accounting for the estate, the court's decree of distribution, or other appropriate evidence will be required.
(3)
Special provisions under the law of the jurisdiction of the decedent's domicile.
If there is no formal or regular administration and no representative of the decedent's estate is to be appointed, the person appointed to receive or distribute the assets of a decedent's estate without regular administration under applicable local law summary or small estates procedures may make a transaction request. Appropriate evidence will be required.
(4)
When administration is required.
If the total redemption value of the Treasury securities and undelivered payments, if any, held directly on our records that are the property of the decedent's estate is greater than $100,000, administration of the decedent's estate will be required. The redemption value of savings bonds and the principal amount of marketable securities will be used to determine the value of securities, and will be determined as of the date of death. Administration may also be required at the discretion of the Department for any case.
(5)
Voluntary representative for small estates of decedents that are not being otherwise administered
—(i)
General.
A voluntary representative is a person qualified according to paragraph (c)(5)(iii) of this section, to make a transaction request. The voluntary representative procedures are for the convenience of the Department; entitlement to the decedent's securities and held payments, if any, is determined by the law of the jurisdiction in which the decedent was domiciled at the date of death. Voluntary representative procedures may be used only if:
(A) There has been no administration, no administration is contemplated, and no summary or small estate procedures under applicable local law have been used;
(B) The total redemption value of the Treasury securities and held payments, if any, that are the property of the decedent's estate is $100,000 or less as of the date of death; and
(C) There is a person eligible to serve as the voluntary representative according to paragraph (c)(5)(iii) of this section.
(ii)
Authority of voluntary representative.
A voluntary representative may make a transaction request to distribute the securities to or for the benefit of the persons entitled by laws of the jurisdiction in which the decedent was domiciled at the date of death.
(iii)
Order of precedence for voluntary representative.
An individual eighteen years of age or older may act as a voluntary representative according to the following order of precedence: A surviving spouse; if there is no surviving spouse, then a child of the decedent; if there are none of the above, then a descendant of a deceased child of the decedent; if there are none of the above, then a parent of the decedent; if there are none of the above, then a brother or sister of the decedent; if there are none of the above, then a descendant of
a deceased brother or sister of the decedent; if there are none of the above, then a next of kin of the decedent, as determined by the law of the jurisdiction in which the decedent was domiciled at the date of death. As used in this order of precedence, child means a natural or adopted child of the decedent.
(iv)
Liability.
By serving, the voluntary representative warrants that the distribution of securities or proceeds is to or on behalf of the persons entitled by the law of the jurisdiction in which the decedent was domiciled at the date of death. The United States is not liable to any person for the improper distribution of securities or proceeds. Upon distribution of the securities or proceeds at the request of the voluntary representative, the United States is released to the same extent as if it had paid or delivered to a representative of the estate appointed pursuant to the law of the jurisdiction in which the decedent was domiciled at the date of death. The voluntary representative shall indemnify and hold harmless the United States and all creditors and persons entitled to the estate of the decedent. The amount of the indemnification is limited to an amount no greater than the value received by the voluntary representative.
(v)
Creditor.
If there has been no administration, no administration is contemplated, no summary or small estate procedures under applicable local law have been used, and there is no person eligible to serve as a voluntary representative pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section, then a creditor may make a claim for payment of the amount of the debt, providing the debt has not been barred by applicable local law.
(d)
Private organizations
—(1)
Corporations and unincorporated associations.
A transaction request involving a security registered in the name of a corporation or an unincorporated association (either in its own right or in a representative capacity), may be executed by an authorized person on its behalf. The request must be supported by evidence of the person's authority to act.
(2)
Partnerships.
A transaction request involving a security registered in the name of a partnership must be executed by a general partner.
(e)
Government entities.
A transaction request involving a security registered in the name of a State, county, city, school district, or other governmental entity, public body or corporation, must be executed by an authorized officer of the entity. The request must be supported by evidence of the officer's authority to act.
(f)
Public officers.
A transaction request involving a security registered in the title of a public officer must be executed by the officer. The request must be supported by evidence of incumbency.
(g)
Attorneys-in-fact.
A transaction request made by an attorney-in-fact must be accompanied by the original power of attorney or a properly authenticated copy. A power of attorney must be executed in the presence of a notary public or a certifying individual. See § 357.31. The power of attorney will not be accepted if it was executed more than two (2) years before the date the transaction request was executed, unless the power provides that the authority of the attorney-in-fact continues notwithstanding the incapacity of the principal. If two or more attorneys-in-fact are named, all must execute the transaction request unless the power authorizes fewer than all to act. A transaction request executed by an attorney-in-fact seeking transfer of a security to the attorney-in-fact will not be accepted unless expressly authorized by the document appointing the attorney-in-fact.

§ 357.29
Time required for processing transaction request.
For purposes of a transaction request affecting payment instructions with respect to a security, a proper request must be received not less than ten (10) business days preceding the next payment date. If a transaction request is received less than ten (10) business days preceding a payment date, the Department may in its discretion act on such request if sufficient time remains

(c)
Duties and liabilities of certifying individuals
—(1)
General.
Except as specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, a certifying individual shall require that the transaction request form be signed in the certifying individual's presence after he or she has established the identity of the person seeking the certification. An employee who is not an officer should insert the words “Authorized signature” in the space provided for the title. A certifying individual and the organization for which he or she is acting are jointly and severally liable for any loss the United States may incur as a result of the individual's negligence in making the certification.
(2)
Signature guaranteed.
The transaction request form need not be executed in the presence of a certifying individual if he or she unqualifiedly guarantees the signature, in which case the certifying individual shall, after the signature, add the following endorsement: “Signature guaranteed, First National Bank of Smithville, Smithville, NH, by A.B. Doe, President”, and add the date. In guaranteeing a signature, the certifying individual and the organization for which he or she is acting warrant to the Department that the signature is genuine and that the signer had the legal capacity to execute the transaction request.
(3)
Absence of signature guaranteed by depository institution.
A transaction request form need not be actually signed
by the owner in any case where a certifying individual associated with a depository institution has placed an endorsement on the form reading substantially as follows: “Absence of signature by owner and validity of transaction guaranteed, Second State Bank of Jonesville, Jonesville, NC, by B.R. Butler, Vice President”. The endorsement should be dated, and the seal of the institution should be added. This form of endorsement is an unconditional guarantee to the Department that the institution is acting for the owner under proper authorization.
(d)
Evidence of certifying individual's authority.
The authority of a certifying individual to act is evidenced by affixing to the certification the following:
(1)
Officers and employees of depository institutions.
The institution's seal or signature guarantee stamp; if the institution is an authorized paying agent for U.S. Savings Bonds, a legible imprint of the paying agent's stamp; or, if the institution is a member of the Security Transfer Agents Medallion Program (STAMP), a legible imprint of the STAMP signature guarantee stamp.
(2)
Officers and authorized employees of institutions that are members of Treasury-recognized signature guarantee programs.
A legible imprint of the program's signature guarantee stamp, e.g., the STAMP, SEMP, MSP stamp for members of the Securities Transfer Agents Medallion Program, the Stock Exchanges Medallion Program, or the New York Stock Exchange Incorporated Medallion Signature Program, respectively.

(6)
Commissioned or warrant officers of the United States Armed Forces.
A statement which sets out the officer's rank and the fact that the person executing the transaction request is one whose signature the officer is authorized to certify under the regulations in this part.
(7)
Such other persons as the Commissioner of the Fiscal Service or his designee may authorize.
The evidence specified by the Commissioner or his designee.
(e)
Interested persons not to act as certifying individual.
Neither the transferor, the transferee, nor any person having an interest in a security involved in the transaction may act as a certifying individual. However, an authorized officer or employee of a depository institution or of an institution that is a member of a Treasury-recognized signature guarantee program may act as a certifying individual on a transaction request for transfer of a security to the institution, or any request executed by another individual on behalf of the institution.

# Appendix A to Part 357—Discussion of Final Rule

# Background
Twenty-four written comments were received to the notice of proposed rulemaking from various sources, including Federal agencies, trade associations, as well as financial and commercial investment institutions. With the exception of one bank, all commentators endorsed the concept of a certificateless security.
The grouping and identification of the comments received have been made on a section-by-section basis, with an explanation of the action taken with respect thereto. As circumstances necessitated the publication of the rule in two segments, in order to make each part more understandable, certain definitions, such as those for “Department” and “securities”, have appeared in the proposed rule for both Legacy Treasury Direct ® and TRADES, and were slightly modified in the proposed rules on TRADES. Because these modifications represent non-substantive clarifications, and to avoid confusion as between the two portions of the rules, the definitions as used in TRADES have been adopted.

# Section-By-Section Analysis

# Section 357.21 Registration.
The forms of registrations provided for securities to be held in Legacy Treasury Direct have different legal effect from those currently provided for in the case of definitive Treasury securities and for the Treasury's book-entry Treasury bill system. A comment was received that, as a result, this could lead to some confusion, and that the Treasury bill forms of recordation currently offered should be changed, particularly since Treasury bills will be phased into Legacy Treasury Direct gradually. The Bureau believes that the benefits of uniformity of rights and interests that Legacy Treasury Direct investors will derive far outweigh any possible confusion. As for confusion with the current Treasury bill book-entry system, given the fact that Treasury bills have a term of not more than a year, it is believed that the problem, if any, will be short-lived.
Given the importance of the change that Legacy Treasury Direct provides as to registration, the discussion thereof that accompanied the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking is re-published below.
“
Forms of Registration.
The proposed rule provides the investor with a variety of registration options. They are essentially similar to those provided for registered, definitive marketable Treasury securities. Investors should be particularly aware that, where the security is held in the names of two individuals, the registration chosen may establish rights of survivorship.
“The reason for establishing the rights of ownership for securities held in Legacy Treasury Direct is that it will give investors the assurance that the forms of registration they select will establish conclusively the rights to their book-entry securities. It will also serve to eliminate some of the uncertainties, as well as possible conflicts, between the varying laws of the several States.
“A Federal rule of ownership is being adopted by the Treasury for Legacy Treasury Direct securities. This regulatory approach is consistent with the one previously taken in the case of United States Savings Bonds. It will have the effect of overriding inconsistent State laws. See,
Free v. Bland,
369 U.S. 663 (1962).
“In the case of individuals (who are likely to be by far the majority of holders of securities in Legacy Treasury Direct), the options offered will permit virtually all the preferred forms of ownership. At the investor's option, it will be possible to provide for the disposition of the securities upon death through rights of survivorship.
“
Coownership registration.
One option is the coownership form of registration, i.e., “A or B.” Unlike the current Treasury bill book-entry system being administered by the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, a security held in Legacy Treasury Direct registered in this form will be transferable upon the written request of either coowner. Other changes in the account may also be made upon the request of either party. While this form of registration will facilitate the receipt of payments and provide ease in conducting transactions, care should obviously be exercised in designating a coowner.
“
Joint ownership.
For those who would prefer to have the transferability of a security held in two names contingent upon the request of both, the joint form of registration will be appropriate. This form of registration, i.e., “A and B, with [without] the right of survivorship,” will require the agreement of both parties to conduct any authorized transaction.
“
Beneficiary form.
The beneficiary form, i.e., “A payable on death to (POD) B,” will permit the owner to have sole control of the account during his/her lifetime, but in the event of death, the account will pass by right of survivorship to the beneficiary.”
One commentator questioned the “natural guardian” and “voluntary guardian” forms of registration provided in the regulations, pointing out that financial institutions are reluctant to establish an account in the name of a natural guardian of a minor because of the uncertainties as to who might be entitled to the funds on the death of the natural guardian or minor, or when the minor reached majority. It was mentioned that a bank would be reluctant to open an account in the name of a voluntary guardian, or to release funds from an existing account to a voluntary guardian because of the potential risk in the event of a claim from a court-appointed guardian. It seems apparent that the comment was prompted by the provision that appeared in the proposed rule that the account held in Legacy Treasury Direct and the deposit account to which payments are to be directed should be in the same form. As hereafter pointed out in the discussion under the payment section, this is not a requirement.
While parents are universally recognized as the natural guardians of the person of minors, they have generally not been recognized as entitled to control the estates of these minors, except perhaps in the case of small amounts. Traditionally, the guardian of the estate of a minor involves judicial appointment and supervision. In order to provide a means of dealing with the problem of disposing of securities inadvertently registered in the name of minors without requiring the appointment of a legal guardian and to provide a means for investing funds of a minor, which did not technically qualify for investment under the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act, the Department decided to provide recognition for natural guardians.
The voluntary guardianship procedure is wholly a creature of the Department's regulations. It was established in recognition of the burden placed on an incompetent's estate and his/her family by requiring the appointment of a legal guardian to receive the interest on, or to redeem securities for, the account of an individual who has become incompetent, at least where the incompetent's estate is relatively modest. This form of registration is not available on original issue and is limited to an aggregate of $20,000 (par amount) of Legacy Treasury Direct securities. The $20,000 limit in connection with the use of the voluntary guardianship procedure is in keeping with the limits used in connection with the summary administration of decedents' estates under the laws of many States.

# Section 357.23 Judicial proceedings.
No comments were received regarding the provisions on judicial proceedings. Given their importance, the discussion that accompanied the publication thereof in proposed form is included here.
Judicial proceedings.
Under the principle of sovereign immunity, neither the Department nor a Federal Reserve Bank, acting as fiscal agent of the United States, will recognize a
court order that attempts to restrain or enjoin the Department or a Federal Reserve Bank from making payment on a security or from disposing of a security in accordance with instructions of the owner as shown on the Department's records.
“The Department will recognize a final court order affecting ownership rights in Legacy Treasury Direct securities provided that the order is consistent with the provisions of subpart C and the terms and conditions of the security, and the appropriate evidence, as described in § 357.23(c), is supplied to the Department. For example, the Department may recognize final orders arising from divorce or dissolution of marriage, creditor or probate proceedings, or cases involving application of a State slayer's act. The Department will also recognize a transaction request submitted by a person appointed by a court and having authority under an order of a court to dispose of the security or payment with respect thereto, provided conditions similar to those above are met.”

# Section 357.25 Security interests.
Legacy Treasury Direct is not designed to reflect or handle the various types of security interests that may arise in connection with a Treasury bond, note or bill. However, the Treasury has from time to time and to a limited extent held in safekeeping, for such agencies as the Customs Service and Immigration and Naturalization Service, Treasury securities submitted in lieu of surety bonds in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 9303. While the Federal Reserve Banks handle the majority of such pledges and will continue to do so, as this statute requires the Treasury to accept these Government obligations so pledged, a provision has been added for accepting and holding book-entry securities submitted for such purposes.

# Section 357.26 Payments.
(a)
General.
Most comments focused on the provisions on payments. A key feature of Legacy Treasury Direct will be the making of payments by the direct deposit method (also known as the electronic funds transfer or ACH method). Checks will be issued only under extraordinary circumstances. A number of comments endorsed the concept of payment by direct deposit as an improvement given the difficulties associated with checks.
One comment expressed concern as to who would have the burden of resolving errors in cases where a receiving financial institution fails to properly credit a payment. The Department has concluded that while the direct deposit payment method is not without risks, it is far superior to the use of checks, in terms of the risks, potential losses, and costs. In a case where a receiving institution fails to act in accordance with the instructions given it, the Bureau intends to use its best efforts to assist investors in rectifying the error.
(b)
Direct deposit.
A number of comments expressed the view that the Legacy Treasury Direct payment system should adopt either the rules governing the direct deposit of Government payments (31 CFR part 210), or the rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association (“NACHA Rules”), but not separate rules. The final rules have adopted some of the existing practices applicable to commercial ACH payments, but it is not possible for the Department of the Treasury to conform to all of these rules. For example, the Treasury has no authority to indemnify recipients of direct deposit payments, although such indemnification by a sender is contemplated in the NACHA rules and was advocated in several comments. It should also be noted that the rules applicable to Legacy Treasury Direct payments are modeled, to some extent, on the rules for Government direct deposit payments in order to take advantage of the large number of entities that are a part of the Government direct deposit network. See the discussion under paragraph (b)(2). Where there are unique rules applicable to Legacy Treasury Direct, however, they are explained here.
Given the variance between the procedures set out in the proposed rules and existing practice, and the increased burdens resulting therefrom, several clearing house associations and financial institutions requested that the implementation of Legacy Treasury Direct be delayed from July 1986 to July 1987. The Treasury is satisfied that the added burdens that would have been imposed on financial institutions to receive Legacy Treasury Direct payments under the proposed rules have been effectively eliminated in the final rule. Thus, Treasury plans to implement the system on or about the original target date. The final rules are being published, however, in advance of actual implementation so as to give financial institutions an opportunity to make whatever remaining, minor procedural changes as may be necessary.
(b)(1)
Information on deposit account at financial institution.
The proposed regulations provided that the owner of a security in Legacy Treasury Direct, or in the case of ownership by two individuals, the first-named owner, must be an owner of, and so designated, on the account at the receiving financial institution. The regulations also provided that in any case in which a security is held jointly or with right of survivorship, the account at the financial institution should be established in a form that assures that the rights of each joint owner or survivor will be preserved.
The rule requiring the naming of the first-named owner on the receiving financial institution account was based on tax reporting
considerations. It has now been determined that the first-named security owner need not be named on the receiving deposit account.
The rule relating to establishment of the receiving account in joint ownership cases in the same form as the registration of the security was intended to be a notice to investors of a potential problem, rather than a requirement. In cases where an investor intends a beneficiary, joint owner or coowner to receive securities after the investor's death, this intention may be defeated if the recipient is not also named on the receiving deposit account. It is up to the investor to examine his or her particular circumstances and determine whether the form in which the deposit account will be held is satisfactory. This matter has been clarified in paragraph (b)(1)(v) of the final rule. Except for the restriction described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) (see below), the Treasury does not intend to establish any limitations on how the receiving deposit account is held.
Several comments addressed the issue of the registration of the security versus the title of the deposit account. Two comments pointed out that if the deposit account must be in the same form as the registration of the security, then existing traditional forms of ownership for bank accounts, which do not include all the forms of registration for securities held in Legacy Treasury Direct, would not suffice. Concerns were also expressed that with multiple forms of ownership, financial institutions could become involved in disputes with investors. As noted above, there is no requirement that the Legacy Treasury Direct account and the deposit account be identical. The responsibility to choose the title of the deposit account rests with the investor.
Another comment objected to the rule that the first-named security owner be named on the receiving deposit account because the rule would eliminate the possibility of payment to an account at a financial institution in the name of a mutual fund, security dealer, or insurance company. Although the change in the tax reporting rule described above permits payment to such accounts, as well as to trust accounts, since it appears that there is a question as to the capability of some receiving institutions to handle such payments, investors are strongly urged to consult their financial institution before requesting such payment arrangements. See paragraph (b)(1)(iii).
It should be emphasized that any payments that must be made by check will be made in the form in which the Legacy Treasury Direct account is held, which may be different than the form of the deposit account. Investors should be aware that this may result in checks being issued, and thus payment being made, in a form different than they intended the direct deposit payments to be made. For example, if Investor A purchases a security in his or her name alone with instructions that payments be directed to a financial institution for the account of a money market fund, any checks that must be issued will be drawn in the name of Investor A. This could happen if Investor A furnishes erroneous payment instructions and the problem cannot be resolved before a payment date, in which case a check would be issued.
The one restriction on the form of the deposit account that appears in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of the final regulations is a rule that where the Legacy Treasury Direct account is in the name of individual(s), and the receiving deposit account is also in the name of individual(s), one of the individuals on the Legacy Treasury Direct account must be named on the deposit account. This rule is intended to provide a means to determine the disposition of the payment, if necessary. The Treasury does not expect financial institutions to monitor this rule.
Provision has been made in paragraph (b)(1)(vii) to permit financial institutions to request “mass changes” of deposit account numbers without the submission of individual requests from investors to Legacy Treasury Direct. This procedure is intended for use where an institution changes all or an entire group of its account numbers, typically as a result of an organizational change. Legacy Treasury Direct will honor requests from a financial institution to change deposit account numbers under such circumstances, with the understanding that the institution agrees to indemnify the Treasury and the security owners for any losses resulting from errors made by the institution. If the institutions does not wish to use the “mass change” procedure, then the change in account number must be requested by the investor, using the authorized transaction request form. See § 357.28.
Some institutions voiced concern in general about investor errors in furnishing the Legacy Treasury Direct a deposit account number and the financial institution's routing number. Although the Treasury plans to provide as much assistance to investors as possible, the investor must bear the responsibility for securing accurate payment information. Investors are urged to consult with their receiving institution to verify the accuracy of the payment information, since neither the Treasury nor the receiving financial institution would be responsible for payment errors resulting from erroneous information provided by investors.
The proposed rule provided in § 357.26(b)(1)(iii) that the designation of a financial institution by a security owner to receive payments from Legacy Treasury Direct would constitute the appointment of the financial institution as agent for the owner for the receipt of payments. The crediting of a payment to the financial institution for deposit to the owner's account, in accordance
with the owner's instructions, would discharge the United States of any further responsibility for the payment. One comment noted that, in contrast, the rule in 31 CFR 210.13 for Federal recurring payments is that the United States is not acquitted until the payment is credited to the account of the recipient on the books of a financial institution.
Although, in principle, the same rules should apply to all Government payments, the proposed Legacy Treasury Direct rule has been retained in the final regulations on the basis of the major differences in the procedures to be used in Legacy Treasury Direct. Most significantly, the Treasury will not be securing any written verification (
i.e.
, an enrollment form) from a financial institution as to the accuracy of the deposit account number and other payment information, as is now the practice in the case of payments under 31 CFR part 210. Under these circumstances, the Treasury cannot, in effect, guarantee that a payment will be credited by a financial institution to the correct account. It should also be noted that this rule on acquittance of the United States is consistent with the provision in § 357.10(c) of the proposed regulations on TRADES. In practice, however, the Treasury plans to participate actively in seeking to locate and recover any payments that have been misdirected.
(b)(2)
Agreement of financial institution.
The proposed rule provided, in § 357.26(b)(2), that a financial institution which has agreed to accept payments under 31 CFR part 210 shall be deemed to have agreed to accept payments from Legacy Treasury Direct. The rule further provided that an institution could not be designated to receive Legacy Treasury Direct payments unless it had agreed to accept direct deposit payments under 31 CFR part 210.
One financial institution commented that a receiving institution that has already agreed to accept part 210 payments should have the choice as to whether to accept payments from Legacy Treasury Direct. The basis for this comment was the perception that the receipt of Legacy Treasury Direct payments would require the implementation of special procedures by the financial institution and expose it to additional risks. As explained earlier, the Treasury has significantly modified the procedures and reduced the requirements imposed upon a financial institution in order to receive Legacy Treasury Direct payments, and decreased as well the risks an institution will incur in the receipt of such payments. Thus, the proposed rule on eligibility of receiving institutions has been retained in the final rule in essentially the same form.
Two other comments were made to the effect that the category of institutions receiving payments should be broadened. In deciding to authorize payments to all institutions receiving part 210 payments, the Treasury considered the fact that many more institutions are designated endpoints for Government (direct deposit) payments than for commercial ACH payments. In order to afford investors the widest choice of recipient institutions, all institutions that had agreed to accept part 210 payments were designated as authorized recipients. Treasury has now broadened the rule further to also authorize those financial institutions that are willing to agree to accept part 210 payments in the future. This rule will permit investors to designate institutions that are not now receiving Government direct deposit payments as the recipients of their Legacy Treasury Direct payments if the institutions make appropriate arrangements with the Federal Reserve Bank of their District.
(b)(3)
Pre-notification.
A significant feature of the Legacy Treasury Direct payment procedure will be the use of a pre-notification message sent to the receiving financial institution in advance of the first payment. This procedure, already in use for commercial ACH payments, alerts the institution that a payment will be made and provides an opportunity for verification of the accuracy of the account information.
The proposed regulations provided that the financial institution would be required to reject the pre-notification message within four calendar days after the date of receipt if the information contained in the message did not agree with the records of the institution or if for any other reason the institution would not be able to credit the payment. The rules also stated that a failure to reject the message within the specified time period would be deemed an acceptance of the pre-notification and a warranty that the information in the message was accurate.
Because there was some confusion over when the pre-notification message woud be sent, the final rules clarify, in paragraph (b)(3)(i), that in most cases, this will occur shortly after establishment of a Legacy Treasury Direct account. The Treasury has under consideration a system change that would permit a second pre-notification to be sent closer to the time of the payment if the first payment is to occur a substantial length of time after account establishment.
One of the items of information contained in a pre-notification message is the name the investor has indicated appears on the deposit account. Comments were received that existing procedures and software do not permit automatic verification of the account name. Although there is apparently some variation in practice, and some institutions undertake to verify the account name information manually, the Treasury has decided to drop the account name verification requirement in the final rules. This means that under paragraph (b)(3)(ii), a financial institution
need only verify the account number and type designations on the pre-notification message. However, the Treasury urges institutions which are able to verify account names to do so and encourages the development of software that would have this capability.
A number of comments urged that the four-day period provided for an institution to reject a pre-notification message be lengthened. After consideration of the various alternatives proposed, the Treasury has concluded that an eight-day period will meet the needs of most institutions. See paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of the final rule. In responding to a pre-notification message, an institution may use the NACHA's “notification of change” procedure, standardized automated rejection codes, or any other similar standard procedure. Upon receipt of such notification, the Treasury will either make the necessary changes in the Legacy Treasury Direct account or contact the investor, depending on the circumstances.
One commentator objected to the warranty by the receiving institution as to the accuracy of the pre-notification information, particularly in view of the manual verification or changes in procedures that would be required, and the resulting possibility of error. As previously noted, the requirement to verify an account name has been eliminated. In addition, language has been added to make it clear that the verification is limited to the time of pre-notification. The Treasury is of the view that the warranty is a useful concept in encouraging institutions to respond to pre-notification messages and will benefit all concerned by increasing the likelihood that payments will be made accurately and to the appropriate party.
(b)(5)
Responsibility of financial institution.
The proposed regulations provided, in § 357.26(b)(5)(ii), that a financial institution that receives a Legacy Treasury Direct payment on behalf of a customer would be required to promptly notify the Treasury when it has made a change in the status or ownership of the customer's deposit account, such as the deletion of the first-named owner of the security from the title of the account, or when the institution is on notice of the death or incompetency of the owner of the deposit account.
Several financial institutions objected to this requirement on the grounds that it would be burdensome and would require the development of new procedures to monitor the changes in deposit accounts. Specifically, several institutions indicated they would be unable to relate the receipt of Legacy Treasury Direct payments, which would be handled in a centralized area of the institution, to the changes being made in a deposit account, which are handled in another operational area of the institution. These institutions said they would not necessarily be aware of who is the first-named owner of the security in Legacy Treasury Direct, and that more responsibility should be placed on the security owner in reporting changes.
In response to these comments, the Treasury has narrowed the notification rule, in paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of the final rule, to require a financial institution to notify Legacy Treasury Direct only in cases where it is on notice of the death or legal incapacity of an individual named on the deposit account, or where it is on notice of the dissolution of a corporation named in the deposit account. Upon receipt of notice by the area of the institution that receives credit payments, the institution will be required to return any Legacy Treasury Direct payments received thereafter.
(b)(6)
Payments in error/duplicate payments.
The proposed regulations, in § 357.26(b)(6), set out rules describing the procedure that would be followed in cases where the Treasury or a Federal Reserve Bank has made a duplicate payment or a payment in error. First, the financial institution to which the payment was directed would be provided with a notice asking for the return of the amount of the payment remaining in the deposit account. If the financial institution were unable to return any part of the payment, it would be required to notify the Treasury or its Federal Reserve Bank, and provide the names and addresses of the persons who withdrew funds from the deposit account after the date of the duplicate payment or the payment in error. If the financial institution did not respond to the notice within 30 days, the financial institution's account at its Federal Reserve Bank could be debited in the amount of the duplicate or improper payment.
Several institutions raised objections about various aspects of the above procedures. One stated that 30 days was an insufficient time to respond and urged conformity with the rules in 31 CFR part 210 permitting a 60-day response time. Some objected to furnishing information about the persons who withdrew money from an account. Several objected in principle to the provision authorizing the debiting of their accounts. Several comments indicated that if a payment is returned by a financial institution using an automated payment reversal procedure, then only the full amount of the payment (not a partial amount) can be reversed.
In the final rule, the Treasury has clarified the procedures. The requirement to provide the names of persons who withdrew funds from an account has been changed. In paragraph (b)(6)(i), financial institutions are asked to provide only such information as they have about the matter. The debiting of an institution's account at a Federal Reserve Bank is intended to be simply a last resort if the institution fails totally to respond to the notice of a duplicate payment or payment
made in error. See paragraph (b)(6)(iii). The time provided for response to this notice has been lengthened to 60 days.
The final rule has also been clarified in paragraph (b)(6)(i) to provide that the amount that should be returned is an amount equal to the payment. The Treasury reserves the right, however, to request the return by other than automated means of a partial amount of a payment made in error. It is anticipated that such a procedure would occur only if the notice of a payment made in error is not issued immediately after the payment was made.
(d)
Handling of payments by Federal Reserve Banks.
Some of the comments raised a question about the liability of the Federal Reserve Banks in making payments. The proposed rule, in § 357.26(d)(2), provided that each Federal Reserve Bank would be responsible only to the Department and would not be liable to any other party for any loss resulting from its handling of payments. This rule was taken from the existing regulations in 31 CFR part 210 (see § 210.3(f)), and is simply a restatement of existing law.
In making payments, the Federal Reserve Banks are acting in the capacity as fiscal agents of the United States, pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 391. They are not acting in an individual (banking) capacity. If a Federal Reserve Bank misdirects a payment contrary to instructions provided by the investor, the United States, as principal, may remain liable to the investor for the payment. The United States could seek to recover any loss from its agent, the Fedeal Reserve Bank. However, because the proposed rule simply stated a legal conclusion and tended to create the impression that the rule was broader than intended, it has been omitted from the final regulations.

# Appendix B to Part 357—TRADES Commentary

# Introduction
The adoption of regulations for the Treasury/Reserve Automated Debt Entry System (“TRADES”) is the culmination of a multi-year Treasury process of moving from issuing securities only in definitive (physical/certificated/paper) form to issuing securities exclusively in book-entry form. The TRADES regulations provide the legal framework for all commercially-maintained Treasury book-entry securities. For a more detailed explanation of the procedural and legal development of book-entry and the TRADES regulations, see the preamble to the rule proposed March 4, 1996 (61 FR 8420), as well as the earlier proposals cited therein 51 FR 8846 (March 14, 1986); 51 FR 43027 (November 28, 1986); 57 FR 12244 (April 9, 1992).

# Comparison of TRADES and Legacy Treasury Direct
A person may hold interests in Treasury book-entry securities either in TRADES
1
or Legacy Treasury Direct. The following summarizes the major differences between the two systems.
1
In TRADES a Person's interest in a Treasury book-entry security is a Security Entitlement, as described in TRADES. A Participant's interest in a marketable Treasury book-entry security also is a Security Entitlement. A Participant's Security Entitlement is different than a Security Entitlement as described in Revised Article 8, with respect to the Participant's rights against the issuer. A non-Participant's Security Entitlement is described in Revised Article 8.
Persons holding Treasury book-entry securities in TRADES hold their interests in such securities in a tiered system of ownership accounts. In TRADES, Treasury, through its fiscal agents, the Federal Reserve Banks, recognizes the identity only of Participants (persons with a direct account relationship with a Federal Reserve Bank). While Participants may be beneficial owners of interests in Treasury book-entry securities, there are many beneficial owners of such interests that are not Participants. Such beneficial owners hold their interests through one or more Securities Intermediaries such as banks, brokerage firms or securities clearing organizations.
In TRADES, the rights of non-Participant beneficial owners may be exercised only
through their Securities Intermediaries. Neither Treasury nor the Federal Reserve Banks have any obligation to a non-Participant beneficial owner of an interest in a Treasury book-entry security. Two examples illustrate this principle. First, except where a pledge has been recorded directly on the books of a Federal Reserve Bank pursuant to § 357.12(c)(1), Federal Reserve Banks, as Treasury's fiscal agents, will act only on instructions of the Participant in whose Securities Account the Treasury book-entry security is maintained in recording transfers of an interest in a Treasury book-entry security. A beneficial owner of the interest that is a non-Participant has no ability to direct a transfer on the books of a Federal Reserve Bank. Second, Treasury discharges its payment obligation with respect to a Treasury book-entry security when payment is credited to a Participant's account or paid in accordance with the Participant's instructions. Neither Treasury nor a Federal Reserve Bank has any payment obligation to a non-Participant beneficial owner of an interest in a Treasury book-entry security. A non-Participant beneficial owner receives its payment when its Securities Intermediary credits the owner's account.
Persons holding Treasury book-entry securities in Legacy Treasury Direct, on the other hand, hold their securities accounts on records maintained by Treasury through its fiscal agents, the Federal Reserve Banks. The primary characteristic of Legacy Treasury Direct is a direct account relationship between the beneficial owner of a Treasury book-entry security and Treasury. In Legacy Treasury Direct, Treasury discharges its payment obligation when payment is credited to the depository institution specified by the beneficial owner of the Treasury book-entry security, paid directly to the beneficial owner by check, or paid in accordance with the beneficial owner's instructions. Unlike TRADES, Legacy Treasury Direct does not provide a mechanism for the exchange of cash to settle a secondary market transaction, nor are pledges of Treasury book-entry securities held in Legacy Treasury Direct generally recognized. Accordingly, Legacy Treasury Direct is suited for persons who plan to hold their Treasury securities until maturity, and provides an alternative for investors who are concerned about holding securities through intermediaries and who do not wish to hold their interests in Treasury securities indirectly in TRADES.

# Scope of Regulation
Just as the scope of Revised Article 8 is limited,
2
the scope of this regulation is limited. It is not a comprehensive codification of the law governing securities, transactions in securities or the law of contracts for the purchase or sale of securities. Similarly, it is not a codification of all laws that could affect a person's interest in a Treasury book-entry security. For example, state laws regarding divorce or intestate succession could well affect which persons have rights in the interest in a Treasury book-entry security. Moreover, the regulations deal with certain aspects of transactions in Treasury securities, such as perfection of a security interest and its effects and not other aspects, such as the contractual relationship between a debtor and its secured party, which are left to applicable law
3
. See the discussion under § 357.10 of the Section-by-Section Analysis.
2
U.C.C. Revised Article 8, Prefatory Note at 12.
3
The regulations in 31 CFR 306.118(b), which are being supplanted by TRADES, state that “applicable law” covers how a transfer or pledge is “effected” as well as perfected. Except with respect to security interests marked on the books of a Federal Reserve Bank, TRADES does not address how a security interest in a Treasury book-entry security is created or what law governs the creation of a security interest. Section 357.11(a) of TRADES, which establishes the choice of law for interests other than those covered by § 357.10, addresses the choice of law with respect to the perfection, effect of perfection or non-perfection, and priority of security interests, but does not address the law governing creation or attachment of a security interest. This is consistent with the scope and choice of law provisions of Revised Article 8.

# Section-by-Section Analysis

# Section 357.0 Dual book-entry systems.
Section 357.0 sets forth that Treasury provides two systems for maintaining Treasury book-entry securities—TRADES and Legacy Treasury Direct. Subpart A of part 357 of 31 CFR contains general information about TRADES and Legacy Treasury Direct. Subpart B contains the TRADES regulations. Subpart C contains the Legacy Treasury Direct regulations. Subpart D contains miscellaneous provisions. Thus, in its totality, part 357 sets forth in one place the complete set of governing rules for Treasury securities issued in book-entry form.

# Section 357.1 Effective date.
Section 357.1 establishes the effective date for TRADES. TRADES applies to outstanding securities formerly governed by 31 CFR part 306, subpart O. Conforming changes to parts 306, 356, and 358 are being made to coincide with the publication of TRADES in final form. Consistent with the approach set forth in Revised Article 8 (see § 8-603 and the
official comment thereto), on and after the effective date these regulations will apply to all transactions, including transactions commenced prior to the effective date. Revised Article 8, in Section 8-603, gave secured parties four months after the effective date to take action to continue the perfection of their security interests. TRADES, through its delayed effectiveness, provides a similar period. In TRADES, January 1, 1997, becomes the date by which such actions must be completed.
The effective date for TRADES is January 1, 1997. While TRADES is based in large part on Revised Article 8 that has received widespread attention in the financial community and already has been adopted in 28 states,
4
Treasury has determined that TRADES will be effective on January 1, 1997, to ensure a smooth transition to TRADES. In making that determination, Treasury has taken into account the time required by other Government-Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs) to promulgate similar regulations for their securities. Such an effective date, when combined with TRADES having been published in proposed form with a 60-day comment period, should provide sufficient time for an orderly transition to the new TRADES rules.
4
As of August 1, 1996, those states are: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia and Wyoming. See discussion accompanying footnote 11.

# Section 357.2 Definitions.
Section 357.2 contains definitions for use in subparts B and C. While most of the definitions are straightforward, four terms—Participant, Entitlement Holder, Security Entitlement and Securities Intermediary—are critical to an understanding of the proposed TRADES regulations.
(a)
Participant.
A Participant is a person that has a securities account relationship in its name with a Federal Reserve Bank. Accordingly, the Federal Reserve Bank and Treasury know both the identity of the persons maintaining these accounts and the Treasury book-entry securities held in these accounts.
(b)
Securities Intermediary.
Securities Intermediaries are persons (other than individuals, except as described below) that are in the business of holding interests in Treasury book-entry securities for others. Participants can be, and usually are, Securities Intermediaries.
In addition, entities such as clearing corporations, banks, brokers and dealers can be Securities Intermediaries in a single chain of ownership of a Treasury security. An individual, unless registered as a broker or dealer under the federal securities laws, cannot be a Securities Intermediary. As an illustration of a possible chain of ownership, in the following chart, the Federal Reserve Bank, Participant and Broker-Dealer are all Securities Intermediaries.
Treasury
Federal Reserve Bank
|
Participant
|
Broker-Dealer
|
Individual Holder
(c)
Entitlement Holder.
An Entitlement Holder is any person for whom a Securities Intermediary holds an interest in a Treasury book-entry security. In the above example Individual Holder, Broker-Dealer and Participant are all Entitlement Holders. Thus, a person can be both a Securities Intermediary and an Entitlement Holder. See also the commentary on “Security Entitlement.”
(d)
Security Entitlement.
A Security Entitlement is the interest that an Entitlement Holder has in a Treasury book-entry security. In the example, Participant, Broker-Dealer and Individual Holder all hold Security Entitlements. The rights and property interests associated with a Security Entitlement of a Participant held on the books of a Federal Reserve Bank (“Participant's Security Entitlement”) are, however, different from the rights and property interests associated with other Security Entitlements. As provided in § 357.10(a), Federal law defines the scope and nature of a Participant's Security Entitlement. While TRADES is based in large part on Revised Article 8, the meaning of Security Entitlement under federal law is different than under Revised Article 8. For example, Participants have a direct claim against the United States for interest and principal even though, under state law, an Entitlement Holder would only have a claim against its Securities Intermediary for such payment. To the extent not inconsistent with this regulation, the scope and nature of a Security Entitlement of an Entitlement Holder below the level of a Participant, (Broker-dealer and Individual Holder in the example above), is defined by applicable state law, as determined pursuant to § 357.11. It should also be noted that while a Participant's rights have Federal law components under § 357.10(a), the nature of a Security Entitlement held by a lower tier intermediary on the books of a Participant is determined pursuant to applicable law as provided in § 357.11.

# Section 357.10 Law governing the United States and Reserve Banks.
Section 357.10(a) provides that the rights and obligations of the United States and the Federal Reserve Banks (with one exception detailed below), with respect to both the TRADES system and Treasury book-entry securities maintained in TRADES are governed solely and exclusively by Federal law. Thus, claims against the United States and Federal Reserve Banks of both Participants and all other persons with an interest (or claiming an interest) in a Treasury book-entry security maintained in TRADES are governed by Federal law. Federal law is defined to include TRADES, the offering circulars pursuant to which the Treasury securities are sold, the offering announcements and Federal Reserve Bank Operating Circulars.
5
Prior to March 1, 1993, the terms of each offering of Treasury securities, except for Treasury bills were set forth in an offering circular published in the
Federal Register.
6
Since March 1, 1993, all Treasury book-entry securities have been offered pursuant to a uniform offering circular set forth at 31 CFR part 356.
5
A “Federal Reserve Bank Operating Circular” is defined in § 357.2 as the publication issued by each Federal Reserve Bank that sets forth the terms and conditions under which the Reserve Bank maintains Book-entry Securities Accounts and transfers Book-entry Securities.
6
Treasury bills were issued pursuant to one master offering circular (31 CFR part 349, removed, and replaced by 31 CFR part 356) effective March 1, 1993. (58 FR 412)
While TRADES is based in large measure on Revised Article 8, a fundamental principle of these regulations (and a divergence from Revised Article 8) is that the obligations of the issuer (the United States) and the Federal Reserve Banks, as well as all claims with respect to TRADES or a Treasury book-entry security against Treasury or a Federal Reserve Bank, are governed solely by Federal law. Thus, for example, those parts of Revised Article 8 that detail obligations of issuers (or their agents) of securities are not applicable to either the United States or Federal Reserve Banks.
7
In addition, neither the United States nor Federal Reserve Banks have any obligations to persons holding their interests in a Treasury book-entry security at levels below the level of a Participant or to any other person claiming an interest in a Treasury book-entry security (with the limited exception set out in § 357.12(c)(1)). Thus, there are no derivative rights against either the United States or the Federal Reserve Banks.
7
The regulations in subpart C of this part set out other obligations of the United States and the Federal Reserve Banks for securities held in Legacy Treasury Direct. These regulations preempt applicable state law.
In interpreting this section, it is important to note that the scope of TRADES, like that of Revised Article 8, is limited. Accordingly, the governing law set forth in § 357.10(a) is applicable only to the matters set forth in § 357.10(a). Other laws remain applicable and could affect the holders of book-entry securities.
For example, the tax treatment of Securities Entitlements is outside the scope of TRADES and other law (the Federal income tax code) is applicable in determining such tax treatment. Similarly, nothing in § 357.10(a) limits the applicability of other laws to matters such as whether the activities of Participants or Securities Intermediaries with respect to interests in Treasury book-entry securities are subject to banking or securities laws.
While TRADES in § 357.10(a) defines what law governs the contract between the United States, as issuer, and the holder of a Security Entitlement, it is not a complete statement of the contract law applicable to the United States or Federal Reserve Banks. For example, if a Participant obtains a discount window loan from a Federal Reserve Bank and agrees to pledge collateral, including Treasury book-entry securities, to the Federal Reserve Bank as security for the loan, § 357.10(a) does not establish the law for determining the validity or enforceability of the contract or the law applicable to the creation and perfection of security interests in property that is not a Treasury book-entry security. Section 357.10(a) does provide the law applicable for how a security interest in Treasury book-entry securities is perfected, the priority of such interest and, if § 357.12(c)(1) is applicable, how such security interest is created. Similarly, nothing in § 357.10(a) affects the continuing applicability or enforceability of Federal Reserve Bank operating circulars such as the circular setting forth provisions regarding electronic access to services provided by Federal Reserve Banks and agreements executed in connection with such circulars.
The law applicable with respect to interests granted to a Federal Reserve Bank depends on the manner in which the security interest is granted.
Where a security interest in favor of a Federal Reserve Bank is marked on the books of the Federal Reserve Bank under Section 357.12(c)(1), § 357.10(a) establishes the applicable law. A security interest in favor of a Federal Reserve Bank would be recorded on the Federal Reserve Bank's books where, for example, the Federal Reserve Bank made a discount window loan to a depository institution and any Treasury book-entry securities
provided by the depository institution as collateral have been deposited to a pledge account on the books of the Federal Reserve Bank. For a borrowing depository institution that is not a Participant, the book-entry securities used as collateral generally would be deposited to the Federal Reserve Bank pledge account by the borrowing institution's Securities Intermediary. See Hypothetical 5.
Section 357.10(b) sets forth law applicable with respect to security interests in favor of a Federal Reserve Bank that have not been marked on the books of a Federal Reserve Bank. A security interest in the Securities Entitlement of a Participant in favor of a Federal Reserve Bank that is not marked on the books of the Federal Reserve Bank is governed by the law of the state in which the head office of the Federal Reserve Bank is located. Such a security interest could arise, for example, where the delivery of book-entry securities to the securities account of the Participant results in an overdraft in the Participant's Funds Account. The extent to which the Federal Reserve Bank has an interest in the Participant's book-entry securities to secure the overdraft therefore would be determined under the law of the state in which the Reserve Bank's head office is located. If the State in which the head office of the Federal Reserve Bank is located has not adopted Revised Article 8, under § 357.10(c) that State is deemed to have adopted Revised Article 8.
In certain very limited circumstances, a Federal Reserve Bank also may have a security interest in the book-entry securities of a non-Participant that is not marked on the books of the Federal Reserve Bank. Section 357.10(b) provides a separate rule for such a security interest, which would be governed by the law of the non-Participant's Securities Intermediary, as determined under § 357.11. Under § 357.11, the perfection, effect of perfection, and priority of a security interest created under such an agreement would be governed by the law of the Securities Intermediary's jurisdiction, as determined under § 357.11(b). Under § 357.11(d), if the jurisdiction specified in § 357.11(b) has not adopted Revised Article 8, jurisdiction would be deemed to have adopted Revised Article 8.
8
8
An interest in book-entry securities of a non-Participant that is not marked on the books of the Federal Reserve Bank, while uncommon, could arise where the Federal Reserve Bank lends to a non-Participant depository institution and enters into a triparty agreement with the depository institution and its Securities Intermediary rather than requiring the deposit of the book-entry securities in a pledge account on the books of the Federal Reserve Bank through an instruction given by the non-Participant depository institution to its Securities Intermediary.
For purposes of applying the state law chosen under the rules of § 357.10(b), Federal Reserve Banks are treated as clearing corporations. As a result, a security interest in a Securities Entitlement of a Participant in favor of a Federal Reserve Bank under § 357.12(c)(2) has the same priority as security interests granted to other clearing corporations under state law. This is consistent with the treatment accorded to Federal Reserve Banks generally under Revised Article 8.

# Section 357.11 Law governing other interests.
(a)
Law governing the rights and obligation of Participants and third parties.
Section 357.11 is a choice of law rule. The substantive matters subject to this choice of law rule are set forth in § 357.11(a). The matters set forth in § 357.11(a) are meant to be coextensive with those matters covered by Revised Article 8 with respect to a person's interest in a Treasury book-entry security (other than those related to a person's relationship to Treasury or a Federal Reserve Bank which are governed solely by federal law). For purposes of these choice of law rules Participants are Securities Intermediaries.
Section 357.11(b) adopts Revised Article 8's general choice of law rule. Section 357.11(c) sets forth a special choice of law rule with respect to security interests perfected automatically or by filing, which also is included in Revised Article 8. Generally, the law applicable to the Securities Intermediary will govern matters involving an interest in a book-entry security held through that intermediary. This approach is not followed with respect to perfection of security interests automatically or by filing. In those cases, the law of the jurisdiction in which the debtor is located is the governing law. Since filing systems are based on the location of the debtor, this approach should reduce uncertainty and preserve the normal practice of searching records based on the debtor's location.
9
The language “person creating a security interest” is used in lieu of the term “debtor” in this provision to avoid any confusion. The word “debtor” has two meanings in the Uniform Commercial Code and the expression “person creating a security interest” provides clarity with respect to who is covered by this section. The term does not refer to a creditor. The language “is located” is intended to conform to its meaning under applicable law, as it may be amended from
time to time. See, e.g., U.C.C. section 9-103(3)(d). Section 357.11(d) provides for the application of Revised Article 8 if the choice of law analysis required by § 357.11(b) results in the choice of the law of a State that has not yet adopted Revised Article 8. As noted elsewhere, in such a situation, the State's law is viewed as if it had adopted Revised Article 8. This section also provides that, for purposes of applying state law, the Federal Reserve Banks are clearing corporations and Participants' interests in book-entry securities are Security Entitlements.
9
The substantive effect of filing is limited and applies only in states which have adopted Revised Article 8. Since the effect of filing is a unique state law matter, in this one area, Treasury has determined that possible lack of uniformity does not justify altering state law.
(b)
Limited scope of Federal preemption.
In an earlier TRADES proposal Treasury contemplated adopting a comprehensive regulation governing the rights of all persons in Treasury book-entry securities held in TRADES. Such an approach was proposed because Treasury believed that a uniform rule was necessary to preserve the efficiency and liquidity of the market for Treasury securities—the most liquid and efficient market in the world. Treasury believed then, and believes now, that the material rights of a holder in the United States of an interest in a Treasury security should not vary solely by virtue of such holder's geographic location or the location of the financial institution through which it holds its interest in Treasury securities. In light of Revised Article 8, Treasury has determined that it is possible to achieve this uniformity without developing an independent system of Federal commercial law.
10
The questions inherent in a tiered system of ownership have been analyzed, and, in Treasury's view, satisfactorily addressed by Revised Article 8.
10
As noted previously, the substantive scope of this regulation is limited.
As of August 1, 1996, 28 states have adopted Revised Article 8 and Treasury understands that it will soon be adopted in additional states. As with all uniform laws, the adoption process takes several years. In order to assure uniformity, in light of the unavoidable delays in the state-by-state adoption process of Revised Article 8, Treasury is promulgating regulations with a limited form of preemption. As provided in both §§ 357.10(c) and 357.11(d), if the choice of law rules set forth in TRADES would lead to the application of the law of a State that has not yet adopted Revised Article 8, TRADES will apply Revised Article 8 (with conforming and miscellaneous amendments to other Articles) in the form approved by the ALI and NCCUSL. Treasury expects that these provisions will be operative only during the state-by-state adoption process and would plan to amend TRADES to delete reference to these provisions once the adoption process has been completed.
While Revised Article 8 is defined to mean the official text of Article 8 as approved by the ALI and NCCUSL, Treasury recognizes that states may make minor changes in that text when adopting Article 8. Treasury has concluded that minor changes should not prevent Revised Article 8, as adopted by a state, from being the appropriate law. In other words, if a state passes a version of Article 8 that is substantially identical to Revised Article 8, reference to Revised Article 8 (as defined) would no longer be required. Treasury has determined that the versions of Article 8 passed by 50
11
states that have enacted Article 8 meet this standard. Accordingly, §§ 357.10(c) and 357.11(d) would not be applicable if the choice of law provisions of TRADES directed a person to one of those states. As additional states adopt Revised Article 8, Treasury will provide notice in the
Federal Register
as to whether the enactments are “substantially identical” to the uniform version for purposes of these regulations and on an annual basis, the Commentary will be amended to reflect subsequent enactments. This approach represents a significantly reduced form of preemption of state law from former versions of TRADES and preserves Treasury's preeminent interest in a uniform system of rules applicable to all holders of interests in Treasury book-entry securities.

# Section 357.12 Obtaining an interest in a book-entry security.
(a)
Creation of a Participant's Security Entitlement.
A Participant's interest in a Treasury book-entry security is a Securities Entitlement. Section 357.12(a) provides that a Participant's Securities Entitlement is created when a Federal Reserve Bank indicates by book entry that a Book-entry Security has been credited to a Participant's Securities Account. Instead of the concept of initial credit and transfer of a Treasury book-entry security, as set forth in the existing regulations, this proposal focuses on the creation of a Participant's Securities Entitlement and, in this way, is similar to Section 8-501 of Revised Article 8.
The regulation focuses on the creation of a Participant's Security Entitlement because
Security Entitlement is the term used to describe the Participant's interest in a Treasury book-entry security. Once a Participant obtains that interest, the regulation sets forth what that interest is. Thus, as provided in § 357.10, federal law describes a Participant's rights against the United States and the Federal Reserve Bank where it maintains its Securities Account. To the extent not inconsistent with § 357.10, § 357.11 describes the applicable law to determine Participants' rights and obligations with respect to all other persons. Under these regulations, Participants can still transfer their interests in a Treasury book-entry security as they did before—by issuing a Transfer Message to the Federal Reserve Bank where they hold such interest. Transfer of interests between Participants can occur by a Participant holding such interest issuing a Transfer Message. As a result of such message, the Federal Reserve Bank will make a book entry in favor of the receiving Participant (thereby creating a Security Entitlement in favor of such Participant) and also will make a book entry deleting the initiator Participant's interest in such Treasury book-entry security (thereby eliminating that Participant's Security Entitlement). In addition, if authorized under applicable state law, Participants may enter into agreements with other Participants that, as to the Participants, constitute a transfer. Such action is without effect to either the United States or a Federal Reserve Bank.
(b)
Creation and priority of a Security Interest.
(i)
Security Interests of the United States.
Section 357.12(b) provides that a security interest in favor of the United States has priority over the interests of any other person in a Treasury book-entry security. The United States obtains security interests in Treasury securities as collateral to secure funds in a variety of situations such as Treasury Tax and Loan accounts; government agency funds or funds under the control of the Federal Courts held at financial institutions; and securities pledged in lieu of surety by contractors and others. The priority provided the United States in these situations is consistent with existing law.
In addition, Federal Reserve Banks do recognize on their books and records security interests in favor of the United States. In that situation, the Federal Reserve Bank will not transfer the security without the permission of the United States. This section provides that a Federal Reserve Bank may rely exclusively on the directions of an authorized representative of the United States to transfer a security and is protected in so relying. Ordinarily, an authorized representative of the United States would take such action under circumstances such as the default or insolvency of the pledgor.
(ii)
Security Interests on the books of a Reserve Bank.
Where required by Federal law or regulation or pursuant to a specific agreement with a Federal Reserve Bank, a security interest in favor of a Federal Reserve Bank or other person may be created or perfected by a Federal Reserve Bank marking its books to record the security interest under § 357.12(c)(1). An example of a security interest that is marked on the books of a Federal Reserve Bank would be the pledge in favor of a Federal Reserve Bank of a Participant's book-entry securities as collateral for a discount window loan.
12
For limited categories of pledges, Federal Reserve Banks may agree to record a security interest in favor of a third party on their books. For example, in some circumstances a Federal Reserve Bank may permit the establishment of a pledge account to hold book-entry securities pledged to governmental entities other than the United States government. It is important to note that there is no obligation for either Treasury or a Federal Reserve Bank to agree to record a security interest on the books of a Federal Reserve Bank, except as required by Federal law or regulation. If they do so, the security interest is perfected when the Federal Reserve Bank records a security interest on its books. In addition, the security interest has priority over all other interests in the Treasury book-entry security except an interest of the United States.
12
Book-entry securities pledged by a non-Participant to a Federal Reserve Bank generally would be deposited by the non-Participant's Securities Intermediary to a pledge account at the Federal Reserve Bank, and therefore also would be marked on the books of the Federal Reserve Bank. See the discussion under D. (§ 357.10).
(iii)
Other security interests.
As provided in § 357.12(c)(2), a security interest in a book-entry security may be perfected by any method available under applicable state law, as determined under § 357.10(b) or § 357.11.
13
The perfection and priority of such interests shall be governed by applicable law. Security interests under this section may include security interests in favor of a Federal Reserve Bank, such as a clearing lien or pledge by a non-participant of book-entry securities held through a Securities Intermediary where the securities have not been deposited to a Federal Reserve Bank pledge account. Consistent with Revised Article 8, a Federal Reserve Bank would be treated as a clearing corporation under the applicable state law.
13
Under both of these sections, if the state has not yet adopted Revised Article 8, the applicable law would be that state's law as it would be amended by Revised Article 8.
If a Person perfects a security interest pursuant to § 357.12(c)(2), obligations of the Treasury and the Federal Reserve Banks with respect to that security interest are
limited. Specifically, unless special arrangements are agreed to by the United States or a Federal Reserve Bank pursuant to § 357.12(c)(1), neither the Federal Reserve Bank nor the United States will recognize the interests of any person other than the person in whose securities account the interest in a Treasury book-entry security is maintained. This does not mean that such a security interest is invalid. Rather, it means that the creditor's recourse will be solely against the debtor Participant or other third party.

# Section 357.13 Rights and obligations of Treasury and the Reserve Banks.
(a)
Adverse claims.
Section 357.13(a) sets forth the general rule that, with limited exceptions, Treasury and the Federal Reserve Banks will recognize only the interest of a Participant in a Treasury book-entry security in whose Securities Account such interest is maintained.
As noted previously, Treasury book-entry securities maintained in TRADES are held in a tiered system of ownership. The records of a Federal Reserve Bank reflect only the ownership at the top tier. Institutions maintaining a Securities Account with a Federal Reserve Bank frequently will hold interests in Treasury book-entry securities for their customers (which can include broker-dealers and other Securities Intermediaries) and in certain cases those customers will hold interests in securities for their customers. Accordingly, neither Treasury nor a Federal Reserve Bank will know the identity or recognize a claim of a Participant's customer if that customer were to present it to Treasury or a Federal Reserve Bank.
In addition, except in the limited case where a security interest is marked on the books of a Federal Reserve Bank pursuant to § 357.12(c)(1), neither the Treasury nor a Federal Reserve Bank will recognize the claims of any other person asserting a claim in a Treasury book-entry security. Persons at levels below the Participant level must present their claims to their Securities Intermediary.
(b)
Payment obligations.
Section 357.13(b) contains a corollary to the rule set forth in § 357.13(a). This section provides that Treasury discharges its payment responsibility with respect to a security that it has issued when a Federal Reserve Bank credits the funds account of a Participant with amounts due on that security or makes payment in some other manner specified by the Participant. This is consistent with existing law and the first TRADES proposal.
14
In Revised Article 8, the issuer discharges its obligations when it makes payment to an owner registered on its books. Under common commercial practice, the registered owner in the indirect system may be a clearing corporation or the clearing corporation's nominee. Although the Federal Reserve Banks are treated as clearing corporations under both Revised Article 8 and TRADES, Treasury remains liable until payment is made to, or in accordance with the instructions of, a Participant. Section 357.13(b)(2) establishes the mechanism of how Treasury book-entry securities are paid at maturity. It is intended to cover a variety of procedures, including where the proceeds of pledged securities are credited to a suspense account pending substitution or release. This paragraph makes clear that the payment takes place automatically and that, unlike with physical certificates, there is no act of presentment required by the Participant.
14
51 FR 8846, 8848 (March 14, 1986).

# Section 357.14 Authority of Reserve Banks.
Section 357.14 provides that Federal Reserve Banks are authorized, as fiscal agents of Treasury, to operate the commercial book-entry system for Treasury.

# Section 357.44 Notices.
Section 357.44 contains a revised version of a provision that appeared in earlier TRADES proposals. Similar to the rule in Revised Article 8 (see section 8-112), it provides where certain legal process should be directed. While providing instructions on where notice should be directed, it makes clear that the regulations do not establish whether a Federal Reserve Bank is required to honor any such order or notice.

# J. Hypotheticals

# Hypothetical 1
TREASURY
FEDERAL RESERVE BANK
|
PARTICIPANT
|
DEALER
|
INVESTOR
The first hypothetical is designed to show what law applies at different levels of the tiered book-entry system. TRADES provides that federal law, and only federal law (defined in § 357.10(a)), governs the rights and obligations of the United States and the Federal Reserve Banks (except for those matters involving Federal Reserve Banks set forth in § 357.10(b)). Thus, for example, Treasury discharges its payment obligations with respect to a security it has issued in the manner described in § 357.13(b). Federal law both defines the payment obligation and describes how Treasury fulfills that obligation. Those portions of Revised Article 8 dealing with issuer
obligations are not applicable to Treasury or the Federal Reserve Banks.
15
Similarly, with certain limited exceptions as set forth in § 357.12(c)(1), Treasury and the Federal Reserve Banks will recognize only the interest of a Participant in a Treasury book-entry security in whose Security Account the interest is maintained. Accordingly, as a matter of federal law, neither Treasury nor a Federal Reserve Bank will recognize any claim by Dealer or Investor.
16
15
As provided in § 357.14, Federal Reserve Banks, among other things, effect transfers of book-entry securities between Participants' Security Accounts.
16
One comment questioned whether similar language in the March 4, 1996 release implied that, under Revised Article 8, in the above example Investor could have a claim against Participant. No such implication was intended. The only point of the language is to make it clear that Federal, not state, law governs the rights and obligations of Treasury and the Federal Reserve Banks.
In the hypothetical above, as between Participant and Dealer, Participant is the Securities Intermediary. With respect to the matters set forth in § 357.11(a), the law of the Securities Intermediary's jurisdiction governs. Thus, with respect to the matters in § 357.11(a), the law of Participant's jurisdiction applies as between Participant and Dealer.
17
If Participant's jurisdiction, as determined under § 357.11(b), has not adopted Revised Article 8, the law of Participant's jurisdiction, as it would be amended by Revised Article 8, applies. Similarly, as between Dealer and Investor, Dealer is a Securities Intermediary, with respect to the matters in § 357.11(a), the law of Dealer's jurisdiction applies as between Dealer and Investor. If Dealer's jurisdiction has not adopted Revised Article 8, the law of Dealer's jurisdiction, as it would be amended by Article 8, applies.
17
As described in the March 4 Release, the scope of TRADES is limited. As a general rule, if a matter is not covered in § 357.11(a), TRADES is not applicable. One comment questioned whether TRADES covered the creation and attachment of a security interest. The omission of creation and attachment in § 357.11(a) is intentional.

# Hypothetical 2
Assume that Dealer A sells its interest in a Treasury book-entry security to Dealer B. The transaction likely would take the following form. Dealer A will instruct Participant A to transfer its interest in a Treasury security to Participant B against cash payment. Dealer B will instruct Participant B to transfer cash to Participant A against delivery of an interest in the specified securities. Participant A will instruct the Federal Reserve Bank to transfer its interest in the Treasury security to Participant B against simultaneous credit of cash. The Federal Reserve Bank will debit Participant A's security account and credit Participant B's security account and simultaneously credit Participant A's cash account and debit Participant B's cash account. Participant A will mark its books to show that it has debited Dealer A's securities account and credited Dealer A's cash account. Participant B will mark its books to show the Security Entitlement in the Treasury security in favor of Dealer B and a debit against Dealer B's cash account. Federal law, set forth in § 357.12(a) provides that Participant B acquires its interest in the Treasury book-entry security when the Federal Reserve Bank indicates by book-entry that the interest in the security has been credited to Participant B's Securities Account. Pursuant to § 357.11(a), but subject to § 357.11(d), Participant B's jurisdiction governs Dealer B's acquisition of a Securities Entitlement from Participant B.

# Hypothetical 3
TREASURY
FEDERAL RESERVE BANK
|
PARTICIPANT
Assume Participant wishes to obtain a loan from Federal Reserve Bank and, as part of the transaction, will grant Federal Reserve Bank a security interest in its Securities Entitlement with respect to Treasury book-entry securities. The transaction can be accomplished in one of two ways. Pursuant to § 357.12(c)(1), the Federal Reserve Bank can mark its books to reflect the security interest. As a matter of federal law, that action creates and perfects the Federal Reserve Bank's security interest and grants the Federal Reserve Bank priority over all other claimants (other than the United States pursuant to § 357.12(b)).
18
A second method for completing the transaction, as set forth in
§ 357.12(c)(2), would be to take whatever actions are authorized by applicable law. In that case, applicable law is the law of the jurisdiction of the head office of the Federal Reserve Bank. If that jurisdiction had adopted Revised Article 8, it would be the law of that jurisdiction. If that jurisdiction had not adopted Revised Article 8, it would be the law of that jurisdiction as if the jurisdiction had adopted Revised Article 8. Under Revised Article 8, the Federal Reserve Bank's interest would be that of a clearing corporation.
18
In certain limited circumstances, a Federal Reserve Bank may enter into an agreement under which it agrees to record on its books an interest in Participant's book-entry securities in favor of a non-Participant, such as a governmental entity. Under these circumstances, the non-Participant would have a perfected security interest with priority over other claimants (other than the United States under § 357.12(b)). It should be noted that, as set forth in § 357.12(c)(1), there is no requirement that either the United States or a Federal Reserve Bank agree to creation and perfection of a security interest in this way, except as provided in § 357.12(c)(1).

PARTICIPANT B
Assume that Participant A wishes to borrow from Participant B and grant Participant B a security interest in its Security Entitlement in Treasury book-entry securities. As provided in § 357.12(c)(2), the transaction would be completed pursuant to applicable law determined in accordance with 357.11. Although such an interest could be recorded on the books of a Federal Reserve Bank under § 357.12(c)(1), Federal Reserve Banks generally do not mark their books to record this type of security interest for Participants.

PARTICIPANT A
|
DEALER A
|
BANK A
Assume that Bank A wishes to borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank and will pledge its interest in Treasury book-entry securities held at Dealer A to collateralize that loan. The transaction could be accomplished in two ways. Pursuant to § 357.12(c)(1), the interest could be created and perfected on the books of a Federal Reserve Bank. Such a transaction would take place in the following fashion. Bank A could have Dealer A instruct Participant A to deposit securities to a pledge account specified by the Federal Reserve Bank. The Federal Reserve Bank likely would create an account on its books and specify that account to Bank A as the account to receive Bank A's interest in Treasury book-entry securities. Participant A, upon receiving Dealer A's instructions, would then instruct the Federal Reserve Bank to debit its account at the Federal Reserve Bank and credit the account created by the Federal Reserve Bank. The second way the transaction could take place is by any method permitted by the law of Dealer A's (Bank A's Securities Intermediary) jurisdiction. This could involve a tri-party agreement among the Federal Reserve Bank, Dealer A, and Bank A. As set forth in § 357.11(b)(1), that agreement likely would specify which jurisdiction's law is to govern the transaction and could specify that such choice of law supersedes any other choice of law agreement previously entered into by Dealer A and Bank A. If Dealer A's jurisdiction has not adopted Revised Article 8, the applicable law would be the law of Dealer A's jurisdiction as it would be amended by Revised Article 8.

§ 359.4
In what form are Series I savings bonds issued?
Series I savings bonds are issued in book-entry form. Effective January 1, 2012, Treasury discontinued the
issuance of definitive Series I savings bonds.
[76 FR 66856, Oct. 28, 2011]
§ 359.5
What is the maturity period of a Series I savings bonds?
Series I savings bonds have a total maturity period of 30 years from the issue date, consisting of an original maturity period of 20 years and an extension period of 10 years.
§ 359.6
When may I redeem my Series I bond?
(a)
Bonds issued on December 1, 2002, or earlier.
You may redeem your Series I savings bond issued on January 1, 2003, or earlier, at any time after six months from its issue date.
(b) Bonds issued on February 1, 2003, or thereafter. You may redeem your Series I savings bond issued on February 1, 2003, or thereafter, at any time after 12 months from its issue date.
[68 FR 2667, Jan. 17, 2003, as amended at 68 FR 7427, Feb. 14, 2003]
§ 359.7
If I redeem a Series I savings bonds before five years after the issue date, is there an interest penalty?
If you redeem a bond less than five years after the issue date, we will reduce the overall earning period by three months. For example, if you redeem a bond issued January 1, 2002, nine months later on October 1, 2002, the redemption value will be determined by applying the value calculation procedures and composite rate for that bond as if the redemption date were three months earlier (July 1, 2002). However, we will not reduce the redemption value of a bond subject to the three-month interest penalty below the issue price (par). This penalty does not apply to bonds redeemed five years or more after the issue date.
§ 359.8
How does interest accrue on Series I savings bonds?
A bond accrues interest based on both a fixed rate of return and a semiannual inflation rate. A single, annual rate called the composite rate reflects the combined effects of the fixed rate and the semiannual inflation rate. For more information, see appendix B of part 359.
§ 359.9
When are interest rates for Series I savings bonds announced?
(a) The Secretary will furnish fixed rates, semiannual inflation rates, and composite rates for Series I savings bonds in announcements published each May 1 and November 1.
(b) If the regularly scheduled date for the announcement is a day when the Treasury is not open for business, then the Secretary will make the announcement on the next business day. However, the effective date of the rates remains the first day of the month of the announcement.
(c) The Secretary may announce rates at any other time.
§ 359.10
What is the fixed rate of return?
The Secretary, or the Secretary's designee, determines the fixed rate of return. The fixed rate is established for the life of the bond. The fixed rate will always be greater than or equal to 0.00%.
1
The most recently announced fixed rate is only for bonds purchased during the six months following the announcement, or for any other period of time announced by the Secretary.
1
However, the fixed rate is not a guaranteed minimum rate. The composite rate is composed of both the fixed rate and a semiannual inflation rate, which could possibly be less than the fixed rate or negative in deflationary situations. In all cases, however, the composite rate will always be greater than or equal to 0.00%.
[73 FR 65543, Nov. 4, 1008]
§ 359.11
What is the semiannual inflation rate?
The index used to determine the semiannual inflation rate is the non-seasonally adjusted CPI-U (the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers for the U.S. City Average for All Items, 1982-84 = 100) published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the U.S. Department of Labor. (For further information on CPI-U considerations,
see
appendix C to part 359 at section 1.) The semiannual inflation rate reflects the percentage change, if any, in the CPI-U over a six-month period. We announce this rate twice a year, in May
and November. The semiannual inflation rate we announced in May 2002 reflects the percentage change between the CPI-U figures from the preceding March 2002 and September 2001. The rate of change over the six-month period, if any, will be expressed as a percentage, rounded to the nearest one-hundredth of one percent. More specifically, the semiannual inflation rate will be determined by the following formula (the resulting rate will be rounded to the nearest one-hundredth of one percent):
Semiannual inflation rate = (CPI − U
Current
− CPI − U
Prior
) ÷ CPI −U
Prior
§ 359.12
What happens in deflationary conditions?
In certain deflationary situations, the semiannual inflation rate may be negative. Negative semiannual inflation rates will be used in the same way as positive semiannual inflation rates. However, if the semiannual inflation rate is negative to the extent that it completely offsets the fixed rate of return, the redemption value of a Series I bond for any particular month will not be less than the value for the preceding month.
§ 359.13
What are composite rates?
Composite rates are single, annual interest rates that reflect the combined effects of the fixed rate and the semiannual inflation rate. The composite rate will always be greater than or equal to 0.00%.
[73 FR 65544, Nov. 4, 1008]
§ 359.14
How are composite rates determined?
Composite rates are set according to the following formula (See appendix A to part 359 for examples of calculations involving composite interest rates.):
Composite rate = {(Fixed rate ÷ 2) + Semiannual inflation rate + [Semiannual inflation rate × (Fixed rate ÷ 2)]} × 2.
2
2
Example for I bonds issued May 2002-October 2002:
Fixed rate = 2.00%
Inflation rate = 0.28%
Composite rate = [0.0200 ÷ 2 + 0.0028 + (0.0028 × 0.0200 ÷ 2)] × 2
Composite rate = [0.0100 + 0.0028 + 0.000028] × 2
Composite rate = 0.012828 × 2
Composite rate = 0.025656
Composite rate = 0.0257 (rounded)
Composite rate = 2.57% (rounded)
§ 359.15
When is the composite rate applied to Series I savings bonds?
The most recently announced composite rate applies to a bond during its next semiannual rate period. A bond's semiannual rate periods are consecutive six-month periods, the first of which begins with the bond's issue date. This means that there can be a delay of several months from the time of a composite rate announcement to the time that rate determines interest earnings for a bond. For example, if you purchased a bond in April, its semiannual rate periods begin every April and October. At the beginning of the semiannual rate period in April, the most recently announced composite rate would have been the rate we announced the previous November. This rate will determine interest earnings for your bond for the next six months, through the end of September. At the beginning of the semiannual rate period in October, the most recently announced composite rate would be the rate announced the previous May. This rate will determine interest earnings for your bond through the end of the following March. However, if you purchased a bond instead in May, its semiannual rate periods begin in May and November. Therefore, the composite rates announced in May and November will apply immediately to this bond. (See appendix C to part 359 at § 2 for a discussion of rate lag.)
§ 359.16
When does interest accrue on Series I savings bonds?
(a) Interest, if any, accrues on the first day of each month; that is, we add the interest earned on a bond during any given month to its value at the beginning of the following month.
(b) The accrued interest compounds semiannually.
§ 359.17
When is interest payable on Series I savings bonds?
Interest earnings are payable upon redemption.
§ 359.18
Is the determination of the Secretary on rates and values final?
The Secretary's determination of fixed rates of return, semiannual inflation rates, composite rates, and savings bonds redemption values is final and conclusive.
§ 359.19
How is interest calculated?
We base all calculations of interest on a $25 unit. We use the value of this unit to determine the value of bonds in higher denominations. The effect of rounding off the value of the $25 unit increases at higher denominations. This can work to your slight advantage or disadvantage, depending on whether we round the value up or down.
3
3
For example: A composite rate of 2.57% will result in a newly purchased $25 unit increasing in value after six months to $25.32, when rounded to the nearest cent. Thus, a $5,000 bond purchased at the same time as the $25 unit will be worth $5,064 after six months ([$5,000 divided by $25] × $25.32 = $5,064.) In contrast, if it applied directly to a $5,000 bond, the rate would render a value of $5,064.25 after six months, a difference of 25 cents. (This example does not include any discussion of the three-month interest penalty that applies if you redeem a bond less than five years after its issue date.)

The bond must meet the requirements for payment specified in part 360. You must establish your identity and entitlement to redemption to the satisfaction of the agent, in accordance with our instructions and identification guidelines, and must sign and complete the request for payment.
§ 359.39
How are redemption values calculated for definitive Series I savings bonds?
We determine the redemption value of a definitive savings bonds for the accrual date (the first day of each month) by first determining the composite rate as defined in § 359.13. If the result of the composite rate calculation is a negative value, zero will be the assumed composite rate in the redemption value calculation. Redemption values are calculated using the following formula (For examples of the calculation, see appendix A to part 359):
FV = PV × {[1 + (CR ÷ 2)] (
m ÷ 6
)}
Where:
FV (future value) = redemption value on the accrual date rounded to the nearest cent without consideration of penalty.
PV (present value) = redemption value at the beginning of the semiannual rate period calculated without consideration of penalty. For bonds that are older than five years, PV will equal the redemption value at the start of the semiannual rate period.
CR = composite rate converted to decimal form by dividing by 100.
m = number of full calendar months elapsed during the semiannual rate period.
§ 359.40
How can I find out what my definitive Series I savings bonds are worth?
(a)

# Appendix A to Part 359—Redemption Value Calculations

# 1. What are some general tax considerations?
Interest on savings bonds is subject to taxes imposed under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The bonds are exempt from taxation by any State or political subdivision of a State, except for estate or inheritance taxes. (See 31 U.S.C. 3124.)

# 2. What is an example of a book-entry Series I savings bonds redemption value calculation?
Assume a New Treasury Direct par investment amount in a book-entry Series I savings bonds of $34.59, with an issue date of May, 2001, and a redemption date of December, 2001. The published CRV for a definitive $100 Series I savings bonds issued May, 2001 and redeemed December, 2001 = $101.96.
Calculation:
[(Book-entry par investment) ÷ (100)] × CRV value for $100 bond
[(34.59 ÷ 100)] × 101.96
[0.3459] × 101.96

# Appendix C to Part 359—Investment Considerations
1. What are some index contingencies?
(a) If a previously reported CPI-U is revised, we will continue to use the previously reported CPI-U in calculating redemption values.
(b) If the CPI-U is rebased to a different year, we will continue to use the CPI-U based on the base reference period in effect when the security was first issued, as long as that CPI-U continues to be published.
(c) If, while an inflation-indexed savings bonds is outstanding, the applicable CPI-U is discontinued or, in the judgment of the Secretary, fundamentally altered in a manner materially adverse to the interests of an investor in the security, or, in the judgment of the Secretary, altered by legislation or Executive Order in a manner materially adverse to the interests of an investor in the security, Treasury, after consulting with the Bureau of Labor Statistics or any successor agency, will substitute an appropriate alternative index. Treasury will then notify the
public of the substitute index and how it will be applied. The Secretary's determinations in this regard will be final.
(d) If the CPI-U for a particular month is not reported by the last day of the following month, we will announce an index number based on the last 12-month change in the CPI-U available. Any calculations of our payment obligations on the inflation-indexed savings bonds that rely on that month's CPI-U will be based on the index number that we have announced.
2. How will inflation lag affect my Series I savings bonds?
The inflation rate component of investor earnings will be determined twice each year. This rate will be the percentage change in the CPI-U for the six months ending each March and September. The rate will be included in the composite rate that is announced each May and November. For Series I bonds offered from September 1, 1998, through October 31, 1998, the inflation rate component of investor earnings will be the percentage change in the CPI-U for the six months ending March 31, 1998. This rate will be included in the composite rate that is announced for Series I bonds offered effective from September 1, 1998, through October 31, 1998. In the event the Secretary, or the Secretary's designee, announces a composite rate at an effective date other than May 1 or November 1, the announcement will specify the period to be used to calculate the semiannual inflation rate. Each composite rate will be effective for the entirety of the applicable rate period that begins while the rate is in effect. Thus, an inflation rate may affect interest accruals from 3 to 13 months from the date that the CPI-U is measured.

# Example 1.
The inflation rate determined from the CPI-U for the six-month period from October, 2003, through March, 2004, will be included in the composite rate announced in May, 2004. For a bond purchased in May 1999, this rate would go into effect immediately, since a new semiannual rate period for this bond will begin in May, 2004. Series I bonds issued in May begin new semiannual rate periods in the months of May and November. In this example, the inflation rate will have its earliest impact in June 2004, when interest from May accrues, three months after the end of the six-month CPI-U period that ends in March, 2004.

# Example 2.
The May 1, 2004, rate will apply similarly to a bond purchased in October 1999. Series I bonds issued in October begin new semiannual rate periods in the months of April and October. Thus, for this bond, the May 1, 2004, composite rate (which includes the inflation rate) will not go into effect until a new semiannual rate period begins on October 1, 2004. This rate, therefore, will determine the inflation-indexed portion of each interest accrual from November, 2004, through April, 2005. In this example, the inflation rate will have its latest impact in April 2005, 13 months following the six-month CPI-U period that ended March 31, 2004.
Pt. 359, App. D

# Appendix D to Part 359—Tax Considerations
1. What are some general tax considerations?
General.
Interest is subject to all taxes imposed under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The bonds are also subject to Federal and State estate, inheritance, gift, or other excise taxes. The bonds are exempt from all other taxation by any State or local taxing authority.
2. What reporting methods are available for savings bonds?
(a)
Reporting methods.
You may use either of the following two methods for reporting the increase in the redemption value of the bond for Federal income tax purposes:
(1)
Cash basis method.
You may defer reporting the increase to the year of final maturity, redemption, or other disposition, whichever is earliest; or
(2)
Accrual basis method.
You may elect to report the increase each year, in which case the election applies to all Series I bonds that you then own, those subsequently acquired, and to any other obligations purchased on a discount basis, such as savings bonds of Series E or EE.
(b)
Changing methods.
If you use the cash basis method, you may change to the accrual basis method without obtaining permission from the Internal Revenue Service. However, once you elect to use the accrual basis method in paragraph (a)(2), you may change the method of reporting the increase only by following the specific procedures prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service for making an automatic method change. For further information, you may contact the Internal Revenue Service director for your area, or the Internal Revenue Service, Washington, DC 20224.
3. What transactions have potential tax consequences?
The following types of transactions, among others, may have potential tax consequences:
(a) A reissue that affects the rights of any of the persons named on a definitive Series I savings bonds may have tax consequences for the owner.
(b) The transfer of a book-entry Series I savings bonds from one owner to another may have tax consequences for the purchaser.
(c) The redemption of a book-entry Series I savings bonds by the secondary owner may have tax consequences for the primary owner.
(d) The purchase of a Series I savings bonds as a gift may have gift tax consequences for the purchaser.

Subject to any limitations or restrictions contained in these regulations on the right of any person to be named as owner, coowner, or beneficiary, bonds should be registered as indicated in this section.

(1)
Single ownership form.
A bond may be registered in the name of one individual.

[63 FR 38049, July 14, 1998, as amended at 72 FR 67854, Dec. 3, 2007]
§ 360.11
Computation of amount.
(a)

The purchases of bonds in the name of any person in an individual capacity are computed separately from purchases in a fiduciary capacity, e.g., as representative for the estate of an individual.

Bonds included in computation.
In computing the purchases for each person, the following outstanding bonds are included:
(1) All bonds registered in the name and bearing the taxpayer identifying number of that person alone;
(2) All bonds registered in the name of the representative of the estate of that person and bearing that person's taxpayer identifying number; and

Under the conditions specified in § 360.90, the Commissioner of the Fiscal Service may permit excess purchases to stand in any particular case or class of cases.
§ 360.13
Employee plans—Conditions of eligibility.
(a)
Definition of plan.
Employee thrift, savings, vacation, 401(k), and similar plans are contributory plans established by the employer for the exclusive and irrevocable benefit of its employees or their beneficiaries. Each plan must afford employees the means of making regular savings from their wages through payroll deductions and provide for employer contributions to be added to these savings.
(b)
Definition of terms used in this section.
(1) The term
assets
means all the employees' contributions and assets purchased with them and the employer's contributions and assets purchased with them, as well as accretions, such as dividends on stock, the increment in value on bonds and all other income; but, notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the right to demand and receive all assets credited to the account of an employee shall not be construed to require the distribution of assets in kind when it would not be possible or practicable to make such a distribution; for example, Series I bonds may not be reissued in unauthorized denominations.
(2) The word
beneficiary
means:
(i) The person or persons, if any, designated by the employee in accordance with the terms of the plan to receive the benefits of the plan upon the employee's death; or
(ii) The estate of the employee.
(c)
Conditions of eligibility.
An employee plan must conform to the following rules in order to be eligible for the special limitation provided in § 360.10.
(1)
Crediting of assets.
All assets of a plan must be credited to the individual accounts of participating employees and may be distributed only to them or their beneficiaries, except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
(2)
Purchase of bonds.
Bonds may be purchased only with assets credited to the accounts of participating employees and only if the amount taken from any account at any time for that purpose is equal to the purchase price of a $50 bond or bonds in an authorized denomination or denominations, and shares in the bonds are credited to the accounts of the individuals from which the purchase price was derived, in amounts corresponding with their shares. For example, if $100 credited to the account of John Jones is commingled with funds credited to the accounts of other employees to make a total of $5,000 with which a Series I bond in the denomination of $5,000 (face amount) is purchased in December 1998 and registered in the name and title of the trustee, the plan must provide, in effect, that John Jones' account be credited to show that he is the owner of a Series I bond in the denomination of $100 (face amount) bearing an issue date of December 1, 1998.
(3)
Irrevocable right of withdrawal.
Each participating employee has an irrevocable right to request and receive from the trustee all assets credited to the employee's account (or their value, if the employee prefers) without regard to any conditions other than the loss or suspension of the privilege of participating further in the plan. A plan may limit or modify such right in any manner required for qualification of the plan under section 401 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (26 U.S.C. 401).
(4)
Rights of beneficiary.
Upon the death of an employee, his or her beneficiary shall have the absolute and unconditional right to demand and receive from the trustee all assets credited to the account of the employee or their value, if he or she so prefers.
(5)
Reissue or payment upon distribution.
(i) When settlement is made with an employee or his or her beneficiary with respect to any bond registered in the name and title of the plan trustee in which the employee has a share, the bond must be paid or reissued to the extent of the share.
(ii) If an employee or the beneficiary is to receive distribution in kind, bonds bearing the same issue dates as those credited to the employee's account will be reissued in the name of the employee or the employee's beneficiary to the extent entitled, in authorized denominations, in any authorized form of registration, upon the request and certification of the trustee.
(d)
Application for special limitation.
A trustee of an employee plan who desires to purchase bonds under the special limitation should submit to the designated Federal Reserve Bank or Branch a copy of:
(1) The plan;
(2) Any instructions issued under the plan that concern Series I bonds; and
(3) The trust agreement, in order to establish the plan's eligibility.
(e)
Vacation plans.
Savings bonds may be purchased under certain vacation plans. Questions concerning the eligibility of these plans to purchase bonds in excess of the general limitation should be addressed to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Parkersburg, WV 26106-1328.

General.

All provisions of this subpart are subject to these restrictions, except as provided in § 360.24.
(b) The Department of the Treasury will recognize a claim against an owner of a savings bond and conflicting claims of ownership of, or interest in, a bond between coowners or between the registered owner and the beneficiary, if established by valid, judicial proceedings specifically listed in this subpart. Escheat proceedings will not be recognized under this subpart. Section 360.23 specifies evidence required to establish the validity of judicial proceedings. Treasury may require any other evidence to establish the validity of judicial proceedings, such as evidence that the proceeding provided due process, complied with this part, and complied with relevant state law.
(c) The Department of the Treasury and the agencies that issue, reissue, or redeem savings bonds will not accept a notice of an adverse claim or notice of pending judicial proceedings, nor undertake to protect the interests of a litigant not in possession of a savings bond.
[63 FR 38049, July 14, 1998, as amended at 80 FR 80265, Dec. 24, 2015]
§ 360.21
Payment to judgment creditors.
(a)
Purchaser or officer under levy.
The Department of the Treasury will pay (but not reissue) a savings bond to the purchaser at a sale under a levy or to the officer authorized under appropriate process to levy upon property of the registered owner or coowner to satisfy a money judgment. Payment will be made only to the extent necessary to satisfy the money judgment. The
amount paid is limited to the redemption value 60 days after the termination of the judicial proceedings. Except in the case of a levy by the Internal Revenue Service, payment of a bond registered in coownership form pursuant to a judgment or a levy against only one coowner is limited to the extent of that coowner's interest in the bond. That interest must be established by an agreement between the coowners or by a judgment, decree, or order of a court in a proceeding to which both coowners are parties. Payment of a bond registered in coownership form pursuant to a levy by the Internal Revenue Service will be made if the levy is against either coowner on the bond.
(b)
Trustee in bankruptcy, receiver, or similar court officer.
The Department of the Treasury will pay, at current redemption value, a savings bond to a trustee in bankruptcy, a receiver of an insolvent's estate, a receiver in equity, or a similar court officer under the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section.
§ 360.22
Payment or reissue pursuant to divorce.
(a)
Divorce.
(1) The Department of the Treasury will recognize a divorce decree that ratifies or confirms a property settlement agreement disposing of bonds or that otherwise settles the interests of the parties in a bond. Reissue of a savings bond may be made to eliminate the name of one spouse as owner, coowner, or beneficiary or to substitute the name of one spouse for that of the other spouse as owner, coowner, or beneficiary pursuant to the decree. However, if the bond is registered in the name of one spouse with another person as coowner, there must be submitted either:
(i) A request for reissue by the other person; or
(ii) a certified copy of a judgment, decree, or court order entered in proceedings to which the other person and the spouse named on the bond are parties, determining the extent of the interest of that spouse in the bond. Reissue will be permitted only to the extent of that spouse's interest.
(2) The evidence required under § 360.23 must be submitted in every case. When the divorce decree does not set out the terms of the property settlement agreement, a certified copy of the agreement must be submitted. Payment, rather than reissue, will be made if requested.
(b)
Date for determining rights.
When payment or reissue under this section is to be made, the rights of the parties will be those existing under the regulations current at the time of the entry of the final judgment, decree, or court order.
§ 360.23
Evidence.
(a)
General.
To establish the validity of judicial proceedings, certified copies of the final judgment, decree, or court order, and of any necessary supplementary proceedings, must be submitted. If the judgment, decree, or court order was rendered more than six months prior to the presentation of the bond, there must also be submitted a certification from the clerk of the court, under court seal, dated within six months of the presentation of the bond, showing that the judgment, decree, or court order is in full force.
(b)
Trustee in bankruptcy or receiver of an insolvent's estate.
A request for payment by a trustee in bankruptcy or a receiver of an insolvent's estate must be supported by appropriate evidence of appointment and qualification. The evidence must be certified by the clerk of the court, under court seal, as being in full force on a date that is not more than six months prior to the presentation of the bond.
(c)
Receiver in equity or similar court officer.
A request for payment by a receiver in equity or a similar court officer, other than a receiver of an insolvent's estate, must be supported by a copy of an order that authorizes the presentation of the bond for redemption, certified by the clerk of the court, under court seal, as being in full force on a date that is not more than six months prior to the presentation of the bond.

Surrender for payment.

Procedure for definitive bonds of Series I presented at authorized paying agents.
The owner, coowner, or other person entitled to payment of a definitive Series I bond may present the bond to an authorized paying agent for redemption. The presenter must establish his or her identity and entitlement to payment in accordance with Treasury instructions and identification guidelines. The presenter must sign the request for payment on the bond or, if authorized, on a separate detached request, and add his or her address. If the request for payment has been signed, or signed and certified, before presentation of the bond, the paying agent must be satisfied that the person presenting the bond for payment is the owner, coowner, or other person entitled to payment, and may require the person to sign the request for payment again. If the bond is in order for payment, the paying agent will make payment at the current redemption value without charge to the presenter. Paying agents are not authorized to process any case involving partial redemption.
(b)
Procedure for all other cases.
In the case of definitive bonds to which the procedure in paragraph (a) of this section, does not apply, or if otherwise preferred, the owner or coowner, or other person entitled to payment should establish his or her identity to the satisfaction of an officer authorized by the regulations in this part to certify requests for payment, sign the requests for payment, and provide delivery information for the payment. The bonds must be forwarded to a designated Federal Reserve Bank or Branch or the Bureau of the Fiscal Service. Usually, payment will be expedited by submission to a designated Federal Reserve Bank or Branch. In all cases, the cost and risk of presentation of a bond will be borne by the owner. Payment will be made to the registered owner or other person entitled and will be delivered according to the instructions of the owner or the other person entitled and the regulations in this part.
(c)
Date of request.
Requests executed more than six months before the date of receipt of a bond for payment will
not be accepted. Neither will a bond be accepted if payment is requested as of a date more than three months in the future.
§ 360.40
Special provisions for payment.
(a)
Owner's signature not required.
A bond may be paid by a paying agent or a designated Federal Reserve Bank or Branch without the owner's signature to the request for payment if the bond bears the special endorsement of a paying agent specifically qualified to place such an endorsement on savings bonds.
(b)
Signature by mark.
A signature by mark (X) must be witnessed by at least one disinterested person and a certifying officer. See subpart I of this part. The witness must attest to the signature by mark substantially as follows: “Witness to signature by mark”, followed by his or her signature and address.

Jones Smith (Mary T. J. Smith or Mary T. Smith) changed by marriage from Mary T. Jones”, or “John R. Young, changed by order of court from Hans R. Jung”. See § 360.50.

(2) The power of attorney must grant, by its terms, authority for the attorney-in-fact to sell or redeem the grantor's securities, sell his or her personal property, or otherwise contain similar authority; and
(3) In the case of a grantor who has become incapacitated, the power of attorney must conform with pertinent provisions of State law concerning its durability. Generally, in such circumstances, the power of attorney should provide that the authority granted will not be affected by the subsequent incompetence or incapacity of the grantor. Medical evidence or other proof of the grantor's condition may be required in any case.
§ 360.41
Partial redemption.
A bond may be redeemed in part at current redemption value, but only in amounts corresponding to authorized denominations, upon surrender of the bond to a designated Federal Reserve Bank or Branch or to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service in accordance with § 360.39(b). In any case in which partial redemption is requested, the phrase “to the extent of $_____ (face amount) and reissue of the remainder” should be added to the request. Upon partial redemption of the bond, the remainder will be reissued as of the original issue date, as provided in subpart H of this part.
§ 360.42
Nonreceipt or loss of remittance issued in payment.
If a remittance in payment of the redemption value of a bond surrendered for redemption is not received within a reasonable time or is lost after receipt, notice should be given to the same agency to which the bond was surrendered for payment. The notice should give the date the bond was surrendered for payment and describe the bond by series, denomination, serial number, and registration, including the taxpayer identifying number of the owner.

Withdrawal on behalf of deceased owner or incompetent.
A request for payment may be withdrawn under the same conditions as in paragraph (a) of this section by the executor or administrator of the estate of a deceased owner or by the person or persons who could have been entitled to the bond under subpart K of this part, or by the legal representative of the estate of a person under legal disability, unless surrender of the bond for payment has eliminated the interest of a surviving coowner or beneficiary. See § 360.70(b) and (c).

General.
Reissue of a bond may be made only under the conditions specified in these regulations, and only at: A designated Federal Reserve Bank or Branch, or the Bureau of the Fiscal Service. Reissue will not be made if the request is received less than one full calendar month before the maturity date of a bond. See 31 CFR part 359.

(a) If the owner of a savings bond is a minor and the form of registration does not indicate that there is a representative of his or her estate, and if the minor is not of sufficient competency to sign the request for payment and to understand the nature of the transaction, payment will be made to either parent with whom the minor resides or to whom legal custody has been granted. If the minor does not reside with either parent, payment will be made to the person who furnishes the chief support for the minor.
(b) The request must appear on the back of the bond in one of the following forms:
(1) Request by parent:
I certify that I am the mother of John C. Jones (with whom he resides) (to whom legal custody has been granted). He is __ years of age and is not of sufficient understanding to make this request.
Mary Jones on behalf of John C. Jones

§ 360.64
Payment or reinvestment—voluntary guardian of an incapacitated person.
(a)
Payment of bonds.
(1) When an adult owner of bonds is incapable of requesting payment as a result of incapacity and there is no other person legally qualified to do so, the relative, or other person, responsible for the owner's care and support may submit an application for recognition as voluntary guardian for the purpose of redeeming the owner's bonds, if the total redemption value of all of the owner's bonds does not exceed $20,000. The bonds and application should be submitted to a designated Federal Reserve Bank or the Bureau of the Fiscal Service.
(2) The redemption value of the bonds shall be determined as of the date the bonds are received, accompanied by an appropriate request for payment. If the total redemption value exceeds $20,000, a legal representative must be appointed, as set forth in § 360.60.
(b)
Reinvestment of bonds.
(1) If the bonds have matured and ceased earning interest, they may be redeemed and the proceeds reinvested in any other savings bonds available. The new bonds must be registered in the name of the incapacitated person, followed by words showing that he or she is under voluntary guardianship; for example, “John Jones 123-45-6789, under voluntary guardianship”. A living coowner or beneficiary named on the matured bonds must be designated on the new bonds, unless such person furnishes a certified statement consenting to omission of his or her name.
(2) If an amount insufficient to purchase an additional bond of any authorized denomination of savings bond remains after the reinvestment, the voluntary guardian may furnish additional funds sufficient to purchase another savings bond of the lowest available denomination. If additional funds are not furnished, the remaining amount will be paid to the voluntary guardian for the use and benefit of the incapacitated person.
§ 360.65
Reissue.
A bond on which a minor or other person under legal disability is named as the owner or coowner, or in which he or she has an interest, may be reissued under the following conditions, but only in accordance with subpart H of this part:
(a) A minor for whose estate no representative has been appointed may request reissue if the minor is of sufficient competency to sign his or her name to the request and to understand the nature of the transaction.
(b) Except to the extent provided in paragraph (a) of this section, reissue will be restricted to a form of registration which does not adversely affect the existing ownership or interest of a minor or other person under legal disability. Requests for reissue should be executed by the person authorized to request payment under §§ 360.60 and 360.63, or the person who may request recognition as voluntary guardian under § 360.64.

# Subpart K—Deceased Owner, Coowner or Beneficiary
§ 360.70
General rules governing entitlement.
The rules in this section govern ownership or entitlement where one or both of the persons named on a bond have died without the bond having been surrendered for payment or reissue. Appropriate proof of death will be required.
(a)
Single owner bond.
If the owner of a bond registered in single ownership form has died, the bond becomes the property of that decedent's estate, and payment or reissue will be made as provided in this subpart.
(b)
Coowner bond
—(1)
One coowner deceased.
If one of the coowners named on a bond has died, the surviving coowner will be recognized as the sole and absolute owner, and payment or reissue will be made as though the bond were registered in the name of the survivor alone. Any request for reissue by the surviving coowner must be supported by proof of death of the other coowner.
(2)
Both coowners deceased.
If both coowners named on a bond have died, the bond becomes the property of the estate of the coowner who died last, and payment or reissue will be made as if the bond were registered in the name of the last deceased coowner alone. Proof
of death of both coowners will be required to establish the order of death.
(3)
Simultaneous death of both coowners.
If both coowners die under conditions where it cannot be established, either by presumption of law or otherwise, which coowner died first, the bond becomes the property of the estates of both equally, and payment or reissue will be made accordingly.
(c)
Beneficiary bond
—(1)
Owner deceased.
If the owner of a bond registered in beneficiary form has died and is survived by the beneficiary, upon proof of death of the owner, the beneficiary will be recognized as the sole and absolute owner of the bond. Payment or reissue will be made as though the bond were registered in the survivor's name alone. A request for payment or reissue by the beneficiary must be supported by proof of death of the owner.
(2)
Beneficiary deceased.
If the beneficiary's death occurs before, or simultaneously with, that of the registered owner, payment or reissue will be made as though the bond were registered in the owner's name alone. Proof of death of the owner and beneficiary is required to establish the order of death.
(d)
Nonresident aliens.
If the person who becomes entitled to a bond because of the death of an owner is an alien who is a resident of an area with respect to which the Department of the Treasury restricts or regulates the delivery of remittances, including checks and electronic payments, drawn against funds of the United States or its agencies or instrumentalities, delivery of the redemption payment will not be made so long as the restriction applies. See Department of the Treasury Circular No. 655, current revision (31 CFR part 211).
[63 FR 38049, July 14, 1998, as amended at 70 FR 57432, Sept. 30, 2005]
§ 360.71
Decedent's estate.
(a)
Estate is being administered.
(1) A legal representative of a deceased owner's estate may request payment of savings bonds to the estate, or may distribute the savings bonds to the persons entitled.
(2) Appropriate proof of appointment for the legal representative of the estate is required. Letters of appointment must be dated not more than one year prior to the date of submission of the letters of appointment.
(b)
Estate has been settled previously.
If the estate has been settled previously through judicial proceedings, the persons entitled may request payment or reissue of the savings bonds. A certified copy of the court-approved final accounting for the estate, the court's decree of distribution, or other appropriate evidence is required.
(c)
Special provisions under the law of the jurisdiction of the decedent's domicile.
If there is no formal or regular administration and no representative of the estate is to be appointed, the person appointed to receive or distribute the assets of a decedent's estate without regular administration under applicable local law summary or small estates procedures may request payment or reissue of savings bonds. Appropriate evidence is required.
(d)
When administration is required.
If the total redemption value of the Treasury securities and undelivered payments, if any, held directly on our records that are the property of the decedent's estate is greater than $100,000, administration of the decedent's estate will be required. The redemption value of savings bonds and the principal amount of marketable securities will be used to determine the value of securities, and will be determined as of the date of death. Administration may also be required at the discretion of the Department for any case.
(e)
Voluntary representative for small estates that are not being otherwise administered
—(1)
General.
A voluntary representative is a person qualified according to paragraph (e)(3) of this section, to request payment or distribution of a decedent's savings bonds. The voluntary representative procedures are for the convenience of the Department; entitlement to the decedent's savings bonds and held payments, if any, is determined by the law of the jurisdiction in which the decedent was domiciled at the date of death. Voluntary representative procedures may be used only if:
(i) There has been no administration, no administration is contemplated, and no summary or small estate procedures
under applicable local law have been used;
(ii) The total redemption value of the Treasury securities and held payments, if any, held directly on our records that are the property of the decedent's estate is $100,000 or less as of the date of death; and
(iii) There is a person eligible to serve as the voluntary representative according to paragraph (e)(3) of this section.
(2)
Authority of voluntary representative.
A voluntary representative may:
(i) Redeem the decedent's savings bonds that are eligible for redemption on behalf of the persons entitled by the law of the jurisdiction in which the decedent was domiciled at the date of death;
(ii) Distribute the decedent's savings bonds to the persons entitled by the law of the jurisdiction in which the decedent was domiciled at the date of death.
(3)
Order of precedence for voluntary representative.
An individual eighteen years of age or older may act as a voluntary representative according to the following order of precedence: A surviving spouse; if there is no surviving spouse, then a child of the decedent; if there are none of the above, then a descendant of a deceased child of the decedent; if there are none of the above, then a parent of the decedent; if there are none of the above, then a brother or sister of the decedent; if there are none of the above, then a descendant of a deceased brother or sister of the decedent; if there are none of the above, then a next of kin of the decedent, as determined by the law of the jurisdiction in which the decedent was domiciled at the date of death. As used in this order of precedence, child means a natural or adopted child of the decedent.
(4)
Liability.
By serving, the voluntary representative warrants that the distribution of payments or savings bonds is to the persons entitled by the law of the jurisdiction in which the decedent was domiciled at the date of death. The United States is not liable to any person for the improper distribution of payments or securities. Upon payment or distribution of the securities at the request of the voluntary representative, the United States is released to the same extent as if it had paid or delivered to a representative of the estate appointed pursuant to the law of the jurisdiction in which the decedent was domiciled at the date of death. The voluntary representative shall indemnify and hold harmless the United States and all creditors and persons entitled to the estate of the decedent. The amount of the indemnification is limited to an amount no greater than the value received by the voluntary representative.
(f)
Creditor.
If there has been no administration, no administration is contemplated, no summary or small estate procedures under applicable local law have been used, and there is no person eligible to serve as a voluntary representative pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section, then a creditor may make a claim for payment of the amount of the debt, providing the debt has not been barred by applicable local law.

§ 360.72
[Reserved]

# Subpart L—Fiduciaries
§ 360.75
Payment or reissue during the existence of the fiduciary estate.
(a)
Request from the fiduciaries named in the registration.
A request for reissue or payment signed by at least one, but less than all, of the fiduciaries named in the registration shall be deemed sufficient and acceptable proof that less than all of the fiduciaries may properly execute the request. If the fiduciaries named in the registration are still acting, no further evidence will be required. In other cases, i.e., cases in which the fiduciary is not designated by name and title in the bond registration or a fiduciary designated in the bond registration is no longer acting, the request must be made in accordance with subparts J and K of this part.
(b)
Corporate fiduciaries.
If a bond is registered in the name of a public or private corporation, such as a financial institution, or a governmental body as fiduciary, the request must be signed by an authorized officer in the name of the organization as fiduciary. Ordinarily, a signed and certified request
will be accepted without further evidence.
(c)
Trustee of a common trust fund.
A bond held by a financial institution as a trustee may be reissued in the name of the institution as trustee of its common trust fund to the extent that participation in the common trust fund is authorized by law or regulation. The request for reissue should be executed by the institution and any co-trustee.
(d)
Successor fiduciary.
If the fiduciary in whose name the bond is registered has been replaced by another fiduciary, a properly executed form or satisfactory evidence of successorship should be furnished.
§ 360.76
Payment or reissue after termination of the fiduciary estate.
A bond registered in the name or title of a fiduciary may be paid or reissued to the person who has become entitled by reason of the termination of an estate, other than a decedent's estate (see subpart K of this part). Requests for reissue made by a fiduciary pursuant to the termination of a fiduciary estate should be made on the appropriate form. Requests for payment or reissue by other than the fiduciary must be accompanied by evidence to show that the person has become entitled in accordance with applicable State law or otherwise. When two or more persons have become entitled, the request for payment or reissue must be signed by each of them.

# Subpart M—Escheat and Unclaimed Property Claims by States
§ 360.77
Payment to a State claiming title to abandoned bonds.
(a)
General.
The Department of the Treasury may, in its discretion, recognize an escheat judgment that purports to vest a State with title to a definitive savings bond that has stopped earning interest and is in the State's possession, when the State presents evidence satisfactory to Treasury that the bond has been abandoned by all persons entitled to payment under Treasury regulations. A State claiming title to a definitive savings bond as the heir to a deceased owner must comply with the requirements of subpart L of this part, and not this section. Treasury will not recognize an escheat judgment that purports to vest a State with title to a bond that is still earning interest. Treasury also will not recognize an escheat judgment that purports to vest a State with title to a bond that the State does not possess, or a judgment that purports to grant the State custody of a bond, but not title.
(b)
Due process.
At a minimum, a State requesting payment under this section must demonstrate to Treasury's satisfaction that it made reasonable efforts to provide actual and constructive notice of the escheat proceeding to all persons listed on the face of the bond and all persons who may have an interest in the bond, and that those persons had an opportunity to be heard before the escheat judgment was entered.
(c)
Fulfillment of obligation.
Payment to a State claiming title under this section fulfills the United States' obligations to the same extent as if payment had been made to the registered owner.

# Subpart B—General Provisions Governing Securities Held in TreasuryDirect
§§ 363.7-363.8
[Reserved]
§ 363.9
What does this subpart cover?
This subpart provides general rules governing securities held within the TreasuryDirect ® system. Provisions in the subparts governing specific securities that conflict with these general rules will supersede these general rules.
[70 FR 57433, Sept. 30, 2005]
§ 363.10
What is a TreasuryDirect ® account?
A TreasuryDirect account is an online account maintained by us solely in your name in which you may hold and conduct transactions in eligible book-entry Treasury securities.
(a)
Primary account.
The primary account is the account that you establish when initially opening your TreasuryDirect account. The primary account may contain the following Treasury securities:
(1)
Individual.
A primary account for an individual may contain Treasury securities purchased initially as book-entry securities that are your personal holdings registered in single owner, owner with beneficiary, and primary owner with secondary owner forms of registration; gifts of savings bonds that have not yet been delivered; and converted savings bonds that were transferred from the conversion linked account.
(2)
Entities.
A primary account for an entity may contain Treasury securities purchased initially as book-entry securities registered in the name of the entity and converted savings bonds in the name of the entity that were transferred from the conversion linked account.
(b)
Linked account.
A linked account is an account that is a separate account from your primary account, but that is connected to your primary account. You use your primary account as a portal to open and access the linked account. Linked accounts include the following:
(1)
Custom account.
A custom account is an account that is linked to your primary account. You use your primary account as the portal to open and access your custom account. You may informally designate a purpose for the custom account, for example, “vacation fund”, or “Johnny's college fund”. However, the designation as to purpose has no legal effect; the registration of the securities held in the custom account determines ownership (Annual
purchase limitations include securities held in custom accounts). You, as an individual owner, may use your custom account to buy, redeem, and transfer securities that you own in single owner, owner with beneficiary, and primary owner with secondary owner forms of registration. An individual owner may also buy and deliver gift savings bonds from the custom account. An entity account manager, acting on behalf of an entity, may use the entity's custom account to buy, redeem, and transfer securities registered in the entity form of registration.
(2)
Minor account.
A minor account is an account established by an individual custodian for an individual who has not yet reached the age of 18 years. We do not permit an entity to open a minor account. A minor account is linked to the custodian's primary account. The minor is the owner of the securities, but the custodian controls the account on behalf of the minor. (See § 363.27 for more information about minor accounts.)
(3)
Conversion account
means a linked account in TreasuryDirect that contains only savings bonds that have been converted from definitive bonds to book-entry bonds.
(c)
Closing an account.
If a TreasuryDirect primary account and all associated linked accounts have had no holdings and no activity for a period of two years, we reserve the right to close the account, along with all linked accounts.

An entity must have a valid SSN or employer identification number. The account owner must have a United States address of record and have an account at a United States depository financial institution that will accept debits and credits using the Automated Clearing House method of payment.
[74 FR 19417, Apr. 29, 2009]

§ 363.20
What do I need to know about the forms of registration that are available for purchases of securities through my TreasuryDirect ® account?
(a)
General principles.
(1) Registration must express the actual ownership of, and interest in, the security. Registration conclusively establishes ownership of a security.
(2) You must provide a last name and a first name for each individual included in the registration of the security.
(3) You must provide the valid taxpayer identification number for each
person named in the registration of the security.
(b)
Forms of registration for individuals.
The forms of registration available for individuals for purchases of securities made through your TreasuryDirect account are single owner, owner with beneficiary, and primary owner with secondary owner, unless the forms of registration available for a security are specifically limited by the subpart governing that security.
(1)
Single owner.
(i) A single owner is the individual named in the registration of a book-entry security or a converted savings bond without a beneficiary, secondary owner, or coowner.
(ii) A single owner may add a beneficiary or secondary owner.
(iii) A single owner may conduct permitted online transactions on securities held in his or her account.
(iv) Upon the death of the single owner, his or her estate is entitled to the security. In determining entitlement, the law of the decedent's domicile will be followed.
(v) Registration example: “John Doe, SSN 123-45-6789.”
(2)
Owner with beneficiary.
(i) The purchaser must be named as the owner with another individual as beneficiary.
(ii) The owner may remove or change the beneficiary without the consent of the beneficiary.
(iii) The owner may conduct permitted online transactions on securities held in his or her account without the consent of the beneficiary.
(iv) The beneficiary has no ownership rights to the security during the owner's lifetime. Upon the death of the owner, the security becomes the property of the surviving beneficiary, despite any attempted testamentary disposition or any applicable local law to the contrary.
(v) If the beneficiary does not survive the owner, the security belongs to the estate of the owner.
(vi) If both the owner and the beneficiary die under conditions where it cannot be established, either by presumption of law or otherwise, who died first, the security is the property of the estate of the owner.
(vii) In order for the beneficiary to obtain the security or the redemption proceeds after the death of the owner, the beneficiary must provide proof of death of the owner. If the beneficiary has a TreasuryDirect account, the security will be transferred to that account. If the beneficiary does not have an account, he or she may establish an account. Alternatively, a beneficiary named on a savings bond may request redemption. If the beneficiary requests redemption, he or she must provide ACH instructions for the payment.
(viii) Registration example: “John Doe, SSN 123-45-6789 POD (payable on death to) Jane Doe, SSN 987-65-4321.”
(3)
Primary owner with secondary owner.

(iii) The primary owner may remove the secondary owner without the consent of the secondary owner.
(iv) The secondary owner has no rights to view or conduct transactions in any security unless the primary owner gives the secondary owner these rights.
(v) The primary owner may give the secondary owner the right to view any security or rights to view and conduct transactions in any security online from the account of the secondary owner.
(vi) Once the right to conduct transactions in a security has been given to the secondary owner, the primary owner may view and conduct transactions in the security from the primary owner's account, and the secondary owner may view and conduct transactions in the security using the secondary owner's own account.
(vii) The primary owner may revoke any rights previously given to the secondary owner at any time.
(viii) Upon the death of either the primary or secondary owner, the security becomes the property of the survivor, despite any attempted testamentary disposition or any applicable local law to the contrary.
(ix) If both the primary and the secondary owner die under conditions where it cannot be established, either by presumption of law or otherwise,
who died first, the security is the property of the estate of the primary owner.
(x) In order for the secondary owner to obtain the security or the security proceeds after the death of the primary owner, the secondary owner must provide proof of death of the primary owner. If the secondary owner has a TreasuryDirect account, the security will be transferred to that account. If the secondary owner does not have an account, he or she may establish an account. Alternatively, a secondary owner named on a savings bond may request redemption. If the secondary owner requests redemption, he or she must provide ACH instructions.
(xi) Registration example: “John Doe, SSN 123-45-6789 with Joseph Doe, SSN 987-65-4321.”

Forms of registration for entities.
The forms of registration available for entities are sole proprietorship; partnership; corporation; limited liability company or professional limited liability company (LLC or PLLC); trust; decedent's estate; and estate of a living person such as an incompetent or a minor.

Sole proprietorship.
A sole proprietorship form of registration is available for an individual who is doing business as a sole proprietor. The entity account manager must be the owner of the business. Registration example: “John Doe DBA Doe Plumbing Supplies, EIN 12-3456789, [or SSN 123-45-6789].”
(2)
Partnership.
A partnership form of registration is available for two or more individuals who are doing business as a partnership, including a limited liability partnership. Unless the name of a partnership includes the word “partnership,” the registration must include descriptive words indicating partnership status. The entity account manager must be a general partner, and must certify that he or she has the authority to act alone on behalf of the partnership with regard to this account. Registration example: “Smith and Jones Construction Company, a partnership, EIN 98-7654321, or SSN 987-65-4321.”

Corporation.
A corporate form of registration is available for an entity that has been incorporated pursuant to state law. The registration must contain a reference to the corporate status. The entity account manager must be a corporate officer or designated employee and must certify that he or she has the authority to act alone on behalf of the corporation with regard to this account. Registration example: “ABC Corporation, EIN 23-4567891.”

A trust form of registration is available. The trust form of registration is not available for trusts in which the trustee is acting on behalf of a federal, state, or local government. The registration must identify the trust with specificity; at a minimum, it must include the authority or document creating the trust, the date the document was executed (except in the case of a probated will when the date is not necessary), the name of a trustee of the trust who is authorized to act alone on behalf of the trust with regard to the account, and any information that is necessary to distinguish the trust from any other trust. The registration may also include the names of additional trustees and the full name of the trust. If one or more of the trustees are individuals, and the entity account manager is an individual trustee, the entity account manager must be named in the registration. If an organization serving as a trustee of the trust will administer this account, the entity account manager must be a duly authorized employee of that organization who has the authority to act alone on behalf of the organization in its role as trustee of the trust with regard to the account, and the organization must be named in the registration. In either
case, the entity account manager must certify that he or she has the authority to act alone on behalf of the trust with regard to the account. Registration examples: “John Doe, Trustee under Declaration of Trust dated January 1, 2001, SSN 123-45-6789”; “First National Bank, Trustee under Agreement with William Jones dated January 1, 2001, EIN 12-3456789”; “John Doe or Sarah Jones, Trustees under Agreement with Jane Doe dated January 1, 2001, SSN 123-45-6789”; “Sarah Jones, Trustee under the Will of Matthew Smith, deceased, SSN 123-45-6789”; “Jane Doe, Trustee of the Doe Family Trust dated January 1, 2001, EIN 12-3456789.”

If such security has been transferred to another TreasuryDirect account, we reserve the right to reverse the transfer, redeem the security, and use the proceeds to reimburse Treasury for the loss. If such security has been redeemed or has matured and the proceeds paid to the account owner, we reserve the right to take any action that we deem appropriate, including redeeming other securities remaining in the account and using the proceeds to reimburse Treasury for the loss.

No action will be taken if the certification is not received by Treasury within 45 days of the erroneous entry. We will only return funds if the erroneous entry was made to an account that does not belong to the intended recipient, is a duplicate payment, is in an amount that is greater than was authorized by the recipient, or was made in error because the employee was not in a pay status. We reserve the right to refuse to return an entry. By requesting that Treasury correct an erroneous entry, the employer agrees to indemnify Treasury for any loss that Treasury may incur as a result of the correction of the error and agrees to provide such information and assistance as Treasury may require.
(c) If a financial institution, except a financial institution acting on behalf of an employer, makes an erroneous ACH credit entry to a TreasuryDirect® account and provides a certification as to the circumstances of the erroneous entry within 6 months of the entry date, we will notify the account owner of the erroneous ACH credit entry and attempt to resolve the issue. We reserve the right to place a hold on and to redeem securities from the TreasuryDirect® account to which the ACH credit entry was made in the amount of the erroneous credit entry and return the funds to the financial institution. The financial institution agrees to indemnify Treasury for any loss that Treasury may incur as a result of the correction of the error and agrees to provide information and assistance as Treasury may require.

§ 363.44
What happens when a TreasuryDirect ® account owner dies and the estate is entitled to securities held in the account?
(a)
Estate is being administered.
For an estate that is being administered, the legal representative of the estate must open a TreasuryDirect account in the name of the estate in order to conduct transactions. The legal representative of the estate may then conduct any transactions that are available to an
individual account owner. We will require appropriate proof of appointment for the legal representative of the estate. Letters of appointment must be dated not more than one year prior to the date of submission of the letters of appointment.
(b)
Estate has been settled previously.
If the estate has been settled previously through judicial proceedings, the persons entitled may request payment of securities, if the securities are eligible for redemption, or may transfer the securities to the TreasuryDirect accounts of the persons entitled, if the securities are eligible for transfer. We will require a certified copy of the court-approved final accounting for the estate, the court's decree of distribution, or other appropriate evidence. If payment is requested, we will require ACH instructions to process the request.
(c)
Special provisions under the law of the jurisdiction of the decedent's domicile.
If there is no formal or regular administration and no representative of the estate is to be appointed, the person appointed to receive or distribute the assets of a decedent's estate without regular administration under summary or small estates procedures under applicable local law may request payment of securities, if the securities are eligible for redemption, or may transfer the securities to or on behalf of the persons entitled by the law of the jurisdiction in which the decedent was domiciled at the date of death, if the securities are eligible for transfer. We will require appropriate evidence. If payment is requested, we will require ACH instructions to process the request.
(d)
When administration is required.
If the total redemption value of the Treasury securities and undelivered payments, if any, held directly on our records that are the property of the decedent's estate is greater than $100,000, administration of the decedent's estate will be required. The redemption value of savings bonds and the principal amount of marketable securities will be used to determine the value of securities, and will be determined as of the date of death. Administration may also be required at the discretion of the Department for any case.
(e)
Voluntary representative for small estates that are not being otherwise administered
—(1)
General.
A voluntary representative is a person qualified according to paragraph (e)(3) of this section, to redeem or transfer a decedent's securities. The voluntary representative procedures are for the convenience of the Department; entitlement to the decedent's securities and held payments, if any, is determined by the law of the jurisdiction in which the decedent was domiciled at the date of death. Voluntary representative procedures may be used only if:
(i) There has been no administration, no administration is contemplated, and no summary or small estate procedures under applicable local law have been used;
(ii) The total redemption value of the Treasury securities and held payments, if any, held directly on our records that are the property of the decedent's estate is $100,000 or less, as of the date of death, and
(iii) There is a person eligible to serve as the voluntary representative according to paragraph (e)(3) of this section.
(2)
Authority of voluntary representative.
A voluntary representative may:
(i) Redeem the decedent's savings bonds that are eligible for redemption. Payment may be made to the voluntary representative on behalf of or directly to the persons entitled by the law of the jurisdiction in which the decedent was domiciled at the date of death;
(ii) Transfer the decedent's securities to the persons entitled by the law of the jurisdiction in which the decedent was domiciled at the date of death.
(3)
Order of precedence for voluntary representative.
An individual eighteen years of age or older may act as a voluntary representative according to the following order of precedence: a surviving spouse; if there is no surviving spouse, then a child of the decedent; if there are none of the above, then a descendant of a deceased child of the decedent; if there are none of the above, then a parent of the decedent; if there are none of the above, then a brother or sister of the decedent; if there are none of the above, then a descendant of
a deceased brother or sister of the decedent; if there are none of the above, then a next of kin of the decedent, as determined by the laws of the decedent's domicile at the date of death. As used in this order of precedence, child means a natural or adopted child of the decedent.
(4)
Liability.
By serving, the voluntary representative warrants that the distribution of payments or securities are to or on behalf of the persons entitled by the law of the jurisdiction in which the decedent was domiciled at the date of death. The United States is not liable to any person for the improper distribution of payments or securities. Upon payment or transfer of the securities to the voluntary representative, the United States is released to the same extent as if it had paid or delivered to a representative of the estate appointed pursuant to the law of the jurisdiction in which the decedent was domiciled at the date of death. The voluntary representative shall indemnify and hold harmless the United States and all creditors and persons entitled to the estate of the decedent. The amount of the indemnification is limited to an amount no greater than the value received by the voluntary representative.
(5)
Creditor.
If there has been no administration, no administration is contemplated, no summary or small estate procedures under applicable local law have been used, and there is no person eligible to serve as a voluntary representative pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section, then a creditor may make a claim for payment of the amount of the debt, providing the debt has not been barred by applicable local law.

# General
§ 363.130
What does this subpart cover?
This subpart is the offering of the zero-percent certificate of indebtedness by the Secretary of the Treasury (Secretary), and will continue until suspended or terminated by the Secretary. This subpart is also the governing regulations for the zero-percent certificate of indebtedness.
§ 363.131
What is a TreasuryDirect ® zero-percent certificate of indebtedness?
A TreasuryDirect® zero-percent certificate of indebtedness is a non-interest-bearing security that is issued daily, with a one-day maturity, which automatically rolls over at maturity until you request redemption. A zero-percent certificate of indebtedness has a minimum purchase amount of one cent. The only purpose of a zero-percent certificate of indebtedness is to accumulate funds for the purchase of another eligible security in the TreasuryDirect system. A zero-percent certificate of indebtedness within a minor's account is the property of the minor alone. The payroll zero-percent certificate of indebtedness is a restricted form of the zero-percent certificate of indebtedness that is held separately from the zero-percent certificate of indebtedness and used only for purchases made through the payroll savings plan.

What happens when I convert a savings bond that is registered in my name as a single owner, either coowner, an owner with a beneficiary, or an entity?
(a)
Unmatured savings bond.
When the conversion is approved, an unmatured savings bond that is registered in the name of the TreasuryDirect ® account owner as a single owner, either coowner, an owner with beneficiary, or an entity, will be released to the account owner's conversion linked account.

Matured savings bond.
A savings bond that has reached final maturity and is registered in the name of the TreasuryDirect account owner as a single owner, either coowner, an owner with beneficiary, or an entity, will be converted to a book-entry savings bond and automatically redeemed.

§ 363.166
What happens when I convert a savings bond that is not registered in my name as owner, either coowner, or owner with beneficiary (including a bond registered in the name of a minor)?
We will presume that a savings bond registered in the name of someone other than the TreasuryDirect ® account owner (including a bond registered in the name of a minor) was purchased by the account owner as a gift for the registered owner. We will not permit an entity to convert a savings bond that is not registered in the name of the entity.
(a)
Unmatured savings bond
—(1)
General.
An unmatured savings bond registered in the name of someone other than the account owner will be converted to a book-entry bond, released as a gift bond to the account owner's conversion linked account, and held until delivered to the TreasuryDirect account (or minor linked account, if the registered owner is a minor) of the registered owner.
(2)
Delivery of unmatured gift bond to registered owner.
The TreasuryDirect
account owner may deliver the converted gift bond to the TreasuryDirect account (or minor linked account, if the registered owner is a minor) of the registered owner, or, if the bond is registered in the coowner form of registration, to the account of either coowner. A bond registered in coowner or owner with beneficiary form of registration will retain the coowner or beneficiary form of registration upon delivery.
(b)
Savings bond that has reached final maturity
—(1)
General.
A savings bond that has reached final maturity and is registered in the name of someone other than the account owner will be converted to a book-entry bond, released as a gift bond into the account owner's conversion linked account, and automatically redeemed. We will hold the redemption proceeds in the name of the registered owner of the definitive bond until the proceeds are delivered to the TreasuryDirect account (or minor linked account, if the registered owner is a minor) of the registered owner.
(2)
Delivery of bond proceeds to registered owner.
If the gift bond has reached final maturity and has been automatically redeemed, then the Treasury Direct account owner may direct that the held redemption proceeds be delivered to the Treasury Direct account of the registered owner (or minor linked account, if the registered owner is a minor), where we will use the proceeds to purchase a zero-percent certificate of indebtedness in the name of the registered owner. If the bond is registered in the coowner form of registration, the account owner may direct that the held redemption proceeds be delivered to the account of either coowner, where we will use the proceeds to purchase a zero-percent certificate of indebtedness in the name of the coowner to whose account the bond was delivered.

§ 363.167
How will a converted savings bond be registered?
The registration of the converted bond will be the same as on the definitive bond, provided that it was registered properly in an authorized form of registration. We will change a definitive savings bond that was not registered in an authorized form of registration to the closest authorized form of registration. For example, a definitive savings bond erroneously registered “John Doe and Jane Doe” will be changed to “John Doe or Jane Doe.” We are not liable to any person for any such decision as to the closest form of authorized registration.

The transaction will not be conducted through the registered owner's TreasuryDirect account. The bond's registration will be changed to the single owner form of registration. Once this transaction is completed, the bond will be treated as a bond originally issued as a book-entry bond in TreasuryDirect, and will be subject to subpart C of this part.
