refers to title 40, part 63, section 1.

# Explanation
The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
Title 1 through Title 16
as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27
as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41
as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50
as of October 1
The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.

# LEGAL STATUS
The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

# HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, July 1, 2025), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

# EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.

# OMB CONTROL NUMBERS
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request.
Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.

# PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.

# “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.

# INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
What is incorporation by reference?
Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
What is a proper incorporation by reference?
The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
(b) The matter incorporated is adequately summarized in the preamble of the final rule and is available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?
If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or email fr.inspection@nara.gov.

# CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES
A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR
Index and Finding Aids.
This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.
An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

# REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

§ 63.1
Applicability.
(a)
General.
(1) Terms used throughout this part are defined in § 63.2 or in the Clean Air Act (Act) as amended in 1990, except that individual subparts of this part may include specific definitions in addition to or that supersede definitions in § 63.2.
(2) This part contains national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants (NESHAP) established pursuant to section 112 of the Act as amended November 15, 1990. These standards regulate specific categories of stationary sources that emit (or have the potential to emit) one or more hazardous air pollutants listed in this part pursuant to section 112(b) of the Act. This section explains the applicability of such standards to sources affected by them. The standards in this part are independent of NESHAP contained in 40 CFR part 61. The NESHAP in part 61 promulgated by signature of the Administrator before November 15, 1990 (i.e., the date of enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990) remain in effect until they are amended, if appropriate, and added to this part.
(3) No emission standard or other requirement established under this part
shall be interpreted, construed, or applied to diminish or replace the requirements of a more stringent emission limitation or other applicable requirement established by the Administrator pursuant to other authority of the Act (section 111, part C or D or any other authority of this Act), or a standard issued under State authority. The Administrator may specify in a specific standard under this part that facilities subject to other provisions under the Act need only comply with the provisions of that standard.
(4)(i) Each relevant standard in this part 63 must identify explicitly whether each provision in this subpart A is or is not included in such relevant standard.
(ii) If a relevant part 63 standard incorporates the requirements of 40 CFR part 60, part 61 or other part 63 standards, the relevant part 63 standard must identify explicitly the applicability of each corresponding part 60, part 61, or other part 63 subpart A (General) provision.
(iii) The General Provisions in this subpart A do not apply to regulations developed pursuant to section 112(r) of the amended Act, unless otherwise specified in those regulations.
(5) [Reserved]
(6) To obtain the most current list of categories of sources to be regulated under section 112 of the Act, or to obtain the most recent regulation promulgation schedule established pursuant to section 112(e) of the Act, contact the Office of the Director, Emission Standards Division, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, U.S. EPA (MD-13), Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27711.
(7)-(9) [Reserved]
(10) For the purposes of this part, time periods specified in days shall be measured in calendar days, even if the word “calendar” is absent, unless otherwise specified in an applicable requirement.
(11) For the purposes of this part, if an explicit postmark deadline is not specified in an applicable requirement for the submittal of a notification, application, test plan, report, or other written communication to the Administrator, the owner or operator shall postmark the submittal on or before the number of days specified in the applicable requirement. For example, if a notification must be submitted 15 days before a particular event is scheduled to take place, the notification shall be postmarked on or before 15 days preceding the event; likewise, if a notification must be submitted 15 days after a particular event takes place, the notification shall be postmarked on or before 15 days following the end of the event. The use of reliable non-Government mail carriers that provide indications of verifiable delivery of information required to be submitted to the Administrator, similar to the postmark provided by the U.S. Postal Service, or alternative means of delivery agreed to by the permitting authority, is acceptable.
(12) Notwithstanding time periods or postmark deadlines specified in this part for the submittal of information to the Administrator by an owner or operator, or the review of such information by the Administrator, such time periods or deadlines may be changed by mutual agreement between the owner or operator and the Administrator. Procedures governing the implementation of this provision are specified in § 63.9(i).
(b)
Initial applicability determination for this part.
(1) The provisions of this part apply to the owner or operator of any stationary source that—
(i) Emits or has the potential to emit any hazardous air pollutant listed in or pursuant to section 112(b) of the Act; and
(ii) Is subject to any standard, limitation, prohibition, or other federally enforceable requirement established pursuant to this part.
(2) [Reserved]
(3) An owner or operator of a stationary source who is in the relevant source category and who determines that the source is not subject to a relevant standard or other requirement established under this part must keep a record as specified in § 63.10(b)(3).
(c)
Applicability of this part after a relevant standard has been set under this part.
(1) If a relevant standard has been established under this part, the owner or operator of an affected source must comply with the provisions of that
standard and of this subpart as provided in paragraph (a)(4) of this section.
(2) Except as provided in § 63.10(b)(3), if a relevant standard has been established under this part, the owner or operator of an affected source may be required to obtain a title V permit from a permitting authority in the State in which the source is located. Emission standards promulgated in this part for area sources pursuant to section 112(c)(3) of the Act will specify whether—
(i) States will have the option to exclude area sources affected by that standard from the requirement to obtain a title V permit (i.e., the standard will exempt the category of area sources altogether from the permitting requirement);
(ii) States will have the option to defer permitting of area sources in that category until the Administrator takes rulemaking action to determine applicability of the permitting requirements; or
(iii) If a standard fails to specify what the permitting requirements will be for area sources affected by such a standard, then area sources that are subject to the standard will be subject to the requirement to obtain a title V permit without any deferral.
(3)-(4) [Reserved]
(5) If an area source that otherwise would be subject to an emission standard or other requirement established under this part if it were a major source subsequently increases its emissions of hazardous air pollutants (or its potential to emit hazardous air pollutants) such that the source is a major source that is subject to the emission standard or other requirement, such source also shall be subject to the notification requirements of this subpart.
(6) A major source may become an area source at any time upon reducing its emissions of and potential to emit hazardous air pollutants, as defined in this subpart, to below the major source thresholds established in § 63.2, subject to the provisions in paragraphs (c)(6)(i) and (ii) of this section.
(i) A major source reclassifying to area source status is subject to the applicability of standards, compliance dates and notification requirements specified in (c)(6)(i)(A) of this section. An area source that previously was a major source and becomes a major source again is subject to the applicability of standards, compliance dates, and notification requirements specified in (c)(6)(i)(B) of this section:
(A) A major source reclassifying to area source status under this part remains subject to any applicable major source requirements established under this part until the reclassification becomes effective. After the reclassification becomes effective, the source is subject to any applicable area source requirements established under this part immediately, provided the compliance date for the area source requirements has passed. The owner or operator of a major source that becomes an area source subject to newly applicable area source requirements under this part must comply with the initial notification requirements pursuant to § 63.9(b). The owner or operator of a major source that becomes an area source must also provide to the Administrator any change in the information already provided under § 63.9(b) per § 63.9(j).
(B) An area source that previously was a major source under this part and that becomes a major source again is subject to the applicable major source requirements established under this part immediately upon becoming a major source again, provided the compliance date for the major source requirements has passed, notwithstanding any provision within the applicable subparts. The owner or operator of an area source that becomes a major source again must comply with the initial notification pursuant to § 63.9(b). The owner or operator must also provide to the Administrator any change in the information already provided under § 63.9(b) per § 63.9(j).
(ii) Becoming an area source does not absolve a source subject to an enforcement action or investigation for major source violations or infractions from the consequences of any actions occurring when the source was major. Becoming a major source does not absolve a source subject to an enforcement action or investigation for area source
violations or infractions from the consequences of any actions occurring when the source was an area source.
(iii) After September 10, 2024, affected sources subject to the following 40 CFR part 63 subparts on September 10, 2024, must remain subject to those subparts, and any modifications thereafter, even if the source becomes an area source by reducing both its actual emissions and potential to emit hazardous air pollutants to below major source thresholds: F, G, H, I, L, R, X, CC, GG, II, JJ, KK, LL, MM, EEE, JJJ, LLL, MMM, RRR, UUU, FFFF, JJJJ, MMMM, PPPP, ZZZZ, CCCCC, DDDDD, FFFFF, IIIII, LLLLL, YYYYY, JJJJJJ, EEEEEEE.
(d) [Reserved]
(e) If the Administrator promulgates an emission standard under section 112(d) or (h) of the Act that is applicable to a source subject to an emission limitation by permit established under section 112(j) of the Act, and the requirements under the section 112(j) emission limitation are substantially as effective as the promulgated emission standard, the owner or operator may request the permitting authority to revise the source's title V permit to reflect that the emission limitation in the permit satisfies the requirements of the promulgated emission standard. The process by which the permitting authority determines whether the section 112(j) emission limitation is substantially as effective as the promulgated emission standard must include, consistent with part 70 or 71 of this chapter, the opportunity for full public, EPA, and affected State review (including the opportunity for EPA's objection) prior to the permit revision being finalized. A negative determination by the permitting authority constitutes final action for purposes of review and appeal under the applicable title V operating permit program.

§ 63.2
Definitions.
The terms used in this part are defined in the Act or in this section as follows:
Act
means the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401
et seq.,
as amended by Pub. L. 101-549, 104 Stat. 2399).
Actual emissions
is defined in subpart D of this part for the purpose of granting a compliance extension for an early reduction of hazardous air pollutants.
Administrator
means the Administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency or his or her authorized representative (e.g., a State that has been delegated the authority to implement the provisions of this part).
Affected source,
for the purposes of this part, means the collection of equipment, activities, or both within a single contiguous area and under common control that is included in a section 112(c) source category or subcategory for which a section 112(d) standard or other relevant standard is established pursuant to section 112 of the Act. Each relevant standard will define the “affected source,” as defined in this paragraph unless a different definition is warranted based on a published justification as to why this definition would result in significant administrative, practical, or implementation problems and why the different definition would resolve those problems. The term “affected source,” as used in this part, is separate and distinct from any other use of that term in EPA regulations such as those implementing title IV of the Act. Affected source may be defined differently for part 63 than affected facility and stationary source in parts 60 and 61, respectively. This definition of “affected source,” and the procedures for adopting an alternative definition of “affected source,” shall apply to each section 112(d) standard for which the initial proposed rule is signed by the Administrator after June 30, 2002.
Alternative emission limitation
means conditions established pursuant to sections 112(i)(5) or 112(i)(6) of the Act by the Administrator or by a State with an approved permit program.
Alternative emission standard
means an alternative means of emission limitation that, after notice and opportunity for public comment, has been demonstrated by an owner or operator to the Administrator's satisfaction to achieve a reduction in emissions of any
air pollutant at least equivalent to the reduction in emissions of such pollutant achieved under a relevant design, equipment, work practice, or operational emission standard, or combination thereof, established under this part pursuant to section 112(h) of the Act.
Alternative test method
means any method of sampling and analyzing for an air pollutant that has been demonstrated to the Administrator's satisfaction, using Method 301 in appendix A of this part, to produce results adequate for the Administrator's determination that it may be used in place of a test method specified in this part.
Approved permit program
means a State permit program approved by the Administrator as meeting the requirements of part 70 of this chapter or a Federal permit program established in this chapter pursuant to title V of the Act (42 U.S.C. 7661).
Area source
means any stationary source of hazardous air pollutants that is not a major source as defined in this part.
Commenced
means, with respect to construction or reconstruction of an affected source, that an owner or operator has undertaken a continuous program of construction or reconstruction or that an owner or operator has entered into a contractual obligation to undertake and complete, within a reasonable time, a continuous program of construction or reconstruction.
Compliance date
means the date by which an affected source is required to be in compliance with a relevant standard, limitation, prohibition, or any federally enforceable requirement established by the Administrator (or a State with an approved permit program) pursuant to section 112 of the Act.
Compliance schedule
means: (1) In the case of an affected source that is in compliance with all applicable requirements established under this part, a statement that the source will continue to comply with such requirements; or
(2) In the case of an affected source that is required to comply with applicable requirements by a future date, a statement that the source will meet such requirements on a timely basis and, if required by an applicable requirement, a detailed schedule of the dates by which each step toward compliance will be reached; or
(3) In the case of an affected source not in compliance with all applicable requirements established under this part, a schedule of remedial measures, including an enforceable sequence of actions or operations with milestones and a schedule for the submission of certified progress reports, where applicable, leading to compliance with a relevant standard, limitation, prohibition, or any federally enforceable requirement established pursuant to section 112 of the Act for which the affected source is not in compliance. This compliance schedule shall resemble and be at least as stringent as that contained in any judicial consent decree or administrative order to which the source is subject. Any such schedule of compliance shall be supplemental to, and shall not sanction noncompliance with, the applicable requirements on which it is based.
Construction
means the on-site fabrication, erection, or installation of an affected source. Construction does not include the removal of all equipment comprising an affected source from an existing location and reinstallation of such equipment at a new location. The owner or operator of an existing affected source that is relocated may elect not to reinstall minor ancillary equipment including, but not limited to, piping, ductwork, and valves. However, removal and reinstallation of an affected source will be construed as reconstruction if it satisfies the criteria for reconstruction as defined in this section. The costs of replacing minor ancillary equipment must be considered in determining whether the existing affected source is reconstructed.
Continuous emission monitoring system
(CEMS) means the total equipment that may be required to meet the data acquisition and availability requirements of this part, used to sample, condition (if applicable), analyze, and provide a record of emissions.
Continuous monitoring system
(CMS) is a comprehensive term that may include, but is not limited to, continuous
emission monitoring systems, continuous opacity monitoring systems, continuous parameter monitoring systems, or other manual or automatic monitoring that is used for demonstrating compliance with an applicable regulation on a continuous basis as defined by the regulation.
Continuous opacity monitoring system
(COMS) means a continuous monitoring system that measures the opacity of emissions.
Continuous parameter monitoring system
means the total equipment that may be required to meet the data acquisition and availability requirements of this part, used to sample, condition (if applicable), analyze, and provide a record of process or control system parameters.
Effective date
means:
(1) With regard to an emission standard established under this part, the date of promulgation in the
Federal Register
of such standard; or
(2) With regard to an alternative emission limitation or equivalent emission limitation determined by the Administrator (or a State with an approved permit program), the date that the alternative emission limitation or equivalent emission limitation becomes effective according to the provisions of this part.
Emission standard
means a national standard, limitation, prohibition, or other regulation promulgated in a subpart of this part pursuant to sections 112(d), 112(h), or 112(f) of the Act.
Emissions averaging
is a way to comply with the emission limitations specified in a relevant standard, whereby an affected source, if allowed under a subpart of this part, may create emission credits by reducing emissions from specific points to a level below that required by the relevant standard, and those credits are used to offset emissions from points that are not controlled to the level required by the relevant standard.
EPA
means the United States Environmental Protection Agency.
Equivalent emission limitation
means any maximum achievable control technology emission limitation or requirements which are applicable to a major source of hazardous air pollutants and are adopted by the Administrator (or a State with an approved permit program) on a case-by-case basis, pursuant to section 112(g) or (j) of the Act.
Excess emissions and continuous monitoring system performance report
is a report that must be submitted periodically by an affected source in order to provide data on its compliance with relevant emission limits, operating parameters, and the performance of its continuous parameter monitoring systems.
Existing source
means any affected source that is not a new source.
Federally enforceable
means all limitations and conditions that are enforceable by the Administrator and citizens under the Act or that are enforceable under other statutes administered by the Administrator. Examples of federally enforceable limitations and conditions include, but are not limited to:
(1) Emission standards, alternative emission standards, alternative emission limitations, and equivalent emission limitations established pursuant to section 112 of the Act as amended in 1990;

Fixed capital cost
means the capital needed to provide all the depreciable components of an existing source.
Force majeure
means, for purposes of § 63.7, an event that will be or has been caused by circumstances beyond the control of the affected facility, its contractors, or any entity controlled by the affected facility that prevents the owner or operator from complying with the regulatory requirement to conduct performance tests within the specified timeframe despite the affected facility's best efforts to fulfill the obligation. Examples of such events are acts of nature, acts of war or terrorism, or equipment failure or safety hazard beyond the control of the affected facility.
Fugitive emissions
means those emissions from a stationary source that could not reasonably pass through a stack, chimney, vent, or other functionally equivalent opening. Under section 112 of the Act, all fugitive emissions are to be considered in determining whether a stationary source is a major source.
Hazardous air pollutant
means any air pollutant listed in or pursuant to section 112(b) of the Act.
Issuance
of a part 70 permit will occur, if the State is the permitting authority, in accordance with the requirements of part 70 of this chapter and the applicable, approved State permit program. When the EPA is the permitting authority, issuance of a title V permit occurs immediately after the EPA takes final action on the final permit.
Major source
means any stationary source or group of stationary sources located within a contiguous area and under common control that emits or has the potential to emit considering controls, in the aggregate, 10 tons per year or more of any hazardous air pollutant or 25 tons per year or more of any combination of hazardous air pollutants, unless the Administrator establishes a lesser quantity, or in the case of radionuclides, different criteria from those specified in this sentence.
Malfunction
means any sudden, infrequent, and not reasonably preventable failure of air pollution control and monitoring equipment, process equipment, or a process to operate in a normal or usual manner which causes, or has the potential to cause, the emission limitations in an applicable standard to be exceeded. Failures that are caused in part by poor maintenance or careless operation are not malfunctions.
Monitoring
means the collection and use of measurement data or other information to control the operation of a process or pollution control device or to verify a work practice standard relative to assuring compliance with applicable requirements. Monitoring is composed of four elements:
(1) Indicator(s) of performance—the parameter or parameters you measure or observe for demonstrating proper operation of the pollution control
measures or compliance with the applicable emissions limitation or standard. Indicators of performance may include direct or predicted emissions measurements (including opacity), operational parametric values that correspond to process or control device (and capture system) efficiencies or emissions rates, and recorded findings of inspection of work practice activities, materials tracking, or design characteristics. Indicators may be expressed as a single maximum or minimum value, a function of process variables (for example, within a range of pressure drops), a particular operational or work practice status (for example, a damper position, completion of a waste recovery task, materials tracking), or an interdependency between two or among more than two variables.
(2) Measurement techniques—the means by which you gather and record information of or about the indicators of performance. The components of the measurement technique include the detector type, location and installation specifications, inspection procedures, and quality assurance and quality control measures. Examples of measurement techniques include continuous emission monitoring systems, continuous opacity monitoring systems, continuous parametric monitoring systems, and manual inspections that include making records of process conditions or work practices.
(3) Monitoring frequency—the number of times you obtain and record monitoring data over a specified time interval. Examples of monitoring frequencies include at least four points equally spaced for each hour for continuous emissions or parametric monitoring systems, at least every 10 seconds for continuous opacity monitoring systems, and at least once per operating day (or week, month, etc.) for work practice or design inspections.
(4) Averaging time—the period over which you average and use data to verify proper operation of the pollution control approach or compliance with the emissions limitation or standard. Examples of averaging time include a 3-hour average in units of the emissions limitation, a 30-day rolling average emissions value, a daily average of a control device operational parametric range, and an instantaneous alarm.
New affected source
means the collection of equipment, activities, or both within a single contiguous area and under common control that is included in a section 112(c) source category or subcategory that is subject to a section 112(d) or other relevant standard for new sources. This definition of “new affected source,” and the criteria to be utilized in implementing it, shall apply to each section 112(d) standard for which the initial proposed rule is signed by the Administrator after June 30, 2002. Each relevant standard will define the term “new affected source,” which will be the same as the “affected source” unless a different collection is warranted based on consideration of factors including:
(1) Emission reduction impacts of controlling individual sources versus groups of sources;
(2) Cost effectiveness of controlling individual equipment;
(3) Flexibility to accommodate common control strategies;
(4) Cost/benefits of emissions averaging;
(5) Incentives for pollution prevention;
(6) Feasibility and cost of controlling processes that share common equipment (e.g., product recovery devices);
(7) Feasibility and cost of monitoring; and
(8) Other relevant factors.
New source
means any affected source the construction or reconstruction of which is commenced after the Administrator first proposes a relevant emission standard under this part establishing an emission standard applicable to such source.
One-hour period,
unless otherwise defined in an applicable subpart, means any 60-minute period commencing on the hour.
Opacity
means the degree to which emissions reduce the transmission of light and obscure the view of an object in the background. For continuous opacity monitoring systems, opacity means the fraction of incident light that is attenuated by an optical medium.
Owner or operator
means any person who owns, leases, operates, controls, or supervises a stationary source.
Performance audit
means a procedure to analyze blind samples, the content of which is known by the Administrator, simultaneously with the analysis of performance test samples in order to provide a measure of test data quality.
Performance evaluation
means the conduct of relative accuracy testing, calibration error testing, and other measurements used in validating the continuous monitoring system data.
Performance test
means the collection of data resulting from the execution of a test method (usually three emission test runs) used to demonstrate compliance with a relevant emission standard as specified in the performance test section of the relevant standard.
Permit modification
means a change to a title V permit as defined in regulations codified in this chapter to implement title V of the Act (42 U.S.C. 7661).
Permit program
means a comprehensive State operating permit system established pursuant to title V of the Act (42 U.S.C. 7661) and regulations codified in part 70 of this chapter and applicable State regulations, or a comprehensive Federal operating permit system established pursuant to title V of the Act and regulations codified in this chapter.

source reduction
as defined under the Pollution Prevention Act (42 U.S.C. 13101-13109). The definition is as follows:
(1)
Source reduction
is any practice that:
(i) Reduces the amount of any hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant entering any waste stream or otherwise released into the environment (including fugitive emissions) prior to recycling, treatment, or disposal; and
(ii) Reduces the hazards to public health and the environment associated with the release of such substances, pollutants, or contaminants.
(2) The term

(3) The term
source reduction
does not include any practice that alters the physical, chemical, or biological characteristics or the volume of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant through a process or activity which itself is not integral to and necessary for the production of a product or the providing of a service.
Potential to emit
means the maximum capacity of a stationary source to emit a pollutant under its physical and operational design. Any physical or operational limitation on the capacity of the stationary source to emit a pollutant, including air pollution control equipment and restrictions on hours of operation or on the type or amount of material combusted, stored, or processed, shall be treated as part of its design if the limitation or the effect it would have on emissions is enforceable.
Reconstruction,
unless otherwise defined in a relevant standard, means the replacement of components of an affected or a previously nonaffected source to such an extent that:
(1) The fixed capital cost of the new components exceeds 50 percent of the fixed capital cost that would be required to construct a comparable new source; and
(2) It is technologically and economically feasible for the reconstructed source to meet the relevant standard(s) established by the Administrator (or a State) pursuant to section 112 of the Act.

§ 63.4
Prohibited activities and circumvention.
(a)
Prohibited activities.
(1) No owner or operator subject to the provisions of this part must operate any affected source in violation of the requirements of this part. Affected sources subject to and in compliance with either an extension of compliance or an exemption from compliance are not in violation of the requirements of this part. An extension of compliance can be granted by the Administrator under this part; by a State with an approved permit program; or by the President under section 112(i)(4) of the Act.
(2) No owner or operator subject to the provisions of this part shall fail to keep records, notify, report, or revise reports as required under this part.
(3)-(5) [Reserved]
(b)
Circumvention.
No owner or operator subject to the provisions of this part shall build, erect, install, or use any article, machine, equipment, or process to conceal an emission that would otherwise constitute noncompliance with a relevant standard. Such concealment includes, but is not limited to—
(1) The use of diluents to achieve compliance with a relevant standard based on the concentration of a pollutant in the effluent discharged to the atmosphere;
(2) The use of gaseous diluents to achieve compliance with a relevant standard for visible emissions; and
(c)
Fragmentation.
Fragmentation after November 15, 1990 which divides ownership of an operation, within the same facility among various owners where there is no real change in control, will not affect applicability. The owner and operator must not use fragmentation or phasing of reconstruction activities (i.e., intentionally dividing reconstruction into multiple parts for purposes of avoiding new source requirements) to avoid becoming subject to new source requirements.

After the effective date of a relevant standard, promulgated pursuant to section 112(d), (f), or (h) of the Act, under this part, the preconstruction review requirements in this section apply to the owner or operator of new affected sources and reconstructed affected sources that are major-emitting as specified in this section. New and reconstructed affected sources that commence construction or reconstruction before the effective date of a relevant standard are not subject to the preconstruction review requirements specified in paragraphs (b)(3), (d), and (e) of this section.
(2) This section includes notification requirements for new affected sources and reconstructed affected sources that are not major-emitting affected sources and that are or become subject to a relevant promulgated emission standard after the effective date of a relevant standard promulgated under this part.
(b)
Requirements for existing, newly constructed, and reconstructed sources.
(1) A new affected source for which construction commences after proposal of a relevant standard is subject to relevant standards for new affected sources, including compliance dates. An affected source for which reconstruction commences after proposal of a relevant standard is subject to relevant standards for new sources, including compliance dates, irrespective of any change in emissions of hazardous air pollutants from that source.
(2) [Reserved]
(3) After the effective date of any relevant standard promulgated by the Administrator under this part, no person may, without obtaining written approval in advance from the Administrator in accordance with the procedures specified in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, do any of the following:
(i) Construct a new affected source that is major-emitting and subject to such standard;
(ii) Reconstruct an affected source that is major-emitting and subject to such standard; or
(iii) Reconstruct a major source such that the source becomes an affected source that is major-emitting and subject to the standard.
(4) After the effective date of any relevant standard promulgated by the Administrator under this part, an owner or operator who constructs a new affected source that is not major-emitting or reconstructs an affected source that is not major-emitting that is subject to such standard, or reconstructs a source such that the source becomes an affected source subject to the standard, must notify the Administrator of the intended construction or reconstruction. The notification must be submitted in accordance with the procedures in § 63.9(b).

The description of the equipment to be used for the control of emissions shall include each control device for each hazardous air pollutant and the estimated control efficiency (percent) for each control device. The description of the method to be used for the control of emissions shall include an estimated control efficiency (percent) for that method. Such technical information shall include calculations of emission estimates in sufficient detail to permit assessment of the validity of the calculations;
(iii) An estimate of the fixed capital cost of the replacements and of constructing a comparable entirely new source;
(iv) The estimated life of the affected source after the replacements; and
(v) A discussion of any economic or technical limitations the source may have in complying with relevant standards or other requirements after the proposed replacements. The discussion shall be sufficiently detailed to demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that the technical or economic limitations affect the source's ability to comply with the relevant standard and how they do so.
(vi) If in the application for approval of reconstruction the owner or operator designates the affected source as a reconstructed source and declares that there are no economic or technical limitations to prevent the source from complying with all relevant standards or other requirements, the owner or operator need not submit the information required in paragraphs (d)(3)(iii) through (d)(3)(v) of this section.
(4)
Additional information.
The Administrator may request additional relevant information after the submittal of an application for approval of construction or reconstruction.
(e)
Approval of construction or reconstruction.
(1)(i) If the Administrator determines that, if properly constructed, or reconstructed, and operated, a new or existing source for which an application under paragraph (d) of this section was submitted will not cause emissions in violation of the relevant standard(s) and any other federally enforceable requirements, the Administrator will approve the construction or reconstruction.
(ii) In addition, in the case of reconstruction, the Administrator's determination under this paragraph will be based on:
(A) The fixed capital cost of the replacements in comparison to the fixed capital cost that would be required to construct a comparable entirely new source;
(B) The estimated life of the source after the replacements compared to the
life of a comparable entirely new source;
(C) The extent to which the components being replaced cause or contribute to the emissions from the source; and
(D) Any economic or technical limitations on compliance with relevant standards that are inherent in the proposed replacements.
(2)(i) The Administrator will notify the owner or operator in writing of approval or intention to deny approval of construction or reconstruction within 60 calendar days after receipt of sufficient information to evaluate an application submitted under paragraph (d) of this section. The 60-day approval or denial period will begin after the owner or operator has been notified in writing that his/her application is complete. The Administrator will notify the owner or operator in writing of the status of his/her application, that is, whether the application contains sufficient information to make a determination, within 30 calendar days after receipt of the original application and within 30 calendar days after receipt of any supplementary information that is submitted.
(ii) When notifying the owner or operator that his/her application is not complete, the Administrator will specify the information needed to complete the application and provide notice of opportunity for the applicant to present, in writing, within 30 calendar days after he/she is notified of the incomplete application, additional information or arguments to the Administrator to enable further action on the application.

(i) Notice of the information and findings on which the intended denial is based; and
(ii) Notice of opportunity for the applicant to present, in writing, within 30 calendar days after he/she is notified of the intended denial, additional information or arguments to the Administrator to enable further action on the application.
(4) A final determination to deny any application for approval will be in writing and will specify the grounds on which the denial is based. The final determination will be made within 60 calendar days of presentation of additional information or arguments (if the application is complete), or within 60 calendar days after the final date specified for presentation if no presentation is made.
(5) Neither the submission of an application for approval nor the Administrator's approval of construction or reconstruction shall—
(i) Relieve an owner or operator of legal responsibility for compliance with any applicable provisions of this part or with any other applicable Federal, State, or local requirement; or
(ii) Prevent the Administrator from implementing or enforcing this part or taking any other action under the Act.
(f)

The Administrator will evaluate the owner or operator's request in accordance with the procedures specified in paragraph (e) of this section. The Administrator may request additional relevant information after the submittal of a request for approval of construction or reconstruction under this paragraph (f)(2).

§ 63.6
Compliance with standards and maintenance requirements.
(a)
Applicability.
(1) The requirements in this section apply to the owner or operator of affected sources for which any relevant standard has been established pursuant to section 112 of the Act and the applicability of such requirements is set out in accordance with § 63.1(a)(4) unless—
(i) The Administrator (or a State with an approved permit program) has granted an extension of compliance consistent with paragraph (i) of this section; or
(ii) The President has granted an exemption from compliance with any relevant standard in accordance with section 112(i)(4) of the Act.
(2) If an area source that otherwise would be subject to an emission standard or other requirement established under this part if it were a major source subsequently increases its emissions of hazardous air pollutants (or its potential to emit hazardous air pollutants) such that the source is a major source, such source shall be subject to the relevant emission standard or other requirement.
(b)
Compliance dates for new and reconstructed sources.
(1) Except as specified in paragraphs (b)(3) and (4) of this section, the owner or operator of a new or reconstructed affected source for which construction or reconstruction commences after proposal of a relevant standard that has an initial startup before the effective date of a relevant standard established under this part pursuant to section 112(d), (f), or (h) of the Act must comply with such standard not later than the standard's effective date.
(2) Except as specified in paragraphs (b)(3) and (4) of this section, the owner or operator of a new or reconstructed affected source that has an initial startup after the effective date of a relevant standard established under this part pursuant to section 112(d), (f), or (h) of the Act must comply with such standard upon startup of the source.
(3) The owner or operator of an affected source for which construction or reconstruction is commenced after the proposal date of a relevant standard established under this part pursuant to section 112(d), 112(f), or 112(h) of the Act but before the effective date (that is, promulgation) of such standard shall comply with the relevant emission standard not later than the date 3 years after the effective date if:
(i) The promulgated standard (that is, the relevant standard) is more stringent than the proposed standard; for purposes of this paragraph, a finding that controls or compliance methods are “more stringent” must include control technologies or performance criteria and compliance or compliance assurance methods that are different but are substantially equivalent to those required by the promulgated rule, as determined by the Administrator (or his or her authorized representative); and
(ii) The owner or operator complies with the standard as proposed during the 3-year period immediately after the effective date.
(4) The owner or operator of an affected source for which construction or reconstruction is commenced after the proposal date of a relevant standard established pursuant to section 112(d) of the Act but before the proposal date of a relevant standard established pursuant to section 112(f) shall not be required to comply with the section 112(f) emission standard until the date 10 years after the date construction or reconstruction is commenced, except that, if the section 112(f) standard is promulgated more than 10 years after construction or reconstruction is commenced, the owner or operator must comply with the standard as provided
in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section.
(5) The owner or operator of a new source that is subject to the compliance requirements of paragraph (b)(3) or (4) of this section must notify the Administrator in accordance with § 63.9(d)
(6) [Reserved]
(7) When an area source increases its emissions of (or its potential to emit) hazardous air pollutants such that the source becomes a major source, the portion of the facility that meets the definition of a new affected source must comply with all requirements of that standard applicable to new sources. The source owner or operator must comply with the relevant standard upon startup.
(c)
Compliance dates for existing sources.
(1) After the effective date of a relevant standard established under this part pursuant to section 112(d) or 112(h) of the Act, the owner or operator of an existing source shall comply with such standard by the compliance date established by the Administrator in the applicable subpart(s) of this part, except as provided in § 63.1(c)(6)(i). Except as otherwise provided for in section 112 of the Act, in no case will the compliance date established for an existing source in an applicable subpart of this part exceed 3 years after the effective date of such standard.
(2) If an existing source is subject to a standard established under this part pursuant to section 112(f) of the Act, the owner or operator must comply with the standard by the date 90 days after the standard's effective date, or by the date specified in an extension granted to the source by the Administrator under paragraph (i)(4)(ii) of this section, whichever is later.
(3)-(4) [Reserved]
(5) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(7) of this section, the owner or operator of an area source that increases its emissions of (or its potential to emit) hazardous air pollutants such that the source becomes a major source and meets the definition of an existing source in the applicable major source standard shall be subject to relevant standards for existing sources. Except as provided in paragraph § 63.1(c)(6)(i)(B), such sources must comply by the date specified in the standards for existing area sources that become major sources. If no such compliance date is specified in the standards, the source shall have a period of time to comply with the relevant emission standard that is equivalent to the compliance period specified in the relevant standard for existing sources in existence at the time the standard becomes effective.
(d) [Reserved]
(e)
Operation and maintenance requirements.
(1)(i) At all times, including periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction, the owner or operator must operate and maintain any affected source, including associated air pollution control equipment and monitoring equipment, in a manner consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions. During a period of startup, shutdown, or malfunction, this general duty to minimize emissions requires that the owner or operator reduce emissions from the affected source to the greatest extent which is consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices. The general duty to minimize emissions during a period of startup, shutdown, or malfunction does not require the owner or operator to achieve emission levels that would be required by the applicable standard at other times if this is not consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices, nor does it require the owner or operator to make any further efforts to reduce emissions if levels required by the applicable standard have been achieved. Determination of whether such operation and maintenance procedures are being used will be based on information available to the Administrator which may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operation and maintenance procedures (including the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan required in paragraph (e)(3) of this section), review of operation and maintenance records, and inspection of the source.
(ii) Malfunctions must be corrected as soon as practicable after their occurrence. To the extent that an unexpected event arises during a startup, shutdown, or malfunction, an owner or
operator must comply by minimizing emissions during such a startup, shutdown, and malfunction event consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices.
(iii) Operation and maintenance requirements established pursuant to section 112 of the Act are enforceable independent of emissions limitations or other requirements in relevant standards.
(2) [Reserved]
(3)
Startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan.
(i) The owner or operator of an affected source must develop a written startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan that describes, in detail, procedures for operating and maintaining the source during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction; and a program of corrective action for malfunctioning process, air pollution control, and monitoring equipment used to comply with the relevant standard. The startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan does not need to address any scenario that would not cause the source to exceed an applicable emission limitation in the relevant standard. This plan must be developed by the owner or operator by the source's compliance date for that relevant standard. The purpose of the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan is to—
(A) Ensure that, at all times, the owner or operator operates and maintains each affected source, including associated air pollution control and monitoring equipment, in a manner which satisfies the general duty to minimize emissions established by paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section;
(B) Ensure that owners or operators are prepared to correct malfunctions as soon as practicable after their occurrence in order to minimize excess emissions of hazardous air pollutants; and
(C) Reduce the reporting burden associated with periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction (including corrective action taken to restore malfunctioning process and air pollution control equipment to its normal or usual manner of operation).
(ii) [Reserved]
(iii) When actions taken by the owner or operator during a startup or shutdown (and the startup or shutdown causes the source to exceed any applicable emission limitation in the relevant emission standards), or malfunction (including actions taken to correct a malfunction) are consistent with the procedures specified in the affected source's startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan, the owner or operator must keep records for that event which demonstrate that the procedures specified in the plan were followed. These records may take the form of a “checklist,” or other effective form of recordkeeping that confirms conformance with the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan and describes the actions taken for that event. In addition, the owner or operator must keep records of these events as specified in paragraph 63.10(b), including records of the occurrence and duration of each startup or shutdown (if the startup or shutdown causes the source to exceed any applicable emission limitation in the relevant emission standards), or malfunction of operation and each malfunction of the air pollution control and monitoring equipment. Furthermore, the owner or operator shall confirm that actions taken during the relevant reporting period during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction were consistent with the affected source's startup, shutdown and malfunction plan in the semiannual (or more frequent) startup, shutdown, and malfunction report required in § 63.10(d)(5).
(iv) If an action taken by the owner or operator during a startup, shutdown, or malfunction (including an action taken to correct a malfunction) is not consistent with the procedures specified in the affected source's startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan, and the source exceeds any applicable emission limitation in the relevant emission standard, then the owner or operator must record the actions taken for that event and must report such actions within 2 working days after commencing actions inconsistent with the plan, followed by a letter within 7 working days after the end of the event, in accordance with § 63.10(d)(5) (unless the owner or operator makes alternative reporting arrangements, in advance, with the Administrator).
(v) The owner or operator must maintain at the affected source a current
startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan and must make the plan available upon request for inspection and copying by the Administrator. In addition, if the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan is subsequently revised as provided in paragraph (e)(3)(viii) of this section, the owner or operator must maintain at the affected source each previous (i.e., superseded) version of the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan, and must make each such previous version available for inspection and copying by the Administrator for a period of 5 years after revision of the plan. If at any time after adoption of a startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan the affected source ceases operation or is otherwise no longer subject to the provisions of this part, the owner or operator must retain a copy of the most recent plan for 5 years from the date the source ceases operation or is no longer subject to this part and must make the plan available upon request for inspection and copying by the Administrator. The Administrator may at any time request in writing that the owner or operator submit a copy of any startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan (or a portion thereof) which is maintained at the affected source or in the possession of the owner or operator. Upon receipt of such a request, the owner or operator must promptly submit a copy of the requested plan (or a portion thereof) to the Administrator. The owner or operator may elect to submit the required copy of any startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan to the Administrator in an electronic format. If the owner or operator claims that any portion of such a startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan is confidential business information entitled to protection from disclosure under section 114(c) of the Act or 40 CFR 2.301, the material which is claimed as confidential must be clearly designated in the submission.
(vi) To satisfy the requirements of this section to develop a startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan, the owner or operator may use the affected source's standard operating procedures (SOP) manual, or an Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) or other plan, provided the alternative plans meet all the requirements of this section and are made available for inspection or submitted when requested by the Administrator.
(vii) Based on the results of a determination made under paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, the Administrator may require that an owner or operator of an affected source make changes to the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan for that source. The Administrator must require appropriate revisions to a startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan, if the Administrator finds that the plan:
(A) Does not address a startup, shutdown, or malfunction event that has occurred;
(B) Fails to provide for the operation of the source (including associated air pollution control and monitoring equipment) during a startup, shutdown, or malfunction event in a manner consistent with the general duty to minimize emissions established by paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section;
(C) Does not provide adequate procedures for correcting malfunctioning process and/or air pollution control and monitoring equipment as quickly as practicable; or
(D) Includes an event that does not meet the definition of startup, shutdown, or malfunction listed in § 63.2.
(viii) The owner or operator may periodically revise the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan for the affected source as necessary to satisfy the requirements of this part or to reflect changes in equipment or procedures at the affected source. Unless the permitting authority provides otherwise, the owner or operator may make such revisions to the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan without prior approval by the Administrator or the permitting authority. However, each such revision to a startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan must be reported in the semiannual report required by § 63.10(d)(5). If the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan fails to address or inadequately addresses an event that meets the characteristics of a malfunction but was not included in the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan at the time the owner or operator developed the plan, the owner or operator must revise the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan within 45
days after the event to include detailed procedures for operating and maintaining the source during similar malfunction events and a program of corrective action for similar malfunctions of process or air pollution control and monitoring equipment. In the event that the owner or operator makes any revision to the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan which alters the scope of the activities at the source which are deemed to be a startup, shutdown, or malfunction, or otherwise modifies the applicability of any emission limit, work practice requirement, or other requirement in a standard established under this part, the revised plan shall not take effect until after the owner or operator has provided a written notice describing the revision to the permitting authority.
(ix) The title V permit for an affected source must require that the owner or operator develop a startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan which conforms to the provisions of this part, but may do so by citing to the relevant subpart or subparagraphs of paragraph (e) of this section. However, any revisions made to the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan in accordance with the procedures established by this part shall not be deemed to constitute permit revisions under part 70 or part 71 of this chapter and the elements of the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan shall not be considered an applicable requirement as defined in § 70.2 and § 71.2 of this chapter. Moreover, none of the procedures specified by the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan for an affected source shall be deemed to fall within the permit shield provision in section 504(f) of the Act.
(f)
Compliance with nonopacity emission standards
—(1)
Applicability.
The non-opacity emission standards set forth in this part shall apply at all times except as otherwise specified in an applicable subpart. If a startup, shutdown, or malfunction of one portion of an affected source does not affect the ability of particular emission points within other portions of the affected source to comply with the non-opacity emission standards set forth in this part, then that emission point must still be required to comply with the non-opacity emission standards and other applicable requirements.
(2)
Methods for determining compliance.
(i) The Administrator will determine compliance with nonopacity emission standards in this part based on the results of performance tests conducted according to the procedures in § 63.7, unless otherwise specified in an applicable subpart of this part.
(ii) The Administrator will determine compliance with nonopacity emission standards in this part by evaluation of an owner or operator's conformance with operation and maintenance requirements, including the evaluation of monitoring data, as specified in § 63.6(e) and applicable subparts of this part.
(iii) If an affected source conducts performance testing at startup to obtain an operating permit in the State in which the source is located, the results of such testing may be used to demonstrate compliance with a relevant standard if—
(A) The performance test was conducted within a reasonable amount of time before an initial performance test is required to be conducted under the relevant standard;
(B) The performance test was conducted under representative operating conditions for the source;
(C) The performance test was conducted and the resulting data were reduced using EPA-approved test methods and procedures, as specified in § 63.7(e) of this subpart; and
(D) The performance test was appropriately quality-assured, as specified in § 63.7(c).
(iv) The Administrator will determine compliance with design, equipment, work practice, or operational emission standards in this part by review of records, inspection of the source, and other procedures specified in applicable subparts of this part.
(v) The Administrator will determine compliance with design, equipment, work practice, or operational emission standards in this part by evaluation of an owner or operator's conformance with operation and maintenance requirements, as specified in paragraph (e) of this section and applicable subparts of this part.
(3)
Finding of compliance.
The Administrator will make a finding concerning
an affected source's compliance with a non-opacity emission standard, as specified in paragraphs (f)(1) and (2) of this section, upon obtaining all the compliance information required by the relevant standard (including the written reports of performance test results, monitoring results, and other information, if applicable), and information available to the Administrator pursuant to paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section.
(g)
Use of an alternative nonopacity emission standard.
(1) If, in the Administrator's judgment, an owner or operator of an affected source has established that an alternative means of emission limitation will achieve a reduction in emissions of a hazardous air pollutant from an affected source at least equivalent to the reduction in emissions of that pollutant from that source achieved under any design, equipment, work practice, or operational emission standard, or combination thereof, established under this part pursuant to section 112(h) of the Act, the Administrator will publish in the
Federal Register
a notice permitting the use of the alternative emission standard for purposes of compliance with the promulgated standard. Any
Federal Register
notice under this paragraph shall be published only after the public is notified and given the opportunity to comment. Such notice will restrict the permission to the stationary source(s) or category(ies) of sources from which the alternative emission standard will achieve equivalent emission reductions. The Administrator will condition permission in such notice on requirements to assure the proper operation and maintenance of equipment and practices required for compliance with the alternative emission standard and other requirements, including appropriate quality assurance and quality control requirements, that are deemed necessary.
(2) An owner or operator requesting permission under this paragraph shall, unless otherwise specified in an applicable subpart, submit a proposed test plan or the results of testing and monitoring in accordance with § 63.7 and § 63.8, a description of the procedures followed in testing or monitoring, and a description of pertinent conditions during testing or monitoring. Any testing or monitoring conducted to request permission to use an alternative nonopacity emission standard shall be appropriately quality assured and quality controlled, as specified in § 63.7 and § 63.8.
(3) The Administrator may establish general procedures in an applicable subpart that accomplish the requirements of paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) of this section.
(h)
Compliance with opacity and visible emission standards
—(1)
Applicability.
The opacity and visible emission standards set forth in this part must apply at all times except as otherwise specified in an applicable subpart. If a startup, shutdown, or malfunction of one portion of an affected source does not affect the ability of particular emission points within other portions of the affected source to comply with the opacity and visible emission standards set forth in this part, then that emission point shall still be required to comply with the opacity and visible emission standards and other applicable requirements.
(2)
Methods for determining compliance.
(i) The Administrator will determine compliance with opacity and visible emission standards in this part based on the results of the test method specified in an applicable subpart. Whenever a continuous opacity monitoring system (COMS) is required to be installed to determine compliance with numerical opacity emission standards in this part, compliance with opacity emission standards in this part shall be determined by using the results from the COMS. Whenever an opacity emission test method is not specified, compliance with opacity emission standards in this part shall be determined by conducting observations in accordance with Test Method 9 in appendix A of part 60 of this chapter or the method specified in paragraph (h)(7)(ii) of this section. Whenever a visible emission test method is not specified, compliance with visible emission standards in this part shall be determined by conducting observations in accordance with Test Method 22 in appendix A of part 60 of this chapter.
(ii) [Reserved]
(iii) If an affected source undergoes opacity or visible emission testing at startup to obtain an operating permit in the State in which the source is located, the results of such testing may be used to demonstrate compliance with a relevant standard if—
(A) The opacity or visible emission test was conducted within a reasonable amount of time before a performance test is required to be conducted under the relevant standard;
(B) The opacity or visible emission test was conducted under representative operating conditions for the source;
(C) The opacity or visible emission test was conducted and the resulting data were reduced using EPA-approved test methods and procedures, as specified in § 63.7(e); and
(D) The opacity or visible emission test was appropriately quality-assured, as specified in § 63.7(c) of this section.
(3) [Reserved]
(4)
Notification of opacity or visible emission observations.
The owner or operator of an affected source shall notify the Administrator in writing of the anticipated date for conducting opacity or visible emission observations in accordance with § 63.9(f), if such observations are required for the source by a relevant standard.
(5)
Conduct of opacity or visible emission observations.
When a relevant standard under this part includes an opacity or visible emission standard, the owner or operator of an affected source shall comply with the following:
(i) For the purpose of demonstrating initial compliance, opacity or visible emission observations shall be conducted concurrently with the initial performance test required in § 63.7 unless one of the following conditions applies:
(A) If no performance test under § 63.7 is required, opacity or visible emission observations shall be conducted within 60 days after achieving the maximum production rate at which a new or reconstructed source will be operated, but not later than 120 days after initial startup of the source, or within 120 days after the effective date of the relevant standard in the case of new sources that start up before the standard's effective date. If no performance test under § 63.7 is required, opacity or visible emission observations shall be conducted within 120 days after the compliance date for an existing or modified source; or
(B) If visibility or other conditions prevent the opacity or visible emission observations from being conducted concurrently with the initial performance test required under § 63.7, or within the time period specified in paragraph (h)(5)(i)(A) of this section, the source's owner or operator shall reschedule the opacity or visible emission observations as soon after the initial performance test, or time period, as possible, but not later than 30 days thereafter, and shall advise the Administrator of the rescheduled date. The rescheduled opacity or visible emission observations shall be conducted (to the extent possible) under the same operating conditions that existed during the initial performance test conducted under § 63.7. The visible emissions observer shall determine whether visibility or other conditions prevent the opacity or visible emission observations from being made concurrently with the initial performance test in accordance with procedures contained in Test Method 9 or Test Method 22 in appendix A of part 60 of this chapter.
(ii) For the purpose of demonstrating initial compliance, the minimum total time of opacity observations shall be 3 hours (30 6-minute averages) for the performance test or other required set of observations (e.g., for fugitive-type emission sources subject only to an opacity emission standard).
(iii) The owner or operator of an affected source to which an opacity or visible emission standard in this part applies shall conduct opacity or visible emission observations in accordance with the provisions of this section, record the results of the evaluation of emissions, and report to the Administrator the opacity or visible emission results in accordance with the provisions of § 63.10(d).
(iv) [Reserved]
(v) Opacity readings of portions of plumes that contain condensed, uncombined water vapor shall not be used for purposes of determining compliance with opacity emission standards.
(6)
Availability of records.
The owner or operator of an affected source shall make available, upon request by the Administrator, such records that the Administrator deems necessary to determine the conditions under which the visual observations were made and shall provide evidence indicating proof of current visible observer emission certification.
(7)
Use of a continuous opacity monitoring system.
(i) The owner or operator of an affected source required to use a continuous opacity monitoring system (COMS) shall record the monitoring data produced during a performance test required under § 63.7 and shall furnish the Administrator a written report of the monitoring results in accordance with the provisions of § 63.10(e)(4).
(ii) Whenever an opacity emission test method has not been specified in an applicable subpart, or an owner or operator of an affected source is required to conduct Test Method 9 observations (see appendix A of part 60 of this chapter), the owner or operator may submit, for compliance purposes, COMS data results produced during any performance test required under § 63.7 in lieu of Method 9 data. If the owner or operator elects to submit COMS data for compliance with the opacity emission standard, he or she shall notify the Administrator of that decision, in writing, simultaneously with the notification under § 63.7(b) of the date the performance test is scheduled to begin. Once the owner or operator of an affected source has notified the Administrator to that effect, the COMS data results will be used to determine opacity compliance during subsequent performance tests required under § 63.7, unless the owner or operator notifies the Administrator in writing to the contrary not later than with the notification under § 63.7(b) of the date the subsequent performance test is scheduled to begin.
(iii) For the purposes of determining compliance with the opacity emission standard during a performance test required under § 63.7 using COMS data, the COMS data shall be reduced to 6-minute averages over the duration of the mass emission performance test.
(iv) The owner or operator of an affected source using a COMS for compliance purposes is responsible for demonstrating that he/she has complied with the performance evaluation requirements of § 63.8(e), that the COMS has been properly maintained, operated, and data quality-assured, as specified in § 63.8(c) and § 63.8(d), and that the resulting data have not been altered in any way.
(v) Except as provided in paragraph (h)(7)(ii) of this section, the results of continuous monitoring by a COMS that indicate that the opacity at the time visual observations were made was not in excess of the emission standard are probative but not conclusive evidence of the actual opacity of an emission, provided that the affected source proves that, at the time of the alleged violation, the instrument used was properly maintained, as specified in § 63.8(c), and met Performance Specification 1 in appendix B of part 60 of this chapter, and that the resulting data have not been altered in any way.
(8)
Finding of compliance.
The Administrator will make a finding concerning an affected source's compliance with an opacity or visible emission standard upon obtaining all the compliance information required by the relevant standard (including the written reports of the results of the performance tests required by § 63.7, the results of Test Method 9 or another required opacity or visible emission test method, the observer certification required by paragraph (h)(6) of this section, and the continuous opacity monitoring system results, whichever is/are applicable) and any information available to the Administrator needed to determine whether proper operation and maintenance practices are being used.
(9)
Adjustment to an opacity emission standard.
(i) If the Administrator finds under paragraph (h)(8) of this section that an affected source is in compliance with all relevant standards for which initial performance tests were conducted under § 63.7, but during the time such performance tests were conducted fails to meet any relevant opacity emission standard, the owner or operator of such source may petition the Administrator to make appropriate adjustment to the opacity emission
standard for the affected source. Until the Administrator notifies the owner or operator of the appropriate adjustment, the relevant opacity emission standard remains applicable.
(ii) The Administrator may grant such a petition upon a demonstration by the owner or operator that—
(A) The affected source and its associated air pollution control equipment were operated and maintained in a manner to minimize the opacity of emissions during the performance tests;
(B) The performance tests were performed under the conditions established by the Administrator; and
(C) The affected source and its associated air pollution control equipment were incapable of being adjusted or operated to meet the relevant opacity emission standard.
(iii) The Administrator will establish an adjusted opacity emission standard for the affected source meeting the above requirements at a level at which the source will be able, as indicated by the performance and opacity tests, to meet the opacity emission standard at all times during which the source is meeting the mass or concentration emission standard. The Administrator will promulgate the new opacity emission standard in the
Federal Register.
(iv) After the Administrator promulgates an adjusted opacity emission standard for an affected source, the owner or operator of such source shall be subject to the new opacity emission standard, and the new opacity emission standard shall apply to such source during any subsequent performance tests.
(i)
Extension of compliance with emission standards.
(1) Until an extension of compliance has been granted by the Administrator (or a State with an approved permit program) under this paragraph, the owner or operator of an affected source subject to the requirements of this section shall comply with all applicable requirements of this part.
(2)
Extension of compliance for early reductions and other reductions
—(i)
Early reductions.
Pursuant to section 112(i)(5) of the Act, if the owner or operator of an existing source demonstrates that the source has achieved a reduction in emissions of hazardous air pollutants in accordance with the provisions of subpart D of this part, the Administrator (or the State with an approved permit program) will grant the owner or operator an extension of compliance with specific requirements of this part, as specified in subpart D.
(ii)
Other reductions.
Pursuant to section 112(i)(6) of the Act, if the owner or operator of an existing source has installed best available control technology (BACT) (as defined in section 169(3) of the Act) or technology required to meet a lowest achievable emission rate (LAER) (as defined in section 171 of the Act) prior to the promulgation of an emission standard in this part applicable to such source and the same pollutant (or stream of pollutants) controlled pursuant to the BACT or LAER installation, the Administrator will grant the owner or operator an extension of compliance with such emission standard that will apply until the date 5 years after the date on which such installation was achieved, as determined by the Administrator.
(3)
Request for extension of compliance.
Paragraphs (i)(4) through (i)(7) of this section concern requests for an extension of compliance with a relevant standard under this part (except requests for an extension of compliance under paragraph (i)(2)(i) of this section will be handled through procedures specified in subpart D of this part).
(4)(i)(A) The owner or operator of an existing source who is unable to comply with a relevant standard established under this part pursuant to section 112(d) of the Act may request that the Administrator (or a State, when the State has an approved part 70 permit program and the source is required to obtain a part 70 permit under that program, or a State, when the State has been delegated the authority to implement and enforce the emission standard for that source) grant an extension allowing the source up to 1 additional year to comply with the standard, if such additional period is necessary for the installation of controls. An additional extension of up to 3 years may be added for mining waste operations, if the 1-year extension of compliance is insufficient to dry and
cover mining waste in order to reduce emissions of any hazardous air pollutant. The owner or operator of an affected source who has requested an extension of compliance under this paragraph and who is otherwise required to obtain a title V permit shall apply for such permit or apply to have the source's title V permit revised to incorporate the conditions of the extension of compliance. The conditions of an extension of compliance granted under this paragraph will be incorporated into the affected source's title V permit according to the provisions of part 70 or Federal title V regulations in this chapter (42 U.S.C. 7661), whichever are applicable.
(B) Any request under this paragraph for an extension of compliance with a relevant standard must be submitted in writing to the appropriate authority no later than 120 days prior to the affected source's compliance date (as specified in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section), except as provided for in paragraph (i)(4)(i)(C) of this section. Nonfrivolous requests submitted under this paragraph will stay the applicability of the rule as to the emission points in question until such time as the request is granted or denied. A denial will be effective as of the date of denial. Emission standards established under this part may specify alternative dates for the submittal of requests for an extension of compliance if alternatives are appropriate for the source categories affected by those standards.
(C) An owner or operator may submit a compliance extension request after the date specified in paragraph (i)(4)(i)(B) of this section provided the need for the compliance extension arose after that date, and before the otherwise applicable compliance date and the need arose due to circumstances beyond reasonable control of the owner or operator. This request must include, in addition to the information required in paragraph (i)(6)(i) of this section, a statement of the reasons additional time is needed and the date when the owner or operator first learned of the problems. Nonfrivolous requests submitted under this paragraph will stay the applicability of the rule as to the emission points in question until such time as the request is granted or denied. A denial will be effective as of the original compliance date.
(ii) The owner or operator of an existing source unable to comply with a relevant standard established under this part pursuant to section 112(f) of the Act may request that the Administrator grant an extension allowing the source up to 2 years after the standard's effective date to comply with the standard. The Administrator may grant such an extension if he/she finds that such additional period is necessary for the installation of controls and that steps will be taken during the period of the extension to assure that the health of persons will be protected from imminent endangerment. Any request for an extension of compliance with a relevant standard under this paragraph must be submitted in writing to the Administrator not later than 90 calendar days after the effective date of the relevant standard.
(5) The owner or operator of an existing source that has installed BACT or technology required to meet LAER [as specified in paragraph (i)(2)(ii) of this section] prior to the promulgation of a relevant emission standard in this part may request that the Administrator grant an extension allowing the source 5 years from the date on which such installation was achieved, as determined by the Administrator, to comply with the standard. Any request for an extension of compliance with a relevant standard under this paragraph shall be submitted in writing to the Administrator not later than 120 days after the promulgation date of the standard. The Administrator may grant such an extension if he or she finds that the installation of BACT or technology to meet LAER controls the same pollutant (or stream of pollutants) that would be controlled at that source by the relevant emission standard.
(6)(i) The request for a compliance extension under paragraph (i)(4) of this section shall include the following information:
(A) A description of the controls to be installed to comply with the standard;
(B) A compliance schedule, including the date by which each step toward
compliance will be reached. At a minimum, the list of dates shall include:
(
1
) The date by which on-site construction, installation of emission control equipment, or a process change is planned to be initiated; and
(
2
) The date by which final compliance is to be achieved.
(
3
) The date by which on-site construction, installation of emission control equipment, or a process change is to be completed; and
(
4
) The date by which final compliance is to be achieved;
(C)-(D)
(ii) The request for a compliance extension under paragraph (i)(5) of this section shall include all information needed to demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that the installation of BACT or technology to meet LAER controls the same pollutant (or stream of pollutants) that would be controlled at that source by the relevant emission standard.
(7) Advice on requesting an extension of compliance may be obtained from the Administrator (or the State with an approved permit program).
(8)
Approval of request for extension of compliance.
Paragraphs (i)(9) through (i)(14) of this section concern approval of an extension of compliance requested under paragraphs (i)(4) through (i)(6) of this section.
(9) Based on the information provided in any request made under paragraphs (i)(4) through (i)(6) of this section, or other information, the Administrator (or the State with an approved permit program) may grant an extension of compliance with an emission standard, as specified in paragraphs (i)(4) and (i)(5) of this section.
(10) The extension will be in writing and will—
(i) Identify each affected source covered by the extension;
(ii) Specify the termination date of the extension;
(iii) Specify the dates by which steps toward compliance are to be taken, if appropriate;
(iv) Specify other applicable requirements to which the compliance extension applies (e.g., performance tests); and
(v)(A) Under paragraph (i)(4), specify any additional conditions that the Administrator (or the State) deems necessary to assure installation of the necessary controls and protection of the health of persons during the extension period; or
(B) Under paragraph (i)(5), specify any additional conditions that the Administrator deems necessary to assure the proper operation and maintenance of the installed controls during the extension period.
(11) The owner or operator of an existing source that has been granted an extension of compliance under paragraph (i)(10) of this section may be required to submit to the Administrator (or the State with an approved permit program) progress reports indicating whether the steps toward compliance outlined in the compliance schedule have been reached. The contents of the progress reports and the dates by which they shall be submitted will be specified in the written extension of compliance granted under paragraph (i)(10) of this section.
(12)(i) The Administrator (or the State with an approved permit program) will notify the owner or operator in writing of approval or intention to deny approval of a request for an extension of compliance within 30 calendar days after receipt of sufficient information to evaluate a request submitted under paragraph (i)(4)(i) or (i)(5) of this section. The Administrator (or the State) will notify the owner or operator in writing of the status of his/her application, that is, whether the application contains sufficient information to make a determination, within 30 calendar days after receipt of the original application and within 30 calendar days after receipt of any supplementary information that is submitted. The 30-day approval or denial period will begin after the owner or operator has been notified in writing that his/her application is complete.
(ii) When notifying the owner or operator that his/her application is not complete, the Administrator will specify the information needed to complete the application and provide notice of opportunity for the applicant to present, in writing, within 30 calendar
days after he/she is notified of the incomplete application, additional information or arguments to the Administrator to enable further action on the application.
(iii) Before denying any request for an extension of compliance, the Administrator (or the State with an approved permit program) will notify the owner or operator in writing of the Administrator's (or the State's) intention to issue the denial, together with—
(A) Notice of the information and findings on which the intended denial is based; and
(B) Notice of opportunity for the owner or operator to present in writing, within 15 calendar days after he/she is notified of the intended denial, additional information or arguments to the Administrator (or the State) before further action on the request.
(iv) The Administrator's final determination to deny any request for an extension will be in writing and will set forth the specific grounds on which the denial is based. The final determination will be made within 30 calendar days after presentation of additional information or argument (if the application is complete), or within 30 calendar days after the final date specified for the presentation if no presentation is made.
(13)(i) The Administrator will notify the owner or operator in writing of approval or intention to deny approval of a request for an extension of compliance within 30 calendar days after receipt of sufficient information to evaluate a request submitted under paragraph (i)(4)(ii) of this section. The 30-day approval or denial period will begin after the owner or operator has been notified in writing that his/her application is complete. The Administrator (or the State) will notify the owner or operator in writing of the status of his/her application, that is, whether the application contains sufficient information to make a determination, within 15 calendar days after receipt of the original application and within 15 calendar days after receipt of any supplementary information that is submitted.
(ii) When notifying the owner or operator that his/her application is not complete, the Administrator will specify the information needed to complete the application and provide notice of opportunity for the applicant to present, in writing, within 15 calendar days after he/she is notified of the incomplete application, additional information or arguments to the Administrator to enable further action on the application.
(iii) Before denying any request for an extension of compliance, the Administrator will notify the owner or operator in writing of the Administrator's intention to issue the denial, together with—
(A) Notice of the information and findings on which the intended denial is based; and

(15) [Reserved]
(16) The granting of an extension under this section shall not abrogate the Administrator's authority under section 114 of the Act.
(j)
Exemption from compliance with emission standards.
The President may exempt any stationary source from compliance with any relevant standard established pursuant to section 112 of the Act for a period of not more than 2 years if the President determines that the technology to implement such standard is not available and that it is in the national security interests of the United States to do so. An exemption under this paragraph may be extended for 1 or more additional periods, each period not to exceed 2 years.
[59 FR 12430, Mar. 16, 1994, as amended at 67 FR 16599, Apr. 5, 2002; 68 FR 32600, May 30, 2003; 71 FR 20454, Apr. 20, 2006; 85 FR 73885, Nov. 19, 2020; 86 FR 13821, Mar. 11, 2021]
§ 63.7
Performance testing requirements.
(a)
Applicability and performance test dates.
(1) The applicability of this section is set out in § 63.1(a)(4).
(2) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, if required to do performance testing by a relevant standard, and unless a waiver of performance testing is obtained under this section or the conditions of paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(B) of this section apply, the owner or operator of the affected source must perform such tests within 180 days of the compliance date for such source.
(i)-(viii) [Reserved]
(ix) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, when an emission standard promulgated under this part is more stringent than the standard proposed (see § 63.6(b)(3)), the owner or operator of a new or reconstructed source subject to that standard for which construction or reconstruction is commenced between the proposal and promulgation dates of the standard shall comply with performance testing requirements within 180 days after the standard's effective date, or within 180 days after startup of the source, whichever is later. If the promulgated standard is more stringent than the proposed standard, the owner or operator may choose to demonstrate compliance with either the proposed or the promulgated standard. If the owner or operator chooses to comply with the proposed standard initially, the owner or operator shall conduct a second performance test within 3 years and 180 days after the effective date of the standard, or after startup of the source, whichever is later, to demonstrate compliance with the promulgated standard.
(3) The Administrator may require an owner or operator to conduct performance tests at the affected source at any other time when the action is authorized by section 114 of the Act.
(4) If a force majeure is about to occur, occurs, or has occurred for which the affected owner or operator intends to assert a claim of force majeure:
(i) The owner or operator shall notify the Administrator, in writing as soon as practicable following the date the owner or operator first knew, or through due diligence should have known that the event may cause or caused a delay in testing beyond the regulatory deadline specified in paragraph (a)(2) or (a)(3) of this section, or elsewhere in this part, but the notification must occur before the performance test deadline unless the initial force majeure or a subsequent force majeure event delays the notice, and in such cases, the notification shall occur as soon as practicable.
(ii) The owner or operator shall provide to the Administrator a written description of the force majeure event and a rationale for attributing the delay in testing beyond the regulatory deadline to the force majeure; describe the measures taken or to be taken to minimize the delay; and identify a date by which the owner or operator proposes to conduct the performance test. The performance test shall be conducted as soon as practicable after the force majeure occurs.
(iii) The decision as to whether or not to grant an extension to the performance test deadline is solely within the discretion of the Administrator. The Administrator will notify the owner or operator in writing of approval or disapproval of the request for an extension as soon as practicable.
(iv) Until an extension of the performance test deadline has been approved by the Administrator under paragraphs (a)(4)(i), (a)(4)(ii), and (a)(4)(iii) of this section, the owner or operator of the affected facility remains strictly subject to the requirements of this part.
(b)
Notification of performance test.
(1) The owner or operator of an affected source must notify the Administrator in writing of his or her intention to conduct a performance test at least 60 calendar days before the performance test is initially scheduled to begin to allow the Administrator, upon request, to review an approve the site-specific test plan required under paragraph (c) of this section and to have an observer present during the test.
(2) In the event the owner or operator is unable to conduct the performance test on the date specified in the notification requirement specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section due to unforeseeable circumstances beyond his or her control, the owner or operator must notify the Administrator as soon as practicable and without delay prior to the scheduled performance test date and specify the date when the performance test is rescheduled. This notification of delay in conducting the performance test shall not relieve the owner or operator of legal responsibility for compliance with any other applicable provisions of this part or with any other applicable Federal, State, or local requirement, nor will it prevent the Administrator from implementing or enforcing this part or taking any other action under the Act.
(c)
Quality assurance program.
(1) The results of the quality assurance program required in this paragraph will be considered by the Administrator when he/she determines the validity of a performance test.
(2)(i)
Submission of site-specific test plan.
Before conducting a required performance test, the owner or operator of an affected source shall develop and, if requested by the Administrator, shall submit a site-specific test plan to the Administrator for approval. The test plan shall include a test program summary, the test schedule, data quality objectives, and both an internal and external quality assurance (QA) program. Data quality objectives are the pretest expectations of precision, accuracy, and completeness of data.
(ii) The internal QA program shall include, at a minimum, the activities planned by routine operators and analysts to provide an assessment of test data precision; an example of internal QA is the sampling and analysis of replicate samples.
(iii) The performance testing shall include a test method performance audit (PA) during the performance test. The PAs consist of blind audit samples supplied by an accredited audit sample provider and analyzed during the performance test in order to provide a measure of test data bias. Gaseous audit samples are designed to audit the performance of the sampling system as well as the analytical system and must be collected by the sampling system during the compliance test just as the compliance samples are collected. If a liquid or solid audit sample is designed to audit the sampling system, it must also be collected by the sampling system during the compliance test. If multiple sampling systems or sampling trains are used during the compliance test for any of the test methods, the tester is only required to use one of the sampling systems per method to collect the audit sample. The audit sample must be analyzed by the same analyst using the same analytical reagents and analytical system and at the same time as the compliance samples. Retests are required when there is a failure to produce acceptable results for an audit sample. However, if the audit results do not affect the compliance or noncompliance status of the affected facility, the compliance authority may waive the reanalysis requirement, further audits, or retests and accept the results of the compliance test. Acceptance of the test results shall constitute a waiver of the reanalysis requirement,
further audits, or retests. The compliance authority may also use the audit sample failure and the compliance test results as evidence to determine the compliance or noncompliance status of the affected facility. A blind audit sample is a sample whose value is known only to the sample provider and is not revealed to the tested facility until after they report the measured value of the audit sample. For pollutants that exist in the gas phase at ambient temperature, the audit sample shall consist of an appropriate concentration of the pollutant in air or nitrogen that can be introduced into the sampling system of the test method at or near the same entry point as a sample from the emission source. If no gas phase audit samples are available, an acceptable alternative is a sample of the pollutant in the same matrix that would be produced when the sample is recovered from the sampling system as required by the test method. For samples that exist only in a liquid or solid form at ambient temperature, the audit sample shall consist of an appropriate concentration of the pollutant in the same matrix that would be produced when the sample is recovered from the sampling system as required by the test method. An accredited audit sample provider (AASP) is an organization that has been accredited to prepare audit samples by an independent, third party accrediting body.
(A) The source owner, operator, or representative of the tested facility shall obtain an audit sample, if commercially available, from an AASP for each test method used for regulatory compliance purposes. No audit samples are required for the following test methods: Methods 3A and 3C of appendix A-3 of part 60 of this chapter; Methods 6C, 7E, 9, and 10 of appendix A-4 of part 60; Methods 18 and 19 of appendix A-6 of part 60; Methods 20, 22, and 25A of appendix A-7 of part 60; Methods 30A and 30B of appendix A-8 of part 60; and Methods 303, 318, 320, and 321 of appendix A of this part. If multiple sources at a single facility are tested during a compliance test event, only one audit sample is required for each method used during a compliance test. The compliance authority responsible for the compliance test may waive the requirement to include an audit sample if they believe that an audit sample is not necessary. “Commercially available” means that two or more independent AASPs have blind audit samples available for purchase. If the source owner, operator, or representative cannot find an audit sample for a specific method, the owner, operator, or representative shall consult the EPA Web site at the following URL,
www.epa.gov/ttn/emc,
to confirm whether there is a source that can supply an audit sample for that method. If the EPA Web site does not list an available audit sample at least 60 days prior to the beginning of the compliance test, the source owner, operator, or representative shall not be required to include an audit sample as part of the quality assurance program for the compliance test. When ordering an audit sample, the source owner, operator, or representative shall give the sample provider an estimate for the concentration of each pollutant that is emitted by the source or the estimated concentration of each pollutant based on the permitted level and the name, address, and phone number of the compliance authority. The source owner, operator, or representative shall report the results for the audit sample along with a summary of the emission test results for the audited pollutant to the compliance authority and shall report the results of the audit sample to the AASP. The source owner, operator, or representative shall make both reports at the same time and in the same manner or shall report to the compliance authority first and then report to the AASP. If the method being audited is a method that allows the samples to be analyzed in the field and the tester plans to analyze the samples in the field, the tester may analyze the audit samples prior to collecting the emission samples provided a representative of the compliance authority is present at the testing site. The tester may request, and the compliance authority may grant, a waiver to the requirement that a representative of the compliance authority must be present at the testing site during the field analysis of an audit sample. The source owner, operator, or representative may report the results of the audit sample
to the compliance authority and then report the results of the audit sample to the AASP prior to collecting any emission samples. The test protocol and final test report shall document whether an audit sample was ordered and utilized and the pass/fail results as applicable.
(B) An AASP shall have and shall prepare, analyze, and report the true value of audit samples in accordance with a written technical criteria document that describes how audit samples will be prepared and distributed in a manner that will ensure the integrity of the audit sample program. An acceptable technical criteria document shall contain standard operating procedures for all of the following operations:
(
1
) Preparing the sample;
(
2
) Confirming the true concentration of the sample;
(
3
) Defining the acceptance limits for the results from a well qualified tester. This procedure must use well established statistical methods to analyze historical results from well qualified testers. The acceptance limits shall be set so that there is 95 percent confidence that 90 percent of well qualified labs will produce future results that are within the acceptance limit range;
(
4
) Providing the opportunity for the compliance authority to comment on the selected concentration level for an audit sample;
(
5
) Distributing the sample to the user in a manner that guarantees that the true value of the sample is unknown to the user;
(
6
) Recording the measured concentration reported by the user and determining if the measured value is within acceptable limits;
(
7
) Reporting the results from each audit sample in a timely manner to the compliance authority and to the source owner, operator, or representative by the AASP. The AASP shall make both reports at the same time and in the same manner or shall report to the compliance authority first and then report to the source owner, operator, or representative. The results shall include the name of the facility tested, the date on which the compliance test was conducted, the name of the company performing the sample collection, the name of the company that analyzed the compliance samples including the audit sample, the measured result for the audit sample, and whether the testing company passed or failed the audit. The AASP shall report the true value of the audit sample to the compliance authority. The AASP may report the true value to the source owner, operator, or representative if the AASP's operating plan ensures that no laboratory will receive the same audit sample twice.
(
8
) Evaluating the acceptance limits of samples at least once every two years to determine in consultation with the voluntary consensus standard body if they should be changed.
(
9
) Maintaining a database, accessible to the compliance authorities, of results from the audit that shall include the name of the facility tested, the date on which the compliance test was conducted, the name of the company performing the sample collection, the name of the company that analyzed the compliance samples including the audit sample, the measured result for the audit sample, the true value of the audit sample, the acceptance range for the measured value, and whether the testing company passed or failed the audit.
(C) The accrediting body shall have a written technical criteria document that describes how it will ensure that the AASP is operating in accordance with the AASP technical criteria document that describes how audit samples are to be prepared and distributed. This document shall contain standard operating procedures for all of the following operations:
(
1
) Checking audit samples to confirm their true value as reported by the AASP.
(
2
) Performing technical systems audits of the AASP's facilities and operating procedures at least once every two years.
(
3
) Providing standards for use by the voluntary consensus standard body to approve the accrediting body that will accredit the audit sample providers.
(D) The technical criteria documents for the accredited sample providers and the accrediting body shall be developed through a public process guided by a voluntary consensus standards body
(VCSB). The VCSB shall operate in accordance with the procedures and requirements in the Office of Management and Budget
Circular A-119.
A copy of Circular A-119 is available upon request by writing the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, 725 17th Street, NW., Washington, DC 20503, by calling (202) 395-6880 or downloading online at
http://standards.gov/standards_gov/a119.cfm.
The VCSB shall approve all accrediting bodies. The Administrator will review all technical criteria documents. If the technical criteria documents do not meet the minimum technical requirements in paragraphs (c)(2)(iii)(B) through (C) of this section, the technical criteria documents are not acceptable and the proposed audit sample program is not capable of producing audit samples of sufficient quality to be used in a compliance test. All acceptable technical criteria documents shall be posted on the EPA Web site at the following URL,
http://www.epa.gov/ttn/emc.
(iv) The owner or operator of an affected source shall submit the site-specific test plan to the Administrator upon the Administrator's request at least 60 calendar days before the performance test is scheduled to take place, that is, simultaneously with the notification of intention to conduct a performance test required under paragraph (b) of this section, or on a mutually agreed upon date.
(v) The Administrator may request additional relevant information after the submittal of a site-specific test plan.
(3)
Approval of site-specific test plan.
(i) The Administrator will notify the owner or operator of approval or intention to deny approval of the site-specific test plan (if review of the site-specific test plan is requested) within 30 calendar days after receipt of the original plan and within 30 calendar days after receipt of any supplementary information that is submitted under paragraph (c)(3)(i)(B) of this section. Before disapproving any site-specific test plan, the Administrator will notify the applicant of the Administrator's intention to disapprove the plan together with—
(A) Notice of the information and findings on which the intended disapproval is based; and
(B) Notice of opportunity for the owner or operator to present, within 30 calendar days after he/she is notified of the intended disapproval, additional information to the Administrator before final action on the plan.
(ii) In the event that the Administrator fails to approve or disapprove the site-specific test plan within the time period specified in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, the following conditions shall apply:
(A) If the owner or operator intends to demonstrate compliance using the test method(s) specified in the relevant standard or with only minor changes to those tests methods (see paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section), the owner or operator must conduct the performance test within the time specified in this section using the specified method(s);
(B) If the owner or operator intends to demonstrate compliance by using an alternative to any test method specified in the relevant standard, the owner or operator is authorized to conduct the performance test using an alternative test method after the Administrator approves the use of the alternative method when the Administrator approves the site-specific test plan (if review of the site-specific test plan is requested) or after the alternative method is approved (see paragraph (f) of this section). However, the owner or operator is authorized to conduct the performance test using an alternative method in the absence of notification of approval 45 days after submission of the site-specific test plan or request to use an alternative method. The owner or operator is authorized to conduct the performance test within 60 calendar days after he/she is authorized to demonstrate compliance using an alternative test method. Notwithstanding the requirements in the preceding three sentences, the owner or operator may proceed to conduct the performance test as required in this section (without the Administrator's prior approval of the site-specific test plan) if he/she subsequently chooses to
use the specified testing and monitoring methods instead of an alternative.
(iii) Neither the submission of a site-specific test plan for approval, nor the Administrator's approval or disapproval of a plan, nor the Administrator's failure to approve or disapprove a plan in a timely manner shall—
(A) Relieve an owner or operator of legal responsibility for compliance with any applicable provisions of this part or with any other applicable Federal, State, or local requirement; or
(B) Prevent the Administrator from implementing or enforcing this part or taking any other action under the Act.
(d)
Performance testing facilities.
If required to do performance testing, the owner or operator of each new source and, at the request of the Administrator, the owner or operator of each existing source, shall provide performance testing facilities as follows:
(1) Sampling ports adequate for test methods applicable to such source. This includes:
(i) Constructing the air pollution control system such that volumetric flow rates and pollutant emission rates can be accurately determined by applicable test methods and procedures; and
(ii) Providing a stack or duct free of cyclonic flow during performance tests, as demonstrated by applicable test methods and procedures;
(2) Safe sampling platform(s);
(3) Safe access to sampling platform(s);
(4) Utilities for sampling and testing equipment; and
(5) Any other facilities that the Administrator deems necessary for safe and adequate testing of a source.
(e)
Conduct of performance tests.
(1) Performance tests shall be conducted under such conditions as the Administrator specifies to the owner or operator based on representative performance (i.e., performance based on normal operating conditions) of the affected source. Operations during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction shall not constitute representative conditions for the purpose of a performance test, nor shall emissions in excess of the level of the relevant standard during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction be considered a violation of the relevant standard unless otherwise specified in the relevant standard or a determination of noncompliance is made under § 63.6(e). Upon request, the owner or operator shall make available to the Administrator such records as may be necessary to determine the conditions of performance tests.
(2) Performance tests shall be conducted and data shall be reduced in accordance with the test methods and procedures set forth in this section, in each relevant standard, and, if required, in applicable appendices of parts 51, 60, 61, and 63 of this chapter unless the Administrator—
(i) Specifies or approves, in specific cases, the use of a test method with minor changes in methodology (see definition in § 63.90(a)). Such changes may be approved in conjunction with approval of the site-specific test plan (see paragraph (c) of this section); or
(ii) Approves the use of an intermediate or major change or alternative to a test method (see definitions in § 63.90(a)), the results of which the Administrator has determined to be adequate for indicating whether a specific affected source is in compliance; or
(iii) Approves shorter sampling times or smaller sample volumes when necessitated by process variables or other factors; or
(iv) Waives the requirement for performance tests because the owner or operator of an affected source has demonstrated by other means to the Administrator's satisfaction that the affected source is in compliance with the relevant standard.
(3) Unless otherwise specified in a relevant standard or test method, each performance test shall consist of three separate runs using the applicable test method. Each run shall be conducted for the time and under the conditions specified in the relevant standard. For the purpose of determining compliance with a relevant standard, the arithmetic mean of the results of the three runs shall apply. Upon receiving approval from the Administrator, results of a test run may be replaced with results of an additional test run in the event that—
(i) A sample is accidentally lost after the testing team leaves the site; or
(ii) Conditions occur in which one of the three runs must be discontinued because of forced shutdown; or
(iii) Extreme meteorological conditions occur; or
(iv) Other circumstances occur that are beyond the owner or operator's control.
(4) Nothing in paragraphs (e)(1) through (e)(3) of this section shall be construed to abrogate the Administrator's authority to require testing under section 114 of the Act.
(f)
Use of an alternative test method
—(1)
General.
Until authorized to use an intermediate or major change or alternative to a test method, the owner or operator of an affected source remains subject to the requirements of this section and the relevant standard.
(2) The owner or operator of an affected source required to do performance testing by a relevant standard may use an alternative test method from that specified in the standard provided that the owner or operator—
(i) Notifies the Administrator of his or her intention to use an alternative test method at least 60 days before the performance test is scheduled to begin;
(ii) Uses Method 301 in appendix A of this part to validate the alternative test method. This may include the use of specific procedures of Method 301 if use of such procedures are sufficient to validate the alternative test method; and
(iii) Submits the results of the Method 301 validation process along with the notification of intention and the justification for not using the specified test method. The owner or operator may submit the information required in this paragraph well in advance of the deadline specified in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section to ensure a timely review by the Administrator in order to meet the performance test date specified in this section or the relevant standard.
(3) The Administrator will determine whether the owner or operator's validation of the proposed alternative test method is adequate and issue an approval or disapproval of the alternative test method. If the owner or operator intends to demonstrate compliance by using an alternative to any test method specified in the relevant standard, the owner or operator is authorized to conduct the performance test using an alternative test method after the Administrator approves the use of the alternative method. However, the owner or operator is authorized to conduct the performance test using an alternative method in the absence of notification of approval/disapproval 45 days after submission of the request to use an alternative method and the request satisfies the requirements in paragraph (f)(2) of this section. The owner or operator is authorized to conduct the performance test within 60 calendar days after he/she is authorized to demonstrate compliance using an alternative test method. Notwithstanding the requirements in the preceding three sentences, the owner or operator may proceed to conduct the performance test as required in this section (without the Administrator's prior approval of the site-specific test plan) if he/she subsequently chooses to use the specified testing and monitoring methods instead of an alternative.
(4) If the Administrator finds reasonable grounds to dispute the results obtained by an alternative test method for the purposes of demonstrating compliance with a relevant standard, the Administrator may require the use of a test method specified in a relevant standard.
(5) If the owner or operator uses an alternative test method for an affected source during a required performance test, the owner or operator of such source shall continue to use the alternative test method for subsequent performance tests at that affected source until he or she receives approval from the Administrator to use another test method as allowed under § 63.7(f).
(6) Neither the validation and approval process nor the failure to validate an alternative test method shall abrogate the owner or operator's responsibility to comply with the requirements of this part.
(g)
Data analysis, recordkeeping, and reporting.
(1) Unless otherwise specified in a relevant standard or test method, or as otherwise approved by the Administrator in writing, results of a performance test shall include the analysis of samples, determination of emissions, and raw data. A performance
test is “completed” when field sample collection is terminated. The owner or operator of an affected source shall report the results of the performance test to the Administrator before the close of business on the 60th day following the completion of the performance test, unless specified otherwise in a relevant standard or as approved otherwise in writing by the Administrator (see § 63.9(i)). The results of the performance test shall be submitted as part of the notification of compliance status required under § 63.9(h). Before a title V permit has been issued to the owner or operator of an affected source, the owner or operator shall send the results of the performance test to the Administrator. After a title V permit has been issued to the owner or operator of an affected source, the owner or operator shall send the results of the performance test to the appropriate permitting authority.
(2) Contents of a performance test, CMS performance evaluation, or CMS quality assurance test report (electronic or paper submitted copy). Unless otherwise specified in a relevant standard, test method, CMS performance specification, or quality assurance requirement for a CMS, or as otherwise approved by the Administrator in writing, the report shall include the elements identified in paragraphs (g)(2)(i) through (vi) of this section.
(i) General identification information for the facility including a mailing address, the physical address, the owner or operator or responsible official (where applicable) and his/her email address, and the appropriate Federal Registry System (FRS) number for the facility.
(ii) Purpose of the test including the applicable regulation requiring the test, the pollutant(s) and other parameters being measured, the applicable emission standard, and any process parameter component, and a brief process description.
(iii) Description of the emission unit tested including fuel burned, control devices, and vent characteristics; the appropriate source classification code (SCC); the permitted maximum process rate (where applicable); and the sampling location.
(iv) Description of sampling and analysis procedures used and any modifications to standard procedures, quality assurance procedures and results, record of process operating conditions that demonstrate the applicable test conditions are met, and values for any operating parameters for which limits were being set during the test.
(v) Where a test method, CEMS, PEMS, or COMS performance specification, or on-going quality assurance requirement for a CEMS, PEMS, or COMS requires you record or report, the following shall be included in your report: Record of preparation of standards, record of calibrations, raw data sheets for field sampling, raw data sheets for field and laboratory analyses, chain-of-custody documentation, and example calculations for reported results.
(vi) Identification of the company conducting the performance test including the primary office address, telephone number, and the contact for this test including his/her email address.
(3) For a minimum of 5 years after a performance test is conducted, the owner or operator shall retain and make available, upon request, for inspection by the Administrator the records or results of such performance test and other data needed to determine emissions from an affected source.
(h)
Waiver of performance tests.
(1) Until a waiver of a performance testing requirement has been granted by the Administrator under this paragraph, the owner or operator of an affected source remains subject to the requirements of this section.
(2) Individual performance tests may be waived upon written application to the Administrator if, in the Administrator's judgment, the source is meeting the relevant standard(s) on a continuous basis, or the source is being operated under an extension of compliance, or the owner or operator has requested an extension of compliance and the Administrator is still considering that request.
(3)
Request to waive a performance test.
(i) If a request is made for an extension
of compliance under § 63.6(i), the application for a waiver of an initial performance test shall accompany the information required for the request for an extension of compliance. If no extension of compliance is requested or if the owner or operator has requested an extension of compliance and the Administrator is still considering that request, the application for a waiver of an initial performance test shall be submitted at least 60 days before the performance test if the site-specific test plan under paragraph (c) of this section is not submitted.
(ii) If an application for a waiver of a subsequent performance test is made, the application may accompany any required compliance progress report, compliance status report, or excess emissions and continuous monitoring system performance report [such as those required under § 63.6(i), § 63.9(h), and § 63.10(e) or specified in a relevant standard or in the source's title V permit], but it shall be submitted at least 60 days before the performance test if the site-specific test plan required under paragraph (c) of this section is not submitted.
(iii) Any application for a waiver of a performance test shall include information justifying the owner or operator's request for a waiver, such as the technical or economic infeasibility, or the impracticality, of the affected source performing the required test.
(4)
Approval of request to waive performance test.
The Administrator will approve or deny a request for a waiver of a performance test made under paragraph (h)(3) of this section when he/she—
(i) Approves or denies an extension of compliance under § 63.6(i)(8); or
(ii) Approves or disapproves a site-specific test plan under § 63.7(c)(3); or
(iii) Makes a determination of compliance following the submission of a required compliance status report or excess emissions and continuous monitoring systems performance report; or
(iv) Makes a determination of suitable progress towards compliance following the submission of a compliance progress report, whichever is applicable.
(5) Approval of any waiver granted under this section shall not abrogate the Administrator's authority under the Act or in any way prohibit the Administrator from later canceling the waiver. The cancellation will be made only after notice is given to the owner or operator of the affected source.

§ 63.8
Monitoring requirements.
(a)
Applicability.
(1) The applicability of this section is set out in § 63.1(a)(4).
(2) For the purposes of this part, all CMS required under relevant standards shall be subject to the provisions of this section upon promulgation of performance specifications for CMS as specified in the relevant standard or otherwise by the Administrator.
(3) [Reserved]
(4) Additional monitoring requirements for control devices used to comply with provisions in relevant standards of this part are specified in § 63.11.
(b)
Conduct of monitoring.
(1) Monitoring shall be conducted as set forth in this section and the relevant standard(s) unless the Administrator—
(i) Specifies or approves the use of minor changes in methodology for the specified monitoring requirements and procedures (see § 63.90(a) for definition); or
(ii) Approves the use of an intermediate or major change or alternative to any monitoring requirements or procedures (see § 63.90(a) for definition).
(iii) Owners or operators with flares subject to § 63.11(b) are not subject to the requirements of this section unless otherwise specified in the relevant standard.
(2)(i) When the emissions from two or more affected sources are combined before being released to the atmosphere, the owner or operator may install an applicable CMS for each emission stream or for the combined emissions streams, provided the monitoring is sufficient to demonstrate compliance with the relevant standard.
(ii) If the relevant standard is a mass emission standard and the emissions from one affected source are released to the atmosphere through more than one point, the owner or operator must
install an applicable CMS at each emission point unless the installation of fewer systems is—
(A) Approved by the Administrator; or
(B) Provided for in a relevant standard (e.g., instead of requiring that a CMS be installed at each emission point before the effluents from those points are channeled to a common control device, the standard specifies that only one CMS is required to be installed at the vent of the control device).
(3) When more than one CMS is used to measure the emissions from one affected source (e.g., multiple breechings, multiple outlets), the owner or operator shall report the results as required for each CMS. However, when one CMS is used as a backup to another CMS, the owner or operator shall report the results from the CMS used to meet the monitoring requirements of this part. If both such CMS are used during a particular reporting period to meet the monitoring requirements of this part, then the owner or operator shall report the results from each CMS for the relevant compliance period.
(c)
Operation and maintenance of continuous monitoring systems.
(1) The owner or operator of an affected source shall maintain and operate each CMS as specified in this section, or in a relevant standard, and in a manner consistent with good air pollution control practices. (i) The owner or operator of an affected source must maintain and operate each CMS as specified in § 63.6(e)(1).
(ii) The owner or operator must keep the necessary parts for routine repairs of the affected CMS equipment readily available.
(iii) The owner or operator of an affected source must develop a written startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan for CMS as specified in § 63.6(e)(3).
(2)(i) All CMS must be installed such that representative measures of emissions or process parameters from the affected source are obtained. In addition, CEMS must be located according to procedures contained in the applicable performance specification(s).
(ii) Unless the individual subpart states otherwise, the owner or operator must ensure the read out (that portion of the CMS that provides a visual display or record), or other indication of operation, from any CMS required for compliance with the emission standard is readily accessible on site for operational control or inspection by the operator of the equipment.
(3) All CMS shall be installed, operational, and the data verified as specified in the relevant standard either prior to or in conjunction with conducting performance tests under § 63.7. Verification of operational status shall, at a minimum, include completion of the manufacturer's written specifications or recommendations for installation, operation, and calibration of the system.
(4) Except for system breakdowns, out-of-control periods, repairs, maintenance periods, calibration checks, and zero (low-level) and high-level calibration drift adjustments, all CMS, including COMS and CEMS, shall be in continuous operation and shall meet minimum frequency of operation requirements as follows:
(i) All COMS shall complete a minimum of one cycle of sampling and analyzing for each successive 10-second period and one cycle of data recording for each successive 6-minute period.
(ii) All CEMS for measuring emissions other than opacity shall complete a minimum of one cycle of operation (sampling, analyzing, and data recording) for each successive 15-minute period.
(5) Unless otherwise approved by the Administrator, minimum procedures for COMS shall include a method for producing a simulated zero opacity condition and an upscale (high-level) opacity condition using a certified neutral density filter or other related technique to produce a known obscuration of the light beam. Such procedures shall provide a system check of all the analyzer's internal optical surfaces and all electronic circuitry, including the lamp and photodetector assembly normally used in the measurement of opacity.
(6) The owner or operator of a CMS that is not a CPMS, which is installed in accordance with the provisions of this part and the applicable CMS performance specification(s), must check
the zero (low-level) and high-level calibration drifts at least once daily in accordance with the written procedure specified in the performance evaluation plan developed under paragraphs (e)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section. The zero (low-level) and high-level calibration drifts must be adjusted, at a minimum, whenever the 24-hour zero (low-level) drift exceeds two times the limits of the applicable performance specification(s) specified in the relevant standard. The system shall allow the amount of excess zero (low-level) and high-level drift measured at the 24-hour interval checks to be recorded and quantified whenever specified. For COMS, all optical and instrumental surfaces exposed to the effluent gases must be cleaned prior to performing the zero (low-level) and high-level drift adjustments; the optical surfaces and instrumental surfaces must be cleaned when the cumulative automatic zero compensation, if applicable, exceeds 4 percent opacity. The CPMS must be calibrated prior to use for the purposes of complying with this section. The CPMS must be checked daily for indication that the system is responding. If the CPMS system includes an internal system check, results must be recorded and checked daily for proper operation.
(7)(i) A CMS is out of control if—
(A) The zero (low-level), mid-level (if applicable), or high-level calibration drift (CD) exceeds two times the applicable CD specification in the applicable performance specification or in the relevant standard; or
(B) The CMS fails a performance test audit (e.g., cylinder gas audit), relative accuracy audit, relative accuracy test audit, or linearity test audit; or
(C) The COMS CD exceeds two times the limit in the applicable performance specification in the relevant standard.
(ii) When the CMS is out of control, the owner or operator of the affected source shall take the necessary corrective action and shall repeat all necessary tests which indicate that the system is out of control. The owner or operator shall take corrective action and conduct retesting until the performance requirements are below the applicable limits. The beginning of the out-of-control period is the hour the owner or operator conducts a performance check (e.g., calibration drift) that indicates an exceedance of the performance requirements established under this part. The end of the out-of-control period is the hour following the completion of corrective action and successful demonstration that the system is within the allowable limits. During the period the CMS is out of control, recorded data shall not be used in data averages and calculations, or to meet any data availability requirement established under this part.
(8) The owner or operator of a CMS that is out of control as defined in paragraph (c)(7) of this section shall submit all information concerning out-of-control periods, including start and end dates and hours and descriptions of corrective actions taken, in the excess emissions and continuous monitoring system performance report required in § 63.10(e)(3).
(d)
Quality control program.
(1) The results of the quality control program required in this paragraph will be considered by the Administrator when he/she determines the validity of monitoring data.
(2) The owner or operator of an affected source that is required to use a CMS and is subject to the monitoring requirements of this section and a relevant standard shall develop and implement a CMS quality control program. As part of the quality control program, the owner or operator shall develop and submit to the Administrator for approval upon request a site-specific performance evaluation test plan for the CMS performance evaluation required in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section, according to the procedures specified in paragraph (e). In addition, each quality control program shall include, at a minimum, a written protocol that describes procedures for each of the following operations:
(i) Initial and any subsequent calibration of the CMS;
(ii) Determination and adjustment of the calibration drift of the CMS;
(iii) Preventive maintenance of the CMS, including spare parts inventory;
(iv) Data recording, calculations, and reporting;
(v) Accuracy audit procedures, including sampling and analysis methods; and
(vi) Program of corrective action for a malfunctioning CMS.
(3) The owner or operator shall keep these written procedures on record for the life of the affected source or until the affected source is no longer subject to the provisions of this part, to be made available for inspection, upon request, by the Administrator. If the performance evaluation plan is revised, the owner or operator shall keep previous (i.e., superseded) versions of the performance evaluation plan on record to be made available for inspection, upon request, by the Administrator, for a period of 5 years after each revision to the plan. Where relevant, e.g., program of corrective action for a malfunctioning CMS, these written procedures may be incorporated as part of the affected source's startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan to avoid duplication of planning and recordkeeping efforts.
(e)
Performance evaluation of continuous monitoring systems
—(1)
General.
When required by a relevant standard, and at any other time the Administrator may require under section 114 of the Act, the owner or operator of an affected source being monitored shall conduct a performance evaluation of the CMS. Such performance evaluation shall be conducted according to the applicable specifications and procedures described in this section or in the relevant standard.
(2)
Notification of performance evaluation.
The owner or operator shall notify the Administrator in writing of the date of the performance evaluation simultaneously with the notification of the performance test date required under § 63.7(b) or at least 60 days prior to the date the performance evaluation is scheduled to begin if no performance test is required.
(3)(i)
Submission of site-specific performance evaluation test plan.
Before conducting a required CMS performance evaluation, the owner or operator of an affected source shall develop and submit a site-specific performance evaluation test plan to the Administrator for approval upon request. The performance evaluation test plan shall include the evaluation program objectives, an evaluation program summary, the performance evaluation schedule, data quality objectives, and both an internal and external QA program. Data quality objectives are the pre-evaluation expectations of precision, accuracy, and completeness of data.
(ii) The internal QA program shall include, at a minimum, the activities planned by routine operators and analysts to provide an assessment of CMS performance. The external QA program shall include, at a minimum, systems audits that include the opportunity for on-site evaluation by the Administrator of instrument calibration, data validation, sample logging, and documentation of quality control data and field maintenance activities.
(iii) The owner or operator of an affected source shall submit the site-specific performance evaluation test plan to the Administrator (if requested) at least 60 days before the performance test or performance evaluation is scheduled to begin, or on a mutually agreed upon date, and review and approval of the performance evaluation test plan by the Administrator will occur with the review and approval of the site-specific test plan (if review of the site-specific test plan is requested).
(iv) The Administrator may request additional relevant information after the submittal of a site-specific performance evaluation test plan.
(v) In the event that the Administrator fails to approve or disapprove the site-specific performance evaluation test plan within the time period specified in § 63.7(c)(3), the following conditions shall apply:
(A) If the owner or operator intends to demonstrate compliance using the monitoring method(s) specified in the relevant standard, the owner or operator shall conduct the performance evaluation within the time specified in this subpart using the specified method(s);
(B) If the owner or operator intends to demonstrate compliance by using an alternative to a monitoring method specified in the relevant standard, the owner or operator shall refrain from conducting the performance evaluation until the Administrator approves the use of the alternative method. If the Administrator does not approve the use of the alternative method within 30 days before the performance evaluation
is scheduled to begin, the performance evaluation deadlines specified in paragraph (e)(4) of this section may be extended such that the owner or operator shall conduct the performance evaluation within 60 calendar days after the Administrator approves the use of the alternative method. Notwithstanding the requirements in the preceding two sentences, the owner or operator may proceed to conduct the performance evaluation as required in this section (without the Administrator's prior approval of the site-specific performance evaluation test plan) if he/she subsequently chooses to use the specified monitoring method(s) instead of an alternative.
(vi) Neither the submission of a site-specific performance evaluation test plan for approval, nor the Administrator's approval or disapproval of a plan, nor the Administrator's failure to approve or disapprove a plan in a timely manner shall—
(A) Relieve an owner or operator of legal responsibility for compliance with any applicable provisions of this part or with any other applicable Federal, State, or local requirement; or
(B) Prevent the Administrator from implementing or enforcing this part or taking any other action under the Act.
(4)
Conduct of performance evaluation and performance evaluation dates.
The owner or operator of an affected source shall conduct a performance evaluation of a required CMS during any performance test required under § 63.7 in accordance with the applicable performance specification as specified in the relevant standard. Notwithstanding the requirement in the previous sentence, if the owner or operator of an affected source elects to submit COMS data for compliance with a relevant opacity emission standard as provided under § 63.6(h)(7), he/she shall conduct a performance evaluation of the COMS as specified in the relevant standard, before the performance test required under § 63.7 is conducted in time to submit the results of the performance evaluation as specified in paragraph (e)(5)(ii) of this section. If a performance test is not required, or the requirement for a performance test has been waived under § 63.7(h), the owner or operator of an affected source shall conduct the performance evaluation not later than 180 days after the appropriate compliance date for the affected source, as specified in § 63.7(a), or as otherwise specified in the relevant standard.
(5)
Reporting performance evaluation results.
(i) The owner or operator shall furnish the Administrator a copy of a written report of the results of the performance evaluation containing the information specified in § 63.7(g)(2)(i) through (vi) simultaneously with the results of the performance test required under § 63.7 or within 60 days of completion of the performance evaluation, unless otherwise specified in a relevant standard.
(ii) The owner or operator of an affected source using a COMS to determine opacity compliance during any performance test required under § 63.7 and described in § 63.6(d)(6) shall furnish the Administrator two or, upon request, three copies of a written report of the results of the COMS performance evaluation under this paragraph. The copies shall be provided at least 15 calendar days before the performance test required under § 63.7 is conducted.
(f)
Use of an alternative monitoring method
—(1)
General.
Until permission to use an alternative monitoring procedure (minor, intermediate, or major changes; see definition in § 63.90(a)) has been granted by the Administrator under this paragraph (f)(1), the owner or operator of an affected source remains subject to the requirements of this section and the relevant standard.
(2) After receipt and consideration of written application, the Administrator may approve alternatives to any monitoring methods or procedures of this part including, but not limited to, the following:
(i) Alternative monitoring requirements when installation of a CMS specified by a relevant standard would not provide accurate measurements due to liquid water or other interferences caused by substances within the effluent gases;
(ii) Alternative monitoring requirements when the affected source is infrequently operated;
(iii) Alternative monitoring requirements to accommodate CEMS that require additional measurements to correct for stack moisture conditions;
(iv) Alternative locations for installing CMS when the owner or operator can demonstrate that installation at alternate locations will enable accurate and representative measurements;
(v) Alternate methods for converting pollutant concentration measurements to units of the relevant standard;
(vi) Alternate procedures for performing daily checks of zero (low-level) and high-level drift that do not involve use of high-level gases or test cells;
(vii) Alternatives to the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) test methods or sampling procedures specified by any relevant standard;
(viii) Alternative CMS that do not meet the design or performance requirements in this part, but adequately demonstrate a definite and consistent relationship between their measurements and the measurements of opacity by a system complying with the requirements as specified in the relevant standard. The Administrator may require that such demonstration be performed for each affected source; or
(ix) Alternative monitoring requirements when the effluent from a single affected source or the combined effluent from two or more affected sources is released to the atmosphere through more than one point.
(3) If the Administrator finds reasonable grounds to dispute the results obtained by an alternative monitoring method, requirement, or procedure, the Administrator may require the use of a method, requirement, or procedure specified in this section or in the relevant standard. If the results of the specified and alternative method, requirement, or procedure do not agree, the results obtained by the specified method, requirement, or procedure shall prevail.
(4)(i)
Request to use alternative monitoring procedure.
An owner or operator who wishes to use an alternative monitoring procedure must submit an application to the Administrator as described in paragraph (f)(4)(ii) of this section. The application may be submitted at any time provided that the monitoring procedure is not the performance test method used to demonstrate compliance with a relevant standard or other requirement. If the alternative monitoring procedure will serve as the performance test method that is to be used to demonstrate compliance with a relevant standard, the application must be submitted at least 60 days before the performance evaluation is scheduled to begin and must meet the requirements for an alternative test method under § 63.7(f).
(ii) The application must contain a description of the proposed alternative monitoring system which addresses the four elements contained in the definition of monitoring in § 63.2 and a performance evaluation test plan, if required, as specified in paragraph (e)(3) of this section. In addition, the application must include information justifying the owner or operator's request for an alternative monitoring method, such as the technical or economic infeasibility, or the impracticality, of the affected source using the required method.
(iii) The owner or operator may submit the information required in this paragraph well in advance of the submittal dates specified in paragraph (f)(4)(i) above to ensure a timely review by the Administrator in order to meet the compliance demonstration date specified in this section or the relevant standard.
(iv) Application for minor changes to monitoring procedures, as specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, may be made in the site-specific performance evaluation plan.
(5)
Approval of request to use alternative monitoring procedure.
(i) The Administrator will notify the owner or operator of approval or intention to deny approval of the request to use an alternative monitoring method within 30 calendar days after receipt of the original request and within 30 calendar days after receipt of any supplementary information that is submitted. If a request for a minor change is made in conjunction with site-specific performance evaluation plan, then
approval of the plan will constitute approval of the minor change. Before disapproving any request to use an alternative monitoring method, the Administrator will notify the applicant of the Administrator's intention to disapprove the request together with—
(A) Notice of the information and findings on which the intended disapproval is based; and
(B) Notice of opportunity for the owner or operator to present additional information to the Administrator before final action on the request. At the time the Administrator notifies the applicant of his or her intention to disapprove the request, the Administrator will specify how much time the owner or operator will have after being notified of the intended disapproval to submit the additional information.
(ii) The Administrator may establish general procedures and criteria in a relevant standard to accomplish the requirements of paragraph (f)(5)(i) of this section.
(iii) If the Administrator approves the use of an alternative monitoring method for an affected source under paragraph (f)(5)(i) of this section, the owner or operator of such source shall continue to use the alternative monitoring method until he or she receives approval from the Administrator to use another monitoring method as allowed by § 63.8(f).
(6)
Alternative to the relative accuracy test.
An alternative to the relative accuracy test for CEMS specified in a relevant standard may be requested as follows:
(i)
Criteria for approval of alternative procedures.
An alternative to the test method for determining relative accuracy is available for affected sources with emission rates demonstrated to be less than 50 percent of the relevant standard. The owner or operator of an affected source may petition the Administrator under paragraph (f)(6)(ii) of this section to substitute the relative accuracy test in section 7 of Performance Specification 2 with the procedures in section 10 if the results of a performance test conducted according to the requirements in § 63.7, or other tests performed following the criteria in § 63.7, demonstrate that the emission rate of the pollutant of interest in the units of the relevant standard is less than 50 percent of the relevant standard. For affected sources subject to emission limitations expressed as control efficiency levels, the owner or operator may petition the Administrator to substitute the relative accuracy test with the procedures in section 10 of Performance Specification 2 if the control device exhaust emission rate is less than 50 percent of the level needed to meet the control efficiency requirement. The alternative procedures do not apply if the CEMS is used continuously to determine compliance with the relevant standard.
(ii)
Petition to use alternative to relative accuracy test.
The petition to use an alternative to the relative accuracy test shall include a detailed description of the procedures to be applied, the location and the procedure for conducting the alternative, the concentration or response levels of the alternative relative accuracy materials, and the other equipment checks included in the alternative procedure(s). The Administrator will review the petition for completeness and applicability. The Administrator's determination to approve an alternative will depend on the intended use of the CEMS data and may require specifications more stringent than in Performance Specification 2.
(iii)
Rescission of approval to use alternative to relative accuracy test.
The Administrator will review the permission to use an alternative to the CEMS relative accuracy test and may rescind such permission if the CEMS data from a successful completion of the alternative relative accuracy procedure indicate that the affected source's emissions are approaching the level of the relevant standard. The criterion for reviewing the permission is that the collection of CEMS data shows that emissions have exceeded 70 percent of the relevant standard for any averaging period, as specified in the relevant standard. For affected sources subject to emission limitations expressed as control efficiency levels, the criterion for reviewing the permission is that the collection of CEMS data shows that exhaust emissions have exceeded 70 percent of the level needed to meet the control efficiency requirement for any
averaging period, as specified in the relevant standard. The owner or operator of the affected source shall maintain records and determine the level of emissions relative to the criterion for permission to use an alternative for relative accuracy testing. If this criterion is exceeded, the owner or operator shall notify the Administrator within 10 days of such occurrence and include a description of the nature and cause of the increased emissions. The Administrator will review the notification and may rescind permission to use an alternative and require the owner or operator to conduct a relative accuracy test of the CEMS as specified in section 7 of Performance Specification 2. The Administrator will review the notification and may rescind permission to use an alternative and require the owner or operator to conduct a relative accuracy test of the CEMS as specified in section 8.4 of Performance Specification 2.
(g)
Reduction of monitoring data.
(1) The owner or operator of each CMS must reduce the monitoring data as specified in paragraphs (g)(1) through (5) of this section.
(2) The owner or operator of each COMS shall reduce all data to 6-minute averages calculated from 36 or more data points equally spaced over each 6-minute period. Data from CEMS for measurement other than opacity, unless otherwise specified in the relevant standard, shall be reduced to 1-hour averages computed from four or more data points equally spaced over each 1-hour period, except during periods when calibration, quality assurance, or maintenance activities pursuant to provisions of this part are being performed. During these periods, a valid hourly average shall consist of at least two data points with each representing a 15-minute period. Alternatively, an arithmetic or integrated 1-hour average of CEMS data may be used. Time periods for averaging are defined in § 63.2.
(3) The data may be recorded in reduced or nonreduced form (e.g., ppm pollutant and percent O
2
or ng/J of pollutant).
(4) All emission data shall be converted into units of the relevant standard for reporting purposes using the conversion procedures specified in that standard. After conversion into units of the relevant standard, the data may be rounded to the same number of significant digits as used in that standard to specify the emission limit (e.g., rounded to the nearest 1 percent opacity).
(5) Monitoring data recorded during periods of unavoidable CMS breakdowns, out-of-control periods, repairs, maintenance periods, calibration checks, and zero (low-level) and high-level adjustments must not be included in any data average computed under this part. For the owner or operator complying with the requirements of § 63.10(b)(2)(vii)(A) or (B), data averages must include any data recorded during periods of monitor breakdown or malfunction.

§ 63.9
Notification requirements.
(a)
Applicability and general information.
(1) The applicability of this section is set out in § 63.1(a)(4).
(2) For affected sources that have been granted an extension of compliance under subpart D of this part, the requirements of this section do not apply to those sources while they are operating under such compliance extensions.
(3) If any State requires a notice that contains all the information required in a notification listed in this section, the owner or operator may send the Administrator a copy of the notice sent to the State to satisfy the requirements of this section for that notification.
(4)(i) Before a State has been delegated the authority to implement and enforce notification requirements established under this part, the owner or operator of an affected source in such State subject to such requirements shall submit notifications to the appropriate Regional Office of the EPA (to the attention of the Director of the Division indicated in the list of the EPA Regional Offices in § 63.13).
(ii) After a State has been delegated the authority to implement and enforce notification requirements established under this part, the owner or operator of an affected source in such State subject to such requirements shall submit notifications to the delegated State authority (which may be the same as the permitting authority). In addition, if the delegated (permitting) authority is the State, the owner or operator shall send a copy of each notification submitted to the State to the appropriate Regional Office of the EPA, as specified in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section. The Regional Office may waive this requirement for any notifications at its discretion.
(b)
Initial notifications.
(1)(i) The requirements of this paragraph apply to the owner or operator of an affected source when such source becomes subject to a relevant standard.
(ii) If an area source subsequently becomes a major source that is subject to the emission standard or other requirement, such source shall be subject to the notification requirements of this section. Area sources previously subject to major source requirements that become major sources again are also subject to the notification requirements of this paragraph and must submit the notification according to the requirements of paragraph (k) of this section.
(iii) Affected sources that are required under this paragraph to submit an initial notification may use the application for approval of construction or reconstruction under § 63.5(d) of this subpart, if relevant, to fulfill the initial notification requirements of this paragraph.
(2) The owner or operator of an affected source that has an initial startup before the effective date of a relevant standard under this part shall notify the Administrator in writing that the source is subject to the relevant standard. The notification, which shall be submitted not later than 120 calendar days after the effective date of the relevant standard (or within 120 calendar days after the source becomes subject to the relevant standard), shall provide the following information:
(i) The name and address of the owner or operator;
(ii) The address (i.e., physical location) of the affected source;
(iii) An identification of the relevant standard, or other requirement, that is the basis of the notification and the source's compliance date;
(iv) A brief description of the nature, size, design, and method of operation of the source and an identification of the types of emission points within the affected source subject to the relevant standard and types of hazardous air pollutants emitted; and
(v) A statement of whether the affected source is a major source or an area source.
(3) [Reserved]
(4) The owner or operator of a new or reconstructed major affected source for which an application for approval of construction or reconstruction is required under § 63.5(d) must provide the following information in writing to the Administrator:
(i) A notification of intention to construct a new major-emitting affected source, reconstruct a major-emitting affected source, or reconstruct a major source such that the source becomes a major-emitting affected source with the application for approval of construction or reconstruction as specified in § 63.5(d)(1)(i); and
(ii)-(iv) [Reserved]
(v) A notification of the actual date of startup of the source, delivered or postmarked within 15 calendar days after that date.
(5) The owner or operator of a new or reconstructed affected source for which an application for approval of construction or reconstruction is not required under § 63.5(d) must provide the following information in writing to the Administrator:
(i) A notification of intention to construct a new affected source, reconstruct an affected source, or reconstruct a source such that the source becomes an affected source, and
(ii) A notification of the actual date of startup of the source, delivered or postmarked within 15 calendar days after that date.

less than the information in § 63.5(d), the notification must include the information required on the application for approval of construction or reconstruction as specified in § 63.5(d)(1)(i).
(c)
Request for extension of compliance.
If the owner or operator of an affected source cannot comply with a relevant standard by the applicable compliance date for that source, or if the owner or operator has installed BACT or technology to meet LAER consistent with § 63.6(i)(5) of this subpart, he/she may submit to the Administrator (or the State with an approved permit program) a request for an extension of compliance as specified in § 63.6(i)(4) through § 63.6(i)(6).
(d)
Notification that source is subject to special compliance requirements.
An owner or operator of a new source that is subject to special compliance requirements as specified in § 63.6(b)(3) and § 63.6(b)(4) shall notify the Administrator of his/her compliance obligations not later than the notification dates established in paragraph (b) of this section for new sources that are not subject to the special provisions.
(e)
Notification of performance test.
The owner or operator of an affected source shall notify the Administrator in writing of his or her intention to conduct a performance test at least 60 calendar days before the performance test is scheduled to begin to allow the Administrator to review and approve the site-specific test plan required under § 63.7(c), if requested by the Administrator, and to have an observer present during the test.
(f)
Notification of opacity and visible emission observations.
The owner or operator of an affected source shall notify the Administrator in writing of the anticipated date for conducting the opacity or visible emission observations specified in § 63.6(h)(5), if such observations are required for the source by a relevant standard. The notification shall be submitted with the notification of the performance test date, as specified in paragraph (e) of this section, or if no performance test is required or visibility or other conditions prevent the opacity or visible emission observations from being conducted concurrently with the initial performance test required under § 63.7, the owner or operator shall deliver or postmark the notification not less than 30 days before the opacity or visible emission observations are scheduled to take place.
(g)
Additional notification requirements for sources with continuous monitoring systems.
The owner or operator of an affected source required to use a CMS by a relevant standard shall furnish the Administrator written notification as follows:
(1) A notification of the date the CMS performance evaluation under § 63.8(e) is scheduled to begin, submitted simultaneously with the notification of the performance test date required under § 63.7(b). If no performance test is required, or if the requirement to conduct a performance test has been waived for an affected source under § 63.7(h), the owner or operator shall notify the Administrator in writing of the date of the performance evaluation at least 60 calendar days before the evaluation is scheduled to begin;
(2) A notification that COMS data results will be used to determine compliance with the applicable opacity emission standard during a performance test required by § 63.7 in lieu of Method 9 or other opacity emissions test method data, as allowed by § 63.6(h)(7)(ii), if compliance with an opacity emission standard is required for the source by a relevant standard. The notification shall be submitted at least 60 calendar days before the performance test is scheduled to begin; and
(3) A notification that the criterion necessary to continue use of an alternative to relative accuracy testing, as provided by § 63.8(f)(6), has been exceeded. The notification shall be delivered or postmarked not later than 10 days after the occurrence of such exceedance, and it shall include a description of the nature and cause of the increased emissions.
(h)
Notification of compliance status.
(1) The requirements of paragraphs (h)(2) through (h)(4) of this section apply when an affected source becomes subject to a relevant standard.
(2)(i) Before a title V permit has been issued to the owner or operator of an affected source, and each time a notification of compliance status is required under this part, the owner or operator
of such source shall submit to the Administrator a notification of compliance status, signed by the responsible official who shall certify its accuracy, attesting to whether the source has complied with the relevant standard. The notification shall list—
(A) The methods that were used to determine compliance;
(B) The results of any performance tests, opacity or visible emission observations, continuous monitoring system (CMS) performance evaluations, and/or other monitoring procedures or methods that were conducted;
(C) The methods that will be used for determining continuing compliance, including a description of monitoring and reporting requirements and test methods;
(D) The type and quantity of hazardous air pollutants emitted by the source (or surrogate pollutants if specified in the relevant standard), reported in units and averaging times and in accordance with the test methods specified in the relevant standard;
(E) If the relevant standard applies to both major and area sources, an analysis demonstrating whether the affected source is a major source (using the emissions data generated for this notification);
(F) A description of the air pollution control equipment (or method) for each emission point, including each control device (or method) for each hazardous air pollutant and the control efficiency (percent) for each control device (or method); and
(G) A statement by the owner or operator of the affected existing, new, or reconstructed source as to whether the source has complied with the relevant standard or other requirements.
(ii) The notification must be sent before the close of business on the 60th day following the completion of the relevant compliance demonstration activity specified in the relevant standard (unless a different reporting period is specified in the standard, in which case the letter must be sent before the close of business on the day the report of the relevant testing or monitoring results is required to be delivered or postmarked). For example, the notification shall be sent before close of business on the 60th (or other required) day following completion of the initial performance test and again before the close of business on the 60th (or other required) day following the completion of any subsequent required performance test. If no performance test is required but opacity or visible emission observations are required to demonstrate compliance with an opacity or visible emission standard under this part, the notification of compliance status shall be sent before close of business on the 30th day following the completion of opacity or visible emission observations. Notifications may be combined as long as the due date requirement for each notification is met.
(3) After a title V permit has been issued to the owner or operator of an affected source, the owner or operator of such source shall comply with all requirements for compliance status reports contained in the source's title V permit, including reports required under this part. After a title V permit has been issued to the owner or operator of an affected source, and each time a notification of compliance status is required under this part, the owner or operator of such source shall submit the notification of compliance status to the appropriate permitting authority following completion of the relevant compliance demonstration activity specified in the relevant standard.
(4) [Reserved]
(5) If an owner or operator of an affected source submits estimates or preliminary information in the application for approval of construction or reconstruction required in § 63.5(d) in place of the actual emissions data or control efficiencies required in paragraphs (d)(1)(ii)(H) and (d)(2) of § 63.5, the owner or operator shall submit the actual emissions data and other correct information as soon as available but no later than with the initial notification of compliance status required in this section.
(6) Advice on a notification of compliance status may be obtained from the Administrator.
(i)
Adjustment to time periods or postmark deadlines for submittal and review of required communications.
(1)(i) Until an adjustment of a time period or postmark deadline has been approved by
the Administrator under paragraphs (i)(2) and (i)(3) of this section, the owner or operator of an affected source remains strictly subject to the requirements of this part.
(ii) An owner or operator shall request the adjustment provided for in paragraphs (i)(2) and (i)(3) of this section each time he or she wishes to change an applicable time period or postmark deadline specified in this part.
(2) Notwithstanding time periods or postmark deadlines specified in this part for the submittal of information to the Administrator by an owner or operator, or the review of such information by the Administrator, such time periods or deadlines may be changed by mutual agreement between the owner or operator and the Administrator. An owner or operator who wishes to request a change in a time period or postmark deadline for a particular requirement shall request the adjustment in writing as soon as practicable before the subject activity is required to take place. The owner or operator shall include in the request whatever information he or she considers useful to convince the Administrator that an adjustment is warranted.
(3) If, in the Administrator's judgment, an owner or operator's request for an adjustment to a particular time period or postmark deadline is warranted, the Administrator will approve the adjustment. The Administrator will notify the owner or operator in writing of approval or disapproval of the request for an adjustment within 15 calendar days of receiving sufficient information to evaluate the request.
(4) If the Administrator is unable to meet a specified deadline, he or she will notify the owner or operator of any significant delay and inform the owner or operator of the amended schedule.
(j)
Change in information already provided.
Any change in the information already provided under this section shall be provided to the Administrator within 15 calendar days after the change. The owner or operator of a major source that reclassifies to area source status is also subject to the notification requirements of this paragraph. The owner or operator may submit the application for reclassification with the regulatory authority (
e.g.,
permit application) according to paragraph (k) of this section to fulfill the requirements of this paragraph, but the information required in paragraphs (j)(1) through (4) of this section must be included. A source which reclassified after January 25, 2018, and before January 19, 2021, and has not yet provided the notification of a change in information is required to provide such notification no later than February 2, 2021, according to the requirements of paragraph (k) of this section. Beginning January 19, 2021, the owner or operator of a major source that reclassifies to area source status must submit the notification according to the requirements of paragraph (k) of this section. A notification of reclassification must contain the following information:
(1) The name and address of the owner or operator;
(2) The address (
i.e.,
physical location) of the affected source;
(3) An identification of the standard being reclassified from and to (if applicable); and
(4) Date of effectiveness of the reclassification.
(k)
Electronic submission of notifications or reports.
If you are required to submit notifications or reports following the procedure specified in this paragraph (k), you must submit notifications or reports to the EPA via the EPA's Compliance and Emissions Data Reporting Interface (CEDRI), which can be accessed through the EPA's Central Data Exchange (CDX) (
https://cdx.epa.gov/
). The notification or report must be submitted by the deadline specified. The EPA will make all the information submitted through CEDRI available to the public without further notice to you. Do not use CEDRI to submit information you claim as confidential business information (CBI). Although we do not expect persons to assert a claim of CBI, if you wish to assert a CBI claim for some of the information in the report or notification, you must submit the information claimed to be CBI according to the procedures in paragraph (k)(3) of this section.
(1) If you are required to electronically submit a notification or report by this paragraph (k) through CEDRI in the EPA's CDX, you may assert a claim of EPA system outage for failure to timely comply with the electronic submittal requirement. To assert a claim of EPA system outage, you must meet the requirements outlined in paragraphs (k)(1)(i) through (vii) of this section.
(i) You must have been or will be precluded from accessing CEDRI and submitting a required notification or report within the time prescribed due to an outage of either the EPA's CEDRI or CDX systems.
(ii) The outage must have occurred within the period of time beginning 5 business days prior to the date that the notification or report is due.
(iii) The outage may be planned or unplanned.
(iv) You must submit notification to the Administrator in writing as soon as possible following the date you first knew, or through due diligence should have known, that the event may cause or has caused a delay in reporting.
(v) You must provide to the Administrator a written description identifying:
(A) The date(s) and time(s) when CDX or CEDRI was accessed and the system was unavailable;
(B) A rationale for attributing the delay in submitting beyond the regulatory deadline to EPA system outage;
(C) Measures taken or to be taken to minimize the delay in submitting; and
(D) The date by which you propose to submit, or if you have already met the electronic submittal requirement in this paragraph (k) at the time of the notification, the date you submitted the notification or report.
(vi) The decision to accept the claim of EPA system outage and allow an extension to the reporting deadline is solely within the discretion of the Administrator.
(vii) In any circumstance, the notification or report must be submitted electronically as soon as possible after the outage is resolved.
(2) If you are required to electronically submit a notification or report by this paragraph (k) through CEDRI in the EPA's CDX, you may assert a claim of force majeure for failure to timely comply with the electronic submittal requirement. To assert a claim of force majeure, you must meet the requirements outlined in paragraphs (k)(2)(i) through (v) of this section.
(i) You may submit a claim if a force majeure event is about to occur, occurs, or has occurred or there are lingering effects from such an event within the period of time beginning five business days prior to the date the submission is due. For the purposes of this section, a force majeure event is defined as an event that will be or has been caused by circumstances beyond the control of the affected facility, its contractors, or any entity controlled by the affected facility that prevents you from complying with the requirement to submit a notification or report electronically within the time period prescribed. Examples of such events are acts of nature (
e.g.,
hurricanes, earthquakes, or floods), acts of war or terrorism, or equipment failure or safety hazard beyond the control of the affected facility (
e.g.,
large scale power outage).
(ii) You must submit notification to the Administrator in writing as soon as possible following the date you first knew, or through due diligence should have known, that the event may cause or has caused a delay in submitting through CEDRI.
(iii) You must provide to the Administrator:
(A) A written description of the force majeure event;
(B) A rationale for attributing the delay in reporting beyond the regulatory deadline to the force majeure event;
(C) Measures taken or to be taken to minimize the delay in reporting; and
(D) The date by which you propose to submit the notification or report, or if you have already met the electronic submittal requirement in this paragraph (k) at the time of the notification, the date you submitted the notification or report.
(iv) The decision to accept the claim of force majeure and allow an extension to the submittal deadline is solely within the discretion of the Administrator.
(v) In any circumstance, the reporting must occur as soon as possible after the force majeure event occurs.
(3) If you wish to assert a CBI claim for some of the information submitted under paragraph (k) of this section, you must submit a complete file, including information claimed to be CBI, to the EPA following the procedures in paragraphs (k)(3)(i) through (iv) of this section. Where a subpart specifies a specific file format for the report or notification for which you are asserting a claim of CBI, the complete file that you submit under this paragraph (k)(3) must be in the same file format specified in the subpart.
(i) Clearly mark the part or all of the information that you claim to be CBI. Information not marked as CBI may be authorized for public release without prior notice. Information marked as CBI will not be disclosed except in accordance with procedures set forth in 40 CFR part 2. All CBI claims must be asserted at the time of submission. Anything submitted using CEDRI cannot later be claimed CBI. Furthermore, under CAA section 114(c), emissions data are not entitled to confidential treatment, and the EPA is required to make emissions data available to the public. Thus, emissions data will not be protected as CBI and will be made publicly available.
(ii) You must submit the same file submitted to the CBI office with the CBI omitted to the EPA via the EPA's CDX as described in paragraph (k) of this section.
(iii) The preferred method to receive CBI is for it to be transmitted electronically using email attachments, File Transfer Protocol, or other online file sharing services. Electronic submissions must be transmitted directly to the OAQPS CBI Office at the email address
oaqpscbi@epa.gov,
and as described above, should include clear CBI markings. Electronic Reporting Tool (ERT) files should be flagged to the attention of the Group Leader, Measurement Policy Group; all other files should be flagged to the attention of the Sector Lead for the subpart for which you are submitting your notification or report. If assistance is needed with submitting large electronic files that exceed the file size limit for email attachments, and if you do not have your own file sharing service, please email
oaqpscbi@epa.gov
to request a file transfer link.
(iv) If you cannot transmit the file electronically, you may send CBI information through the postal service to the following address: U.S. EPA, Attn: OAQPS Document Control Officer, Mail Drop: C404-02, 109 T.W. Alexander Drive, P.O. Box 12055, RTP, NC 27711. ERT files should also be flagged to the attention of the Group Leader, Measurement Policy Group; all other files should also be flagged to the attention of the Sector Lead for the subpart for which you are submitting your notification or report. The mailed CBI material should be double wrapped and clearly marked. Any CBI markings should not show through the outer envelope.

§ 63.10
Recordkeeping and reporting requirements.
(a)
Applicability and general information.
(1) The applicability of this section is set out in § 63.1(a)(4).
(2) For affected sources that have been granted an extension of compliance under subpart D of this part, the requirements of this section do not apply to those sources while they are operating under such compliance extensions.
(3) If any State requires a report that contains all the information required in a report listed in this section, an owner or operator may send the Administrator a copy of the report sent to the State to satisfy the requirements of this section for that report.
(4)(i) Before a State has been delegated the authority to implement and enforce recordkeeping and reporting requirements established under this part, the owner or operator of an affected source in such State subject to such requirements shall submit reports to the appropriate Regional Office of the EPA (to the attention of the Director of the Division indicated in the list of the EPA Regional Offices in § 63.13).
(ii) After a State has been delegated the authority to implement and enforce recordkeeping and reporting requirements established under this part, the owner or operator of an affected source in such State subject to such requirements shall submit reports to the delegated State authority (which may be the same as the permitting authority). In addition, if the delegated (permitting) authority is the State, the owner or operator shall send a copy of each report submitted to the State to the appropriate Regional Office of the EPA, as specified in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section. The Regional Office may waive this requirement for any reports at its discretion.
(5) If an owner or operator of an affected source in a State with delegated authority is required to submit periodic reports under this part to the State, and if the State has an established timeline for the submission of periodic reports that is consistent with the reporting frequency(ies) specified for such source under this part, the owner or operator may change the dates by which periodic reports under this part shall be submitted (without changing the frequency of reporting) to be consistent with the State's schedule by mutual agreement between the owner or operator and the State. For each relevant standard established pursuant to section 112 of the Act, the allowance in the previous sentence applies in each State beginning 1 year after the affected source's compliance date for that standard. Procedures governing the implementation of this provision are specified in § 63.9(i).
(6) If an owner or operator supervises one or more stationary sources affected by more than one standard established pursuant to section 112 of the Act, he/she may arrange by mutual agreement between the owner or operator and the Administrator (or the State permitting authority) a common schedule on which periodic reports required for each source shall be submitted throughout the year. The allowance in the previous sentence applies in each State beginning 1 year after the latest compliance date for any relevant standard established pursuant to section 112 of the Act for any such affected source(s). Procedures governing the implementation of this provision are specified in § 63.9(i).
(7) If an owner or operator supervises one or more stationary sources affected by standards established pursuant to section 112 of the Act (as amended November 15, 1990) and standards set under part 60, part 61, or both such parts of this chapter, he/she may arrange by mutual agreement between the owner or operator and the Administrator (or the State permitting authority) a common schedule on which periodic reports required by each relevant (i.e., applicable) standard shall be submitted throughout the year. The allowance in the previous sentence applies in each State beginning 1 year after the stationary source is required to be in compliance with the relevant section 112 standard, or 1 year after the stationary source is required to be in compliance with the applicable part 60 or part 61 standard, whichever is latest. Procedures governing the implementation of this provision are specified in § 63.9(i).
(b)
General recordkeeping requirements.
(1) The owner or operator of an affected source subject to the provisions of this part shall maintain files of all information (including all reports and notifications) required by this part recorded in a form suitable and readily available for expeditious inspection and review. The files shall be retained for at least 5 years following the date of each occurrence, measurement, maintenance, corrective action, report, or record. At a minimum, the most recent 2 years of data shall be retained on site. The remaining 3 years of data may be retained off site. Such files may be maintained on microfilm, on a computer, on computer floppy disks, on magnetic tape disks, or on microfiche.
(2) The owner or operator of an affected source subject to the provisions of this part shall maintain relevant records for such source of—
(i) The occurrence and duration of each startup or shutdown when the startup or shutdown causes the source to exceed any applicable emission limitation in the relevant emission standards;
(ii) The occurrence and duration of each malfunction of operation (i.e., process equipment) or the required air
pollution control and monitoring equipment;
(iii) All required maintenance performed on the air pollution control and monitoring equipment;
(iv)(A) Actions taken during periods of startup or shutdown when the source exceeded applicable emission limitations in a relevant standard and when the actions taken are different from the procedures specified in the affected source's startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan (see § 63.6(e)(3)); or
(B) Actions taken during periods of malfunction (including corrective actions to restore malfunctioning process and air pollution control and monitoring equipment to its normal or usual manner of operation) when the actions taken are different from the procedures specified in the affected source's startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan (see § 63.6(e)(3));
(v) All information necessary, including actions taken, to demonstrate conformance with the affected source's startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan (see § 63.6(e)(3)) when all actions taken during periods of startup or shutdown (and the startup or shutdown causes the source to exceed any applicable emission limitation in the relevant emission standards), and malfunction (including corrective actions to restore malfunctioning process and air pollution control and monitoring equipment to its normal or usual manner of operation) are consistent with the procedures specified in such plan. (The information needed to demonstrate conformance with the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan may be recorded using a “checklist,” or some other effective form of recordkeeping, in order to minimize the recordkeeping burden for conforming events);
(vi) Each period during which a CMS is malfunctioning or inoperative (including out-of-control periods);
(vii) All required measurements needed to demonstrate compliance with a relevant standard (including, but not limited to, 15-minute averages of CMS data, raw performance testing measurements, and raw performance evaluation measurements, that support data that the source is required to report);
(A) This paragraph applies to owners or operators required to install a continuous emissions monitoring system (CEMS) where the CEMS installed is automated, and where the calculated data averages do not exclude periods of CEMS breakdown or malfunction. An automated CEMS records and reduces the measured data to the form of the pollutant emission standard through the use of a computerized data acquisition system. In lieu of maintaining a file of all CEMS subhourly measurements as required under paragraph (b)(2)(vii) of this section, the owner or operator shall retain the most recent consecutive three averaging periods of subhourly measurements and a file that contains a hard copy of the data acquisition system algorithm used to reduce the measured data into the reportable form of the standard.
(B) This paragraph applies to owners or operators required to install a CEMS where the measured data is manually reduced to obtain the reportable form of the standard, and where the calculated data averages do not exclude periods of CEMS breakdown or malfunction. In lieu of maintaining a file of all CEMS subhourly measurements as required under paragraph (b)(2)(vii) of this section, the owner or operator shall retain all subhourly measurements for the most recent reporting period. The subhourly measurements shall be retained for 120 days from the date of the most recent summary or excess emission report submitted to the Administrator.
(C) The Administrator or delegated authority, upon notification to the source, may require the owner or operator to maintain all measurements as required by paragraph (b)(2)(vii), if the administrator or the delegated authority determines these records are required to more accurately assess the compliance status of the affected source.
(viii) All results of performance tests, CMS performance evaluations, and opacity and visible emission observations;
(ix) All measurements as may be necessary to determine the conditions of performance tests and performance evaluations;
(x) All CMS calibration checks;
(xi) All adjustments and maintenance performed on CMS;
(xii) Any information demonstrating whether a source is meeting the requirements for a waiver of recordkeeping or reporting requirements under this part, if the source has been granted a waiver under paragraph (f) of this section;
(xiii) All emission levels relative to the criterion for obtaining permission to use an alternative to the relative accuracy test, if the source has been granted such permission under § 63.8(f)(6); and
(xiv) All documentation supporting initial notifications and notifications of compliance status under § 63.9.
(3) If an owner or operator determines that his or her existing or new stationary source is in the source category regulated by a standard established pursuant to section 112 of the Act, but that source is not subject to the relevant standard (or other requirement established under this part) because of enforceable limitations on the source's potential to emit, or the source otherwise qualifies for an exclusion, the owner or operator must keep a record of the applicability determination. The applicability determination must be kept on site at the source for a period of 5 years after the determination, or until the source changes its operations to become an affected source subject to the relevant standard (or other requirement established under this part), whichever comes first if the determination is made prior to January 19, 2021. The applicability determination must be kept until the source changes its operations to become an affected source subject to the relevant standard (or other requirement established under this part) if the determination was made on or after January 19, 2021. The record of the applicability determination must be signed by the person making the determination and include an emissions analysis (or other information) that demonstrates the owner or operator's conclusion that the source is unaffected (
e.g.,
because the source is an area source). The analysis (or other information) must be sufficiently detailed to allow the Administrator to make an applicability finding for the source with regard to the relevant standard or other requirement. If applicable, the analysis must be performed in accordance with requirements established in relevant subparts of this part for this purpose for particular categories of stationary sources. If relevant, the analysis should be performed in accordance with EPA guidance materials published to assist sources in making applicability determinations under section 112 of the Act, if any. The requirements to determine applicability of a standard under § 63.1(b)(3) and to record the results of that determination under this paragraph (b)(3) of this section shall not by themselves create an obligation for the owner or operator to obtain a title V permit.
(c)
Additional recordkeeping requirements for sources with continuous monitoring systems.
In addition to complying with the requirements specified in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section, the owner or operator of an affected source required to install a CMS by a relevant standard shall maintain records for such source of—
(1) All required CMS measurements (including monitoring data recorded during unavoidable CMS breakdowns and out-of-control periods);
(2)-(4) [Reserved]
(5) The date and time identifying each period during which the CMS was inoperative except for zero (low-level) and high-level checks;
(6) The date and time identifying each period during which the CMS was out of control, as defined in § 63.8(c)(7);
(7) The specific identification (i.e., the date and time of commencement and completion) of each period of excess emissions and parameter monitoring exceedances, as defined in the relevant standard(s), that occurs during startups, shutdowns, and malfunctions of the affected source;
(8) The specific identification (i.e., the date and time of commencement and completion) of each time period of excess emissions and parameter monitoring exceedances, as defined in the relevant standard(s), that occurs during periods other than startups, shutdowns, and malfunctions of the affected source;
(9) [Reserved]
(10) The nature and cause of any malfunction (if known);
(11) The corrective action taken or preventive measures adopted;
(12) The nature of the repairs or adjustments to the CMS that was inoperative or out of control;
(13) The total process operating time during the reporting period; and
(14) All procedures that are part of a quality control program developed and implemented for CMS under § 63.8(d).
(15) In order to satisfy the requirements of paragraphs (c)(10) through (c)(12) of this section and to avoid duplicative recordkeeping efforts, the owner or operator may use the affected source's startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan or records kept to satisfy the recordkeeping requirements of the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan specified in § 63.6(e), provided that such plan and records adequately address the requirements of paragraphs (c)(10) through (c)(12).
(d)
General reporting requirements.
(1) Notwithstanding the requirements in this paragraph or paragraph (e) of this section, and except as provided in § 63.16, the owner or operator of an affected source subject to reporting requirements under this part shall submit reports to the Administrator in accordance with the reporting requirements in the relevant standard(s).
(2)
Reporting results of performance tests.
Before a title V permit has been issued to the owner or operator of an affected source, the owner or operator shall report the results of any performance test under § 63.7 to the Administrator. After a title V permit has been issued to the owner or operator of an affected source, the owner or operator shall report the results of a required performance test to the appropriate permitting authority. The owner or operator of an affected source shall report the results of the performance test to the Administrator (or the State with an approved permit program) before the close of business on the 60th day following the completion of the performance test, unless specified otherwise in a relevant standard or as approved otherwise in writing by the Administrator. The results of the performance test shall be submitted as part of the notification of compliance status required under § 63.9(h).
(3)
Reporting results of opacity or visible emission observations.
The owner or operator of an affected source required to conduct opacity or visible emission observations by a relevant standard shall report the opacity or visible emission results (produced using Test Method 9 or Test Method 22, or an alternative to these test methods) along with the results of the performance test required under § 63.7. If no performance test is required, or if visibility or other conditions prevent the opacity or visible emission observations from being conducted concurrently with the performance test required under § 63.7, the owner or operator shall report the opacity or visible emission results before the close of business on the 30th day following the completion of the opacity or visible emission observations.
(4)
Progress reports.
The owner or operator of an affected source who is required to submit progress reports as a condition of receiving an extension of compliance under § 63.6(i) shall submit such reports to the Administrator (or the State with an approved permit program) by the dates specified in the written extension of compliance.
(5)(i)
Periodic startup, shutdown, and malfunction reports.
If actions taken by an owner or operator during a startup or shutdown (and the startup or shutdown causes the source to exceed any applicable emission limitation in the relevant emission standards), or malfunction of an affected source (including actions taken to correct a malfunction) are consistent with the procedures specified in the source's startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan (see § 63.6(e)(3)), the owner or operator shall state such information in a startup, shutdown, and malfunction report. Actions taken to minimize emissions during such startups, shutdowns, and malfunctions shall be summarized in the report and may be done in checklist form; if actions taken are the same for each event, only one checklist is necessary. Such a report shall also include the number, duration, and a brief description for each type of malfunction which occurred during the reporting period and which caused or may have
caused any applicable emission limitation to be exceeded. Reports shall only be required if a startup or shutdown caused the source to exceed any applicable emission limitation in the relevant emission standards, or if a malfunction occurred during the reporting period. The startup, shutdown, and malfunction report shall consist of a letter, containing the name, title, and signature of the owner or operator or other responsible official who is certifying its accuracy, that shall be submitted to the Administrator semiannually (or on a more frequent basis if specified otherwise in a relevant standard or as established otherwise by the permitting authority in the source's title V permit). The startup, shutdown, and malfunction report shall be delivered or postmarked by the 30th day following the end of each calendar half (or other calendar reporting period, as appropriate). If the owner or operator is required to submit excess emissions and continuous monitoring system performance (or other periodic) reports under this part, the startup, shutdown, and malfunction reports required under this paragraph may be submitted simultaneously with the excess emissions and continuous monitoring system performance (or other) reports. If startup, shutdown, and malfunction reports are submitted with excess emissions and continuous monitoring system performance (or other periodic) reports, and the owner or operator receives approval to reduce the frequency of reporting for the latter under paragraph (e) of this section, the frequency of reporting for the startup, shutdown, and malfunction reports also may be reduced if the Administrator does not object to the intended change. The procedures to implement the allowance in the preceding sentence shall be the same as the procedures specified in paragraph (e)(3) of this section.
(ii)
Immediate startup, shutdown, and malfunction reports.
Notwithstanding the allowance to reduce the frequency of reporting for periodic startup, shutdown, and malfunction reports under paragraph (d)(5)(i) of this section, any time an action taken by an owner or operator during a startup or shutdown that caused the source to exceed any applicable emission limitation in the relevant emission standards, or malfunction (including actions taken to correct a malfunction) is not consistent with the procedures specified in the affected source's startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan, the owner or operator shall report the actions taken for that event within 2 working days after commencing actions inconsistent with the plan followed by a letter within 7 working days after the end of the event. The immediate report required under this paragraph (d)(5)(ii) shall consist of a telephone call (or facsimile (FAX) transmission) to the Administrator within 2 working days after commencing actions inconsistent with the plan, and it shall be followed by a letter, delivered or postmarked within 7 working days after the end of the event, that contains the name, title, and signature of the owner or operator or other responsible official who is certifying its accuracy, explaining the circumstances of the event, the reasons for not following the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan, describing all excess emissions and/or parameter monitoring exceedances which are believed to have occurred (or could have occurred in the case of malfunctions), and actions taken to minimize emissions in conformance with § 63.6(e)(1)(i). Notwithstanding the requirements of the previous sentence, after the effective date of an approved permit program in the State in which an affected source is located, the owner or operator may make alternative reporting arrangements, in advance, with the permitting authority in that State. Procedures governing the arrangement of alternative reporting requirements under this paragraph (d)(5)(ii) are specified in § 63.9(i).
(e)
Additional reporting requirements for sources with continuous monitoring systems
—(1)
General.
When more than one CEMS is used to measure the emissions from one affected source (e.g., multiple breechings, multiple outlets), the owner or operator shall report the results as required for each CEMS.
(2)
Reporting results of continuous monitoring system performance evaluations.
(i) The owner or operator of an affected source required to install a CMS by a relevant standard shall furnish the Administrator a copy of a written report
of the results of the CMS performance evaluation, as required under § 63.8(e), simultaneously with the results of the performance test required under § 63.7, unless otherwise specified in the relevant standard.
(ii) The owner or operator of an affected source using a COMS to determine opacity compliance during any performance test required under § 63.7 and described in § 63.6(d)(6) shall furnish the Administrator two or, upon request, three copies of a written report of the results of the COMS performance evaluation conducted under § 63.8(e). The copies shall be furnished at least 15 calendar days before the performance test required under § 63.7 is conducted.
(3)
Excess emissions and continuous monitoring system performance report and summary report.
(i) Excess emissions and parameter monitoring exceedances are defined in relevant standards. The owner or operator of an affected source required to install a CMS by a relevant standard shall submit an excess emissions and continuous monitoring system performance report and/or a summary report to the Administrator semiannually, except when—
(A) More frequent reporting is specifically required by a relevant standard;
(B) The Administrator determines on a case-by-case basis that more frequent reporting is necessary to accurately assess the compliance status of the source; or
(C) [Reserved]
(D) The affected source is complying with the Performance Track Provisions of § 63.16, which allows less frequent reporting.
(ii)
Request to reduce frequency of excess emissions and continuous monitoring system performance reports.
Notwithstanding the frequency of reporting requirements specified in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section, an owner or operator who is required by a relevant standard to submit excess emissions and continuous monitoring system performance (and summary) reports on a quarterly (or more frequent) basis may reduce the frequency of reporting for that standard to semiannual if the following conditions are met:
(A) For 1 full year (e.g., 4 quarterly or 12 monthly reporting periods) the affected source's excess emissions and continuous monitoring system performance reports continually demonstrate that the source is in compliance with the relevant standard;
(B) The owner or operator continues to comply with all recordkeeping and monitoring requirements specified in this subpart and the relevant standard; and
(C) The Administrator does not object to a reduced frequency of reporting for the affected source, as provided in paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section.
(iii) The frequency of reporting of excess emissions and continuous monitoring system performance (and summary) reports required to comply with a relevant standard may be reduced only after the owner or operator notifies the Administrator in writing of his or her intention to make such a change and the Administrator does not object to the intended change. In deciding whether to approve a reduced frequency of reporting, the Administrator may review information concerning the source's entire previous performance history during the 5-year recordkeeping period prior to the intended change, including performance test results, monitoring data, and evaluations of an owner or operator's conformance with operation and maintenance requirements. Such information may be used by the Administrator to make a judgment about the source's potential for noncompliance in the future. If the Administrator disapproves the owner or operator's request to reduce the frequency of reporting, the Administrator will notify the owner or operator in writing within 45 days after receiving notice of the owner or operator's intention. The notification from the Administrator to the owner or operator will specify the grounds on which the disapproval is based. In the absence of a notice of disapproval within 45 days, approval is automatically granted.
(iv) As soon as CMS data indicate that the source is not in compliance with any emission limitation or operating parameter specified in the relevant standard, the frequency of reporting shall revert to the frequency specified in the relevant standard, and the owner or operator shall submit an
excess emissions and continuous monitoring system performance (and summary) report for the noncomplying emission points at the next appropriate reporting period following the noncomplying event. After demonstrating ongoing compliance with the relevant standard for another full year, the owner or operator may again request approval from the Administrator to reduce the frequency of reporting for that standard, as provided for in paragraphs (e)(3)(ii) and (e)(3)(iii) of this section.
(v)
Content and submittal dates for excess emissions and monitoring system performance reports.
All excess emissions and monitoring system performance reports and all summary reports, if required, shall be delivered or postmarked by the 30th day following the end of each calendar half or quarter, as appropriate. Written reports of excess emissions or exceedances of process or control system parameters shall include all the information required in paragraphs (c)(5) through (c)(13) of this section, in §§ 63.8(c)(7) and 63.8(c)(8), and in the relevant standard, and they shall contain the name, title, and signature of the responsible official who is certifying the accuracy of the report. When no excess emissions or exceedances of a parameter have occurred, or a CMS has not been inoperative, out of control, repaired, or adjusted, such information shall be stated in the report.
(vi)
Summary report.
As required under paragraphs (e)(3)(vii) and (e)(3)(viii) of this section, one summary report shall be submitted for the hazardous air pollutants monitored at each affected source (unless the relevant standard specifies that more than one summary report is required, e.g., one summary report for each hazardous air pollutant monitored). The summary report shall be entitled “Summary Report—Gaseous and Opacity Excess Emission and Continuous Monitoring System Performance” and shall contain the following information:
(A) The company name and address of the affected source;
(B) An identification of each hazardous air pollutant monitored at the affected source;
(C) The beginning and ending dates of the reporting period;
(D) A brief description of the process units;

(F) The monitoring equipment manufacturer(s) and model number(s);
(G) The date of the latest CMS certification or audit;
(H) The total operating time of the affected source during the reporting period;
(I) An emission data summary (or similar summary if the owner or operator monitors control system parameters), including the total duration of excess emissions during the reporting period (recorded in minutes for opacity and hours for gases), the total duration of excess emissions expressed as a percent of the total source operating time during that reporting period, and a breakdown of the total duration of excess emissions during the reporting period into those that are due to startup/shutdown, control equipment problems, process problems, other known causes, and other unknown causes;
(J) A CMS performance summary (or similar summary if the owner or operator monitors control system parameters), including the total CMS downtime during the reporting period (recorded in minutes for opacity and hours for gases), the total duration of CMS downtime expressed as a percent of the total source operating time during that reporting period, and a breakdown of the total CMS downtime during the reporting period into periods that are due to monitoring equipment malfunctions, nonmonitoring equipment malfunctions, quality assurance/quality control calibrations, other known causes, and other unknown causes;
(K) A description of any changes in CMS, processes, or controls since the last reporting period;
(L) The name, title, and signature of the responsible official who is certifying the accuracy of the report; and
(M) The date of the report.
(vii) If the total duration of excess emissions or process or control system parameter exceedances for the reporting period is less than 1 percent of the
total operating time for the reporting period, and CMS downtime for the reporting period is less than 5 percent of the total operating time for the reporting period, only the summary report shall be submitted, and the full excess emissions and continuous monitoring system performance report need not be submitted unless required by the Administrator.
(viii) If the total duration of excess emissions or process or control system parameter exceedances for the reporting period is 1 percent or greater of the total operating time for the reporting period, or the total CMS downtime for the reporting period is 5 percent or greater of the total operating time for the reporting period, both the summary report and the excess emissions and continuous monitoring system performance report shall be submitted.
(4)
Reporting continuous opacity monitoring system data produced during a performance test.
The owner or operator of an affected source required to use a COMS shall record the monitoring data produced during a performance test required under § 63.7 and shall furnish the Administrator a written report of the monitoring results. The report of COMS data shall be submitted simultaneously with the report of the performance test results required in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
(f)
Waiver of recordkeeping or reporting requirements.
(1) Until a waiver of a recordkeeping or reporting requirement has been granted by the Administrator under this paragraph, the owner or operator of an affected source remains subject to the requirements of this section.
(2) Recordkeeping or reporting requirements may be waived upon written application to the Administrator if, in the Administrator's judgment, the affected source is achieving the relevant standard(s), or the source is operating under an extension of compliance, or the owner or operator has requested an extension of compliance and the Administrator is still considering that request.
(3) If an application for a waiver of recordkeeping or reporting is made, the application shall accompany the request for an extension of compliance under § 63.6(i), any required compliance progress report or compliance status report required under this part (such as under §§ 63.6(i) and 63.9(h)) or in the source's title V permit, or an excess emissions and continuous monitoring system performance report required under paragraph (e) of this section, whichever is applicable. The application shall include whatever information the owner or operator considers useful to convince the Administrator that a waiver of recordkeeping or reporting is warranted.
(4) The Administrator will approve or deny a request for a waiver of recordkeeping or reporting requirements under this paragraph when he/she—
(i) Approves or denies an extension of compliance; or
(ii) Makes a determination of compliance following the submission of a required compliance status report or excess emissions and continuous monitoring systems performance report; or
(iii) Makes a determination of suitable progress towards compliance following the submission of a compliance progress report, whichever is applicable.
(5) A waiver of any recordkeeping or reporting requirement granted under this paragraph may be conditioned on other recordkeeping or reporting requirements deemed necessary by the Administrator.
(6) Approval of any waiver granted under this section shall not abrogate the Administrator's authority under the Act or in any way prohibit the Administrator from later canceling the waiver. The cancellation will be made only after notice is given to the owner or operator of the affected source.

(c)
Alternative work practice for monitoring equipment for leaks.
Paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section apply to all equipment for which the applicable subpart requires monitoring with a 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7, Method 21 monitor, except for closed vent systems, equipment designated as leakless, and equipment identified in the applicable subpart as having no detectable emissions, as indicated by an instrument reading of less than 500 ppm above background. An owner or operator may use an optical gas imaging instrument instead of a 40 CFR part 60, sppendix A-7, Method 21 monitor. Requirements in the existing subparts that are specific to the Method 21 instrument do not apply under this section. All other requirements in the applicable subpart that are not addressed in paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section continue to apply. For example, equipment specification requirements, and non-Method 21 instrument recordkeeping and reporting requirements in the applicable subpart continue to apply. The terms defined in paragraphs (c)(1) through (5) of this section have meanings that are specific to the alternative work practice standard in paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section.
(1)
Applicable subpart
means the subpart in 40 CFR parts 60, 61, 63, and 65 that requires monitoring of equipment with a 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7, Method 21 monitor.
(2)
Equipment
means pumps, valves, pressure relief valves, compressors, open-ended lines, flanges, connectors, and other equipment covered by the applicable subpart that require monitoring with a 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7, Method 21 monitor.
(3)
Imaging
means making visible emissions that may otherwise be invisible to the naked eye.
(4)
Optical gas imaging instrument
means an instrument that makes visible emissions that may otherwise be invisible to the naked eye.
(5)
Repair
means that equipment is adjusted, or otherwise altered, in order to eliminate a leak.
(6)
Leak
means:
(i) Any emissions imaged by the optical gas instrument;
(ii) Indications of liquids dripping;
(iii) Indications by a sensor that a seal or barrier fluid system has failed; or
(iv) Screening results using a 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7, Method 21 monitor that exceed the leak definition in the applicable subpart to which the equipment is subject.
(d) The alternative work practice standard for monitoring equipment for leaks is available to all subparts in 40 CFR parts 60, 61, 63, and 65 that require monitoring of equipment with a 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7, Method 21 monitor.
(1) An owner or operator of an affected source subject to 40 CFR parts 60, 61, 63, or 65 can choose to comply with the alternative work practice requirements in paragraph (e) of this section instead of using the 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7, Method 21 monitor to identify leaking equipment. The owner or operator must document the equipment, process units, and facilities for which the alternative work practice will be used to identify leaks.
(2) Any leak detected when following the leak survey procedure in paragraph (e)(3) of this section must be identified for repair as required in the applicable subpart.
(3) If the alternative work practice is used to identify leaks, re-screening after an attempted repair of leaking equipment must be conducted using either the alternative work practice or the 40 CFR part 60, Appendix A-7, Method 21 monitor at the leak definition required in the applicable subparts to which the equipment is subject.
(4) The schedule for repair is as required in the applicable subpart.
(5) When this alternative work practice is used for detecting leaking equipment, choose one of the monitoring frequencies listed in Table 1 to subpart A of this part in lieu of the monitoring frequency specified for regulated equipment in the applicable subpart. Reduced monitoring frequencies for good performance are not applicable when using the alternative work practice.
(6) When this alternative work practice is used for detecting leaking equipment, the following are not applicable for the equipment being monitored:
(i) Skip period leak detection and repair;
(ii) Quality improvement plans; or
(iii) Complying with standards for allowable percentage of valves and pumps to leak.
(7) When the alternative work practice is used to detect leaking equipment, the regulated equipment in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section must also be monitored annually using a 40 CFR part 60, Appendix A-7, Method 21 monitor at the leak definition required in the applicable subpart. The owner or operator may choose the specific monitoring period (for example, first quarter) to conduct the annual monitoring. Subsequent monitoring must be conducted every 12 months from the initial period. Owners or operators must keep records of the annual Method 21 screening results, as specified in paragraph (i)(4)(vii) of this section.
(e) An owner or operator of an affected source who chooses to use the alternative work practice must comply with the requirements of paragraphs (e)(1) through (e)(5) of this section.
(1)
Instrument specifications.
The optical gas imaging instrument must comply with the requirements specified in paragraphs (e)(1)(i) and (e)(1)(ii) of this section.
(i) Provide the operator with an image of the potential leak points for each piece of equipment at both the detection sensitivity level and within the distance used in the daily instrument check described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section. The detection sensitivity level depends upon the frequency at which leak monitoring is to be performed.
(ii) Provide a date and time stamp for video records of every monitoring event.
(2)
Daily instrument check.
On a daily basis, and prior to beginning any leak monitoring work, test the optical gas imaging instrument at the mass flow rate determined in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section in accordance with the procedure specified in paragraphs (e)(2)(ii) through (e)(2)(iv) of this section for each camera configuration used during monitoring (for example,
different lenses used), unless an alternative method to demonstrate daily instrument checks has been approved in accordance with paragraph (e)(2)(v) of this section.
(i) Calculate the mass flow rate to be used in the daily instrument check by following the procedures in paragraphs (e)(2)(i)(A) and (e)(2)(i)(B) of this section.
(A) For a specified population of equipment to be imaged by the instrument, determine the piece of equipment in contact with the lowest mass fraction of chemicals that are detectable, within the distance to be used in paragraph (e)(2)(iv)(B) of this section, at or below the standard detection sensitivity level.
(B) Multiply the standard detection sensitivity level, corresponding to the selected monitoring frequency in Table 1 of subpart A of this part, by the mass fraction of detectable chemicals from the stream identified in paragraph (e)(2)(i)(A) of this section to determine the mass flow rate to be used in the daily instrument check, using the following equation.

(iv) The technical basis for the mass fraction of detectable chemicals used in the equation in paragraph (e)(2)(i)(B) of this section.
(v) The daily instrument check. Record the distance, per paragraph (e)(2)(iv)(B) of this section, and the flow meter reading, per paragraph (e)(2)(iv)(C) of this section, at which the leak was imaged. Keep a video record of the daily instrument check for each configuration of the optical gas imaging instrument used during the leak survey (for example, the daily instrument check must be conducted for each lens used). The video record must include a time and date stamp for each daily instrument check. The video record must be kept for 5 years.
(vi)
Recordkeeping requirements in the applicable subpart.
A video record must be used to document the leak survey results. The video record must include a time and date stamp for each monitoring event. A video record can be used to meet the recordkeeping requirements of the applicable subparts if each piece of regulated equipment selected for this work practice can be identified in the video record. The video record must be kept for 5 years.
(vii) The results of the annual Method 21 screening required in paragraph (h)(7) of this section. Records must be kept for all regulated equipment specified in paragraph (h)(1) of this section.

§ 63.12
State authority and delegations.
(a) The provisions of this part shall not be construed in any manner to preclude any State or political subdivision thereof from—
(1) Adopting and enforcing any standard, limitation, prohibition, or other regulation applicable to an affected source subject to the requirements of this part, provided that such standard, limitation, prohibition, or regulation is not less stringent than any requirement applicable to such source established under this part;
(2) Requiring the owner or operator of an affected source to obtain permits, licenses, or approvals prior to initiating construction, reconstruction, modification, or operation of such source; or
(3) Requiring emission reductions in excess of those specified in subpart D of this part as a condition for granting the extension of compliance authorized by section 112(i)(5) of the Act.
(b)(1) Section 112(l) of the Act directs the Administrator to delegate to each State, when appropriate, the authority to implement and enforce standards and other requirements pursuant to section 112 for stationary sources located in that State. Because of the unique nature of radioactive material, delegation of authority to implement and enforce standards that control radionuclides may require separate approval.
(2) Subpart E of this part establishes procedures consistent with section 112(l) for the approval of State rules or programs to implement and enforce applicable Federal rules promulgated under the authority of section 112. Subpart E also establishes procedures for the review and withdrawal of section 112 implementation and enforcement authorities granted through a section 112(l) approval.
(c) All information required to be submitted to the EPA under this part also shall be submitted to the appropriate state agency of any state to which authority has been delegated under section 112(l) of the Act, provided that each specific delegation may exempt sources from a certain federal or state reporting requirement. Any information required to be submitted electronically by this part via the EPA's CEDRI may, at the discretion of the
delegated authority, satisfy the requirements of this paragraph. The Administrator may permit all or some of the information to be submitted to the appropriate state agency only, instead of to the EPA and the state agency with the exception of federal electronic reporting requirements under this part. Sources may not be exempted from federal electronic reporting requirements.

Performance Track Provisions.
(a) Notwithstanding any other requirements in this part, an affected source at any major source or any area source at a Performance Track member facility, which is subject to regular periodic reporting under any subpart of this part, may submit such periodic reports at an interval that is twice the length of the regular period specified in the applicable subparts; provided, that for sources subject to permits under 40 CFR part 70 or 71 no interval so calculated for any report of the results of any required monitoring may be less frequent than once in every six months.
(b) Notwithstanding any other requirements in this part, the modifications of reporting requirements in paragraph (c) of this section apply to any major source at a Performance Track member facility which is subject to requirements under any of the subparts of this part and which has:
(1) Reduced its total HAP emissions to less than 25 tons per year;
(2) Reduced its emissions of each individual HAP to less than 10 tons per year; and
(3) Reduced emissions of all HAPs covered by each MACT standard to at least the level required for full compliance with the applicable emission standard.
(c) For affected sources at any area source at a Performance Track member facility and which meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(3) of this section, or for affected sources at any major source that meet the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section:
(1) If the emission standard to which the affected source is subject is based on add-on control technology, and the affected source complies by using add-on control technology, then all required reporting elements in the periodic report may be met through an annual certification that the affected source is meeting the emission standard by continuing to use that control technology. The affected source must continue to meet all relevant monitoring and recordkeeping requirements. The compliance certification must meet the requirements delineated in Clean Air Act section 114(a)(3).
(2) If the emission standard to which the affected source is subject is based on add-on control technology, and the
affected source complies by using pollution prevention, then all required reporting elements in the periodic report may be met through an annual certification that the affected source is continuing to use pollution prevention to reduce HAP emissions to levels at or below those required by the applicable emission standard. The affected source must maintain records of all calculations that demonstrate the level of HAP emissions required by the emission standard as well as the level of HAP emissions achieved by the affected source. The affected source must continue to meet all relevant monitoring and recordkeeping requirements. The compliance certification must meet the requirements delineated in Clean Air Act section 114(a)(3).
(3) If the emission standard to which the affected source is subject is based on pollution prevention, and the affected source complies by using pollution prevention and reduces emissions by an additional 50 percent or greater than required by the applicable emission standard, then all required reporting elements in the periodic report may be met through an annual certification that the affected source is continuing to use pollution prevention to reduce HAP emissions by an additional 50 percent or greater than required by the applicable emission standard. The affected source must maintain records of all calculations that demonstrate the level of HAP emissions required by the emission standard as well as the level of HAP emissions achieved by the affected source. The affected source must continue to meet all relevant monitoring and recordkeeping requirements. The compliance certification must meet the requirements delineated in Clean Air Act section 114(a)(3).
(4) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (c)(1) through (3), of this section, for sources subject to permits under 40 CFR part 70 or 71, the results of any required monitoring and recordkeeping must be reported not less frequently than once in every six months.

[61 FR 68399, Dec. 27, 1996]
§ 63.42
Program requirements governing construction or reconstruction of major sources.
(a)
Adoption of program.
Each permitting authority shall review its existing programs, procedures, and criteria for preconstruction review for conformity to the requirements established by §§ 63.40 through 63.44, shall make any additions and revisions to its existing programs, procedures, and criteria that the permitting authority deems necessary to properly effectuate §§ 63.40 through 63.44, and shall adopt a program to implement section 112(g) with respect to construction or reconstruction of major sources of HAP. As part of the adoption by the permitting authority of a program to implement section 112(g) with respect to construction or reconstruction of major sources of HAP, the chief executive officer of the permitting authority shall certify that the program satisfies all applicable requirements established by §§ 63.40 through 63.44, and shall specify an effective date for that program which is not later than June 29, 1998. Prior to the specified effective date, the permitting authority shall publish a notice stating that the permitting authority has adopted a program to implement section 112(g) with respect to construction or reconstruction of major sources of HAP and stating the effective date, and shall provide a written description of the program to the Administrator through the appropriate EPA Regional Office. Nothing in this section shall be construed either:
(1) To require that any owner or operator of a stationary source comply with any requirement adopted by the permitting authority which is not intended to implement section 112(g) with respect to construction or reconstruction of major sources of HAP; or
(2) To preclude the permitting authority from enforcing any requirements not intended to implement section 112(g) with respect to construction or reconstruction of major sources of HAP under any other provision of applicable law.
(b)
Failure to adopt program.
In the event that the permitting authority fails to adopt a program to implement section 112(g) with respect to construction or reconstruction of major sources of HAP with an effective date on or before June 29, 1998, and the permitting authority concludes that it is able to make case-by-case MACT determinations which conform to the provisions of § 63.43 in the absence of such a program, the permitting authority may elect to make such determinations. However, in those instances where the permitting authority elects to make case-by-case MACT determinations in the absence of a program to implement
section 112(g) with respect to construction or reconstruction of major sources of HAP, no such case-by-case MACT determination shall take effect until after it has been submitted by the permitting authority in writing to the appropriate EPA Regional Adminstrator and the EPA Regional Administrator has concurred in writing that the case-by-case MACT determination by the permitting authority is in conformity with all requirements established by §§ 63.40 through 63.44. In the event that the permitting authority fails to adopt a program to implement section 112(g) with respect to construction or reconstruction of major sources of HAP with an effective date on or before June 29, 1998, and the permitting authority concludes that it is unable to make case-by-case MACT determinations in the absence of such a program, the permitting authority may request that the EPA Regional Administrator implement a transitional program to implement section 112(g) with respect to construction or reconstruction of major sources of HAP in the affected State of local jurisdiction while the permitting authority completes development and adoption of a section 112(g) program. Any such transitional section 112(g) program implemented by the EPA Regional Administrator shall conform to all requirements established by §§ 63.40 through 63.44, and shall remain in effect for no more than 30 months. Continued failure by the permitting authority to adopt a program to implement section 112(g) with respect to construction or reconstruction of major sources of HAP shall be construed as a failure by the permitting authority to adequately administer and enforce its title V permitting program and shall constitute cause by EPA to apply the sanctions and remedies set forth in the Clean Air Act section 502(I).
(c)
Prohibition.
After the effective date of section 112(g)(2)(B) (as defined in § 63.41) in a State or local jurisdiction and the effective date of the title V permit program applicable to that State or local jurisdiction, no person may begin actual construction or reconstruction of a major source of HAP in such State or local jurisdiction unless:
(1) The major source in question has been specifically regulated or exempted from regulation under a standard issued pursuant to section 112(d), section 112(h) or section 112(j) in part 63, and the owner and operator has fully complied with all procedures and requirements for preconstruction review established by that standard, including any applicable requirements set forth in subpart A of this part 63; or
(2) The permitting authority has made a final and effective case-by-case determination pursuant to the provisions of § 63.43 such that emissions from the constructed or reconstructed major source will be controlled to a level no less stringent than the maximum achievable control technology emission limitation for new sources.
[61 FR 68400, Dec. 27, 1996, as amended at 64 FR 35032, June 30, 1999]
§ 63.43
Maximum achievable control technology (MACT) determinations for constructed and reconstructed major sources.
(a)
Applicability.
The requirements of this section apply to an owner or operator who constructs or reconstructs a major source of HAP subject to a case-by-case determination of maximum achievable control technology pursuant to § 63.42(c).
(b)
Requirements for constructed and reconstructed major sources.
When a case-by-case determination of MACT is required by § 63.42(c), the owner and operator shall obtain from the permitting authority an approved MACT determination according to one of the review options contained in paragraph (c) of this section.
(c)
Review options.
(1) When the permitting authority requires the owner or operator to obtain, or revise, a permit issued pursuant to title V of the Act before construction or reconstruction of the major source, or when the permitting authority allows the owner or operator at its discretion to obtain or revise such a permit before construction or reconstruction, and the owner or operator elects that option, the owner or operator shall follow the administrative procedures in the program approved under title V of the Act
(or in other regulations issued pursuant to title V of the Act, where applicable).
(2) When an owner or operator is not required to obtain or revise a title V permit (or other permit issued pursuant to title V of the Act) before construction or reconstruction, the owner or operator (unless the owner or operator voluntarily follows the process to obtain a title V permit) shall either, at the discretion of the permitting authority:
(i) Apply for and obtain a Notice of MACT Approval according to the procedures outlined in paragraphs (f) through (h) of this section; or
(ii) Apply for a MACT determination under any other administrative procedures for preconstruction review and approval established by the permitting authority for a State or local jurisdiction which provide for public participation in the determination, and ensure that no person may begin actual construction or reconstruction of a major source in that State or local jurisdiction unless the permitting authority determines that the MACT emission limitation for new sources will be met.
(3) When applying for a permit pursuant to title V of the Act, an owner or operator may request approval of case-by-case MACT determinations for alternative operating scenarios. Approval of such determinations satisfies the requirements of section 112(g) of each such scenario.
(4) Regardless of the review process, the MACT emission limitation and requirements established shall be effective as required by paragraph (j) of this section, consistent with the principles established in paragraph (d) of this section, and supported by the information listed in paragraph (e) of this section. The owner or operator shall comply with the requirements in paragraphs (k) and (l) of this section, and with all applicable requirements in subpart A of this part.
(d)
Principles of MACT determinations.
The following general principles shall govern preparation by the owner or operator of each permit application or other application requiring a case-by-case MACT determination concerning construction or reconstruction of a major source, and all subsequent review of and actions taken concerning such an application by the permitting authority:
(1) The MACT emission limitation or MACT requirements recommended by the applicant and approved by the permitting authority shall not be less stringent than the emission control which is achieved in practice by the best controlled similar source, as determined by the permitting authority.
(2) Based upon available information, as defined in this subpart, the MACT emission limitation and control technology (including any requirements under paragraph (d)(3) of this section) recommended by the applicant and approved by the permitting authority shall achieve the maximum degree of reduction in emissions of HAP which can be achieved by utilizing those control technologies that can be identified from the available information, taking into consideration the costs of achieving such emission reduction and any non-air quality health and environmental impacts and energy requirements associated with the emission reduction.
(3) The applicant may recommend a specific design, equipment, work practice, or operational standard, or a combination thereof, and the permitting authority may approve such a standard if the permitting authority specifically determines that it is not feasible to prescribe or enforce an emission limitation under the criteria set forth in section 112(h)(2) of the Act.
(4) If the Administrator has either proposed a relevant emission standard pursuant to section 112(d) or section 112(h) of the Act or adopted a presumptive MACT determination for the source category which includes the constructed or reconstructed major source, then the MACT requirements applied to the constructed or reconstructed major source shall have considered those MACT emission limitations and requirements of the proposed standard or presumptive MACT determination.
(e)
Application requirements for a case-by-case MACT determination.
(1) An application for a MACT determination (whether a permit application under title V of the Act, an application for a Notice of MACT Approval, or other
document specified by the permitting authority under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section) shall specify a control technology selected by the owner or operator that, if properly operated and maintained, will meet the MACT emission limitation or standard as determined according to the principles set forth in paragraph (d) of this section.
(2) In each instance where a constructed or reconstructed major source would require additional control technology or a change in control technology, the application for a MACT determination shall contain the following information:
(i) The name and address (physical location) of the major source to be constructed or reconstructed;
(ii) A brief description of the major source to be constructed or reconstructed and identification of any listed source category or categories in which it is included;
(iii) The expected commencement date for the construction or reconstruction of the major source;
(iv) The expected completion date for construction or reconstruction of the major source;
(v) the anticipated date of start-up for the constructed or reconstructed major source;

(vii) Any federally enforceable emission limitations applicable to the constructed or reconstructed major source;
(viii) The maximum and expected utilization of capacity of the constructed or reconstructed major source, and the associated uncontrolled emission rates for that source, to the extent this information is needed by the permitting authority to determine MACT;
(ix) The controlled emissions for the constructed or reconstructed major source in tons/yr at expected and maximum utilization of capacity, to the extent this information is needed by the permitting authority to determine MACT;
(x) A recommended emission limitation for the constructed or reconstructed major source consistent with the principles set forth in paragraph (d) of this section;
(xi) The selected control technology to meet the recommended MACT emission limitation, including technical information on the design, operation, size, estimated control efficiency of the control technology (and the manufacturer's name, address, telephone number, and relevant specifications and drawings, if requested by the permitting authority);
(xii) Supporting documentation including identification of alternative control technologies considered by the applicant to meet the emission limitation, and analysis of cost and non-air quality health environmental impacts or energy requirements for the selected control technology; and
(xiii) Any other relevant information required pursuant to subpart A.
(3) In each instance where the owner or operator contends that a constructed or reconstructed major source will be in compliance, upon startup, with case-by-case MACT under this subpart without a change in control technology, the application for a MACT determination shall contain the following information:
(i) The information described in paragraphs (e)(2)(i) through (e)(2)(x) of this section; and
(ii) Documentation of the control technology in place.
(f)
Administrative procedures for review of the Notice of MACT Approval.
(1) The permitting authority will notify the owner or operator in writing, within 45 days from the date the application is first received, as to whether the application for a MACT determination is complete or whether additional information is required.
(2) The permitting authority will initially approve the recommended MACT emission limitation and other terms set forth in the application, or the permitting authority will notify the owner or operator in writing of its intent to disapprove the application, within 30 calendar days after the owner or operator is notified in writing that the application is complete.
(3) The owner or operator may present, in writing, within 60 calendar days after receipt of notice of the permitting authority's intent to disapprove the application, additional information or arguments pertaining to, or amendments to, the application for consideration by the permitting authority before it decides whether to finally disapprove the application.
(4) The permitting authority will either initially approve or issue a final disapproval of the application within 90 days after it notifies the owner or operator of an intent to disapprove or within 30 days after the date additional information is received from the owner or operator; whichever is earlier.
(5) A final determination by the permitting authority to disapprove any application will be in writing and will specify the grounds on which the disapproval is based. If any application is finally disapproved, the owner or operator may submit a subsequent application concerning construction or reconstruction of the same major source, provided that the subsequent application has been amended in response to the stated grounds for the prior disapproval.
(6) An initial decision to approve an application for a MACT determination will be set forth in the Notice of MACT Approval as described in paragraph (g) of this section.
(g)
Notice of MACT Approval.
(1) The Notice of MACT Approval will contain a MACT emission limitation (or a MACT work practice standard if the permitting authority determines it is not feasible to prescribe or enforce an emission standard) to control the emissions of HAP. The MACT emission limitation or standard will be determined by the permitting authority and will conform to the principles set forth in paragraph (d) of this section.
(2) The Notice of MACT Approval will specify any notification, operation and maintenance, performance testing, monitoring, reporting and record keeping requirements. The Notice of MACT Approval shall include:

[61 FR 68401, Dec. 27, 1996]
§ 63.44
Requirements for constructed or reconstructed major sources subject to a subsequently promulgated MACT standard or MACT requirement.
(a) If the Administrator promulgates an emission standard under section 112(d) or section 112(h) of the Act or the permitting authority issues a determination under section 112(j) of the Act that is applicable to a stationary source or group of sources which would
be deemed to be a constructed or reconstructed major source under this subpart before the date that the owner or operator has obtained a final and legally effective MACT determination under any of the review options available pursuant to § 63.43, the owner or operator of the source(s) shall comply with the promulgated standard or determination rather than any MACT determination under section 112(g) by the permitting authority, and the owner or operator shall comply with the promulgated standard by the compliance date in the promulgated standard.
(b) If the Administrator promulgates an emission standard under section 112(d) or section 112(h) of the Act or the permitting authority makes a determination under section 112(j) of the Act that is applicable to a stationary source or group of sources which was deemed to be a constructed or reconstructed major source under this subpart and has been subject to a prior case-by-case MACT determination pursuant to § 63.43, and the owner and operator obtained a final and legally effective case-by-case MACT determination prior to the promulgation date of such emission standard, then the permitting authority shall (if the initial title V permit has not yet been issued) issue an initial operating permit which incorporates the emission standard or determination, or shall (if the initial title V permit has been issued) revise the operating permit according to the reopening procedures in 40 CFR part 70 or part 71, whichever is relevant, to incorporate the emission standard or determination.
(1) The EPA may include in the emission standard established under section 112(d) or section 112(h) of the Act a specific compliance date for those sources which have obtained a final and legally effective MACT determination under this subpart and which have submitted the information required by § 63.43 to the EPA before the close of the public comment period for the standard established under section 112(d) of the Act. Such date shall assure that the owner or operator shall comply with the promulgated standard as expeditiously as practicable, but not longer than 8 years after such standard is promulgated. In that event, the permitting authority shall incorporate the applicable compliance date in the title V operating permit.
(2) If no compliance date has been established in the promulgated 112(d) or 112(h) standard or section 112(j) determination, for those sources which have obtained a final and legally effective MACT determination under this subpart, then the permitting authority shall establish a compliance date in the permit that assures that the owner or operator shall comply with the promulgated standard or determination as expeditiously as practicable, but not longer than 8 years after such standard is promulgated or a section 112(j) determination is made.
(c) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, if the Administrator promulgates an emission standard under section 112(d) or section 112(h) of the Act or the permitting authority issues a determination under section 112(j) of the Act that is applicable to a stationary source or group of sources which was deemed to be a constructed or reconstructed major source under this subpart and which is the subject of a prior case-by-case MACT determination pursuant to § 63.43, and the level of control required by the emission standard issued under section 112(d) or section 112(h) or the determination issued under section 112(j) is less stringent than the level of control required by any emission limitation or standard in the prior MACT determination, the permitting authority is not required to incorporate any less stringent terms of the promulgated standard in the title V operating permit applicable to such source(s) and may in its discretion consider any more stringent provisions of the prior MACT determination to be applicable legal requirements when issuing or revising such an operating permit.
[61 FR 68404, Dec. 27, 1996]
§§ 63.45-63.49
[Reserved]
§ 63.50
Applicability.
(a)
General applicability.
(1) The requirements of this section through § 63.56 implement section 112(j) of the Clean Air Act (as amended in 1990). The requirements of this section through
§ 63.56 apply in each State beginning on the effective date of an approved title V permit program in such State. The requirements of this section through § 63.56 do not apply to research or laboratory activities as defined in § 63.51.
(2) The requirements of this section through § 63.56 apply to:
(i) The owner or operator of affected sources within a source category or subcategory under this part that are located at a major source that is subject to an approved title V permit program and for which the Administrator has failed to promulgate emission standards by the section 112(j) deadlines. If title V applicability has been deferred for a source category, then section 112(j) is not applicable for sources in that category within that State, local or tribal jurisdiction until those sources become subject to title V permitting requirements; and
(ii) Permitting authorities with an approved title V permit program.
(b) Relationship to State and local requirements. Nothing in §§ 63.50 through 63.56 shall prevent a State or local regulatory agency from imposing more stringent requirements, as a matter of State or local law, than those contained in §§ 63.50 through 63.56.
(c) The procedures in §§ 63.50 through 63.56 apply for each affected source only after the section 112(j) deadline for the source category or subcategory in question has passed, and only until such time as a generally applicable Federal standard governing that source has been promulgated under section 112(d) or 112(h) of the Act. Once a generally applicable Federal standard governing that source has been promulgated, the owner or operator of the affected source and the permitting authority are not required to take any further actions to develop an equivalent emission limitation under section 112(j) of the Act.
(d) Any final equivalent emission limitation for an affected source which is issued by the permitting authority pursuant to §§ 63.50 through 63.56 prior to promulgation of a generally applicable Federal standard governing that source under section 112(d) or 112(h) of the Act shall be deemed an applicable Federal requirement adopted pursuant to section 112(j) of the Act. Each such equivalent emission limitation shall take effect upon issuance of the permit containing that limitation under section 112(j)(5) of the Act, and shall remain applicable to the source until such time as it may be revised or supplanted pursuant to the procedures established by §§ 63.50 through 63.56. Such a final equivalent emission limitation, and all associated requirements adopted pursuant to § 63.52(f)(2), are directly enforceable under Federal law regardless of whether or not any permit in which they may be contained remains in effect.
[59 FR 26449, May 20, 1994, as amended at 67 FR 16605, Apr. 5, 2002; 68 FR 32601, May 30, 2003]
§ 63.51
Definitions.
Terms used in §§ 63.50 through 63.56 that are not defined in this section have the meaning given to them in the Act, or in subpart A of this part.
Affected source
means the collection of equipment, activities, or both within a single contiguous area and under common control that is in a section 112(c) source category or subcategory for which the Administrator has failed to promulgate an emission standard by the section 112(j) deadline, and that is addressed by an applicable MACT emission limitation established pursuant to this subpart.
Available information
means, for purposes of conducting a MACT floor finding and identifying control technology options under this subpart, any information that is available as of the date on which the first Part 2 MACT application is filed for a source in the relevant source category or subcategory in the State or jurisdiction; and, pursuant to the requirements of this subpart, is additional relevant information that can be expeditiously provided by the Administrator, is submitted by the applicant or others prior to or during the public comment period on the section 112(j) equivalent emission limitation for that source, or information contained in the information sources in paragraphs (1) through (5) of this definition.
(1) A relevant proposed regulation, including all supporting information;
(2) Relevant background information documents for a draft or proposed regulation.
(3) Any relevant regulation, information or guidance collected by the Administrator establishing a MACT floor finding and/or MACT determination.
(4) Relevant data and information available from the Clean Air Technology Center developed pursuant to section 112(l)(3) of the Act.
(5) Relevant data and information contained in the Aerometric Information Retrieval System (AIRS).
(6) Any additional information that can be expeditiously provided by the Administrator, and
(7) Any information provided by applicants in an application for a permit, permit modification, administrative amendment, or Notice of MACT Approval pursuant to the requirements of this subpart.
(8) Any additional relevant information provided by the applicant.
Control technology
means measures, processes, methods, systems, or techniques to limit the emission of hazardous air pollutants including, but not limited to, measures which:
(1) Reduce the quantity, or eliminate emissions, of such pollutants through process changes, substitution of materials or other modifications;
(2) Enclose systems or processes to eliminate emissions;
(3) Collect, capture, or treat such pollutants when released from a process, stack, storage or fugitive emissions point;
(4) Are design, equipment, work practice, or operational standards (including requirements for operator training or certification) as provided in 42 U.S.C. 7412(h); or
(5) Are a combination of paragraphs (1) through (4) of this definition.
Enhanced review
means a review process containing all administrative steps needed to ensure that the terms and conditions resulting from the review process can be incorporated using title V permitting procedures.
Equivalent emission limitation
means an emission limitation, established under section 112(j) of the Act, which is equivalent to the MACT standard that EPA would have promulgated under section 112(d) or (h) of the Act.
Maximum achievable control technology (MACT) emission limitation for existing sources
means the emission limitation reflecting the maximum degree of reduction in emissions of hazardous air pollutants (including a prohibition on such emissions, where achievable) that the Administrator, taking into consideration the cost of achieving such emission reductions, and any non-air quality health and environmental impacts and energy requirements, determines is achievable by sources in the category or subcategory to which such emission standard applies. This limitation shall not be less stringent than the MACT floor.
Maximum achievable control technology (MACT) emission limitation for new sources
means the emission limitation which is not less stringent than the emission limitation achieved in practice by the best controlled similar source, and which reflects the maximum degree of reduction in emissions of hazardous air pollutants (including a prohibition on such emissions, where achievable) that the Administrator, taking into consideration the cost of achieving such emission reduction, and any non-air quality health and environmental impacts and energy requirements, determines is achievable by sources in the category or subcategory to which such emission standard applies.
Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) floor
means:
(1) For existing sources:
(i) The average emission limitation achieved by the best performing 12 percent of the existing sources in the United States (for which the Administrator has emissions information), excluding those sources that have, within 18 months before the emission standard is proposed or within 30 months before such standard is promulgated, whichever is later, first achieved a level of emission rate or emission reduction which complies, or would comply if the source is not subject to such standard, with the lowest achievable emission rate (as defined in section 171 of the Act) applicable to the source category and prevailing at the time, in the category or subcategory, for categories and subcategories of stationary sources with 30 or more sources; or
(ii) The average emission limitation achieved by the best performing five sources (for which the Administrator has or could reasonably obtain emissions information) in the category or subcategory, for categories or subcategories with fewer than 30 sources;
(2) For new sources, the emission limitation achieved in practice by the best controlled similar source.
New affected source
means the collection of equipment, activities, or both, that if constructed after the issuance of a section 112(j) permit for the source pursuant to § 63.52, is subject to the applicable MACT emission limitation for new sources. Each permit must define the term “new affected source,” which will be the same as the “affected source” unless a different collection is warranted based on consideration of factors including:
(1) Emission reduction impacts of controlling individual sources versus groups of sources;
(2) Cost effectiveness of controlling individual equipment;
(3) Flexibility to accommodate common control strategies;
(4) Cost/benefits of emissions averaging;
(5) Incentives for pollution prevention;
(6) Feasibility and cost of controlling processes that share common equipment (e.g., product recovery devices);
(7) Feasibility and cost of monitoring; and
(8) Other relevant factors.
Permitting authority
means the permitting authority as defined in part 70 of this chapter.
Research or laboratory activities
means activities whose primary purpose is to conduct research and development into new processes and products where such activities are operated under the close supervision of technically trained personnel and are not engaged in the manufacture of products for commercial sale in commerce, except in a de minimis manner; and where the source is not in a source category, specifically addressing research or laboratory activities, that is listed pursuant to section 112(c)(7) of the Act.
Section 112(j) deadline
means the date 18 months after the date for which a relevant standard is scheduled to be promulgated under this part, except that for all major sources listed in the source category schedule for which a relevant standard is scheduled to be promulgated by November 15, 1994, the section 112(j) deadline is November 15, 1996, and for all major sources listed in the source category schedule for which a relevant standard is scheduled to be promulgated by November 15, 1997, the section 112(j) deadline is December 15, 1999.
Similar source
means that equipment or collection of equipment that, by virtue of its structure, operability, type of emissions and volume and concentration of emissions, is substantially equivalent to the new affected source and employs control technology for control of emissions of hazardous air pollutants that is practical for use on the new affected source.
Source category schedule for standards
means the schedule for promulgating MACT standards issued pursuant to section 112(e) of the Act.
[59 FR 26449, May 20, 1994, as amended at 61 FR 21372, May 10, 1996; 64 FR 26314, May 14, 1999; 67 FR 16605, Apr. 5, 2002]
§ 63.52
Approval process for new and existing affected sources.
(a)
Sources subject to section 112(j) as of the section 112(j) deadline.
The requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section apply to major sources that include, as of the section 112(j) deadline, one or more sources in a category or subcategory for which the Administrator has failed to promulgate an emission standard under this part on or before an applicable section 112(j) deadline. Existing source MACT requirements (including relevant compliance deadlines), as specified in a title V permit issued to the source pursuant to the requirements of the subpart, must apply to such sources.
(1) The owner or operator must submit an application for a title V permit or for a revision to an existing title V permit or a pending title V permit meeting the requirements of § 63.53(a) by the section 112(j) deadline if the owner or operator can reasonably determine that one or more sources at the major source belong in the category or subcategory subject to section 112(j).
(2) If an application was not submitted under paragraph (a)(1) of this section and if notified by the permitting authority, the owner or operator must submit an application for a title V permit or for a revision to an existing title V permit or a pending title V permit meeting the requirements of § 63.53(a) within 30 days after being notified in writing by the permitting authority that one or more sources at the major source belong to such category or subcategory. Permitting authorities are not required to make such notification.
(3) The requirements in paragraphs (a)(3)(i) through (ii) of this section apply when the owner or operator has obtained a title V permit that incorporates a case-by-case MACT determination by the permitting authority under section 112(g) or has submitted a title V permit application for a revision that incorporates a case-by-case MACT determination under section 112(g), but has not submitted an application for a title V permit revision that addresses the emission limitation requirements of section 112(j).
(i) When the owner or operator has a title V permit that incorporates a case-by-case MACT determination by the permitting authority under section 112(g), the owner or operator must submit an application meeting the requirements of § 63.53(a) for a title V permit revision within 30 days of the section 112(j) deadline or within 30 days of being notified in writing by the permitting authority that one or more sources at the major source belong in such category or subcategory. Using the procedures established in paragraph (e) of this section, the permitting authority must determine whether the emission limitations adopted pursuant to the prior case-by-case MACT determination under section 112(g) are substantially as effective as the emission limitations which the permitting authority would otherwise adopt pursuant to section 112(j) for the source in question. If the permitting authority determines that the emission limitations previously adopted to effectuate section 112(g) are substantially as effective as the emission limitations which the permitting authority would otherwise adopt to effectuate section 112(j) for the source, then the permitting authority must retain the existing emission limitations in the permit as the emission limitations to effectuate section 112(j). The title V permit applicable to that source must be revised accordingly. If the permitting authority does not retain the existing emission limitations in the permit as the emission limitations to effectuate section 112(j), the MACT requirements of this subpart are satisfied upon issuance of a revised title V permit incorporating any additional section 112(j) requirements.
(ii) When the owner or operator has submitted a title V permit application that incorporates a case-by-case MACT determination by the permitting authority under section 112(g), but has not received the permit incorporating the section 112(g) requirements, the owner or operator must continue to pursue a title V permit that addresses the emission limitation requirements of section 112(g). Within 30 days of issuance of that title V permit, the owner or operator must submit an application meeting the requirements of § 63.53(a) for a change to the existing title V permit. Using the procedures established in paragraph (e) of this section, the permitting authority must determine whether the emission limitations adopted pursuant to the prior case-by-case MACT determination under section 112(g) are substantially as effective as the emission limitations which the permitting authority would otherwise adopt pursuant to section 112(j) for the source in question. If the permitting authority determines that the emission limitations previously adopted to effectuate section 112(g) are substantially as effective as the emission limitations which the permitting authority would otherwise adopt to effectuate section 112(j) for the source, then the permitting authority must retain the existing emission limitations in the permit as the emission limitations to effectuate section 112(j). The title V permit applicable to that source must be revised accordingly. If the permitting authority does not retain the existing emission limitations in the permit as the emission limitations to effectuate section 112(j), the MACT requirements of this subpart are satisfied
upon issuance of a revised title V permit incorporating any additional section 112(j) requirements.
(b)
Sources that become subject to section 112(j) after the section 112(j) deadline and that do not have a title V permit addressing section 112(j) requirements.
The requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section apply to sources that do not meet the criteria in paragraph (a) of this section on the section 112(j) deadline and are, therefore, not subject to section 112(j) on that date, but where events occur subsequent to the section 112(j) deadline that would bring the source under the requirements of this subpart, and the source does not have a title V permit that addresses the requirements of section 112(j).
(1) When one or more sources in a category or subcategory subject to the requirements of this subpart are installed at a major source, or result in the source becoming a major source due to the installation, and the installation does not invoke section 112(g) requirements, the owner or operator must submit an application meeting the requirements of § 63.53(a) within 30 days of startup of the source. This application shall be reviewed using the procedures established in paragraph (e) of this section. Existing source MACT requirements (including relevant compliance deadlines), as specified in a title V permit issued pursuant to the requirements of this subpart, shall apply to such sources.
(2) The requirements in this paragraph apply when one or more sources in a category or subcategory subject to this subpart are installed at a major source, or result in the source becoming a major source due to the installation, and the installation does require emission limitations to be established and permitted under section 112(g), and the owner or operator has not submitted an application for a title V permit revision that addresses the emission limitation requirements of section 112(j). In this case, the owner or operator must apply for and obtain a title V permit that addresses the emission limitation requirements of section 112(g). Within 30 days of issuance of that title V permit, the owner or operator must submit an application meeting the requirements of § 63.53(a) for a revision to the existing title V permit. Using the procedures established in paragraph (e) of this section, the permitting authority must determine whether the emission limitations adopted pursuant to the prior case-by-case MACT determination under section 112(g) are substantially as effective as the emission limitations which the permitting authority would otherwise adopt pursuant to section 112(j) for the source in question. If the permitting authority determines that the emission limitations previously adopted to effectuate section 112(g) are substantially as effective as the emission limitations which the permitting authority would otherwise adopt to effectuate section 112(j) for the source, then the permitting authority must retain the existing emission limitations in the permit as the emission limitations to effectuate section 112(j). The title V permit applicable to that source must be revised accordingly. If the permitting authority does not retain the existing emission limitations in the permit as the emission limitations to effectuate section 112(j), the MACT requirements of this subpart are satisfied upon issuance of a revised title V permit incorporating any additional section 112(j) requirements.
(3) The owner or operator of an area source that, due to a relaxation in any federally enforceable emission limitation (such as a restriction on hours of operation), increases its potential to emit hazardous air pollutants such that the source becomes a major source that is subject to this subpart, must submit an application meeting the requirements of § 63.53(a) for a title V permit or for an application for a title V permit revision within 30 days after the date that such source becomes a major source. This application must be reviewed using the procedures established in paragraph (e) of this section. Existing source MACT requirements (including relevant compliance deadlines), as specified in a title V permit issued pursuant to the requirements of this subpart, must apply to such sources.
(4) On or after April 5, 2002, if the Administrator establishes a lesser quantity emission rate under section
112(a)(1) of the Act that results in an area source becoming a major source that is subject to this subpart, then the owner or operator of such a major source must submit an application meeting the requirements of § 63.53(a) for a title V permit or for a change to an existing title V permit or pending title V permit on or before the date 6 months after the date that such source becomes a major source. Existing source MACT requirements (including relevant compliance deadlines), as specified in a title V permit issued pursuant to the requirements of this subpart, shall apply to such sources.
(c)
Sources that have a title V permit addressing section 112(j) requirements.
The requirements of paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section apply to major sources that include one or more sources in a category or subcategory for which the Administrator fails to promulgate an emission standard under this part on or before an applicable section 112(j) deadline, and the owner or operator has a permit meeting the section 112(j) requirements, and where changes occur at the major source to equipment, activities, or both, subsequent to the section 112(j) deadline.
(1) If the title V permit already provides the appropriate requirements that address the events that occur under paragraph (c) of this section subsequent to the section 112(j) deadline, then the source must comply with the applicable new source MACT or existing source MACT requirements as specified in the permit, and the section 112(j) requirements are thus satisfied.
(2) If the title V permit does not contain the appropriate requirements that address the events that occur under paragraph (c) of this section subsequent to the section 112(j) deadline, then the owner or operator must submit an application for a revision to the existing title V permit that meets the requirements of § 63.53(a). The application must be submitted within 30 days of beginning construction and must be reviewed using the procedures established in paragraph (e) of this section. Existing source MACT requirements (including relevant compliance deadlines), as specified in a title V permit issued pursuant to the requirements of this subpart, shall apply to such sources.
(d)
Requests for applicability determination or notice of MACT approval.
(1) An owner or operator who is unsure of whether one or more sources at a major source belong in a category or subcategory for which the Administrator has failed to promulgate an emission standard under this part may, on or before an applicable section 112(j) deadline, request an applicability determination from the permitting authority by submitting an application meeting the requirements of § 63.53(a) by the applicable deadlines specified in paragraphs (a), (b), or (c) of this section.
(2) In addition to meeting the requirements of paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section, the owner or operator of a new affected source may submit an application for a Notice of MACT Approval before construction, pursuant to § 63.54.
(e)
Permit application review.
(1) Each owner or operator who is required to submit to the permitting authority a Part 1 MACT application which meets the requirements of § 63.53(a) for one or more sources in a category or subcategory subject to section 112(j) must also submit to the permitting authority a timely Part 2 MACT application for the same sources which meets the requirements of § 63.53(b). Each owner or operator shall submit the Part 2 MACT application for the sources in a particular category or subcategory no later than the applicable date specified in table 1 to this subpart. The submission date specified in table 1 to this subpart for Miscellaneous Organic Chemical Manufacturing shall apply to sources in each of the source categories listed in table 2 to this subpart. When the owner or operator is required by §§ 63.50 through 63.56 to submit an application meeting the requirements of § 63.53(a) by a date which is after the date for a Part 2 MACT application for sources in the category or subcategory in question established by table 1 to this subpart, the owner or operator shall submit a Part 2 MACT application meeting the requirements of § 63.53(b) within 60 additional days after the applicable deadline for submission of the Part 1 MACT application. Part 2
MACT applications must be reviewed by the permitting authority according to procedures established in § 63.55. The resulting MACT determination must be incorporated into the source's title V permit according to procedures established under title V, and any other regulations approved under title V in the jurisdiction in which the affected source is located.
(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the owner or operator may request either an applicability determination or an equivalency determination by the permitting authority as provided in paragraphs (e)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section.
(i) Each owner or operator who submitted a request for an applicability determination pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this section on or before May 15, 2002, which remains pending before the permitting authority on May 30, 2003, and who still wishes to obtain such a determination, must resubmit that request by July 29, 2003, or by the date which is 60 days after the Administrator publishes in the
Federal Register
a proposed standard under section 112(d) or 112(h) of the Act for the category or subcategory in question, whichever is later. Each request for an applicability determination which is resubmitted under this paragraph (e)(2)(i) must be supplemented to discuss the relation between the source(s) in question and the applicability provision in the proposed standard for the category or subcategory in question, and to explain why there may still be uncertainties that require a determination of applicability. The permitting authority must take action upon each properly resubmitted and supplemented request for an applicability determination within an additional 60 days after the applicable deadline for the resubmitted request. If the applicability determination is positive, the owner or operator must submit a Part 2 MACT application meeting the requirements of § 63.53(b) by the date specified for the category or subcategory in question in Table 1 to this subpart. If the applicability determination is negative, then no further action by the owner or operator is necessary.
(ii) As specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, an owner or operator who has submitted an application meeting the requirements of § 63.53(a) may request a determination by the permitting authority of whether emission limitations adopted pursuant to a prior case-by-case MACT determination under section 112(g) that apply to one or more sources at a major source in a relevant category or subcategory are substantially as effective as the emission limitations which the permitting authority would otherwise adopt pursuant to section 112(j) for the source in question. Such a request must be submitted by the date for the category or subcategory in question specified in Table 1 to this subpart. Any owner or operator who previously submitted such a request under a prior version of this paragraph (e)(2)(ii) need not resubmit the request. Each request for an equivalency determination under this paragraph (e)(2)(ii), regardless of when it was submitted, will be construed in the alternative as a complete application for an equivalent emission limitation under section 112(j). The process for determination by the permitting authority of whether the emission limitations in the prior case-by-case MACT determination are substantially as effective as the emission limitations which the permitting authority would otherwise adopt under section 112(j) must include the opportunity for full public, EPA, and affected State review prior to a final determination. If the permitting authority determines that the emission limitations in the prior case-by-case MACT determination are substantially as effective as the emission limitations which the permitting authority would otherwise adopt under section 112(j), then the permitting authority must adopt the existing emission limitations in the permit as the emission limitations to effectuate section 112(j) for the source in question. If more than 3 years remain on the current title V permit, the owner or operator must submit an application for a title V permit revision to make any conforming changes in the permit required to adopt the existing emission limitations as the section 112(j) MACT emission limitations. If less than 3 years remain on the current title V permit, any required conforming changes must be made when the permit
is renewed. If the permitting authority determines that the emission limitations in the prior case-by-case MACT determination under section 112(g) are not substantially as effective as the emission limitations which the permitting authority would otherwise adopt for the source in question under section 112(j), the permitting authority must make a new MACT determination and adopt a title V permit incorporating an appropriate equivalent emission limitation under section 112(j). Such a determination constitutes final action for purposes of judicial review under 40 CFR 70.4(b)(3)(x) and corresponding State title V program provisions.
(3) Within 60 days of submittal of the Part 2 MACT application, the permitting authority must notify the owner or operator in writing whether the application is complete or incomplete. The Part 2 MACT application shall be deemed complete on the date it was submitted unless the permitting authority notifies the owner or operator in writing within 60 days of the submittal that the Part 2 MACT application is incomplete. A Part 2 MACT application is complete if it is sufficient to begin processing the application for a title V permit addressing section 112(j) requirements. In the event that the permitting authority disapproves a permit application or determines that the application is incomplete, the owner or operator must revise and resubmit the application to meet the objections of the permitting authority. The permitting authority must specify a reasonable period in which the owner or operator is required to remedy the deficiencies in the disapproved or incomplete application. This period may not exceed 6 months from the date the owner or operator is first notified that the application has been disapproved or is incomplete.
(4) Following submittal of a Part 1 or Part 2 MACT application, the permitting authority may request additional information from the owner or operator. The owner or operator must respond to such requests in a timely manner.
(5) If the owner or operator has submitted a timely and complete application as required by this section, any failure to have a title V permit addressing section 112(j) requirements shall not be a violation of section 112(j), unless the delay in final action is due to the failure of the applicant to submit, in a timely manner, information required or requested to process the application. Once a complete application is submitted, the owner or operator shall not be in violation of the requirement to have a title V permit addressing section 112(j) requirements.
(f)
Permit content.
The title V permit must contain an equivalent emission limitation (or limitations) for the relevant category or subcategory determined on a case-by-case basis by the permitting authority, or, if the applicable criteria in subpart D of this part are met, the title V permit may contain an alternative emission limitation. For the purposes of the preceding sentence, early reductions made pursuant to section 112(i)(5)(A) of the Act must be achieved not later than the date on which the relevant standard should have been promulgated according to the source category schedule for standards.
(1) The title V permit must contain an emission standard or emission limitation that is equivalent to existing source MACT and an emission standard or emission limitation that is equivalent to new source MACT for control of emissions of hazardous air pollutants. The MACT emission standards or limitations must be determined by the permitting authority and must be based on the degree of emission reductions that can be achieved if the control technologies or work practices are installed, maintained, and operated properly. The permit must also specify the affected source and the new affected source. If construction of a new affected source or reconstruction of an affected source commences after a title V permit meeting the requirements of section 112(j) has been issued for the source, the new source MACT compliance dates must apply.
(2) The title V permit must specify any notification, operation and maintenance, performance testing, monitoring, and reporting and recordkeeping requirements. In developing the title V permit, the permitting authority must consider and specify the
appropriate provisions of subpart A of this part. The title V permit must also include the information in paragraphs (f)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section.
(i) In addition to the MACT emission limitation required by paragraph (f)(1) of this section, additional emission limits, production limits, operational limits or other terms and conditions necessary to ensure practicable enforceability of the MACT emission limitation.
(ii) Compliance certifications, testing, monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping requirements that are consistent with requirements established pursuant to title V and paragraph (h) of this section.
(iii) Compliance dates by which the owner or operator must be in compliance with the MACT emission limitation and all other applicable terms and conditions of the permit.
(A) The owner or operator of an affected source subject to the requirements of this subpart must comply with the emission limitation(s) by the date established in the source's title V permit. In no case shall such compliance date be later than 3 years after the issuance of the permit for that source, except where the permitting authority issues a permit that grants an additional year to comply in accordance with section 112(i)(3)(B) of the Act, or unless otherwise specified in section 112(i), or in subpart D of this part.
(B) The owner or operator of a new affected source, as defined in the title V permit meeting the requirements of section 112(j), that is subject to the requirements of this subpart must comply with a new source MACT level of control immediately upon startup of the new affected source.
(g)
Permit issuance dates.
The permitting authority must issue a title V permit meeting section 112(j) requirements within 18 months after submittal of the complete Part 2 MACT application.
(h)
Enhanced monitoring.
In accordance with section 114(a)(3) of the Act, monitoring shall be capable of demonstrating continuous compliance for each compliance period during the applicable reporting period. Such monitoring data shall be of sufficient quality to be used as a basis for directly enforcing all applicable requirements established under this subpart, including emission limitations.
(i)
MACT emission limitations.
(1) The owner or operator of affected sources subject to paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section must comply with all requirements of this subpart that are applicable to affected sources, including the compliance date for affected sources established in paragraph (f)(2)(iii)(A) of this section.
(2) The owner or operator of new affected sources subject to paragraph (c)(1) of this section must comply with all requirements of this subpart that are applicable to new affected sources, including the compliance date for new affected sources established in paragraph (f)(2)(iii)(B) of this section.

§ 63.53
Application content for case-by-case MACT determinations.
(a)
Part 1 MACT application.
The Part 1 application for a MACT determination must contain the information in paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section.
(1) The name and address (physical location) of the major source.
(2) A brief description of the major source and an identification of the relevant source category.
(3) An identification of the types of emission points belonging to the relevant source category.
(4) An identification of any affected sources for which a section 112(g) MACT determination has been made.
(b)
Part 2 MACT application.
(1) In compiling a Part 2 MACT application, the owner or operator may cross-reference specific information in any prior submission by the owner or operator to the permitting authority, but in cross-referencing such information the owner or operator may not presume favorable action on any prior application or request which is still pending. In compiling a Part 2 MACT application, the owner or operator may also cross-reference any part of a standard proposed by the Administrator pursuant to section 112(d) or 112(h) of the Act for any category or subcategory which
includes sources to which the Part 2 application applies.
(2) The Part 2 application for a MACT determination must contain the information in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (b)(2)(v) of this section.
(i) For a new affected source, the anticipated date of startup of operation.
(ii) Each emission point or group of emission points at the affected source which is part of a category or subcategory for which a Part 2 MACT application is required, and each of the hazardous air pollutants emitted at those emission points. When the Administrator has proposed a standard pursuant to section 112(d) or 112(h) of the Act for a category or subcategory, such information may be limited to those emission points and hazardous air pollutants which would be subject to control under the proposed standard.
(iii) Any existing Federal, State, or local limitations or requirements governing emissions of hazardous air pollutants from those emission points which are part of a category or subcategory for which a Part 2 application is required.
(iv) For each identified emission point or group of affected emission points, an identification of control technology in place.
(v) Any additional emission data or other information specifically requested by the permitting authority.
(3) The Part 2 application for a MACT determination may, but is not required to, contain the following information:
(i) Recommended emission limitations for the affected source and support information consistent with § 63.52(f). The owner or operator may recommend a specific design, equipment, work practice, or operational standard, or combination thereof, as an emission limitation.
(ii) A description of the control technologies that would be applied to meet the emission limitation including technical information on the design, operation, size, estimated control efficiency and any other information deemed appropriate by the permitting authority, and identification of the affected sources to which the control technologies must be applied.
(iii) Relevant parameters to be monitored and frequency of monitoring to demonstrate continuous compliance with the MACT emission limitation over the applicable reporting period.

§ 63.54
Preconstruction review procedures for new affected sources.
The requirements of this section apply to an owner or operator who constructs a new affected source subject to § 63.52(c)(1). The purpose of this section is to describe alternative review processes that the permitting authority may use to make a MACT determination for the new affected source.
(a)
Review process for new affected sources.
(1) If the permitting authority requires an owner or operator to obtain or revise a title V permit before construction of the new affected source, or when the owner or operator chooses to obtain or revise a title V permit before construction, the owner or operator must follow the procedures established under the applicable title V permit program before construction of the new affected source.
(2) If an owner or operator is not required to obtain or revise a title V permit before construction of the new affected source (and has not elected to do so), but the new affected source is covered by any preconstruction or preoperation review requirements established pursuant to section 112(g) of the Act, then the owner or operator must comply with those requirements in order to ensure that the requirements of section 112(j) and (g) are satisfied. If the new affected source is not covered by section 112(g), the permitting authority, in its discretion, may issue a Notice of MACT Approval, or the equivalent, in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section, or an equivalent permit review process, before construction or operation of the new affected source.
(3) Regardless of the review process, the MACT determination shall be consistent with the principles established in § 63.55. The application for a Notice of MACT Approval or a title V permit, permit modification, or administrative amendment, whichever is applicable, shall include the documentation required by § 63.53.
(b)
Optional administrative procedures for preconstruction or preoperation review for new affected sources.
The permitting authority may provide for an enhanced review of section 112(j) MACT determinations for review procedures and compliance requirements equivalent to those set forth in paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section.
(1) The permitting authority will notify the owner or operator in writing as to whether the application for a MACT determination is complete or whether additional information is required.
(2) The permitting authority will approve an applicant's proposed control technology, or the permitting authority will notify the owner or operator in writing of its intention to disapprove a control technology.
(3) The owner or operator may present in writing, within a time frame specified by the permitting authority, additional information, considerations, or amendments to the application before the permitting authority's issuance of a final disapproval.
(4) The permitting authority will issue a preliminary approval or issue a disapproval of the application, taking into account additional information received from the owner or operator.
(5) A determination to disapprove any application will be in writing and will specify the grounds on which the disapproval is based.
(6) Approval of an applicant's proposed control technology must be set forth in a Notice of MACT Approval (or the equivalent) as described in § 63.52(f).
(c)
Opportunity for public comment on Notice of MACT Approval.
The permitting authority will provide opportunity for public comment on the preliminary Notice of MACT Approval prior to issuance, including, at a minimum,
(1) Availability for public inspection in at least one location in the area affected of the information submitted by the owner or operator and of the permitting authority's tentative determination;
(2) A period for submittal of public comment of at least 30 days; and
(3) A notice by prominent advertisement in the area affected of the location of the source information and analysis specified in § 63.52(f). The form and content of the notice must be substantially equivalent to that found in § 70.7 of this chapter.
(4) An opportunity for a public hearing, if one is requested. The permitting authority will give at least 30 days notice in advance of any hearing.
(d)
Review by the EPA and affected States.
The permitting authority must send copies of the preliminary notice (in time for comment) and final notice required by paragraph (c) of this section to the Administrator through the appropriate Regional Office, and to all other State and local air pollution control agencies having jurisdiction in affected States. The permitting authority must provide EPA with a review period for the final notice of at least 45 days and shall not issue a final Notice of MACT Approval until EPA objections are satisfied.
(e)
Compliance with MACT determinations.
An owner or operator of a major source that is subject to a MACT determination must comply with notification, operation and maintenance, performance testing, monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements established under § 63.52(h), under title V, and at the discretion of the permitting authority, under subpart A of this part. The permitting authority must provide the EPA with the opportunity to review compliance requirements for consistency with requirements established pursuant to title V during the review period under paragraph (d) of this section.
(f)
Equivalency under section 112(l).
If a permitting authority requires preconstruction review for new source MACT determinations under this subpart, such requirement shall not necessitate a determination under subpart E of this part.
[59 FR 26449, May 20, 1994, as amended at 67 FR 16610, Apr. 5, 2002]
§ 63.55
Maximum achievable control technology (MACT) determinations for affected sources subject to case-by-case determination of equivalent emission limitations.
(a)
Requirements for permitting authorities.
The permitting authority must determine whether the § 63.53(a) Part 1 and § 63.53(b) Part 2 MACT application is complete or an application for a Notice of MACT Approval is approvable.
In either case, when the application is complete or approvable, the permitting authority must establish hazardous air pollutant emissions limitations equivalent to the limitations that would apply if an emission standard had been issued in a timely manner under section 112(d) or (h) of the Act. The permitting authority must establish these emissions limitations consistent with the following requirements and principles:
(1) Emission limitations must be established for the equipment and activities within the affected sources within a source category or subcategory for which the section 112(j) deadline has passed.
(2) Each emission limitation for an existing affected source must reflect the maximum degree of reduction in emissions of hazardous air pollutants (including a prohibition on such emissions, where achievable) that the permitting authority, taking into consideration the cost of achieving such emission reduction and any non-air quality health and environmental impacts and energy requirements, determines is achievable by affected sources in the category or subcategory for which the section 112(j) deadline has passed. This limitation must not be less stringent than the MACT floor which must be established by the permitting authority according to the requirements of section 112(d)(3)(A) and (B) and must be based upon available information.
(3) Each emission limitation for a new affected source must reflect the maximum degree of reduction in emissions of hazardous air pollutants (including a prohibition on such emissions, where achievable) that the permitting authority, taking into consideration the cost of achieving such emission reduction and any non-air quality health and environmental impacts and energy requirements, determines is achievable. This limitation must not be less stringent than the emission limitation achieved in practice by the best controlled similar source which must be established by the permitting authority according to the requirements of section 112(d)(3). This limitation must be based upon available information.
(4) The permitting authority must select a specific design, equipment, work practice, or operational standard, or combination thereof, when it is not feasible to prescribe or enforce an equivalent emission limitation due to the nature of the process or pollutant. It is not feasible to prescribe or enforce a limitation when the Administrator determines that hazardous air pollutants cannot be emitted through a conveyance designed and constructed to capture such pollutant, or that any requirement for, or use of, such a conveyance would be inconsistent with any Federal, State, or local law, or the application of measurement methodology to a particular class of sources is not practicable due to technological and economic limitations.
(5) Nothing in this subpart shall prevent a State or local permitting authority from establishing an emission limitation more stringent than required by Federal regulations.
(b)
Reporting to EPA.
The owner or operator must submit additional copies of its Part 1 and Part 2 MACT application for a title V permit, permit revision, or Notice of MACT Approval, whichever is applicable, to the EPA at the same time the material is submitted to the permitting authority.
[67 FR 16610, Apr. 5, 2002]
§ 63.56
Requirements for case-by-case determination of equivalent emission limitations after promulgation of subsequent MACT standard.
(a) If the Administrator promulgates a relevant emission standard that is applicable to one or more affected sources within a major source before the date a permit application under this paragraph (a) is approved, the title V permit must contain the promulgated standard rather than the emission limitation determined under § 63.52, and the owner or operator must comply with the promulgated standard by the compliance date in the promulgated standard.
(b) If the Administrator promulgates a relevant emission standard under section 112(d) or (h) of the Act that is applicable to a source after the date a permit is issued pursuant to § 63.52 or § 63.54, the permitting authority must incorporate requirements of that
standard in the title V permit upon its next renewal. The permitting authority must establish a compliance date in the revised permit that assures that the owner or operator must comply with the promulgated standard within a reasonable time, but not longer than 8 years after such standard is promulgated or 8 years after the date by which the owner or operator was first required to comply with the emission limitation established by the permit, whichever is earlier. However, in no event shall the period for compliance for existing sources be shorter than that provided for existing sources in the promulgated standard.
(c) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, the requirements of paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section shall apply.
(1) If the Administrator promulgates an emission standard under section 112(d) or (h) that is applicable to an affected source after the date a permit application under this paragraph is approved under § 63.52 or § 63.54, the permitting authority is not required to change the emission limitation in the permit to reflect the promulgated standard if the permitting authority determines that the level of control required by the emission limitation in the permit is substantially as effective as that required by the promulgated standard pursuant to § 63.1(e).
(2) If the Administrator promulgates an emission standard under section 112(d) or (h) of the Act that is applicable to an affected source after the date a permit application is approved under § 63.52 or § 63.54, and the level of control required by the promulgated standard is less stringent than the level of control required by any emission limitation in the prior MACT determination, the permitting authority is not required to incorporate any less stringent emission limitation of the promulgated standard in the title V permit and may in its discretion consider any more stringent provisions of the MACT determination to be applicable legal requirements when issuing or revising such a title V permit.

# Subpart D—Regulations Governing Compliance Extensions for Early Reductions of Hazardous Air Pollutants
§ 63.70
Applicability.
The provisions of this subpart apply to an owner or operator of an existing source who wishes to obtain a compliance extension from a standard issued under section 112(d) of the Act. The provisions of this subpart also apply to a State or local agency acting pursuant to a permit program approved under title V of the Act. The Administrator will carry out the provisions of this subpart for any State that does not have an approved permit program.
§ 63.71
Definitions.
All terms used in this subpart not defined in this section are given the same meaning as in the Act.
Act
means the Clean Air Act as amended.
Actual emissions
means the actual rate of emissions of a pollutant, but does not include excess emissions from a malfunction, or startups and shutdowns associated with a malfunction. Actual emissions shall be calculated using the source's actual operating rates, and types of materials processed, stored, or combusted during the selected time period.
Artificially or substantially greater emissions
means abnormally high emissions such as could be caused by equipment malfunctions, accidents, unusually high production or operating rates
compared to historical rates, or other unusual circumstances.
EPA conditional method
means any method of sampling and analyzing for air pollutants that has been validated by the Administrator but that has not been published as an EPA Reference Method.
EPA reference method
means any method of sampling and analyzing for an air pollutant as described in appendix A of part 60 of this chapter, appendix B of part 61 of this chapter, or appendix A of part 63.
Equipment leaks
means leaks from pumps, compressors, pressure relief devices, sampling connection systems, open-ended valves or lines, valves, connectors, agitators, accumulator vessels, and instrumentation systems in hazardous air pollutant service.
Existing source
means any source as defined in § 63.72, the construction or reconstruction of which commenced prior to proposal of an applicable section 112(d) standard.
Hazardous air pollutant (HAP)
means any air pollutant listed pursuant to section 112(b) of the Act.
High-risk pollutant
means a hazardous air pollutant listed in Table 1 of § 63.74.
Malfunction
means any sudden failure of air pollution control equipment or process equipment or of a process to operate in a normal or usual manner. Failures that are caused entirely or in part by poor maintenance, careless operation, or any other preventable upset condition or preventable equipment breakdown shall not be considered malfunctions.
Not feasible to prescribe or enforce a numerical emission limitation
means a situation in which the Administrator or a State determines that a pollutant (or stream of pollutants) listed pursuant to section 112(b) of the Act cannot be emitted through a conveyance designed and constructed to emit or capture such pollutant, or that any requirement for, or use of, such a conveyance would be inconsistent with any Federal law; or the application of measurement technology to a particular source is not practicable due to technological or economic limitations.
Permitting authority
means either a State agency with an approved permitting program under Title V of the Act or the Administrator in cases where the State does not have an approved permitting program.
Post-reduction year
means the one year period beginning with the date early reductions have to be achieved to qualify for a compliance extension under subpart D of this part, unless a source has established with the permitting authority an earlier one year period as the post-reduction year. For most sources, the post-reduction year would begin with the date of proposal of the first section 112(d) standard applicable to the early reductions source; however, for sources that have made enforceable commitments, it would be the year from January 1, 1994, through December 31, 1994.
Responsible official

§ 63.72
General provisions for compliance extensions.
(a) Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, a permitting authority acting pursuant to a permitting program approved under Title V of the Act shall by permit allow an existing source to meet an alternative emission limitation in lieu of an emission limitation promulgated under section 112(d) of the Act for a period of 6 years from the compliance date of the otherwise applicable standard provided the source owner or operator demonstrates:
(1) According to the requirements of § 63.74 that the source has achieved a reduction of 90 percent (95 percent or more in the case of hazardous air pollutants which are particulates) in emissions of:
(i) Total hazardous air pollutants from the source;
(ii) Total hazardous air pollutants from the source as adjusted for high-risk pollutant weighting factors, if applicable.
(2) That such reduction was achieved before proposal of an applicable standard or, for sources eligible to qualify for an alternative emission limitation as specified in paragraph (c) of this section, before January 1, 1994.
(b) A source granted an alternative emission limitation shall comply with an applicable standard issued under section 112(d) of the Act immediately upon expiration of the six year compliance extension period specified in paragraph (a) of this section.
(c) An existing source that achieves the reduction specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section after proposal of an applicable section 112(d) standard but before January 1, 1994, may qualify for an alternative emission limitation under paragraph (a) of this section if the source makes an enforceable commitment, prior to proposal of the applicable standard, to achieve such reduction. The enforceable commitment shall be made according to the procedures and requirements of § 63.75.
(d) For each permit issued to a source under paragraph (a) of this section, there shall be established as part of the permit an enforceable alternative emission limitation for hazardous air pollutants reflecting the reduction which qualified the source for the alternative emission limitation.
(e) An alternative emission limitation shall not be available with respect to standards or requirements promulgated to provide an ample margin of safety to protect public health pursuant to section 112(f) of the Act, and the Administrator will, for the purpose of determining whether a standard under section 112(f) of the Act is necessary, review emissions from sources granted an alternative emission limitation under this subpart at the same time that other sources in the category or subcategory are reviewed.
(f) Nothing in this subpart shall preclude a State from requiring hazardous air pollutant reductions in excess of 90 percent (95 percent in the case of particulate hazardous air pollutants) as a condition of such State granting an alternative emission limitation authorized in paragraph (a) of this section.
§ 63.73
Source.
(a) An alternative emission limitation may be granted under this subpart to an existing source. For the purposes of this subpart only, a source is defined as follows:
(1) A building structure, facility, or installation identified as a source by the EPA in appendix B of this part;
(2) All portions of an entire contiguous plant site under common ownership or control that emit hazardous air pollutants;
(3) Any portion of an entire contiguous plant site under common ownership or control that emits hazardous air pollutants and can be identified as a facility, building, structure, or installation for the purposes of establishing standards under section 112(d) of the Act; or
(4) Any individual emission point or combination of emission points within a contiguous plant site under common control, provided that emission reduction from such point or aggregation of
points constitutes a significant reduction of hazardous air pollutant emissions of the entire contiguous plant site.
(b) For purposes of paragraph (a)(4) of this section, emissions reductions are considered significant if they are made from base year emissions of not less than:
(1) A total of 10 tons per year of hazardous air pollutants where the total emissions of hazardous air pollutants in the base year from the entire contiguous plant site is greater than 25 tons per; or
(2) A total of 5 tons per year of hazardous air pollutants where the total emissions of hazardous air pollutants in the base year from the entire contiguous plant site is less than or equal to 25 tons per year.
§ 63.74
Demonstration of early reduction.
(a) An owner or operator applying for an alternative emission limitation shall demonstrate achieving early reductions as required by § 63.72(a)(1) by following the procedures in this section.
(b) An owner or operator shall establish the source for the purposes of this subpart by documenting the following information:
(1) A description of the source including: a site plan of the entire contiguous plant site under common control which contains the source, markings on the site plan locating the parts of the site that constitute the source, and the activity at the source which causes hazardous air pollutant emissions;
(2) A complete list of all emission points of hazardous air pollutants in the source, including identification numbers and short descriptive titles; and
(3) A statement showing that the source conforms to one of the allowable definition options from § 63.73. For a source conforming to the option in § 63.73(a)(4), the total base year emissions from the source, as determined pursuant to this section, shall be demonstrated to be at least:
(i) 5 tons per year, for cases in which total hazardous air pollutant emissions from the entire contiguous plant site under common control are 25 tons per year or less as calculated under paragraph (1) of this section; or
(ii) 10 tons per year in all other cases.
(c) An owner or operator shall establish base year emissions for the source by providing the following information:
(1) The base year chosen, where the base year shall be 1987 or later except that the base year may be 1985 or 1986 if the owner or operator of the source can demonstrate that emission data for the source for 1985 or 1986 was submitted to the Administrator pursuant to an information request issued under section 114 of the Act and was received by the Administrator prior to November 15, 1990;
(2) The best available data accounting for actual emissions, during the base year, of all hazardous air pollutants from each emission point listed in the source in paragraph (b)(2) of this section;
(3) The supporting basis for each emission number provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section including:
(i) For test results submitted as the supporting basis, a description of the test protocol followed, any problems encountered during the testing, and a discussion of the validity of the method for measuring the subject emissions; and
(ii) For calculations based on emission factors, material balance, or engineering principles and submitted as the supporting basis, a step-by-step description of the calculations, including assumptions used and their bases, and a brief rationale for the validity of the calculation method used; and
(4) Evidence that the emissions provided under paragraph (c)(2) of this section are not artificially or substantially greater than emissions in other years prior to implementation of emission reduction measures.
(d) An owner or operator shall establish post-reduction emissions by providing the following information:
(1) For the emission points listed in the source in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, a description of all control measures employed to achieve the emission reduction required by § 63.72(a)(1);
(2) The best available data accounting for actual emissions, during the year following the applicable emission
reduction deadline as specified in § 63.72(a)(2), of all hazardous air pollutants from each emission point in the source listed pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
(3) The supporting basis for each emission number provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section including:
(i) For test results submitted as the supporting basis, a description of the test protocol followed, any problems encountered during the testing, and a discussion of the validity of the method for measuring the subject emissions; and
(ii) For calculations based on emission factors, material balance, or engineering principles and submitted as the supporting basis, a step-by-step description of the calculations, including assumptions used and their bases, and a brief rationale for the validity of the calculation method used;
(4) [Reserved]
(5) Evidence that there was no increase in radionuclide emissions from the source.
(e)(1) An owner or operator shall demonstrate that both total base year emissions and total base year emissions adjusted for high-risk pollutants, as applicable, have been reduced by at least 90 percent for gaseous hazardous air pollutants emitted and 95 percent for particulate hazardous air pollutants emitted by determining the following for gaseous and particulate emissions separately:
(i) Total base year emissions, calculated by summing all base year emission data from paragraph (c)(2) of this section;
(ii) Total post-reduction emissions, calculated by summing all post-reduction emission data from paragraph (d)(2) of this section;
(iii) (If applicable) Total base year emissions adjusted for high-risk pollutants, calculated by multiplying each emission number for a pollutant from paragraph (c)(2) of this section by the appropriate weighting factor for the pollutant from Table 1 in paragraph (f) of this section and then summing all weighted emission data;
(iv) (If applicable) Total post-reduction emissions adjusted for high-risk pollutants, calculated by multiplying each emission number for a pollutant from paragraph (d)(2) of this section by the appropriate weighting factor for the pollutant from Table 1 and then summing all weighted emission data; and
(v) Percent reductions, calculated by dividing the difference between base year and post-reduction emissions by the base year emissions. Separate demonstrations are required for total gaseous and particulate emissions, and total gaseous and particulate emissions adjusted for high-risk pollutants.
(2) If any points in the source emit both particulate and gaseous pollutants, as an alternative to the demonstration required in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, an owner or operator may demonstrate:
(i) A weighted average percent reduction for all points emitting both particulate and gaseous pollutants where the weighted average percent reduction is determined by
EC21OC91.019
where %
W
= the required weighted percent reduction
Σ M
g
= the total mass rate (e.g., kg/yr) of all gaseous emissions
Σ M
p
= the total mass rate of all particulate emissions and,
(ii) The reductions required in paragraph (e)(1) of this section for all other points in the source.
(f) If lower rates or hours are used to achieve all or part of the emission reduction, any hazardous air pollutant emissions that occur from a compensating increase in rates or hours from the same activity elsewhere within the plant site which contains the source shall be counted in the post-reduction emissions from the source. If emission reductions are achieved by shutting down process equipment and the shutdown equipment is restarted or replaced anywhere within the plant site, any hazardous air pollutant emissions from the restarted or replacement equipment shall be counted in the post-reduction emissions for the source.

(g) The best available data representing actual emissions for the purpose of establishing base year or post-reduction emissions under this section shall consist of documented results from source tests using an EPA Reference Method, EPA Conditional Method, or the owner's or operator's source test method which has been validated pursuant to Method 301 of appendix A of this part. However, if one of the following conditions exists, an owner or operator may submit, in lieu of results from source tests, calculations based on engineering principles, emission factors, or material balance data as actual emission data for establishing base year or post-reduction emissions:
(1) No applicable EPA Reference Method, EPA Conditional Method, or other source test method exists;
(2) It is not technologically or economically feasible to perform source tests;
(3) It can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the reviewing agency that the calculations will provide emission estimates of accuracy comparable to that of any applicable source test method;
(4) For base year emission estimates only, the base year conditions no longer exist at an emission point in the source and emission data could not be produced for such an emission point, by performing source tests under currently existing conditions and converting the test results to reflect base year conditions, that is more accurate than an estimate produced by using engineering principles, emission factors, or a material balance; or
(5) The emissions from one or a set of emission points in the source are small compared to total source emissions and potential errors in establishing emissions from such points will not have a significant effect on the accuracy of total emissions established for the source.
(h) For base year or post-reduction emissions established under this section that are not supported by source test data, the source owner or operator shall include the reason source testing was not performed.
(i) [Reserved]
(j) The EPA average emission factors for equipment leaks cannot be used under this subpart to establish base year emissions for equipment leak sources, unless the base year emission number calculated using the EPA average emission factors for equipment leaks also is used as the post-reduction emission number for equipment leaks from the source.
(k) A source owner or operator shall not establish base year or post-reduction emissions that include any emissions from the source exceeding allowable emission levels specified in any applicable law, regulation, or permit condition.
(l) For sources subject to paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, an owner or operator shall document total base year
emissions from an entire contiguous plant site under common control by providing the information required pursuant to paragraphs (b)(2), (c)(2), and (e)(1)(i) of this section for all hazardous air pollutants from all emission points in the contiguous plant site under common control.
(m) If a new pollutant is added to the list of hazardous air pollutants or high-risk pollutants, any source emitting such pollutant will not be required to revise an early reduction demonstration pursuant to this section if:
(1) Alternative emission limits have previously been specified by permit for the source as provided for in § 63.72(a); or
(2) The base year emissions submitted in an enforceable commitment have previously been approved by the reviewing agency.

§ 63.75
Enforceable commitments.
(a) To make an enforceable commitment an owner or operator shall submit a commitment to achieve the early reductions required under § 63.72(a)(1) to the appropriate EPA Regional Office and a copy of the commitment to the appropriate State, except that the commitment shall be submitted to the State and a copy to the EPA Regional Office if the State has an approved permitting program under Title V of the Act. A copy shall also be submitted to both the EPA Stationary Source Compliance Division (EN-341W), 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20460 and the EPA Emission Standards Division (MD-13), Research Triangle Park, NC 27711; attention both to the Early Reductions Officer. The commitment shall contain:
(1) The name and address of the source;
(2) The name and telephone number of the source owner or operator or other responsible official who can be contacted concerning the commitment;
(3) An alternative mailing address if correspondence is to be directed to a location other than that given in paragraph (a)(1) of this section;
(4) All information specified in § 63.74(b), (c) and (e)(1)(i), which defines and describes the source and establishes the base year hazardous air pollutant emissions from the source;
(5) The general plan for achieving the required hazardous air pollutant emissions reductions at the source including descriptions of emission control equipment to be employed, process changes or modifications to be made, and any other emission reduction measures to be used; and
(6) A statement of commitment, signed by a responsible official of the source, containing the following:
(i) A statement providing the post-reduction emission levels for total hazardous air pollutants and high-risk pollutants, as applicable, from the source on an annual basis which reflect a 90 percent (95 percent for particulate pollutants) reduction from base year emissions;
(ii) A statement certifying that the base year emission data submitted as part of the enforceable commitment constitute the best available data for base year emissions from the source, are correct to the best of the responsible official's knowledge, and are within allowable levels specified in any applicable law, regulation, or permit;
(iii) A statement that it is understood by the source owner or operator that submission of base year emissions constitutes a response to an EPA request under the authority of section 114 of the Act and that the commitment is subject to enforcement according to § 63.80; and
(iv) A statement committing the source owner or operator to achieving the emission levels, listed in paragraph (a)(6), (i) of this section, at the source before January 1, 1994.
(b) The following language may be used to satisfy the requirements of paragraphs (a)(6)(ii) through (a)(6)(iv) of this section:
I certify to the best of my knowledge that the base year emissions given above are correct and constitute the best available data for base year emissions from the source, and acknowledge that these estimates are being submitted in response to an EPA request under section 114 of the Act. I further certify that the base year emissions provided for all emission points in the source do not exceed allowable emission levels specified in any applicable law, regulation, or permit condition. I commit to achieve before January 1, 1994,
the stated post-reduction emission level(s) at the source, which will provide the 90 (95) percent reduction required to qualify for the compliance extension, and acknowledge that this commitment is enforceable as specified in title 40, part 63, subpart D, of the Code of Federal Regulations.
(c) A commitment for a source shall be submitted prior to proposal of an applicable standard issued under section 112(d) of the Act. Commitments received after the proposal date shall be void.
(d) If test results for one or more emission points in a source are required to support base year emissions in an enforceable commitment but are not available prior to proposal of an applicable standard issued under section 112(d) of the Act, the test results may be submitted after the enforceable commitment is made but no later than 180 days after proposal of an applicable standard. In such cases, the enforceable commitment shall contain the best substitute emission data for the points in the source for which test results will be submitted later.
(e) An owner or operator may rescind such a commitment prior to December 1, 1993 without penalty and forfeit the opportunity to obtain a six year compliance extension under this subpart.
(f) An enforceable commitment submitted under this section shall not be in effect and enforceable until the base year emissions contained in the commitment have been approved according to the procedures in § 63.76. An owner or operator is under no obligation to continue to seek approval of commitments that have not been approved by December 1, 1993.
(g) The control measure information required under § 63.74(d)(1) as part of post-reduction emission documentation and submitted in a permit application according to the provisions of § 63.77 shall become part of an existing enforceable commitment upon receipt of the permit application by the permitting authority. An owner or operator shall notify the permitting authority of any change made to the source during calendar year 1994 which affects such control measure information and shall mail the notice within 5 days (postmark date) of making the change. The notice shall be considered an amendment to the source's enforceable commitment.
[57 FR 61992, Dec. 29, 1992, as amended at 58 FR 34370, June 25, 1993; 58 FR 62543, Nov. 29, 1993; 59 FR 59924, Nov. 21, 1994]
§ 63.76
Review of base year emissions.
(a) Pursuant to the procedures of this section, the appropriate reviewing agency shall review and approve or disapprove base year emission data submitted in an enforceable commitment under § 63.75 or in a request letter from an applicant that wishes to participate in the early reduction program but who is not required to submit an enforceable commitment. For review requests submitted to a State agency as the appropriate reviewing agency, a copy of the request also shall be submitted to the applicable EPA Regional Office. For review requests submitted to the EPA Regional Office as the appropriate reviewing agency, a copy of the request also shall be sent to the applicable State agency. Copies also shall be submitted to the EPA Stationary Source Compliance Division (EN-341W), 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20460 and the EPA Emission Standards Division (MD-13), Research Triangle Park, NC 27711; to the attention of the Early Reductions Officer.
(b) Within 30 days of receipt of an enforceable commitment or base year emission data, the reviewing agency shall advise the applicant that:
(1) The base year emission data are complete as submitted; or
(2) The base year emission data are not complete and include a list of deficiencies that must be corrected before review can proceed.
(c) EPA will publish a notice in the
Federal Register
which contains a list, accumulated for the previous month, of the sources for which complete base year emission data have been submitted and which are undergoing review either in the EPA Regional Office or a State agency within the EPA region. The notice will contain the name and location of each source and a contract in the EPA Regional Office for additional information.
(d) Within 60 days of a determination that a base year emission data submission is complete, the reviewing agency
shall evaluate the adequacy of the submission with respect to the requirements of § 63.74 (b) and (c) and either:
(1) Determine to approve the submission and publish a notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the area where the source is located or in a State publication designed to give general public notice, providing the aggregate base year emission data for the source and the rationale for the proposed approval, noting the availability of the nonconfidential information contained in the submission for public inspection in at least one location in the community in which the source is located, providing for a public hearing upon request by an interested party, and establishing a 30 day public comment period that can be extended to 60 days upon request by an interested party; or
(2) Determine to disapprove the base year emission data and give notice to the applicant of the reasons for the disapproval. An applicant may correct disapproved base year data and submit revised data for review in accordance with this subsection, except that the review of a revision shall be accomplished within 30 days.
(e) If no adverse public comments are received by the reviewing agency on proposed base year data for a source, the data shall be considered approved at the close of the public comment period and a notice of the approval shall be sent to the applicant and published by the reviewing agency by advertisement in the area affected.
(f) If adverse comments are received and the reviewing agency agrees that corrections are needed, the reviewing agency shall give notice to the applicant of the disapproval and reasons for the disapproval. An applicant may correct disapproved base year emission data and submit revised emission data. If a revision is submitted by the applicant that, to the satisfaction of the reviewing agency, takes into account the adverse comments, the reviewing agency will publish by advertisement in the area affected a notice containing the approved base year emission data for the source and send notice of the approval to the applicant.
(g) If adverse comments are received and the reviewing agency determines that the comments do not warrant changes to the base year emission data, the reviewing agency will publish by advertisement in the area affected a notice containing the approved base year emission data for the source and the reasons for not accepting the adverse comments. A notice of the approval also shall be sent to the applicant.
(h) If an applicant submits revised emission data under paragraph (d)(2) or (f) of this section for a source subject to an enforceable commitment, the applicant also shall submit an amended enforceable commitment which takes into account the revised base year emissions.
(i) If revised base year emission data are not submitted or notice of intent to submit revised data is not provided to the permitting authority by an applicant within 90 days of receiving adverse comments or a notice of disapproved base year emission data for a source that is subject to an enforceable commitment, the enforceable commitment shall be considered withdrawn and a notice to that effect shall be sent by the reviewing agency to the applicant.
§ 63.77
Application procedures.
(a) To apply for an alternative emission limitation under § 63.72, an owner or operator of the source shall file a permit application with the appropriate permitting authority.
(b) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, the permit application shall contain the information required by § 63.74, as applicable, and the additional information required for a complete permit application as specified by the applicable permit program established pursuant to title V of the Act.
(c) Permit applications under this section for sources not subject to enforceable commitments shall be submitted by the later of the following dates:
(1) 120 days after proposal of an otherwise applicable standard issued under section 112(d) of the Act; or
(2) 120 days after the date an applicable permit program is approved or established pursuant to title V of the Act.
(d) Permit applications for sources subject to enforceable commitments pursuant to § 63.75 shall be submitted no later than April 30, 1994.
(e) If the post-reduction year does not end at least one month before the permit application deadline under paragraph (c) of this section, the source may file the post-reduction emissions information required under § 63.74(d)(2), (d)(3), and (d)(5) later as a supplement to the original permit application. In such cases, this supplemental information shall be submitted to the permitting authority no later than one month after the end of the post-reduction year.
(f) If a source test will be the supporting basis for establishing post-reduction emissions for one or more emissions units in the early reductions source, the test results shall be submitted by the applicable deadline for submittal of a permit application as specified in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section.
(g) Review and disposition of permit applications submitted under this section will be accomplished according to the provisions of the applicable permit program established pursuant to title V of the Act.
[58 FR 62543, Nov. 29, 1993, as amended at 59 FR 59924, Nov. 21, 1994]
§ 63.78
Early reduction demonstration evaluation.
(a) The permitting authority will evaluate an early reduction demonstration submitted by the source owner or operator in a permit application with respect to the requirements of § 63.74.
(b) An application for a compliance extension may be denied if, in the judgement of the permitting authority, the owner or operator has failed to demonstrate that the requirements of § 63.74 have been met. Specific reasons for denial include, but are not limited to:
(1) The information supplied by the owner or operator is incomplete;
(2) The required 90 percent reduction (95 percent in cases where the hazardous air pollutant is particulate matter) has not been demonstrated;
(3) The base year or post-reduction emissions are incorrect, based on methods or assumptions that are not valid, or not sufficiently reliable or well documented to determine with reasonable certainty that required reductions have been achieved; or
(4) The emission of hazardous air pollutants or the performance of emission control measures is unreliable so as to preclude determination that the required reductions have been achieved or will continue to be achieved during the extension period.
§ 63.79
Approval of applications.
(a) If an early reduction demonstration is approved and other requirements for a complete permit application are met, the permitting authority shall establish by a permit issued pursuant to title V of the Act enforceable alternative emissions limitations for the source reflecting the reduction which qualified the source for the extension. However, if it is not feasible to prescribe a numerical emissions limitation for one or more emission points in the source, the permitting authority shall establish such other requirements, reflecting the reduction which qualified the source for an extension, in order to assure the source achieves the 90 percent or 95 percent reduction, as applicable.
(b) An alternative emissions limitation or other requirement prescribed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section shall be effective and enforceable immediately upon issuance of the permit for the source and shall expire exactly six years after the compliance date of an otherwise applicable standard issued pursuant to section 112(d) of the Act.
§ 63.80
Enforcement.
(a) All base year or post-reduction emissions information described in § 63.74 and required to be submitted as part of a permit application under § 63.77 or an enforceable commitment under § 63.75 shall be considered to have been requested by the Administrator under the authority of section 114 of the Act.
(b) Fraudulent statements contained in any base year or post-reduction emissions submitted to a State or EPA Regional Office under this subpart shall be considered violations of section 114 of the Act and of this subpart
and, thus, actionable under section 113 of the Act and can be considered, in appropriate cases, violations of 18 U.S.C. 1001, the general false swearing provision of the United States Code.
(c) If a source subject to an enforceable commitment fails to achieve reductions before January 1, 1994, sufficient to qualify the source for an extension under this subpart, the source shall be considered to be in violation of the commitment and shall be subject to enforcement action under section 113 of the Act.
(d) If an early reduction demonstration in a permit application filed under § 63.77 is disapproved for a source not subject to an enforceable commitment, the owner or operator shall comply with an applicable standard issued under section 112(d) of the Act by the compliance date specified in such standard.
(e) If an early reduction demonstration in a permit application filed under § 63.77 is disapproved for a source that is subject to an enforceable commitment, the owner or operator shall comply with an applicable standard issued under section 112(d) of the Act by the compliance date specified in such standard and will be subject to enforcement action under section 113 of the Act.
(f) A violation of an alternative emission limitation or other requirement established by permit under § 63.79 (a) or (b) for the source is enforceable pursuant to the authority of section 113 of the Act notwithstanding any demonstration of continuing 90 percent (95 percent for hazardous air pollutants which are particulates) emission reduction over the entire source.
§ 63.81
Rules for special situations.
(a) If more than one standard issued under section 112(d) of the Act would be applicable to a source as defined under § 63.73, then the date of proposal referred to in §§ 63.72(a)(2), 63.72(c), 63.74(d)(4), 63.75(c), and 63.77(c) is the date the first applicable standard is proposed.
(b) Sources emitting radionuclides are not required to reduce radionuclides by 90 (95) percent. Radionuclides may not be increased from the source as a result of the early reductions demonstration.

# Subpart E—Approval of State Programs and Delegation of Federal Authorities
§ 63.90
Program overview.
The regulations in this subpart establish procedures consistent with section 112(l) of the Clean Air Act (Act) (42 U.S.C. 7401-7671q). This subpart establishes procedures for the approval of State rules, programs, or other requirements such as permit terms and conditions to be implemented and enforced in place of certain otherwise applicable section 112 Federal rules, emission standards, or requirements (including section 112 rules promulgated under the authority of the Act prior to the 1990 Amendments to the Act). The authority to implement and enforce section 112 Federal rules as promulgated without changes may be delegated under procedures established in this subpart. In this process, States may seek approval of a State mechanism for receiving delegation of existing and future unchanged Federal section 112 standards. This subpart clarifies which part 63, subpart A General Provisions authorities can be delegated to States. This subpart also establishes procedures for the review and withdrawal of section 112 implementation and enforcement authorities delegated through this subpart. This subpart also establishes procedures for the approval of State rules or programs to establish limitations on the potential to emit pollutants listed in or pursuant to section 112(b) of the Act.
(a)
Definitions.
The following definitions apply to this subpart.
Alternative requirements
means the requirements, rules, permits, provisions, methods, or other enforceable mechanisms that a State submits for approval under this subpart or subpart A and, after approval, replaces the otherwise applicable Federal section 112 requirements, provisions, or methods.
Applicability criteria
means the regulatory criteria used to define all affected sources subject to a specific section 112 rule.
Approval
means a determination by the Administrator that a State rule,
program, or requirement meets the criteria of § 63.91 and the additional criteria of either § 63.92, § 63.93, § 63.94, or § 63.97 as appropriate. For accidental release prevention programs, the criteria of § 63.95 must be met in addition to the criteria of § 63.91. This is considered a “full approval” for the purposes of this subpart. Partial approvals may also be granted as described in this subpart. Any approved requirements become applicable requirements under § 70.2 of this chapter.
Compliance and enforcement measures
means requirements relating to compliance and enforcement, including but not necessarily limited to monitoring methods and procedures, recordkeeping, reporting, plans, inspection, maintenance, and operation requirements, pollution prevention requirements, noticing, field inspections, entry, sampling, or accidental release prevention oversight.
Intermediate change to monitoring
means a modification to federally required monitoring involving “proven technology” (generally accepted by the scientific community as equivalent or better) that is applied on a site-specific basis and that may have the potential to decrease the stringency of the associated emission limitation or standard. Though site-specific, an intermediate change may set a national precedent for a source category and may ultimately result in a revision to the federally required monitoring. Examples of intermediate changes to monitoring include, but are not limited to:
(1) Use of a continuous emission monitoring system (CEMS) in lieu of a parameter monitoring approach;
(2) Decreased frequency for non-continuous parameter monitoring or physical inspections;
(3) Changes to quality control requirements for parameter monitoring; and
(4) Use of an electronic data reduction system in lieu of manual data reduction.
Intermediate change to test method
means a within-method modification to a federally enforceable test method involving “proven technology” (generally accepted by the scientific community as equivalent or better) that is applied on a site-specific basis and that may have the potential to decrease the stringency of the associated emission limitation or standard. Though site-specific, an intermediate change may set a national precedent for a source category and may ultimately result in a revision to the federally enforceable test method. In order to be approved, an intermediate change must be validated according to EPA Method 301 (Part 63, Appendix A) to demonstrate that it provides equal or improved accuracy and precision. Examples of intermediate changes to a test method include, but are not limited to:
(1) Modifications to a test method's sampling procedure including substitution of sampling equipment that has been demonstrated for a particular sample matrix, and use of a different impinger absorbing solution;
(2) Changes in sample recovery procedures and analytical techniques, such as changes to sample holding times and use of a different analytical finish with proven capability for the analyte of interest; and
(3) “Combining” a federally required method with another proven method for application to processes emitting multiple pollutants.
Level of control
means the degree to which a rule, program, or requirement limits emissions or employs design, equipment, work practice, or operational standards, accident prevention, or other requirements or techniques (including a prohibition of emissions) for:
(1)(i) Each hazardous air pollutant, if individual pollutants are subject to emission limitations, and
(ii) The aggregate total of hazardous air pollutants, if the aggregate grouping is subject to emission limitations, provided that the rule, program, or requirement would not lead to an increase in risk to human health or the environment; and
(2) Each substance regulated under part 68 of this chapter.
(3) Test methods and associated procedures and averaging times are integral to the level of control.
Local agency
means a local air pollution control agency or, for the purposes of § 63.95, any local agency or entity having responsibility for preventing accidental releases which may occur at
a source regulated under part 68 of this chapter.
Major change to monitoring
means a modification to federally required monitoring that uses “unproven technology or procedures” (not generally accepted by the scientific community) or is an entirely new method (sometimes necessary when the required monitoring is unsuitable). A major change to monitoring may be site-specific or may apply to one or more source categories and will almost always set a national precedent. Examples of major changes to monitoring include, but are not limited to:
(1) Use of a new monitoring approach developed to apply to a control technology not contemplated in the applicable regulation;
(2) Use of a predictive emission monitoring system (PEMS) in place of a required continuous emission monitoring system (CEMS);
(3) Use of alternative calibration procedures that do not involve calibration gases or test cells;
(4) Use of an analytical technology that differs from that specified by a performance specification;
(5) Decreased monitoring frequency for a continuous emission monitoring system, continuous opacity monitoring system, predictive emission monitoring system, or continuous parameter monitoring system;
(6) Decreased monitoring frequency for a leak detection and repair program; and
(7) Use of alternative averaging times for reporting purposes.
Major change to recordkeeping/reporting
means:
(1) A modification to federally required recordkeeping or reporting that:
(i) May decrease the stringency of the required compliance and enforcement measures for the relevant standards;
(ii) May have national significance (e.g., might affect implementation of the applicable regulation for other affected sources, might set a national precedent); or
(iii) Is not site-specific.
(2) Examples of major changes to recordkeeping and reporting include, but are not limited to:
(i) Decreases in the record retention for all records;
(ii) Waiver of all or most recordkeeping or reporting requirements;
(iii) Major changes to the contents of reports; or
(iv) Decreases in the reliability of recordkeeping or reporting (e.g., manual recording of monitoring data instead of required automated or electronic recording, or paper reports where electronic reporting may have been required).
Major change to test method
means a modification to a federally enforceable test method that uses “unproven technology or procedures” (not generally accepted by the scientific community) or is an entirely new method (sometimes necessary when the required test method is unsuitable). A major change to a test method may be site-specific, or may apply to one or more sources or source categories, and will almost always set a national precedent. In order to be approved, a major change must be validated according to EPA Method 301 (part 63, appendix A). Examples of major changes to a test method include, but are not limited to:
(1) Use of an unproven analytical finish;
(2) Use of a method developed to fill a test method gap;
(3) Use of a new test method developed to apply to a control technology not contemplated in the applicable regulation; and
(4) Combining two or more sampling/analytical methods (at least one unproven) into one for application to processes emitting multiple pollutants.
Minor change to monitoring
means:
(1) A modification to federally required monitoring that:
(i) Does not decrease the stringency of the compliance and enforcement measures for the relevant standard;
(ii) Has no national significance (e.g., does not affect implementation of the applicable regulation for other affected sources, does not set a national precedent, and individually does not result in a revision to the monitoring requirements); and
(iii) Is site-specific, made to reflect or accommodate the operational characteristics, physical constraints, or safety concerns of an affected source.
(2) Examples of minor changes to monitoring include, but are not limited to:
(i) Modifications to a sampling procedure, such as use of an improved sample conditioning system to reduce maintenance requirements;
(ii) Increased monitoring frequency; and
(iii) Modification of the environmental shelter to moderate temperature fluctuation and thus protect the analytical instrumentation.
Minor change to recordkeeping/reporting means:
(1) A modification to federally required recordkeeping or reporting that:
(i) Does not decrease the stringency of the compliance and enforcement measures for the relevant standards;
(ii) Has no national significance (e.g., does not affect implementation of the applicable regulation for other affected sources, does not set a national precedent, and individually does not result in a revision to the recordkeeping or reporting requirement); and
(iii) Is site-specific.
(2) Examples of minor changes to recordkeeping or reporting include, but are not limited to:
(i) Changes to recordkeeping necessitated by alternatives to monitoring;
(ii) Increased frequency of recordkeeping or reporting, or increased record retention periods;
(iii) Increased reliability in the form of recording monitoring data, e.g., electronic or automatic recording as opposed to manual recording of monitoring data;
(iv) Changes related to compliance extensions granted pursuant to § 63.6(i);
(v) Changes to recordkeeping for good cause shown for a fixed short duration, e.g., facility shutdown;
(vi) Changes to recordkeeping or reporting that is clearly redundant with equivalent recordkeeping/reporting requirements; and
(vii) Decreases in the frequency of reporting for area sources to no less than once a year for good cause shown, or for major sources to no less than twice a year as required by title V, for good cause shown.
Minor change to test method
means:
(1) A modification to a federally enforceable test method that:
(i) Does not decrease the stringency of the emission limitation or standard;
(ii) Has no national significance (e.g., does not affect implementation of the applicable regulation for other affected sources, does not set a national precedent, and individually does not result in a revision to the test method); and
(iii) Is site-specific, made to reflect or accommodate the operational characteristics, physical constraints, or safety concerns of an affected source.
(2) Examples of minor changes to a test method include, but are not limited to:
(i) Field adjustments in a test method's sampling procedure, such as a modified sampling traverse or location to avoid interference from an obstruction in the stack, increasing the sampling time or volume, use of additional impingers for a high moisture situation, accepting particulate emission results for a test run that was conducted with a lower than specified temperature, substitution of a material in the sampling train that has been demonstrated to be more inert for the sample matrix; and
(ii) Changes in recovery and analytical techniques such as a change in quality control/quality assurance requirements needed to adjust for analysis of a certain sample matrix.
Partial approval
means that the Administrator approves under this subpart:
(1) A State's legal authorities that fully meet the criteria of § 63.91(d)(3)(ii)-(v), and substantially meet the criteria of § 63.91(d)(3)(i) as appropriate; or
(2) A State rule or program that meets the criteria of § 63.92, § 63.93, § 63.94, § 63.95, or § 63.97 with the exception of a separable portion of that State rule or program which fails to meet those criteria. A separable portion of a State rule or program is defined as a section(s) of a rule or a portion(s) of a program which can be acted upon independently without affecting the overall integrity of the rule or program as a whole.
Program
means, for the purposes of an approval under this subpart, a collection of State authorities, resources, and other requirements that satisfy
the criteria of this subpart and subpart A.
State agency,
for the purposes of this subpart, includes State and local air pollution agencies, Indian tribes as defined in § 71.2 of this chapter, and territories of the United States to the extent they are or will be delegated Federal section 112 rules, emission standards, or requirements.
Stringent or stringency
means the degree of rigor, strictness or severity a statute, rule, emission standard, or requirement imposes on an affected source as measured by the quantity of emissions, or as measured by parameters relating to rule applicability and level of control, or as otherwise determined by the Administrator.
Title V operating permit programs
means the part 70 permitting program and the delegated Indian tribal programs under part 70 of this chapter.
(b)
Local agency coordination with State and territorial agencies.
Local agencies submitting a rule or program for approval under this subpart shall consult with the relevant State or Territorial agency prior to making a request for approval to the Administrator. A State or Territorial agency may submit requests for approval on behalf of a local agency after consulting with that local agency.
(c)
Tribal authority.
A tribal authority may submit a rule or program under this subpart, provided that the tribal authority has received approval, under the provisions of part 49 of this chapter, for administering Federal rules under section 112 of the Act.
(d)
Authorities retained by the Administrator.
(1) The following authorities will be retained by the Administrator and will not be delegated:
(i) The authority to add or delete pollutants from the list of hazardous air pollutants established under section 112(b);
(ii)-(iii) [Reserved]
(iv) The authority to add source categories to or delete source categories from the Federal source category list established under section 112(c)(1) or to subcategorize categories on the Federal source category list after proposal of a relevant emission standard;
(v) The authority to revise the source category schedule established under section 112(e) by moving a source category to a later date for promulgation; and
(vi) Any other authorities determined to be nondelegable by the Administrator.
(2) Nothing in this subpart shall prohibit the Administrator from enforcing any applicable rule, emission standard or requirement established under section 112.
(3) Nothing in this subpart shall affect the authorities and obligations of the Administrator or the State under title V of the Act or under regulations promulgated pursuant to that title.
(e)
Federally-enforceable requirements.
All rules, programs, State or local permits, or other requirements approved under this subpart and all resulting part 70 operating permit conditions are enforceable by the Administrator and by citizens under the Act.
(f)
Standards not subject to modification or substitution.
With respect to radionuclide emissions from licensees of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission or licensees of Nuclear Regulatory Commission Agreement States which are subject to part 61, subparts I, T, or W of this chapter, a State may request that the EPA approve delegation of implementation and enforcement of the Federal standard pursuant to § 63.91, but no changes or modifications in the form or content of the standard will be approved pursuant to § 63.92, § 63.93, § 63.94, or § 63.97.
(g)
Selection of delegation options.
(1) With the exception of paragraphs (g)(2) and (g)(3) of this section, States may only submit requests for approval of alternative requirements for a section 112 Federal rule, emission standard, or other requirement under a single delegation option under this subpart.
(2) In the case of § 63.94 submittals, if the identified sources in any source category comprise a subset of the sources in that category, the State must accept delegation under one other section of this subpart for the remainder of the sources in that category that are required to be permitted by the State under part 70 of this chapter.
(3) If the Administrator partially approves the State request per § 63.91(f), the State may submit a request for the remaining section 112 rules, emission
standards, or requirements in that category under another section of this subpart.
[65 FR 55835, Sept. 14, 2000]
§ 63.91
Criteria for straight delegation and criteria common to all approval options.
(a)
Applicable approval criteria.
A State must satisfy the criteria in paragraph (d) of this section for up-front approval to obtain delegation of the Federal section 112 rules, emission standards, or requirements. Once a State has demonstrated it meets the criteria in paragraph (d) of this section, it only needs to reference that demonstration and reaffirm that it still meets the criteria in future submittals. In addition, a State must satisfy the applicable approval criteria in § 63.92, § 63.93, § 63.94, § 63.95, or § 63.97, as specified in the following paragraphs.
(1)
Unchanged Federal section 112 rules (“straight delegation”).
To obtain approval of State programs to implement and enforce Federal section 112 rules as promulgated without changes (except for accidental release programs, described in paragraph (a)(4) of this section), only the criteria of paragraph (d) of this section must be met. This includes State requests for one-time approval of their mechanism for taking delegation of future unchanged Federal section 112 rules, emission standards, and requirements as well as approval to implement and enforce unchanged Federal section 112 rules, emission standards, and requirements on a rule-by-rule basis.
(2)
State rules, programs, or requirements that are different from the Federal rule.
To obtain approval under this subpart of a rule, program, or requirement that is different from the Federal section 112 rule, emission standard, or requirement, the criteria of paragraph (d) of this section and the criteria of either § 63.92, § 63.93, § 63.94, or § 63.97 must be met.
(3)
Separable portions of State rules, programs, or requirements (“partial approval”).
To obtain partial approval under this subpart, a State request must meet the criteria in paragraphs (d) and (f) of this section.
(4)
Programs under part 68 of this chapter, prevention of accidental releases.
For approval of State rules or programs to implement and enforce the Federal accidental release prevention program in part 68 of this chapter, as promulgated without changes, the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section, and § 63.95 must be met. For approval of alternative requirements, the provisions of either § 63.92 or § 63.93 must also be met.
(5)
Limits on the potential to emit section 112 pollutants.
The Administrator may, under the authority of section 112(l) and this subpart, also approve a State program designed to establish limits on the potential to emit hazardous air pollutants listed pursuant to section 112 of the Act.
(b)
Approval process.
When a State submits an initial request for approval, and except as otherwise specified under § 63.92, § 63.93, § 63.94, § 63.95, or § 63.97, for a State's subsequent requests for approval, the approval process will be as shown in the following table:
If . . .
Then . . .
And then . . .
(1) A request for approval is received
the Administrator will review the request for approval and determine whether the request is complete according to the criteria in this subpart
if a request is incomplete, the Administrator will notify the State of the specific deficient elements of the request.
(2) A complete request for approval is received
the Administrator will seek public comment for a minimum of 30 days through a
Federal Register
notice on the State's request for approval
the Administrator will require that comments be submitted concurrently to the State.
(3) A complete request for approval is received and there has been a period of public comment
the Administrator will either approve, partially approve, or disapprove the State rule, program, or requirement within 180 days of receipt of a complete request
(4) The Administrator finds that all of the criteria of this section are met and all of the criteria of § 63.92, § 63.93, § 63.94, § 63.95, or § 63.97 are met
the Administrator will approve or partially approve the State rule, program, or requirement
the Administrator will publish it in the
Federal Register,
and incorporate it directly or by reference, in the appropriate subpart of part 63. Requirements approved under § 63.95 will be incorporated pursuant to requirements under part 68 of this chapter.
(5) The Administrator finds that any of the criteria of this section are not met, or any of the criteria of § 63.92, § 63.93, § 63.94, § 63.95, or § 63.97 under which the request for approval was made are not met
the Administrator will notify the State of any revisions or additions necessary to obtain approval
any resubmittal by a State of a request for approval will be considered a new request under this subpart.
(6) A State rule, program, or requirement is disapproved
unless the State can revise the submittal to meet the criteria, the Administrator will disapprove the State rule, program, or requirement
the Administrator will publish the disapproval in the
Federal Register.
(c)
Enforcement.
(1) Approval of the alternative rule, program, or requirement delegates to the State the authority to implement and enforce the approved rule, program, or requirement in lieu of the otherwise applicable Federal section 112 rule, emission standard, or requirement.
(i) The approved State rule, program, or requirement shall be federally enforceable from the date the Administrator signs the approval, with two exceptions. For States that implement unchanged Federal requirements (§ 63.91, straight delegation) via their title V permit program, and for States using the equivalency by permit option (63.94), the approved requirements shall be federally enforceable on the date of issuance or revision of the title V permit.
(ii) In the case of a partial approval under paragraph (f)(1) of this section, only those authorities of the State request found to meet the requirements of this section will be approved; the remaining Federal authorities will be implemented and enforced by EPA.
(iii) For partial approvals under paragraph (f)(3) of this section, only the portion of the State rule that is approved will be federally enforceable; the remainder continues to be State enforceable only.
(2) When a State rule, program, or requirement is approved by the Administrator under this subpart, applicable title V permits shall be revised according to the provisions of § 70.7(f) of this chapter.
(i) Each permit shall specify the origin of the alternative conditions per § 70.6 (a)(i) of this chapter and specifically reference the
Federal Register
notice or other EPA approval mechanism in the permit.
(ii) When approved alternative requirements are incorporated in a permit, those requirements must be clearly identified and carried forward in any subsequent permit revisions or renewals. If the permit is not renewed, or if a revision or renewal does not carry the alternate requirements forward, then the Federal section 112 requirements become the applicable requirements.
(3) If approval is withdrawn under § 63.96, all otherwise applicable Federal rules and requirements shall be enforceable in accordance with the compliance schedule established in the withdrawal notice and relevant title V permits shall be revised according to the provisions of § 70.7(f) of this chapter.
(d)
Criteria for approval.
(1) Any request for approval under this subpart shall meet all section 112(l) approval criteria specified by the otherwise applicable Federal section 112 rule, emission standard, or requirement, all of the approval criteria of this section, and any additional approval criteria in § 63.92, § 63.93, § 63.94, § 63.95, or § 63.97.
(2) Once a State has satisfied the § 63.91(d) up-front approval requirements, it only needs to reference the previous demonstration and reaffirm that is still meets the criteria for any subsequent equivalency submittals.
(3) Interim or final title V program approval will satisfy the criteria set
forth in § 63.91(d), up-front approval criteria. Alternatively, the State must provide the following items in paragraphs (d)(3)(i) through (v) of this section to the Administrator:
(i) A written finding by the State Attorney General (or for a local agency or tribal authority, the General Counsel with full authority to represent the local agency or tribal authority) that the State has the necessary legal authority to implement and to enforce the State rule, program, or requirement upon approval and to assure compliance by all sources within the State with each applicable section 112 rule, emission standard, or requirement. For full approval, the State must have the following legal authorities concerning enforcement and compliance assurance:
(A) The State shall have enforcement authorities that meet the requirements of § 70.11 of this chapter, except that tribal authorities shall have enforcement authorities that meet the requirements of part 49 of this chapter, the Tribal Air Rule.
(B) The State shall have authority to request information from regulated sources regarding their compliance status.
(C) The State shall have authority to inspect sources and any records required to determine a source's compliance status.
(D) If a State delegates authorities to a local agency, the State must retain enforcement authority unless the local agency has authorities that meet the requirements of § 70.11 of this chapter.
(ii) A copy of State statutes, regulations, and requirements that contain the appropriate provisions granting authority to implement and enforce the State rule, program, or requirement upon approval.
(iii) A demonstration that the State has adequate resources to implement and enforce all aspects of the rule, program, or requirement upon approval (except for authorities explicitly retained by the Administrator, such as those pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section or pursuant to part 49 of this chapter), which includes:
(A) A description in narrative form of the scope, structure, coverage, and processes of the State program.
(B) A description of the organization and structure of the agency or agencies that will have responsibility for administering the program.
(C) A description of the agency's capacity to carry out the State program, including the number, occupation, and general duties of the employees.
(iv) A schedule demonstrating expeditious State implementation of the rule, program, or requirement upon approval.
(v) A plan that assures expeditious compliance by all sources subject to the State rule, program, or requirement upon approval. The plan should include, at a minimum, a complete description of the State's compliance tracking and enforcement program, including but not limited to inspection strategies.
(4) If any of the State documents that are required to support an approval under this subpart are readily available to the EPA and to the public, the State may cite the relevant portions of the documents or indicate where they are available (e.g., by providing an Internet address) rather than provide copies.
(5) Electronic documents. Submission of electronic documents shall comply with the requirements of 40 CFR part 3—(Electronic reporting).
(e)
Revisions.
Within 90 days of any State amendment, repeal, or revision of any State rule, program, permit, or other requirement approved as an alternative to a Federal requirement or part of the authority necessary for the up-front approval, the State must provide the Administrator with a copy of the revised authorities and meet the requirements of either paragraph (e)(1) or (e)(2) of this section.
(1)(i) The State shall provide the Administrator with a written finding by the State Attorney General (or for a local agency or tribal authority, the General Counsel with full authority to represent the local agency or tribal authority) that the State's revised legal authorities are adequate to continue to implement and to enforce all previously approved State rules and the approved State program (as applicable) and adequate to continue to assure compliance by all sources within the
State with approved rules, the approved program, the approved permit, or other requirements (as applicable) and each applicable section 112 rule, emission standard, or requirement.
(ii) If the Administrator determines that the written finding is not adequate, the State shall request approval of the revised rule, program, permit, or other requirement according to the provisions of paragraph (e)(2) of this section.
(2) The State shall request approval under this subpart for any revised rule, program, permit, or other requirement.
(i) If the Administrator approves the revised rule, program, permit, or other requirement, the revision will replace the previously approved rule, program, permit, or other requirement.
(ii) If the Administrator disapproves the revised rule, program, permit, or other requirement, the Administrator will initiate procedures under § 63.96 to withdraw approval of any previously approved rule, program, permit, or other requirement that may be affected by the revised authorities.
(iii) Until such time as the Administrator approves or withdraws approval of a revised rule, program, permit, or other requirement, the previously approved rule, program, permit, or requirement remains federally enforceable and the revision is not federally enforceable.
(3) If the EPA amends, or otherwise revises a promulgated section 112 rule or requirement in a way that increases its stringency, the EPA will notify any State which has received delegation under this subpart of the need to revise their equivalency demonstration.
(i) The EPA Regional Office will consult with the affected State(s) to set a time frame for the State(s) to submit a revised equivalency demonstration.
(ii) The revised equivalency demonstration will be reviewed and approved or disapproved according to the procedures set forth in this section and § 63.91, § 63.92, § 63.93, § 63.94, § 63.95, or § 63.97, whichever are applicable.
(f)
Partial approval.
The partial approval process under this subpart is described in the following table:
If . . .
Then . . .
And . . .
(1) A State's legal authorities submitted under this subpart substantially meet the requirements of paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, but are not fully approvable
the Administrator may grant a partial approval with the State's consent
The EPA will continue to implement and enforce those authorities under paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section that are not approved.
(2) Any of the other requirements in paragraphs (d)(3)(ii)-(v) of this section are not approvable
the Administrator will disapprove the submittal
(3) A rule, requirement, or program submitted under this subpart meets the requirements of § 63.92, § 63.93, § 63.94, § 63.95, or § 63.97 as appropriate, with the exception of a separable portion of that rule, requirement, or program
the Administrator may remove that separable portion with the State's consent
the Administrator may then grant a partial approval of the portion of the rule, requirement, or program that meets the requirements of this subpart.
(4) the Administrator determines that there are too many areas of deficiency or that separating the responsibilities between Federal and State government would be too cumbersome and complex
the Administrator may disapprove the submittal in its entirety
(g)

§ 63.92
Approval of State requirements that adjust a section 112 rule.
Under this section a State may seek approval of State requirements that make pre-approved adjustments to a Federal section 112 rule, emission standard, or requirement that are unambiguously no less stringent than the Federal rule, emission standard, or requirement.
(a)
Approval process.
(1) If the Administrator finds that the criteria of this section and the criteria of § 63.91 are met, the Administrator will approve the State requirements, publish them in the
Federal Register,
and incorporate them, directly or by reference, in the appropriate subpart of part 63, without additional notice and opportunity for comment. Requirements approved under § 63.95 will be incorporated pursuant to requirements under part 68 of this chapter.
(2) If the Administrator finds that any one of the State adjustments to
the Federal rule is in any way ambiguous with respect to the stringency of applicability, level of control, compliance and enforcement measures, or the compliance date for any affected source or emission point, the Administrator will either disapprove the State request or consider the request under § 63.93.
(3) Within 60 days of receiving a complete request for approval under this section, the Administrator will either approve or disapprove the State request. If approved, the change will be effective upon signature of the
Federal Register
notice.

(5) If the State uses a permit as the basis of alternative requirements under this section, the relevant permit terms and conditions must remain applicable to the source, even if the source takes steps that would otherwise release it from an obligation to have a permit.
(b)
Criteria for approval.
Any request for approval under this section shall meet all of the criteria of this section and § 63.91 before approval. The State shall provide the Administrator with:
(1) A demonstration that the public within the State has had adequate notice and opportunity to submit written comment on the State requirements, and
(2) A demonstration that each State adjustment to the Federal rule individually results in requirements that:
(i) Are unequivocally no less stringent than the otherwise applicable Federal rule with respect to applicability;
(ii) Are unequivocally no less stringent than the otherwise applicable Federal rule with respect to level of control for each affected source and emission point;
(iii) Are unequivocally no less stringent than the otherwise applicable Federal rule with respect to compliance and enforcement measures for each affected source and emission point; and
(iv) Assure compliance by every affected source no later than would be required by the otherwise applicable Federal rule.
(3) State adjustments to Federal section 112 rules which may be part of an approved rule under this section are:

§ 63.93
Approval of State requirements that substitute for a section 112 rule.
Under this section a State may seek approval of State requirements which differ from a Federal section 112 rule for which they would substitute, such that the State requirements do not qualify for approval under § 63.92.
(a)
Approval process.
(1) After receiving a complete request for approval under this section and making a preliminary determination on its equivalence, the Administrator will seek public comment on the State's request for a minimum of 30 days through a
Federal Register
notice. The Administrator will require that comments be submitted concurrently to the State.
(2) If, after review of public comments and any State responses to comments submitted to the Administrator, the Administrator finds that the criteria of this section and the criteria of § 63.91 are met, the Administrator will approve the State requirements under this section, publish the approved requirements in the
Federal Register,
and incorporate them directly or by reference, in the appropriate subpart of part 63. Requirements approved under § 63.95 will be incorporated pursuant to requirements under part 68 of this chapter.
(3) If the Administrator finds that any of the requirements of this section or § 63.91 have not been met, the Administrator may partially approve or disapprove the State requirements. For any partial approvals or disapprovals, the Administrator will provide the State with the basis for the partial approval or disapproval and what actions that State can take to make the requirements approvable.
(4) Requirements submitted for approval under this section shall include either: State rules, title V permits, title V general permits, Federal new source review permits, board and administrative orders, permits issued pursuant to permit templates, or State operating permits. Permits must already be issued to be used under this section.
(5) If the State uses a permit as the basis of alternative requirements under this section, the relevant permit terms and conditions must remain applicable to the source even if it takes steps that would otherwise release it from an obligation to have a permit.
(6) Within 180 days of receiving a complete request for approval under this section, the Administrator will either approve, partially approve, or disapprove the State request.
(b)
Criteria for approval.
Any request for approval under this section shall meet all of the criteria of this section and § 63.91 before approval. The State shall provide the Administrator with detailed documentation that the State requirements contain or demonstrate:
(1) Applicability criteria that are no less stringent than those in the respective Federal rule;
(2) Levels of control (including associated performance test methods) and compliance and enforcement measures that result in emission reductions from each affected source or accidental release prevention program requirements for each affected source that are no less stringent than would result from the otherwise applicable Federal rule;
(3) A compliance schedule that requires each affected source to be in compliance within a time frame consistent with the deadlines established in the otherwise applicable Federal rule; and
(4) At a minimum, the approved State requirements must include the following compliance and enforcement measures. (For requirements addressing the accidental release prevention program, minimum compliance and enforcement provisions are described in § 63.95.)
(i) The approved requirements must include monitoring or another method for determining compliance.
(ii) If a standard in the approved rule is not instantaneous, a maximum averaging time must be established.
(iii) The requirements must establish an obligation to periodically monitor for compliance using the monitoring or another method established in paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section sufficient to yield reliable data that are representative of the source's compliance status.

§ 63.94
Approval of State permit terms and conditions that substitute for a section 112 rule.
Under this section a State may seek approval of State permit terms and conditions to be implemented and enforced in lieu of specified existing and future Federal section 112 rules, emission standards, or requirements promulgated under section 112, for those affected sources permitted by the State under part 70 of this chapter. The State may not seek approval under this section for permit terms and conditions that implement and enforce part 68 requirements.
(a)
Up-front approval process.
(1) A State must submit a request that meets the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section. After receiving a
complete request for approval of a State program under this section and making a preliminary determination of equivalence, the Administrator will seek public comment for 21 days through a
Federal Register
notice. The Administrator will require that comments be submitted concurrently to the State.
(2) If, after review of all public comments, and State responses to comments submitted to the Administrator, the Administrator finds that the criteria of paragraph (b) of this section and the criteria of § 63.91 are met, the Administrator will approve the State program. The approved program will be published in the
Federal Register
and incorporated directly or by reference in the appropriate subpart of part 63.
(3) If the Administrator finds that any of the criteria of paragraph (b) of this section or § 63.91 have not been met, the Administrator will partially approve or disapprove the State program. For any partial approvals or disapprovals, the Administrator will provide the State with the basis for the partial approval or disapproval and what action the State can take to make the programs approvable.
(4) Within 90 days of receiving a complete request for approval under this section, the Administrator will either approve, partially approve, or disapprove the State request.
(b)
Criteria for up-front approval.
Any request for program approval under this section shall meet all of the criteria of this paragraph and § 63.91 before approval. The State shall provide the Administrator with:
(1)(i) To the extent possible, an identification of all specific sources in source categories listed pursuant to subsection 112(c) for which the State is seeking authority to implement and enforce alternative requirements under this section;
(ii) If the identified sources in any source category comprise a subset of the sources in that category within the State's jurisdiction, the State shall request delegation for the remainder of the sources in that category that are required to be permitted by the State under part 70 of this chapter. The State shall request delegation for the remainder of the sources in that category under another section of this subpart.
(iii) Prior to submitting a request for one or more sources within a source category, the State shall consult with their EPA Regional Office regarding the number of sources in a category eligible for submittal under this option. Based on the Regional Office's decision, the State shall limit the number of sources for which it submits permit requirements.
(2) To the extent possible, an identification of all existing and future section 112 emission standards for which the State is seeking authority under this section to implement and enforce alternative requirements.
(3) If, after approval of the initial list of source categories identified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the State adds source categories for approval under this option, the State shall submit an addendum to the up-front approval submission, and identify the addition to the lists. The Administrator will follow the process outlined in paragraph (a) of this section for up-front approval.
(4) A one-time demonstration that the State has an approved title V operating permit program and that the program permits the affected sources.
(c)
Approval process for alternative requirements.
(1) After promulgation of a Federal section 112 rule, emission standard, or requirement for which the State has up-front approval to implement and enforce alternative requirements in the form of title V permit terms and conditions, the State shall provide the Administrator with pre-draft title V permit terms and conditions that are sufficient, in the Administrator's judgement, to allow the Administrator to determine equivalency. The permit terms and conditions shall reflect all of the requirements of the otherwise applicable Federal section 112 rule, emission standard, or requirement.
(2) [Reserved]
(3) If, the Administrator receives a complete request and finds the pre-draft title V permit terms and conditions submitted by the State meet the criteria of paragraph (d), the Administrator will approve the State's alternative requirements (by approving the
pre-draft permit terms and conditions) and notify the State in writing of the approval.
(4) The Administrator may approve the State's alternative requirements on the condition that the State makes certain changes to the pre-draft title V permit terms and conditions and includes the changes in the complete pre-draft, proposed, and final title V permits for the affected sources. If the Administrator approves the alternative requirements on the condition that the State makes certain changes to them, the State shall make those changes or the alternative requirements will not be federally enforceable when they are included in the final permit, even if the Administrator does not object to the proposed permit. Until the Administrator affirmatively approves the State's alternative requirements (by approving the pre-draft permit terms and conditions) under this paragraph, and those requirements (permit terms) are incorporated into the final title V permit for any affected source, the otherwise applicable Federal emission standard(s) remain the federally enforceable and applicable requirements for that source.
(5) If, after evaluating the pre-draft title V permit terms and conditions that were submitted by the State, the Administrator finds that the criteria of paragraph (d) of this section have not been met, the Administrator will disapprove the State's alternative requirements and notify the State in writing of the disapproval. In the notice of disapproval, the Administrator will specify the deficient or nonapprovable elements of the State's alternative requirements.
(6) Within 90 days of receiving a complete request for approval under this paragraph, the Administrator will either approve, partially approve, or disapprove the State's alternative requirements.
(7) Nothing in this section precludes the State from submitting alternative requirements in the form of title V permit terms and conditions or title V general permit terms and conditions for approval under this paragraph at the same time the State submits its program to the Administrator for up-front approval under paragraph (a) of this section, provided that the Federal emission standards for which the State submits alternative requirements are promulgated at the time of the State's submittal. If the Administrator finds that the criteria of § 63.91 and the criteria of paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section are met, the Administrator will approve both the State program and the permit terms and conditions within 90 days of receiving a complete request for approval.
(d)
Approval criteria for alternative requirements.
Any request for approval under this paragraph shall meet the following criteria. Taken together, the criteria in this paragraph describe the minimum contents of a State's equivalency demonstration for a promulgated Federal section 112 rule, emission standard, or requirement. To be approvable, the State submittal must contain sufficient detail to allow the Administrator to make a determination of equivalency between the State's alternative requirements and the Federal requirements. Each submittal of alternative requirements in the form of pre-draft permit terms and conditions for an affected source shall:
(1) Identify the specific, practicably enforceable terms and conditions with which the source would be required to comply upon issuance, renewal, or revision of the title V permit. The State shall submit permit terms and conditions that reflect all of the requirements of the otherwise applicable Federal section 112 rule, emission standard, or requirement. The State shall identify for the Administrator the specific permit terms and conditions that contain alternative requirements.
(2) Identify specifically how the alternative requirements in the form of permit terms and conditions are the same as or differ from the requirements in the otherwise applicable Federal section 112 rule, emission standard, or requirement (including any applicable requirements in subpart A or other subparts or appendices). The State shall provide this identification in a side-by-side comparison of the State's requirements in the form of permit terms and conditions and the requirements of the Federal section 112 rule, emission standard, or requirement.
(3) The State shall provide the Administrator with detailed documentation that demonstrates that the alternative requirements meet the criteria specified in § 63.93(b), i.e., that the alternative requirements are at least as stringent as the otherwise applicable Federal requirements.
(e)
Incorporation of permit terms and conditions into title V permits.
(1) After approval of the State's alternative requirements under this section, the State shall incorporate the approved permit terms and conditions into title V permits for the affected sources. The State shall issue or revise the title V permits according to the provisions contained in § 70.7 of this chapter. The alternative permit terms and conditions may substitute for the Federal requirements once they are contained in a valid title V permit. If the State does not write the alternative conditions, exactly as approved, into the permit, EPA may reopen the permit for cause per § 70.7(g) of this chapter, and the delegation may not occur.
(2) In the notice of pre-draft permit availability, and in each pre-draft, proposed, and final permit, the State shall indicate prominently that the permit contains alternative section 112 requirements. In the notice of pre-draft permit availability, the State shall specifically solicit public comment on the alternative requirements. In addition, the State shall attach all documents supporting the approved equivalency determination for those alternative requirements to each pre-draft, proposed, and final permit.
[65 FR 55841, Sept. 14, 2000]
§ 63.95
Additional approval criteria for accidental release prevention programs.
(a) A State submission for approval of a part 68 program must meet the criteria and be in accordance with the procedures of this section, § 63.91, and, where appropriate, either § 63.92 or § 63.93.
(b) The State part 68 program application shall contain the following elements consistent with the procedures in § 63.91 and, where appropriate, either § 63.92 or § 63.93 of this subpart, for at least the chemicals listed in part 68 subpart F (“federally-listed chemicals”) that an approvable State Accidental Release Prevention program is regulating:
(1)(i) A demonstration of the State's authority and resources to implement and enforce regulations that are no less stringent than the regulations of part 68, subparts A through G and § 68.200 of this chapter; and
(ii) A requirement that any source subject to the State's part 68 program submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) that reports at least the same information in the same format as required under part 68, subpart G of this chapter.
(2) A State's RMP program may require reporting of information not required by the Federal program, and these requirements (like any other additional State requirements) will become federally enforceable upon approval. The extent to which EPA will be able to help a State collect and report additional information through EPA's electronic RMP submission system will be determined on a case-by-case basis.
(3) Procedures for reviewing risk management plans and providing technical assistance to stationary sources, including small businesses.
(4) A demonstration of the State's authority to enforce all part 68 requirements must be made, including an auditing strategy that complies with § 68.220 of this chapter.
(c) A State may request approval for a program that covers all of the federally-listed chemicals (a “complete program”) or a program covering less than all of the federally-listed chemicals (a “partial program”) as long as the State takes delegation of the full part 68 program for the federally-listed chemicals it regulates.
[65 FR 55843, Sept. 14, 2000]
§ 63.96
Review and withdrawal of approval.
(a)
Submission of information for review of approval.
(1) The Administrator may at any time request any of the following information to review the adequacy of implementation and enforcement of an approved rule or program and the State shall provide that information within 45 days of the Administrator's request:
(i) Copies of any State statutes, rules, regulations or other requirements that have amended, repealed or revised the approved State rule or program since approval or since the immediately previous EPA review;
(ii) Information to demonstrate adequate State enforcement and compliance monitoring activities with respect to all approved State rules and with all section 112 rules, emission standards or requirements;
(iii) Information to demonstrate adequate funding, staff, and other resources to implement and enforce the State's approved rule or program;
(iv) A schedule for implementing the State's approved rule or program that assures compliance with all section 112 rules and requirements that the EPA has promulgated since approval or since the immediately previous EPA review,
(v) A list of part 70 or other permits issued, amended, revised, or revoked since approval or since immediately previous EPA review, for sources subject to a State rule or program approved under this subpart.
(vi) A summary of enforcement actions by the State regarding violations of section 112 requirements, including but not limited to administrative orders and judicial and administrative complaints and settlements.
(2) Upon request by the Administrator, the State shall demonstrate that each State rule, emission standard or requirement applied to an individual source is no less stringent as applied than the otherwise applicable Federal rule, emission standard or requirement.
(b)
Withdrawal of approval of a state rule or program.
(1) If the Administrator has reason to believe that a State is not adequately implementing or enforcing an approved rule or program according to the criteria of this section or that an approved rule or program is not as stringent as the otherwise applicable Federal rule, emission standard or requirements, the Administrator will so inform the State in writing and will identify the reasons why the Administrator believes that the State's rule or program is not adequate. The State shall then initiate action to correct the deficiencies identified by the Administrator and shall inform the Administrator of the actions it has initiated and completed. If the Administrator determines that the State's actions are not adequate to correct the deficiencies, the Administrator will notify the State that the Administrator intends to withdraw approval and will hold a public hearing and seek public comment on the proposed withdrawal of approval. The Administrator will require that comments be submitted concurrently to the State. Upon notification of the intent to withdraw, the State will notify all sources subject to the relevant approved rule or program that withdrawal proceedings have been initiated.
(2) Based on any public comment received and any response to that comment by the State, the Administrator will notify the State of any changes in identified deficiencies or actions needed to correct identified deficiencies. If the State does not correct the identified deficiencies within 90 days after receiving revised notice of deficiencies, the Administrator shall withdraw approval of the State's rule or program upon a determination that:
(i) The State no longer has adequate authorities to assure compliance or re-sources to implement and enforce the approved rule or program, or
(ii) The State is not adequately implementing or enforcing the approved rule or program, or
(iii) An approved rule or program is not as stringent as the otherwise applicable Federal rule, emission standard or requirement.
(3) The Administrator may withdraw approval for part of a rule, for a rule, for part of a program, or for an entire program.
(4) Any State rule, program or portion of a State rule or program for which approval is withdrawn is no longer Federally enforceable. The Federal rule, emission standard or requirement that would have been applicable in the absence of approval under this will be the federally enforceable rule, emission standard or requirement.
(i) Upon withdrawal of approval, the Administrator will publish an expeditious schedule for sources subject to the previously approved State rule or program to come into compliance with
applicable Federal requirements. Such schedule shall include interim emission limits where appropriate. During this transition, sources must be operated in a manner consistent with good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions.
(ii) Upon withdrawal, the State shall reopen, under the provisions of § 70.7(f) of this chapter, the part 70 permit of each source subject to the previously approved rules or programs in order to assure compliance through the permit with the applicable requirements for each source.
(iii) If the Administrator withdraws approval of State rules applicable to sources that are not subject to part 70 permits, the applicable State rules are no longer Federally enforceable.
(iv) If the Administrator withdraws approval of a portion of a State rule or program, other approved portions of the State rule or program that are not withdrawn shall remain in effect.
(v) Any applicable Federal emission standard or requirement shall remain enforceable by the EPA as specified in section 112(l)(7) of the Act.
(5) If a rule approved under § 63.93 is withdrawn under the provisions of § 63.96(b)(2) (i) or (ii), and, at the time of withdrawal, the Administrator finds the rule to be no less stringent than the otherwise applicable Federal requirement, the Administrator will grant equivalency to the previously approved State rule under the appropriate provisions of this part.
(6) A State may submit a new rule, program or portion of a rule or program for approval after the Administrator has withdrawn approval of the State's rule, program or portion of a rule or program. The Administrator will determine whether the new rule or program or portion of a rule or program is approvable according to the criteria and procedures of § 63.91 and either of § 63.92, § 63.93 or § 63.94.
(7) A State may voluntarily withdraw from an approved State rule, program or portion of a rule or program by notifying the EPA and all affected sources subject to the rule or program and providing notice and opportunity for comment to the public within the State.
(i) Upon voluntary withdrawal by a State, the Administrator will publish a timetable for sources subject to the previously approved State rule or program to come into compliance with applicable Federal requirements.
(ii) Upon voluntary withdrawal, the State must reopen and revise the part 70 permits of all sources affected by the withdrawal as provided for in this section and § 70.7(f), and the Federal rule, emission standard, or requirement that would have been applicable in the absence of approval under this subpart will become the applicable requirement for the source.
(iii) Any applicable Federal section 112 rule, emission standard or requirement shall remain enforceable by the EPA as specified in section 112(l)(7) of the Act.
(iv) Voluntary withdrawal shall not be effective sooner than 180 days after the State notifies the EPA of its intent to voluntarily withdraw.
[65 FR 55843, Sept. 14, 2000]
§ 63.97
Approval of a State program that substitutes for section 112 requirements.
Under this section, a State may seek approval of a State program to be implemented and enforced in lieu of specified existing or future Federal emission standards or requirements promulgated under section 112. A State may not seek approval under this section for a program that implements and enforces part 68 requirements.
(a)
Up-front approval process.
(1) After receiving a complete request for approval of a State program submitted under paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section and making a preliminary determination on whether to approve it, the Administrator will seek public comment for 21 days through a
Federal Register
notice. At its discretion, the State may include in this submittal a request for approval of specific alternative requirements under paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
(2) [Reserved]
(3) The Administrator will require that comments be submitted concurrently to the State.
(4) If, after review of all public comments and State responses to comments submitted to the Administrator, the Administrator finds that the criteria of paragraph (b) of this section
and the criteria of § 63.91 are met, the Administrator will approve or partially approve the State program. The approved State program will be published in the
Federal Register
and incorporated, directly or by reference, in the appropriate subpart of part 63.
(5) If the Administrator finds that any of the criteria of paragraph (b) of this section or § 63.91 have not been met, the Administrator will partially approve or disapprove the State program.
(6) The Administrator will either approve, partially approve, or disapprove the State request:
(i) Within 90 days after receipt of a complete request for approval of a State program submitted under paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section; or
(ii) Within 180 days after receipt of a complete request for approval of a State program submitted under paragraphs (b)(1) or (b)(2) and paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
(b)
Criteria for up-front approval.
Any request for program approval under this section shall meet all of the criteria of this paragraph and § 63.91 before approval.
(1) For every request for program approval under this section, the State shall provide the Administrator, to the extent possible, with an identification of the initial specific source categories listed pursuant to section 112(c) and an identification of all existing and future section 112 emission standards or other requirements for which the State is seeking authority to implement and enforce alternative requirements under this section.
(2) If, after approval of the initial list of specific source categories identified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the State adds source categories for approval under this option, the State shall submit an addendum to the approval submission, and identify the addition to the list.
(3) In addition, the State may provide the Administrator with one or more of the following program elements for approval under this paragraph:
(i) Alternative requirements in State rules, regulations, or general permits (or other enforceable mechanisms) that apply generically to one or more categories of sources and for which the State seeks approval to implement and enforce in lieu of specific existing Federal section 112 emission standards or requirements. The Administrator may approve or disapprove the alternative requirements in these rules, regulations, or permits when approving or disapproving the State's up-front submittal under this paragraph. After approval of the alternative generic rules, regulations or general permits, and after new Federal emission standards or requirements are promulgated, the State may extend the applicability of approved generic alternative requirements to additional source categories by repeating the approval process specified in paragraph (a) of this section. To be approvable, any request for approval of generic alternative requirements during the up-front approval process shall meet the criteria in paragraph (d) of this section.
(ii) A description of the mechanisms that are enforceable as a matter of State law that the State will use to implement and enforce alternative requirements for area sources. The mechanisms that may be approved under this paragraph include title V permits, title V general permits, Federal new source review permits, board and administrative orders, permits issued pursuant to permit templates, state permits, and State rules that apply to categories of sources. The State shall demonstrate to the Administrator that the State has adequate resources and authorities to implement and enforce alternative section 112 requirements using the State mechanisms.
(c)
Approval process for alternative requirements.
(1) After promulgation of a Federal emission standard or requirement for which the State has program approval under this section to implement and enforce alternative requirements, the State shall provide the Administrator with alternative requirements that are sufficient, in the Administrator's judgement, to allow the Administrator to determine equivalency under paragraph (d) of this section. The alternative requirements shall reflect all of the requirements of the otherwise applicable Federal section 112 rule, emission standard, or requirement, including any alternative requirements that the State is seeking
to implement and enforce. Alternative requirements submitted for approval under this paragraph shall be contained in rules, regulations, general permits, or other mechanisms that apply to and are enforceable under State law for categories of sources. State policies are not approvable under this section unless they are incorporated into specific, enforceable, alternative requirements in rules, permits, or other mechanisms that apply to categories of sources.
(2) [Reserved]
(3) After receiving a complete request for approval under this section and making a preliminary determination on its equivalence, the Administrator will seek public comment for a minimum of 21 days through a
Federal Register
notice. The Administrator will require that comments be submitted concurrently to the State.
(4) If, after review of public comments and any State responses to comments submitted to the Administrator, the Administrator finds that the criteria of paragraph (d) of this section and the criteria of § 63.91 are met, the Administrator will approve the State's alternative requirements. The approved alternative requirements will be published in the
Federal Register
and incorporated, directly or by reference, in the appropriate subpart of part 63.
(5) If the Administrator finds that any of the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section or § 63.91 have not been met, the Administrator will partially approve or disapprove the State's alternative requirements. For any partial approvals or disapprovals, the Administrator will provide the State with the basis for the partial approval or disapproval and what action the State can take to make the alternative requirements approvable.
(6) Within 180 days of receiving a complete request for approval under this paragraph, the Administrator will either approve, partially approve, or disapprove the State request.
(7) Nothing in this section precludes the State from submitting alternative requirements for approval under this paragraph at the same time the State submits its program to the Administrator for up-front approval under paragraph (a) of this section, provided that the Federal rules, emission standards, or requirements for which the State submits alternative requirements are promulgated at the time of the State's submittal. If the Administrator finds that the criteria of § 63.91 and the criteria of paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section are met, the Administrator will approve both the State program and the alternative requirements within 180 days of receiving a complete request for approval. Alternatively, following up-front approval, the State may submit alternative requirements for approval under this paragraph at any time after promulgation of the Federal emission standards or requirements.
(d)
Approval criteria for alternative requirements.
Any request for approval under this paragraph shall meet the following criteria. Taken together, the criteria in this paragraph describe the minimum contents of a State's equivalency demonstration for a promulgated Federal section 112 rule, emission standard, or requirement. To be approvable, the State submittal must contain sufficient detail to allow the Administrator to make a determination of equivalency between the State's alternative requirements and the Federal requirements. Each submittal of alternative requirements for a category of sources shall:
(1) Include copies of all State rules, regulations, permits, or other enforceable mechanisms that contain the alternative requirements for which the State is seeking approval. These documents shall also contain requirements that reflect all of the requirements of the otherwise applicable Federal section 112 rules, emission standards or requirements for which the State is not submitting alternatives. The State shall identify for the Administrator the specific requirements with which sources in a source category are required to comply, including the specific alternative requirements.
(2) Identify specifically how the alternative requirements are the same as or differ from the requirements in the otherwise applicable Federal rule, emission standards, or requirements (including any applicable requirements
in subpart A or other subparts or appendices). The State shall provide this identification in a side-by-side comparison of the State's requirements and the requirements of the Federal rule, emission standards, or requirements.
(3) The State shall provide the Administrator with detailed documentation that demonstrates the State's belief that the alternative requirements meet the criteria specified in § 63.93(b) of this subpart, i.e., that the alternative requirements are at least as stringent as the otherwise applicable Federal requirements.

California Regulatory Requirements Applicable to the Air Toxics Program
(California Code of Regulations Title 17, sections 93109, 93109.1, and 93109.2) pertains to the perchloroethylene dry cleaning source category in the State of California, and has been approved under the procedures in § 63.93 to be implemented and enforced in place of subpart M—National Perchloroethylene Air Emission Standards for Dry Cleaning Facilities, as it applies to area sources only, as defined in § 63.320(h).
(
1
) Authorities not delegated.
(
i
) California is not delegated the Administrator's authority to implement and enforce California Code of Regulations Title 17, section 93109, in lieu of those provisions of subpart M which apply to major sources, as defined in § 63.320(g). Dry cleaning facilities which are major sources remain subject to subpart M.
(
ii
) California is not delegated the Administrator's authority of § 63.325 to determine equivalency of emissions control technologies. Any source seeking permission to use an alternative means of emission limitation, under sections 93109(d)(27) or (38), or (i)(3)(A)(2), Title 17 of the California Code of Regulations, must also receive approval from the Administrator before using such alternative means of emission limitation for the purpose of complying with section 112 of the Clean Air Act.
(
iii
) This delegation does not extend to the provisions regarding California's enforcement authorities or its collection of fees as described in Sections 93109.1(c) or 93109.2(c) and (d), Title 17 of the California Code of Regulations. Approval of the California Code of Regulations, Title 17, sections 93109, 93109.1, and 93109.2 does not in any way limit the enforcement authorities, including the penalty authorities, of the Clean Air Act.
(B) [Reserved]
(C) The material incorporated in Chapter 3 of the California Regulatory Requirements Applicable to the Air Toxics Program (South Coast Air Quality Management District Rule 1421) pertains to the perchloroethylene dry cleaning source category in the South Coast Air Quality Management District, and has been approved under the

(i) Maryland is delegated the authority to implement and enforce all existing and future unchanged 40 CFR part 63 standards at major sources, as defined in 40 CFR part 70, in accordance with the delegation agreement between EPA Region III and the Maryland Department of the Environment, dated November 3, 1999, and any mutually acceptable amendments to that agreement.
(ii) Maryland is delegated the authority to implement and enforce all existing 40 CFR part 63 standards and all future unchanged 40 CFR part 63 standards, if delegation is sought by the Maryland Department of the Environment and approved by EPA Region III, at affected sources which are not located at major sources, as defined in 40 CFR part 70, in accordance with the final rule, dated January 30, 2002, effective April 1, 2002, and any mutually acceptable amendments to the terms described in the direct final rule.
(iii) EPA has granted the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) “up-front” approval to implement an Equivalency by Permit (EBP) program under which the MDE may establish and enforce alternative State requirements for MeadWestvaco Company's Luke Mill in lieu of those of the National Emissions Standard for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) for Chemical Recovery Combustion Sources at Kraft, Soda, Sulfite, and Stand-Alone Semichemical Pulp Mills found at 40 CFR part 63, subpart MM. The MDE may only establish alternative requirements for the Luke Mill which are equivalent to and at least as stringent as the otherwise applicable Federal requirements. The MDE must, in order to establish alternative requirements for the Luke Mill under its EPA approved EBP program: submit to EPA for review pre-draft Clean Air Act (CAA) Title V permit terms specifying alternative requirements which are at least as stringent as the otherwise applicable Federal requirements, obtain EPA's written approval of the alternative pre-draft CAA Title V permit requirements, and issue a CAA Title V permit for the Luke Mill which contains the approved alternative requirements. Until EPA has approved the alternative permit terms and conditions and the MDE has issued a final CAA Title V permit incorporating them, MeadWestvaco Company's Luke Mill will remain subject to the Federal NESHAP requirements found at 40 CFR part 63, subpart MM.

§ 63.100
Applicability and designation of source.
(a) This subpart provides applicability provisions, definitions, and other general provisions that are applicable to subparts G and H of this part. This subpart also provides requirements for certain heat exchange systems, maintenance wastewater, and flares.
(b) Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(4) and (c) of this section, the provisions of subparts F, G, and H of this part apply to chemical manufacturing process units that meet all the criteria specified in paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3) of this section:
(1) Manufacture as a primary product one or more of the chemicals listed in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) or (b)(1)(ii) of this section.
(i) One or more of the chemicals listed in table 1 of this subpart; or
(ii) One or more of the chemicals listed in paragraphs (b)(1)(ii)(A) or (b)(1)(ii)(B) of this section:
(A) Tetrahydrobenzaldehyde (CAS Number 100-50-5); or
(B) Crotonaldehyde (CAS Number 123-73-9).
(2) Use as a reactant or manufacture as a product, or co-product, one or more of the organic hazardous air pollutants listed in table 2 of this subpart;
(3) Are located at a plant site that is a major source as defined in section 112(a) of the Act.
(4) The owner or operator of a chemical manufacturing processing unit is exempt from all requirements of subparts F, G, and H of this part until not later than April 22, 1997 if the owner or operator certifies, in a notification to the appropriate EPA Regional Office, not later than May 14, 1996, that the plant site at which the chemical manufacturing processing unit is located emits, and will continue to emit, during any 12-month period, less than 10
tons per year of any individual hazardous air pollutants (HAP), and less than 25 tons per year of any combination of HAP.
(i) If such a determination is based on limitations and conditions that are not federally enforceable (as defined in subpart A of this part), the owner or operator shall document the basis for the determination as specified in paragraphs (b)(4)(i)(A) through (b)(4)(i)(C) and comply with the recordkeeping requirement in 63.103(f).
(A) The owner or operator shall identify all HAP emission points at the plant site, including those emission points subject to and emission points not subject to subparts F, G, and H;
(B) The owner or operator shall calculate the amount of annual HAP emissions released from each emission point at the plant site, using acceptable measurement or estimating techniques for maximum expected operating conditions at the plant site. Examples of estimating procedures that are considered acceptable include the calculation procedures in § 63.150 of subpart G, the early reduction demonstration procedures specified in §§ 63.74 (c)(2), (c)(3), (d)(2), (d)(3), and (g), or accepted engineering practices. If the total annual HAP emissions for the plant site are annually reported under Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) section 313, then such reported annual emissions may be used to satisfy the requirements of § 63.100(b)(4)(i)(B).
(C) The owner or operator shall sum the amount of annual HAP emissions from all emission points on the plant site. If the total emissions of any one HAP are less than 10 tons per year and the total emissions of any combination of HAP are less than 25 tons per year, the plant site qualifies for the exemption described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, provided that emissions are kept below these thresholds.
(ii) If such a determination is based on limitations and conditions that are federally enforceable (as defined in subpart A of this part), the owner or operator is not subject to the provisions of paragraph (b)(4) of this section.
(c) The owner or operator of a chemical manufacturing process unit that meets the criteria specified in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(3) of this section but does not use as a reactant or manufacture as a product or co-product, any organic hazardous air pollutant listed in table 2 of this subpart shall comply only with the requirements of § 63.103(e) of this subpart. To comply with this subpart, such chemical manufacturing process units shall not be required to comply with the provisions of subpart A of this part.
(d) The primary product of a chemical manufacturing process unit shall be determined according to the procedures specified in paragraphs (d)(1), (d)(2), (d)(3), and (d)(4) of this section.

The exemption for “vessels storing organic liquids that contain organic hazardous air pollutants only as impurities” listed in the definition of “storage vessel” in this section does not apply for storage vessels that may be in ethylene oxide service. Examples of information that could suggest ethylene oxide could be present in a storage vessel, include calculations based on safety data sheets, material balances, process stoichiometry, or previous test results provided the results are still relevant to the current operating conditions.
(v) For wastewater streams, any wastewater stream that contains total annual average concentration of ethylene oxide greater than or equal to 1 parts per million by weight at any flow rate. If knowledge exists that suggests ethylene oxide could be present in a wastewater stream, then the wastewater stream is considered to be “in ethylene oxide service” unless sampling and analysis is performed as specified in § 63.109 to demonstrate that the wastewater stream does not meet the definition of being “in ethylene oxide service”.

An unscheduled work practice or operational procedure that stops production from a process unit or part of a process unit for less than 24 hours is not a process unit shutdown. An unscheduled work practice or operational procedure that would stop production from a process unit or part of a process unit for a shorter period of time than would be required to clear the process unit or part of the process unit of materials and start up the unit, and would result in greater emissions than delay of repair of leaking components until the next scheduled process unit shutdown, is not a process unit shutdown. The use of spare equipment and technically feasible bypassing of equipment without stopping production are not process unit shutdowns.

§ 63.102
General standards.
(a) Except as specified in paragraph (e) of this section, owners and operators of sources subject to this subpart shall comply with the requirements of subparts G and H of this part as specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section.
(1) The provisions set forth in this subpart and subpart G of this part shall apply at all times except during periods of start-up or shutdown (as defined in § 63.101 of this subpart), malfunction, or non-operation of the chemical manufacturing process unit (or specific portion thereof) resulting in cessation of the emissions to which this subpart and subpart G of this part apply. However, if a start-up, shutdown, malfunction or period of non-operation of one portion of a chemical manufacturing process unit does not affect the ability of a particular emission point to comply with the specific provisions to which it is subject, then that emission point shall still be required to comply with the applicable provisions of this subpart and subpart G of this part during the start-up, shutdown, malfunction or period of non-operation. For example, if there is an overpressure in the reactor area, a storage vessel in the chemical manufacturing process unit would still be required to be controlled
in accordance with § 63.119. Similarly, the degassing of a storage vessel would not affect the ability of a process vent to meet the requirements of § 63.113.
(2) The provisions set forth in subpart H of this part shall apply at all times except during periods of start-up or shutdown, malfunction, or process unit shutdown (as defined in § 63.101(b)), or non-operation of the chemical manufacturing process unit (or specific portion thereof) in which the lines are drained and depressurized resulting in cessation of the emissions to which subpart H of this part applies.
(3) The owner or operator shall not shut down items of equipment that are required or utilized for compliance with the provisions of this subpart or subpart G or H of this part during times when emissions (or, where applicable, wastewater streams or residuals) are being routed to such items of equipment, if the shutdown would contravene requirements of this subpart or subpart G or H of this part applicable to such items of equipment. This paragraph does not apply if the item of equipment is malfunctioning, or if the owner or operator must shut down the equipment to avoid damage due to a contemporaneous start-up, shutdown, or malfunction of the chemical manufacturing process unit or portion thereof.
(4) During start-ups, shutdowns, and malfunctions when the requirements of this subpart and subparts G and/or H of this part do not apply pursuant to paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section, the owner or operator shall implement, to the extent reasonably available, measures to prevent or minimize excess emissions to the extent practical. The general duty to minimize emissions during a period of startup, shutdown, or malfunction does not require the owner or operator to achieve emission levels that would be required by the applicable standard at other times if this is not consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices, nor does it require the owner or operator to make any further efforts to reduce emissions if levels required by the applicable standard have been achieved. Determination of whether such operation and maintenance procedures are being used will be based on information available to the Administrator which may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operation and maintenance procedures (including the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan required in § 63.6(e)(3)), review of operation and maintenance records, and inspection of the source. The measures to be taken may include, but are not limited to, air pollution control technologies, recovery technologies, work practices, pollution prevention, monitoring, and/or changes in the manner of operation of the source. Back-up control devices are not required but may be used if available.
(b) If, in the judgment of the Administrator, an alternative means of emission limitation will achieve a reduction in organic HAP emissions at least equivalent to the reduction in organic HAP emissions from that source achieved under any design, equipment, work practice, or operational standards in subpart G or H of this part, the Administrator will publish in the
Federal Register
a notice permitting the use of the alternative means for purposes of compliance with that requirement.
(1) The notice may condition the permission on requirements related to the operation and maintenance of the alternative means.
(2) Any notice under this paragraph (b) shall be published only after public notice and an opportunity for a hearing.
(3) Any person seeking permission to use an alternative means of compliance under this section shall collect, verify, and submit to the Administrator information showing that the alternative means achieves equivalent emission reductions.
(c) Each owner or operator of a source subject to this subpart shall obtain a permit under 40 CFR part 70 or part 71 from the appropriate permitting authority by the date determined by 40 CFR part 70 or part 71, as appropriate.
(1) If the EPA has approved a State operating permit program under 40 CFR part 70, the permit shall be obtained from the State authority. If the State operating permit program has
not been approved, the source shall apply to the EPA Regional Office.
(2) [Reserved]
(d) The requirements in this subpart and subparts G and H of this part are federally enforceable under section 112 of the Act on and after the dates specified in § 63.100(k) of this subpart.
(e) For each source as defined in § 63.101, beginning no later than the compliance dates specified in § 63.100(k)(10), paragraph (a) of this section does not apply. Instead, owners and operators of sources as defined in § 63.101 shall comply with the requirements in this subpart and subparts G and H of this part at all times, except during periods of nonoperation of the source (or specific portion thereof) resulting in cessation of the emissions to which this subpart or subpart G or H of this part applies.
(f) For each source as defined in § 63.101, beginning no later than the compliance dates specified in § 63.100(k)(10), at all times, owners and operators must operate and maintain any source, including associated air pollution control equipment and monitoring equipment, in a manner consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions. The general duty to minimize emissions does not require owners and operators to make any further efforts to reduce emissions if levels required by the applicable standard have been achieved. Determination of whether a source is operating in compliance with operation and maintenance requirements will be based on information available to the Administrator which may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operation and maintenance procedures, review of operation and maintenance records, and inspection of the source.
[89 FR 43163, May 16, 2024]
§ 63.103
General compliance, reporting, and recordkeeping provisions.
(a) Table 3 of this subpart specifies the provisions of subpart A that apply and those that do not apply to owners and operators of sources subject to subparts F, G, and H of this part.
(b) Performance tests and initial compliance determinations shall be required only as specified in subparts G and H of this part.
(1) Initial performance tests and compliance determinations shall be conducted according to the schedule and procedures in § 63.7(a) and the applicable sections of subparts G and H of this part. Beginning no later than the compliance dates specified in § 63.100(k)(10), except as outlined in subpart H of this part, conduct subsequent performance tests no later than 60 calendar months after the previous performance test.
(2) The owner or operator shall notify the Administrator of the intention to conduct a performance test at least 30 calendar days before the performance test is scheduled to allow the Administrator the opportunity to have an observer present during the test.
(3) Performance tests shall be conducted as specified in paragraph (b)(3)(i) or (ii) of this section.(i) Except as specified in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, performance tests shall be conducted according to the provisions of § 63.7(e), except that performance tests shall be conducted at maximum representative operating conditions for the process. During the performance test, an owner or operator may operate the control or recovery device at maximum or minimum representative operating conditions for monitored control or recovery device parameters, whichever results in lower emission reduction.
(ii) For each source as defined in § 63.101, beginning no later than the compliance dates specified in § 63.100(k)(10), paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section no longer applies and instead the owner or operator may not conduct performance tests during periods of malfunction. Owners and operators must record the process information that is necessary to document operating conditions during the test and include in such record an explanation to support that such conditions represent normal operation. Upon request, owners and operators must make available to the Administrator such records as may be necessary to determine the conditions of performance tests.
(4) Data shall be reduced in accordance with the EPA-approved methods specified in the applicable subpart or,
if other test methods are used, the data and methods shall be validated according to the protocol in Method 301 of appendix A of this part.
(5) Performance tests may be waived with approval of the Administrator as specified in § 63.7(h)(2) of subpart A of this part. Owners or operators of sources subject to subparts F, G, and H of this part who apply for a waiver of a performance test shall submit the application by the dates specified in paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section rather than the dates specified in § 63.7(h)(3) of subpart A of this part.
(i) If a request is made for an extension of compliance under § 63.151(a)(6) of subpart G or § 63.6(i) of subpart A of this part, the application for a waiver of an initial performance test shall accompany the information required for the request for an extension of compliance. If no extension of compliance is requested, the application for a waiver of an initial performance test shall be submitted no later than 90 calendar days before the Notification of Compliance Status required in § 63.152(b) of subpart G of this part is due to be submitted.
(ii) Any application for a waiver of a performance test shall include information justifying the owner or operator's request for a waiver, such as the technical or economic infeasibility, or the impracticality, of the source performing the required test.
(6) The owner or operator of a flexible operation unit shall conduct all required compliance demonstrations during production of the primary product. The owner or operator is not required to conduct compliance demonstrations for operating conditions during production of a product other than the primary product. Except as otherwise provided in this subpart or in subpart G or subpart H of this part, as applicable, the owner or operator shall operate each control device, recovery device, and/or recapture device that is required or used for compliance, and associated monitoring systems, without regard for whether the product that is being produced is the primary product or a different product. Except as otherwise provided in this subpart, subpart G and/or subpart H of this part, as applicable, operation of a control device, recapture device and/or recovery device required or used for compliance such that the daily average of monitored parameter values is outside the parameter range established pursuant to § 63.152(b)(2), or such that the monitoring data show operation inconsistent with the monitoring plan established pursuant to § 63.120(d)(2) or § 63.181(g)(1)(iv), shall constitute a violation of the required operating conditions.
(c) Each owner or operator of a source subject to subparts F, G, and H of this part shall keep copies of all applicable reports and records required by subparts F, G, and H of this part for at least 5 years; except that, if subparts G or H require records to be maintained for a time period different than 5 years, those records shall be maintained for the time specified in subpart G or H of this part. If an owner or operator submits copies of reports to the applicable EPA Regional Office, the owner or operator is not required to maintain copies of reports. If the EPA Regional Office has waived the requirement of § 63.10(a)(4)(ii) for submittal of copies of reports, the owner or operator is not required to maintain copies of reports.
(1) All applicable records shall be maintained in such a manner that they can be readily accessed. The most recent 6 months of records shall be retained on site or shall be accessible from a central location by computer or other means that provides access within 2 hours after a request. The remaining four and one-half years of records may be retained offsite. Records may be maintained in hard copy or computer-readable form including, but not limited to, on paper, microfilm, computer, floppy disk, magnetic tape, or microfiche.
(2) The owner or operator subject to subparts F, G, and H of this part shall keep the records specified in this paragraph, as well as records specified in subparts G and H.
(i) Records of the occurrence and duration of each start-up, shutdown, and malfunction of operation of process equipment or of air pollution control equipment or continuous monitoring systems used to comply with this subpart or subpart G or H of this part during which excess emissions (as defined
in § 63.102(a)(4)) occur. For each source as defined in § 63.101, on and after July 15, 2027, this paragraph (c)(2)(i) no longer applies; however, for historical compliance purposes, a copy of these records must be retained and available on-site for at least five years after the date of occurrence.
(ii) For each start-up, shutdown, and malfunction during which excess emissions (as defined in § 63.102(a)(4)) occur, records that the procedures specified in the source's start-up, shutdown, and malfunction plan were followed, and documentation of actions taken that are not consistent with the plan. For example, if a start-up, shutdown, and malfunction plan includes procedures for routing a control device to a backup control device (
e.g.,
the incinerator for a halogenated stream could be routed to a flare during periods when the primary control device is out of service), records must be kept of whether the plan was followed. These records may take the form of a “checklist,” or other form of recordkeeping that confirms conformance with the start-up, shutdown, and malfunction plan for the event. For each source as defined in § 63.101, on and after July 15, 2027, this paragraph (c)(2)(ii) no longer applies; however, for historical compliance purposes, a copy of the plan and these records must be retained and available on-site for 5 years after July 15, 2027.
(iii) For continuous monitoring systems used to comply with subpart G of this part, records documenting the completion of calibration checks and maintenance of continuous monitoring systems that are specified in the manufacturer's instructions or other written procedures that provide adequate assurance that the equipment would reasonably be expected to monitor accurately.inning no later than the compliance dates specified in § 63.100(k)(10), the manufacturer's specifications specified in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section must include a schedule for calibrations, preventative maintenance procedures, a schedule for preventative maintenance, and corrective actions to be taken if a calibration fails. If a continuous monitoring system calibration fails, the continuous monitoring system is considered to be inoperative until the owner or operator takes corrective action and the system passes calibration. The owner or operator must record the nature and cause of instances when the continuous monitoring system is inoperative and the corrective action taken.
(3) Records of start-up, shutdown and malfunction and continuous monitoring system calibration and maintenance are not required if they pertain solely to Group 2 emission points, as defined in § 63.101, that are not included in an emissions average. For each source as defined in § 63.101, on and after July 15, 2027, the phrase “start-up, shutdown and malfunction and” in this paragraph (c)(3) no longer applies.
(d) Unless required to be submitted electronically via the EPA's CEDRI, all reports required under this subpart and subparts G and H of this part must be sent to the Administrator at the addresses listed in § 63.13, except that requests for permission to use an alternative means of compliance as provided for in § 63.102(b) of this subpart and application for approval of a nominal efficiency as provided for in § 63.150 (i)(1) through (6) must be submitted to the Director of the EPA Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards rather than to the Administrator or delegated authority.
(1) Wherever subpart A of this part specifies “postmark” dates, submittals may be sent by methods other than the U.S. Mail (
e.g.,
by fax or courier). Submittals shall be sent on or before the specified date.
(2) If acceptable to both the Administrator and the owner or operator of a source, reports may be submitted on electronic media.
(e) The owner or operator of a chemical manufacturing process unit which meets the criteria of § 63.100(b)(1) and (3), but not the criteria of § 63.100(b)(2), shall comply with the requirements of either paragraph (e)(1) or (2) of this section.
(1) Retain information, data, and analysis used to determine that the chemical manufacturing process unit does not use as a reactant or manufacture as a product or co-product any organic hazardous air pollutant. Examples of information that could document this include, but are not limited
to, records of chemicals purchased for the process, analyses of process stream composition, engineering calculations, or process knowledge.
(2) When requested by the Administrator, demonstrate that the chemical manufacturing process unit does not use as a reactant or manufacture as a product or co-product any organic hazardous air pollutant.
(f) To qualify for the exemption specified in § 63.100(b)(4), the owner or operator shall maintain the documentation of the information required pursuant to § 63.100(b)(4)(i), and documentation of any update of this information requested by the EPA Regional Office, and shall provide the documentation to the EPA Regional Office upon request. The EPA Regional Office will notify the owner or operator, after reviewing such documentation, if the source does not qualify for the exemption specified in § 63.100(b)(4). In such cases, compliance with subpart H shall be required no later than 90 days after expiration of the applicable compliance date in § 63.100(k)(3), but in no event earlier than 90 days after the date of such notification by the EPA Regional Office.

§ 63.104
Heat exchange system requirements.
(a) Unless one or more of the conditions specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (6) or paragraph (l) of this section are met, owners and operators of sources subject to this subpart shall monitor each heat exchange system used to cool process equipment in a chemical manufacturing process unit meeting the conditions of § 63.100(b)(1) through (3), except for chemical manufacturing process units meeting the condition specified in § 63.100(c), according to the provisions in either paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, and if applicable, paragraph (g) of this section. Whenever a leak is detected, the owner or operator shall comply with the requirements in paragraph (d) of this section, and if applicable, paragraphs (h) through (j) of this section. Owners and operators of heat exchange systems in a chemical manufacturing process unit meeting the conditions of § 63.100(b)(1) through (3) must also comply with paragraph (k) of this section.
(1) The heat exchange system is operated with the minimum pressure on the cooling water side at least 35 kilopascals greater than the maximum pressure on the process side.
(2) There is an intervening cooling fluid, containing less than 5 percent by weight of total hazardous air pollutants listed in table 4 of this subpart, between the process and the cooling water. This intervening fluid serves to isolate the cooling water from the process fluid and the intervening fluid is not sent through a cooling tower or discharged. For purposes of this section, discharge does not include emptying for maintenance purposes.
(3) The once-through heat exchange system is subject to a National Pollution Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES) permit with an allowable discharge limit of 1 part per million or less above influent concentration or 10 percent or less above influent concentration, whichever is greater. For each source as defined in § 63.101, beginning no later than the compliance dates specified in § 63.100(k)(10), this paragraph (a)(3) no longer applies.
(4) Except as specified in paragraph (a)(4)(v) of this section, the once-through heat exchange system is subject to an NPDES permit that:
(i) Requires monitoring of a parameter(s) or condition(s) to detect a leak of process fluids into cooling water;
(ii) Specifies or includes the normal range of the parameter or condition;
(iii) Requires monitoring for the parameters selected as leak indicators no less frequently than monthly for the first six months and quarterly thereafter; and
(iv) Requires the owner or operator to report and correct leaks to the cooling water when the parameter or condition exceeds the normal range.
(v) For each source as defined in § 63.101, beginning no later than the compliance dates specified in § 63.100(k)(10), this paragraph (a)(4) no longer applies.
(b) The owner or operator who elects to comply with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section by monitoring the cooling water for the presence of one or more organic hazardous air pollutants or other representative substances whose presence in cooling water indicates a leak shall comply with the requirements specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(6) of this section. The cooling water shall be monitored for total hazardous air pollutants, total volatile organic compounds, total organic carbon, one or more speciated HAP compounds, or other representative substances that would indicate the presence of a leak in the heat exchange system.
(1) The cooling water shall be monitored monthly for the first 6 months and quarterly thereafter to detect leaks.
(2)(i) For recirculating heat exchange systems (cooling tower systems), the monitoring of speciated hazardous air pollutants or total hazardous air pollutants refers to the hazardous air pollutants listed in table 4 of this subpart.
(ii) For once-through heat exchange systems, the monitoring of speciated hazardous air pollutants or total hazardous air pollutants refers to the hazardous air pollutants listed in table 9 of subpart G of this part.
(3) The concentration of the monitored substance(s) in the cooling water shall be determined using any EPA-approved method listed in part 136 of this chapter as long as the method is sensitive to concentrations as low as 10 parts per million and the same method is used for both entrance and exit samples. Alternative methods may be used upon approval by the Administrator.
(4) The samples shall be collected either at the entrance and exit of each heat exchange system or at locations where the cooling water enters and exits each heat exchanger or any combination of heat exchangers.
(i) For samples taken at the entrance and exit of recirculating heat exchange systems, the entrance is the point at which the cooling water leaves the cooling tower prior to being returned to the process equipment and the exit is the point at which the cooling water is introduced to the cooling tower after being used to cool the process fluid.
(ii) For samples taken at the entrance and exit of once-through heat exchange systems, the entrance is the point at which the cooling water enters and the exit is the point at which the cooling water exits the plant site or chemical manufacturing process units.
(iii) For samples taken at the entrance and exit of each heat exchanger or any combination of heat exchangers in chemical manufacturing process units, the entrance is the point at which the cooling water enters the individual heat exchanger or group of heat exchangers and the exit is the point at which the cooling water exits the heat exchanger or group of heat exchangers.
(5) A minimum of three sets of samples shall be taken at each entrance and exit as defined in paragraph (b)(4) of this section. The average entrance and exit concentrations shall then be calculated. The concentration shall be
corrected for the addition of any makeup water or for any evaporative losses, as applicable.
(6) A leak is detected if the exit mean concentration is found to be greater than the entrance mean using a one-sided statistical procedure at the 0.05 level of significance and the amount by which it is greater is at least 1 part per million or 10 percent of the entrance mean, whichever is greater.
(c) The owner or operator who elects to comply with the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section by monitoring using a surrogate indicator of heat exchange system leaks shall comply with the requirements specified in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(3) of this section. Surrogate indicators that could be used to develop an acceptable monitoring program are ion specific electrode monitoring, pH, conductivity or other representative indicators.
(1) The owner or operator shall prepare and implement a monitoring plan that documents the procedures that will be used to detect leaks of process fluids into cooling water. The plan shall require monitoring of one or more surrogate indicators or monitoring of one or more process parameters or other conditions that indicate a leak. Monitoring that is already being conducted for other purposes may be used to satisfy the requirements of this section. The plan shall include the information specified in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (c)(1)(ii) of this section.
(i) A description of the parameter or condition to be monitored and an explanation of how the selected parameter or condition will reliably indicate the presence of a leak.
(ii) The parameter level(s) or conditions(s) that shall constitute a leak. This shall be documented by data or calculations showing that the selected levels or conditions will reliably identify leaks. The monitoring must be sufficiently sensitive to determine the range of parameter levels or conditions when the system is not leaking. When the selected parameter level or condition is outside that range, a leak is indicated.
(iii) The monitoring frequency which shall be no less frequent than monthly for the first 6 months and quarterly thereafter to detect leaks.
(iv) The records that will be maintained to document compliance with the requirements of this section.
(2) If a substantial leak is identified by methods other than those described in the monitoring plan and the method(s) specified in the plan could not detect the leak, the owner or operator shall revise the plan and document the basis for the changes. The owner or operator shall complete the revisions to the plan no later than 180 days after discovery of the leak.
(3) The owner or operator shall maintain, at all times, the monitoring plan that is currently in use. The current plan shall be maintained on-site, or shall be accessible from a central location by computer or other means that provides access within 2 hours after a request. If the monitoring plan is superseded, the owner or operator shall retain the most recent superseded plan at least until 5 years from the date of its creation. The superseded plan shall be retained on-site (or accessible from a central location by computer or other means that provides access within two hours after a request) for at least 6 months after its creation.
(d) If a leak is detected according to the criteria of paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, the owner or operator shall comply with the requirements in paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section, except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section.
(1) The leak shall be repaired as soon as practical but not later than 45 calendar days after the owner or operator receives results of monitoring tests indicating a leak. The leak shall be repaired unless the owner or operator demonstrates that the results are due to a condition other than a leak.
(2) Once the leak has been repaired, the owner or operator shall confirm that the heat exchange system has been repaired within 7 calendar days of the repair or startup, whichever is later.
(e) Delay of repair of heat exchange systems for which leaks have been detected is allowed if the equipment is isolated from the process. Delay of repair is also allowed if repair is technically infeasible without a shutdown and any one of the conditions in paragraph (e)(1) or (e)(2) of this section is
met. All time periods in paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this section shall be determined from the date when the owner or operator determines that delay of repair is necessary.
(1) If a shutdown is expected within the next 2 months, a special shutdown before that planned shutdown is not required.
(2) If a shutdown is not expected within the next 2 months, the owner or operator may delay repair as provided in paragraph (e)(2)(i) or (e)(2)(ii) of this section. Documentation of a decision to delay repair shall state the reasons repair was delayed and shall specify a schedule for completing the repair as soon as practical.
(i) If a shutdown for repair would cause greater emissions than the potential emissions from delaying repair, the owner or operator may delay repair until the next shutdown of the process equipment associated with the leaking heat exchanger. The owner or operator shall document the basis for the determination that a shutdown for repair would cause greater emissions than the emissions likely to result from delaying repair as specified in paragraphs (e)(2)(i)(A) and (e)(2)(i)(B) of this section.
(A) The owner or operator shall calculate the potential emissions from the leaking heat exchanger by multiplying the concentration of total hazardous air pollutants listed in table 4 of this subpart in the cooling water from the leaking heat exchanger by the flowrate of the cooling water from the leaking heat exchanger by the expected duration of the delay. The owner or operator may calculate potential emissions using total organic carbon concentration instead of total hazardous air pollutants listed in table 4 of this subpart.
(B) The owner or operator shall determine emissions from purging and depressurizing the equipment that will result from the unscheduled shutdown for the repair.
(ii) If repair is delayed for reasons other than those specified in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, the owner or operator may delay repair up to a maximum of 120 calendar days. The owner shall demonstrate that the necessary parts or personnel were not available.
(f)(1)

If the leak remains unrepaired, the information shall also be submitted in each subsequent periodic report, until repair of the leak is reported. In addition, if an owner or operator is complying with paragraph (g) or (l) of this section, then the semi-annual periodic report must include the information specified in paragraph (f)(2)(vi) of this section.
(i) The owner or operator shall report the presence of the leak by identifying the heat exchange system and the date that the leak was detected.
(ii) The owner or operator shall report whether or not the leak has been repaired.
(iii) The owner or operator shall report the reason(s) for delay of repair. If delay of repair is invoked due to the reasons described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, documentation of emissions estimates must also be submitted.
(iv) If the leak remains unrepaired, the owner or operator shall report the expected date of repair.
(v) If the leak is repaired, the owner or operator shall report the date the leak was successfully repaired.

(B) The number of heat exchange systems subject to the monitoring requirements in paragraph (g) or (l) of this section at the plant site found to be leaking during the reporting period.
(C) For each monitoring location where a leak was identified during the reporting period, identification of the monitoring location (

(D) For leaks that were repaired during the reporting period (including delayed repairs), identification of the monitoring location associated with the repaired leak, the total strippable hydrocarbon concentration or total hydrocarbon mass emissions rate (if complying with paragraph (g) of this section) or the measured concentration of the monitored substance(s) (if complying with paragraph (l) of this section) measured during re-monitoring to verify repair, and the re-monitoring date (
i.e.,
the effective date of repair); and
(E) For each delayed repair, identification of the monitoring location associated with the leak for which repair is delayed, the date when the delay of repair began, the date the repair was completed or is expected to be completed (if the leak is not repaired during the reporting period), the total strippable hydrocarbon concentration or total hydrocarbon mass emissions rate (if complying with paragraph (g) of this section) or the measured concentration of the monitored substance(s) (if complying with paragraph (l) of this section) and date of each monitoring event conducted on the delayed repair during the reporting period, and an estimate in pounds of the potential total hydrocarbon emissions or monitored substance(s) emissions over the reporting period associated with the delayed repair.
(3)

) of this section.
(

) If an owner or operator complies with the total strippable hydrocarbon concentration leak action level, as specified in paragraph (g)(4) of this section, then the owner or operator must calculate the mass emissions rate by complying with the requirements of paragraph (g)(3)(ii) of this section or by determining the mass flow rate of the cooling water at the monitoring location where the leak was detected. If the monitoring location is an individual
cooling tower riser, determine the total cooling water mass flow rate to the cooling tower. Cooling water mass flow rates may be determined using direct measurement, pump curves, heat balance calculations, or other engineering methods. If an owner or operator determines the mass flow rate of the cooling water, calculate the mass emissions rate by converting the stripping gas leak concentration (in ppmv as methane) to an equivalent liquid concentration, in parts per million by weight (ppmw), using equation 7-1 from “Air Stripping Method (Modified El Paso Method) for Determination of Volatile Organic Compound Emissions from Water Sources” (incorporated by reference—see § 63.14) and multiply the equivalent liquid concentration by the mass flow rate of the cooling water.
(

) For delay of repair monitoring intervals prior to repair of the leak, calculate the potential total hydrocarbon emissions or monitored substance(s) emissions for the leaking heat exchange system or heat exchanger for the monitoring interval by multiplying the mass emissions rate, determined in paragraph (g)(3)(ii) or (f)(3)(iv)(D)(
1
) or (
4
) of this section, by the duration of the delay of repair monitoring interval. The duration of the delay of repair monitoring interval is the time period starting at midnight on the day of the previous monitoring event or at midnight on the day the repair would have had to be completed if the repair had not been delayed, whichever is later, and ending at midnight of the day the of the current monitoring event.
(
3
) For delay of repair monitoring intervals ending with a repaired leak, calculate the potential total hydrocarbon emissions or monitored substance(s) emissions for the leaking heat exchange system or heat exchanger for the final delay of repair monitoring interval by multiplying the duration of the final delay of repair monitoring interval by the mass emissions rate determined for the last monitoring event prior to the re-monitoring event used to verify the leak was repaired. The duration of the final delay of repair monitoring interval is the time period starting at midnight of the day of the last monitoring event prior to re-monitoring to verify the leak was repaired and ending at the time of the re-monitoring event that verified that the leak was repaired.
(
4
) If an owner or operator monitors the cooling water for leaks according to paragraph (l) of this section, then the owner or operator must calculate the mass emissions rate by determining the mass flow rate of the cooling water at the monitoring location where the leak was detected. Cooling water mass flow rates may be determined using direct measurement, pump curves, heat balance calculations, or other engineering methods. Once determined, multiply the mass flow rate of the cooling water by the concentration of the measured substance(s).
(g) For each source as defined in § 63.101, beginning no later than the compliance dates specified in § 63.100(k)(10), owners and operators must monitor the cooling water for the presence of total strippable hydrocarbons that indicate a leak according to paragraph (g)(1) of this section, and if an owner or operator detects a leak pursuant to the procedures in this paragraph, then the owner or operator must repair it according to paragraphs (h) and (i) of this section, unless repair is delayed according to paragraph (j) of this section. The requirements in this paragraph do not apply to heat exchange systems that have a maximum cooling water flow rate of 10 gallons per minute or less.
(1) For each recirculating heat exchange system subject to the requirements of paragraph (g) of this section, owners and operators must collect and analyze a sample from the location(s) described in either paragraph (g)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section.
(i) Each cooling tower return line or any representative riser within the cooling tower prior to exposure to air for each heat exchange system.
(ii) Selected heat exchanger exit line(s), so that each heat exchanger or group of heat exchangers within a heat exchange system is covered by the selected monitoring location(s).
(2) For each once-through heat exchange system, owners and operators must collect and analyze a sample from the location(s) described in paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section. The owner or operator may also elect to collect and
analyze an additional sample from the location(s) described in paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section.
(i) Selected heat exchanger exit line(s), so that each heat exchanger or group of heat exchangers within a heat exchange system is covered by the selected monitoring location(s). The selected monitoring location may be at a point where discharges from multiple heat exchange systems are combined provided that the combined cooling water flow rate at the monitoring location does not exceed 40,000 gallons per minute.
(ii) The inlet water feed line for a once-through heat exchange system prior to any heat exchanger. If multiple heat exchange systems use the same water feed (
i.e.,
inlet water from the same primary water source), the owner or operator may monitor at one representative location and use the monitoring results for that sampling location for all heat exchange systems that use that same water feed.
(3) If an owner or operator complies with the total strippable hydrocarbon concentration leak action level as specified in paragraph (g)(4) of this section, then the owner or operator must comply with the requirements in paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section. If an owner or operator complies with the total hydrocarbon mass emissions rate leak action level as specified in paragraph (g)(4) of this section, then the owner or operator must comply with the requirements in paragraphs (g)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section.
(i) Owners and operators must determine the total strippable hydrocarbon concentration (in parts per million by volume (ppmv) as methane) at each monitoring location using the “Air Stripping Method (Modified El Paso Method) for Determination of Volatile Organic Compound Emissions from Water Sources” (incorporated by reference—see § 63.14) using a flame ionization detector (FID) analyzer for on-site determination as described in Section 6.1 of the Modified El Paso Method.
(ii) Owners and operators must convert the total strippable hydrocarbon concentration (in ppmv as methane) to a total hydrocarbon mass emissions rate (as methane) using the calculations in Section 7.0 of “Air Stripping Method (Modified El Paso Method) for Determination of Volatile Organic Compound Emissions from Water Sources” (incorporated by reference—see § 63.14).
(4) Except as specified in paragraph (g)(6) of this section, for each heat exchange system, owners and operators must initially monitor monthly for 6-months beginning upon startup and monitor quarterly thereafter using a leak action level defined as a total strippable hydrocarbon concentration (as methane) in the stripping gas of 6.2 ppmv or, for heat exchange systems with a recirculation rate of 10,000 gallons per minute or less, the owner or operator may monitor quarterly using a leak action level defined as a total hydrocarbon mass emissions rate from the heat exchange system (as methane) of 0.18 kg/hr. If a leak is detected as specified in paragraph (g)(5) of this section, then owners and operators must monitor monthly until the leak has been repaired according to the requirements in paragraph (h) or (i) of this section. Once the leak has been repaired according to the requirements in paragraph (h) or (i) of this section, quarterly monitoring for the heat exchange system may resume. The monitoring frequencies specified in this paragraph also apply to the inlet water feed line for a once-through heat exchange system, if monitoring of the inlet water feed is elected as provided in paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section.
(5) A leak is defined as described in paragraph (g)(5)(i) or (ii) of this section, as applicable.
(i) For once-through heat exchange systems for which the inlet water feed is monitored as described in paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section, a leak is detected if the difference in the measurement value of the sample taken from a location specified in paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section and the measurement value of the corresponding sample taken from the location specified in paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section equals or exceeds the leak action level.
(ii) For all other heat exchange systems, a leak is detected if a measurement value of the sample taken from a location specified in paragraph (g)(1)(i)
or (ii) or (g)(2)(i) of this section equals or exceeds the leak action level.
(6) For heat exchange systems in ethylene oxide service, as defined in § 63.101, the monitoring frequency is weekly.
(h) If a leak is detected using the methods described in paragraph (g) of this section, owners and operators must repair the leak to reduce the concentration or mass emissions rate to below the applicable leak action level as soon as practicable, but no later than 45 days after identifying the leak, except as specified in paragraph (h)(6) or (j) of this section. Repair must include re-monitoring at the monitoring location where the leak was identified according to the method specified in paragraph (g)(3) of this section to verify that the total strippable hydrocarbon concentration or total hydrocarbon mass emissions rate is below the applicable leak action level. Repair may also include performing the additional monitoring in paragraph (i) of this section to verify that the total strippable hydrocarbon concentration or total hydrocarbon mass emissions rate is below the applicable leak action level. Actions that can be taken to achieve repair include but are not limited to:
(1) Physical modifications to the leaking heat exchanger, such as welding the leak or replacing a tube;
(2) Blocking the leaking tube within the heat exchanger;
(3) Changing the pressure so that water flows into the process fluid;
(4) Replacing the heat exchanger or heat exchanger bundle; or
(5) Isolating, bypassing, or otherwise removing the leaking heat exchanger from service until it is otherwise repaired.
(6) For heat exchange systems in ethylene oxide service, as defined in § 63.101, paragraph (j) of this section does not apply, and owners and operators must repair the leak to reduce the concentration or mass emissions rate to below the applicable leak action level as soon as practicable, but no later than 15 days after the sample was collected. Delay of repair of heat exchange systems in ethylene oxide service for which leaks have been detected is allowed if the equipment is isolated from the process such that it is no longer in ethylene oxide service.
(i) If an owner or operator detects a leak when monitoring a cooling tower return line under paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section, then the owner or operator may conduct additional monitoring of each heat exchanger or group of heat exchangers associated with the heat exchange system for which the leak was detected, as provided in paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section. If no leaks are detected when monitoring according to the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section, the heat exchange system is considered to have met the repair requirements through re-monitoring of the heat exchange system, as provided in paragraph (h) of this section.
(j) Owners and operators may delay repair when one of the conditions in paragraph (j)(1) or (2) of this section is met and the leak is less than the delay of repair action level specified in paragraph (j)(3) of this section. Owners and operators must determine if a delay of repair is necessary as soon as practicable, but no later than 45 days after first identifying the leak.
(1) If the repair is technically infeasible without a shutdown and the total strippable hydrocarbon concentration or total hydrocarbon mass emissions rate is initially and remains less than the delay of repair action level for all monitoring periods during the delay of repair, then the owner or operator may delay repair until the next scheduled shutdown of the heat exchange system. If, during subsequent monitoring, the delay of repair action level is exceeded, then owners and operators must repair the leak within 30 days of the monitoring event in which the leak was equal to or exceeded the delay of repair action level.
(2) If the necessary equipment, parts, or personnel are not available and the total strippable hydrocarbon concentration or total hydrocarbon mass emissions rate is initially and remains less than the delay of repair action level for all monitoring periods during the delay of repair, then the owner or operator may delay the repair for a maximum of 120 calendar days. Owners and operators must demonstrate that
the necessary equipment, parts, or personnel were not available. If, during subsequent monitoring, the delay of repair action level is exceeded, then owners and operators must repair the leak within 30 days of the monitoring event in which the leak was equal to or exceeded the delay of repair action level.
(3) The delay of repair action level is a total strippable hydrocarbon concentration (as methane) in the stripping gas of 62 ppmv or, for heat exchange systems with a recirculation rate of 10,000 gallons per minute or less, the delay of repair action level is a total hydrocarbon mass emissions rate (as methane) of 1.8 kg/hr. The delay of repair action level is assessed as described in paragraph (j)(3)(i) or (ii) of this section, as applicable.
(i) For once-through heat exchange systems for which the inlet water feed is monitored as described in paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section, the delay of repair action level is exceeded if the difference in the measurement value of the sample taken from a location specified in paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section and the measurement value of the corresponding sample taken from the location specified in paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section equals or exceeds the delay of repair action level.
(ii) For all other heat exchange systems, the delay of repair action level is exceeded if a measurement value of the sample taken from a location specified in paragraph (g)(1)(i), (1)(ii), or (2)(i) of this section equals or exceeds the delay of repair action level.
(k) For each source as defined in § 63.101, beginning no later than the compliance dates specified in § 63.100(k)(11), owners and operators must not inject water into or dispose of water through any heat exchange system in a chemical manufacturing process unit meeting the conditions of § 63.100(b)(1) through (3) if the water contains any amount of ethylene oxide, has been in contact with any process stream containing ethylene oxide, or the water is considered wastewater as defined in § 63.101.
(l) If 99 percent by weight or more of the organic compounds that could leak into the heat exchange system are water soluble and have a Henry's Law Constant less than 5.0E-6 atmospheres-cubic meters/mol at 25 degrees Celsius, beginning no later than the compliance dates specified in § 63.100(k)(10), owners and operators may monitor the cooling water for leaks according to the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section in lieu of using the Modified El Paso Method. If an owner or operator detects a leak according to paragraph (b) of this section, then the owner or operator must repair it according to paragraph (l)(1) of this section, unless repair is delayed according to paragraph (l)(2) of this section.
(1) If a leak is detected using the methods described in paragraph (l) of this section, the owner or operator must repair the leak as soon as practicable, but no later than 45 days after identifying the leak, except as specified in paragraph (l)(2) of this section. Repair must include re-monitoring at the monitoring location where the leak was identified to verify that the criteria in paragraph (b)(6) of this section is no longer met. Actions that can be taken to achieve repair include but are not limited to:
(i) Physical modifications to the leaking heat exchanger, such as welding the leak or replacing a tube;
(ii) Blocking the leaking tube within the heat exchanger;
(iii) Changing the pressure so that water flows into the process fluid;
(iv) Replacing the heat exchanger or heat exchanger bundle; or

§ 63.108
Flare requirements.
(a) For any flare that is used to reduce organic HAP emissions from a chemical manufacturing process unit, the owner or operator may elect to comply with the requirements in this section in lieu of the requirements of § 63.11(b) and the requirements referenced therein. The owner or operator may also elect to comply with the requirements in this section pursuant to the overlap provisions provided in § 63.110(j). However, for each source as defined in § 63.101 and for each source as defined in § 63.191, beginning no later than the compliance dates specified in § 63.100(k)(10), the provisions specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (22) of this section no longer apply. Instead, if an owner or operator reduces organic HAP
emissions from a chemical manufacturing process unit by venting emissions through a closed-vent system to a steam-assisted, air-assisted, non-assisted, or pressure-assisted multi-point flare, then the owner or operator must meet the applicable requirements for flares as specified in §§ 63.670 and 63.671, including the provisions in tables 12 and 13 to subpart CC of this part, except as specified in paragraphs (b) through (o) of this section. This requirement also applies to any flare using fuel gas from a fuel gas system, of which 50 percent or more of the fuel gas is derived from a chemical manufacturing process unit, as determined on an annual average basis. For purposes of compliance with this paragraph, the following terms are defined in § 63.641: Assist air, assist steam, center steam, combustion zone, combustion zone gas, flare, flare purge gas, flare supplemental gas, flare sweep gas, flare vent gas, lower steam, net heating value, perimeter assist air, pilot gas, premix assist air, total steam, and upper steam.

(22) The phrase “including periods when a flare pilot light system does not have a flame” in § 63.181(g)(2)(i) of subpart H of this part.
(b) When determining compliance with the pilot flame requirements specified in § 63.670(b) and (g), substitute “pilot flame or flare flame” for each occurrence of “pilot flame.”
(c) When determining compliance with the flare tip velocity and combustion zone operating limits specified in § 63.670(d) and (e), the requirement effectively applies starting with the 15-minute block that includes a full 15 minutes of the flaring event. The owner or operator is required to demonstrate compliance with the velocity and NHVcz requirements starting with the block that contains the fifteenth minute of a flaring event. The owner or operator is not required to demonstrate compliance for the previous 15-minute block in which the event started and contained only a fraction of flow.
(d) Instead of complying with § 63.670(o)(2)(i), owners and operators must develop and implement the flare management plan no later than the compliance dates specified in § 63.100(k)(10).
(e) Instead of complying with § 63.670(o)(2)(iii), if required to develop a flare management plan and submit it to the Administrator, then owners and operators must also submit all versions of the plan in portable document format (PDF) to the EPA following the procedure specified in § 63.9(k), except any medium submitted through mail must be sent to the attention of the Hazardous Organic Chemical Manufacturing Sector Lead.
(f) Section 63.670(o)(3)(ii) and all references to it do not apply. Instead, the owner or operator must comply with the maximum flare tip velocity operating limit at all times.
(g) Substitute “chemical manufacturing process unit” for each occurrence of “petroleum refinery.”
(h) Each occurrence of “refinery” does not apply.
(i) If a pressure-assisted multi-point flare is used as a control device, then owners and operators must meet the following conditions:
(1) The owner or operator is not required to comply with the flare tip velocity requirements in § 63.670(d) and (k);
(2) The NHVcz for pressure-assisted mulit-point flares is 800 Btu/scf;
(3) Owners and operators must determine the 15-minute block average NHVvg using only the direct calculation method specified in § 63.670(l)(5)(ii);
(4) Instead of complying with § 63.670(b) and (g), if a pressure-assisted multi-point flare uses cross-lighting on a stage of burners rather than having an individual pilot flame on each burner, then owners and operators must operate each stage of the pressure-assisted multi-point flare with a flame present at all times when regulated material is routed to that stage of burners. Each stage of burners that cross-lights in the pressure-assisted multi-point flare must have at least two pilots with at least one continuously lit and capable of igniting all regulated material that is routed to that stage of burners. Each 15-minute block during which there is at least one minute where no pilot flame is present on a stage of burners when regulated material is routed to the flare is a violation of the standard. Violations in different 15-minute blocks from the same event are considered separate violations. The pilot flame(s) on each stage of burners that use cross-lighting must be continuously monitored by a thermocouple or any other equivalent device used to detect the presence of a flame;
(5) Unless the owner or operator chooses to conduct a cross-light performance demonstration as specified in this paragraph, owners and operators must ensure that if a stage of burners on the flare uses cross-lighting, that the distance between any two burners in series on that stage is no more than 6 feet when measured from the center of one burner to the next burner. A distance greater than 6 feet between any two burners in series may be used provided the owner or operator conducts a performance demonstration that confirms the pressure-assisted multi-point flare will cross-light a minimum of three burners and the spacing between the burners and location of the pilot flame must be representative of the projected installation. The compliance demonstration must be approved by the permitting authority and a copy of this approval must be maintained onsite. The compliance demonstration report must include: a protocol describing the test methodology used, associated test method QA/QC parameters, the waste gas composition and NHVcz of the gas tested, the velocity of the waste gas tested, the pressure-assisted multi-point flare burner tip pressure, the time, length, and duration of the test, records of whether a successful cross-light was observed over all of the burners and the length of time it took for the burners to cross-light, records of maintaining a stable flame after a successful cross-light and the duration for which this was observed, records of any smoking events during the cross-light, waste gas temperature, meteorological conditions (
e.g.,
ambient temperature, barometric pressure, wind speed and direction, and relative humidity), and whether there were any observed flare flameouts; and
(6) Owners and operators must install and operate pressure monitor(s) on the main flare header, as well as a valve position indicator monitoring system for each staging valve to ensure that the flare operates within the proper range of conditions as specified by the manufacturer. The pressure monitor must meet the requirements in table 13 to subpart CC of this part.
(7) If a pressure-assisted multi-point flare is operating under the requirements of an approved alternative means of emission limitations, owners and operators must either continue to comply with the terms of the alternative means of emission limitations or comply with the provisions in paragraphs (i)(1) through (6) of this section.
(j) If an owner or operator chooses to determine compositional analysis for net heating value with a continuous process mass spectrometer, then the owner or operator must comply with the requirements specified in paragraphs (j)(1) through (7) of this section.
(1) Owners and operators must meet the requirements in § 63.671(e)(2). The owner or operator may augment the minimum list of calibration gas components found in § 63.671(e)(2) with compounds found during a pre-survey or known to be in the gas through process knowledge.
(2) Calibration gas cylinders must be certified to an accuracy of 2 percent
and traceable to National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standards.
(3) For unknown gas components that have similar analytical mass fragments to calibration compounds, the owner or operator may report the unknowns as an increase in the overlapped calibration gas compound. For unknown compounds that produce mass fragments that do not overlap calibration compounds, the owner or operator may use the response factor for the nearest molecular weight hydrocarbon in the calibration mix to quantify the unknown component's NHVvg.
(4) The owner or operator may use the response factor for n-pentane to quantify any unknown components detected with a higher molecular weight than n-pentane.
(5) Owners and operators must perform an initial calibration to identify mass fragment overlap and response factors for the target compounds.
(6) Owners and operators must meet applicable requirements in Performance Specification 9 in appendix B to part 60 of this chapter for continuous monitoring system acceptance including, but not limited to, performing an initial multi-point calibration check at three concentrations following the procedure in section 10.1 and performing the periodic calibration requirements listed for gas chromatographs in table 13 to subpart CC of this part, for the process mass spectrometer. The owner or operator may use the alternative sampling line temperature allowed under Net Heating Value by Gas Chromatograph in table 13 to subpart CC of this part.
(7) The average instrument calibration error (CE) for each calibration compound at any calibration concentration must not differ by more than 10 percent from the certified cylinder gas value. The CE for each component in the calibration blend must be calculated using equation 1 to this paragraph.

(5) Except as specified in paragraph (a)(6) of this section, the concentration of ethylene oxide must be determined using Method 18 of appendix A-6 to part 60 of this chapter, or Method 320 of appendix A to this part.
(6) You may elect to use ASTM D6348-12 (Reapproved 2020) (incorporated by reference, § 63.14) in lieu of Method 320 of appendix A to this part as specified in paragraph (a)(5) of this section. To comply with this paragraph, annexes Al through A8 to ASTM D6348-12 (Reapproved 2020) are mandatory; the percent (%) R must be determined for each target analyte using Equation A5.5 of ASTM D6348-12 (Reapproved 2020) Annex A5 (Analyte Spiking Technique); and in order for the test data to be acceptable for a compound, the %R must be 70% ≥ R ≤ 130%. If the %R value does not meet this criterion for a target compound, then the test data is not acceptable for that compound and the test must be repeated for that analyte (
i.e.,
the sampling and/or analytical procedure should be adjusted before a retest). The %R value for each compound must be
reported in the test report, and all field measurements must be corrected with the calculated %R value for that compound by using the following equation:

# Equation 1 to Paragraph (a)(6)
Reported Results = (Measured Concentration in the Stack × 100)/%R.
(7) The requirements specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (6) of this section for an initial measurement or initial performance test do not apply if the conditions specified in paragraphs (a)(7)(i) through (iv) of this section are met for a previously conducted measurement or performance test.
(i) No changes have been made to the process since the time of the measurement or performance test;
(ii) The operating conditions and test methods used during measurement or performance test conform to the ethylene oxide related requirements of this subpart;
(iii) The control device and process parameter values established during the previously conducted measurement or performance test are used to demonstrate continuous compliance with the ethylene oxide related requirements of this subpart; and
(iv) The previously conducted measurement or performance test was completed within the last 60 months.
(b) For storage vessels, owners and operators must determine the concentration of ethylene oxide of the fluid stored in the storage vessels by complying with the requirements in paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section.
(1) The owner or operator must measure concentration of ethylene oxide of the fluid stored in the storage vessel using Method 624.1 of appendix A to 40 CFR part 136, or preparation by Method SW-846-5031 or SW-846-5030B and analysis by Method SW-846-8260D (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14). The owner or operator may not use a preservative in the collected sample; the owner or operator must store the sample with minimal headspace as cold as possible and at least below 4 degrees C; and the owner or operator must analyze the sample as soon as possible, but in no case longer than 7 days from the time the sample was collected. If owners and operators collect a sample from a pressure vessel, then the owner or operator must maintain the sample under pressure both during and following sampling.
(2) Unless specified by the Administrator, the owner or operator may calculate the concentration of ethylene oxide of the fluid stored in the storage vessels if information specific to the fluid stored is available. Information specific to the fluid stored includes concentration data from safety data sheets.
(c) For equipment leaks, owners and operators must comply with the requirements in paragraphs (c)(1) through (4) of this section.
(1) Each piece of equipment within a chemical manufacturing process unit that can reasonably be expected to contain equipment in ethylene oxide service is presumed to be in ethylene oxide service unless the owner or operator demonstrates that the piece of equipment is not in ethylene oxide service. For a piece of equipment to be considered not in ethylene oxide service, it must be determined that the percent ethylene oxide content of the process fluid that is contained in or contacts equipment can be reasonably expected to not exceed 0.1 percent by weight on an annual average basis. For purposes of determining the percent ethylene oxide content of the process fluid, owners and operators must use Method 18 of appendix A-6 to part 60 of this chapter, for gaseous process fluid, and Method 624.1 of appendix A to part 136 of this chapter, or preparation by Method SW-846-5031 and analysis by Method SW-846-8260D (both incorporated by reference, see § 63.14) for liquid process fluid. In lieu of preparation by Method SW-846-5031, owners and operators may use Method SW-846-5030B (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14), as long as: the owner or operator does not use a preservative in the collected sample; the owner or operator stores the sample with minimal headspace as cold as possible and at least below 4 degrees C; and the owner or operator analyzes the sample as soon as possible, but in no case longer than 7 days from the time the sample was collected.
(2) Unless specified by the Administrator, owners and operators may use good engineering judgment rather than the procedures specified in paragraph
(c)(1) of this section to determine that the percent ethylene oxide content of the process fluid that is contained in or contacts equipment does not exceed 0.1 percent by weight.
(3) Owners and operators may revise a determination for whether a piece of equipment is in ethylene oxide service by following the procedures in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, or by documenting that a change in the process or raw materials no longer causes the equipment to be in ethylene oxide service.
(4) Samples used in determining the ethylene oxide content must be representative of the process fluid that is contained in or contacts the equipment.
(d) For wastewater, owners and operators must determine the concentration of ethylene oxide of each wastewater stream using Method 624.1 of appendix A to part 136 of this chapter, or preparation by either Method SW-846-5031 or SW-846-5030B and analysis by Method SW-846-8260D (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14). The owner or operator may not use a preservative in the collected sample; the owner or operator must store the sample with minimal headspace as cold as possible and at least below 4 degrees C; and the owner or operator must analyze the sample as soon as possible, but in no case longer than 7 days from the time the sample was collected.
(e) For heat exchange systems, owners and operators must comply with the requirements in paragraph (e)(1) or (2) of this section.
(1) Determine the concentration of ethylene oxide of the process fluid cooled by the heat exchange system using Method 624.1 of appendix A to part 136 of this chapter, or preparation by either Method SW-846-5031 or SW-846-5030B and analysis by Method SW-846-8260D (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14). The owner or operator may not use a preservative in the collected sample; the owner or operator must store the sample with minimal headspace as cold as possible and at least below 4 degrees C; and the owner or operator must analyze the sample as soon as possible, but in no case longer than 7 days from the time the sample was collected. soon as possible, but in no case longer than 7 days from the time the sample was collected.
(2) Unless specified by the Administrator, owners and operators may use good engineering judgment rather than the procedures specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section to determine that the percent ethylene oxide content of the process fluid cooled by the heat exchange system does not exceed 0.1 percent by weight.

Any vent designated as a maintenance vent is only subject to the maintenance vent provisions in this paragraph (k) and the associated reporting and recordkeeping requirements in § 63.118(f)(9) and (m), respectively. The owner or operator does not need to designate a maintenance vent as a Group 1 or Group 2 process vent nor identify maintenance vents in a Notification of Compliance Status report.
(1) Prior to venting to the atmosphere, remove process liquids from the equipment as much as practical and depressurize the equipment to either: A flare meeting the requirements of § 63.108, as applicable, or using any combination of a non-flare combustion, recovery, and/or recapture device meeting the requirements in paragraph (a)(2) of this section until one of the following conditions, as applicable, is met.
(i) The concentration of the vapor in the equipment served by the maintenance vent is less than 10 percent of its lower explosive limit (LEL) and has an outlet concentration less than or equal to 20 ppmv hydrogen halide and halogen HAP.
(ii) If there is no ability to measure the concentration of the vapor in the equipment based on the design of the equipment, the pressure in the equipment served by the maintenance vent is reduced to 5 pounds per square inch gauge (psig) or less. Upon opening the maintenance vent, active purging of the equipment cannot be used until the concentration of the vapors in the maintenance vent (or inside the equipment if the maintenance is a hatch or similar type of opening) is less than 10 percent of its LEL.
(iii) The equipment served by the maintenance vent contains less than 50 pounds of total volatile organic compounds (VOC).
(iv) If, after applying best practices to isolate and purge equipment served by a maintenance vent, none of the applicable criterion in paragraphs (k)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section can be met prior to installing or removing a blind flange or similar equipment blind, then the pressure in the equipment served by the maintenance vent must be reduced to 2 psig or less before installing or removing the equipment blind. During installation or removal
of the equipment blind, active purging of the equipment may be used provided the equipment pressure at the location where purge gas is introduced remains at 2 psig or less.
(2) Except for maintenance vents complying with the alternative in paragraph (k)(1)(iii) of this section, the owner or operator must determine the concentration or, if applicable, equipment pressure using process instrumentation or portable measurement devices and follow procedures for calibration and maintenance according to manufacturer's specifications.
(3) For maintenance vents complying with the alternative in paragraph (k)(1)(iii) of this section, the owner or operator must determine mass of VOC in the equipment served by the maintenance vent based on the equipment size and contents after considering any contents drained or purged from the equipment. Equipment size may be determined from equipment design specifications. Equipment contents may be determined using process knowledge.
(4) In addition to complying with the requirements in paragraphs (k)(1) through (3) of this section, for process vents in ethylene oxide service, subject to the requirements of § 63.124 that are designated as maintenance vents, owners and operators may not release more than 1.0 tons of ethylene oxide from all maintenance vents combined per any consecutive 12-month period. The owner or operator must keep monthly records of the quantity in tons of ethylene oxide released from each maintenance vent and include a description of the method used to estimate this quantity.
(l) For each source as defined in § 63.101, beginning no later than the compliance dates specified in § 63.100(k)(10), paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section no longer apply. Instead, the owner or operator of a Group 2 process vent with a total organic HAP mass flow rate less than 1.0 pound per hour shall maintain a total organic HAP mass flow rate less than 1.0 pound per hour; comply with the Group determination procedures in § 63.115(g); and the reporting and recordkeeping requirements in §§ 63.117(g) and 63.118(n); and is not subject to monitoring or any other provisions of §§ 63.114 through 63.118.

All monitoring equipment shall be installed, calibrated, maintained, and operated according to manufacturer's specifications or other written procedures that provide adequate assurance that the equipment would reasonably be expected to monitor accurately.
(1) Where an incinerator is used, a temperature monitoring device equipped with a continuous recorder is required.
(i) Where an incinerator other than a catalytic incinerator is used, a temperature monitoring device shall be installed in the firebox or in the ductwork immediately downstream of the firebox in a position before any substantial heat exchange occurs.
(ii) Where a catalytic incinerator is used, temperature monitoring devices shall be installed in the gas stream immediately before and after the catalyst bed.
(2) Where a flare is used, except as specified in § 63.108(a), the following monitoring equipment is required: A device (including but not limited to a thermocouple, ultra-violet beam sensor, or infrared sensor) capable of continuously detecting the presence of a pilot flame.
(3) Where a boiler or process heater of less than 44 megawatts design heat input capacity is used, the following monitoring equipment is required: a temperature monitoring device in the firebox equipped with a continuous recorder. This requirement does not apply to gas streams that are introduced with primary fuel or are used as the primary fuel.
(4) Where a scrubber is used with an incinerator, boiler, or process heater in
the case of halogenated vent streams, the following monitoring equipment is required for the scrubber.
(i) A pH monitoring device equipped with a continuous recorder shall be installed to monitor the pH of the scrubber effluent.
(ii) A flow meter equipped with a continuous recorder shall be located at the scrubber influent for liquid flow. Gas flow rate shall be determined using one of the procedures specified in paragraphs (a)(4)(ii)(A) through (C) of this section.
(A) The owner or operator may determine gas flow rate using the design blower capacity, with appropriate adjustments for pressure drop.
(B) If the scrubber is subject to rules in 40 CFR parts 264 through 266 that have required a determination of the liquid to gas (L/G) ratio prior to the applicable compliance date for this subpart specified in § 63.100(k), the owner or operator may determine gas flow rate by the method that had been utilized to comply with those rules. A determination that was conducted prior to the compliance date for this subpart may be utilized to comply with this subpart if it is still representative.
(C) The owner or operator may prepare and implement a gas flow rate determination plan that documents an appropriate method which will be used to determine the gas flow rate. The plan shall require determination of gas flow rate by a method which will at least provide a value for either a representative or the highest gas flow rate anticipated in the scrubber during representative operating conditions other than startups, shutdowns, or malfunctions. The plan shall include a description of the methodology to be followed and an explanation of how the selected methodology will reliably determine the gas flow rate, and a description of the records that will be maintained to document the determination of gas flow rate. The owner or operator shall maintain the plan as specified in § 63.103(c). For each source as defined in § 63.101, on and after July 15, 2027, the phrase “other than startups, shutdowns, or malfunctions” in this paragraph no longer applies.
(5) Where a recovery device or recapture device is used to comply with the requirements of § 63.113(a)(2) or (5), the owner or operator shall utilize the appropriate monitoring device identified in paragraph (a)(5)(i), (ii), (iii), (iv), or (v) of this section. All monitoring equipment shall be installed, calibrated, and maintained according to the manufacturer's specifications or other written procedures that provide adequate assurance that the equipment would reasonably be expected to monitor accurately.

(v) Beginning no later than the compliance dates specified in § 63.100(k)(10), if the owner or operator vents emissions through a closed vent system to an adsorber(s) that cannot be regenerated or a regenerative adsorber(s) that is regenerated offsite, then the owner or operator must install a system of two or more adsorber units in series and comply with the requirements specified in paragraphs (a)(5)(v)(A) through (C) of this section.
(A) Conduct an initial performance test or design evaluation of the adsorber and establish the breakthrough limit and adsorber bed life.
(B) Monitor the HAP or total organic compound (TOC) concentration through a sample port at the outlet of the first adsorber bed in series according to the schedule in paragraph (a)(5)(v)(C)(
2
) of this section. The owner or operator must measure the concentration of HAP or TOC using either a portable analyzer, in accordance with Method 21 of appendix A-7 to part 60 of this chapter using methane, propane, isobutylene, or the primary HAP being controlled as the calibration gas or Method 25A of part 60, appendix A-7, using methane, propane, or the primary HAP being controlled as the calibration gas.
(C) Comply with paragraph (a)(5)(v)(C)(
1
) of this section and comply with the monitoring frequency according to paragraph (a)(5)(v)(C)(
2
) of this section.
(
1
) The first adsorber in series must be replaced immediately when breakthrough, as defined in § 63.101, is detected between the first and second adsorber. The original second adsorber (or a fresh canister) will become the new first adsorber and a fresh adsorber will become the second adsorber. For purposes of this paragraph, “immediately” means within 8 hours of the detection of a breakthrough for adsorbers of 55 gallons or less, and within 24 hours of the detection of a breakthrough for adsorbers greater than 55 gallons. The owner or operator must monitor at the outlet of the first adsorber within 3 days of replacement to confirm it is performing properly.
(
2
) Based on the adsorber bed life established according to paragraph (a)(5)(v)(A) of this section and the date the adsorbent was last replaced, conduct monitoring to detect breakthrough at least monthly if the adsorbent has more than 2 months of life remaining, at least weekly if the adsorbent has between 2 months and 2 weeks of life remaining, and at least daily if the adsorbent has 2 weeks or less of life remaining.
(6) Where sorbent injection is used, the following monitoring equipment is required for the sorbent injection system:

(d) The owner or operator of a process vent shall comply with paragraphs (d)(1) or (2) and (d)(3) of this section for any bypass line between the origin of the gas stream (
i.e.,
at an air oxidation reactor, distillation unit, or reactor as identified in § 63.107(b)) and the point where the gas stream reaches the process vent, as described in § 63.107, that could divert the gas stream directly to the atmosphere. Except as specified in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section, equipment such as low leg drains, high point bleeds, analyzer vents, open-ended valves or lines, and pressure relief valves needed for safety purposes are not subject to this paragraph (d).
(1) Properly install, maintain, and operate a flow indicator that takes a reading at least once every 15 minutes. Records shall be generated as specified in § 63.118(a)(3). The flow indicator shall be installed at the entrance to any bypass line that could divert the gas stream to the atmosphere; or

A visual inspection of the seal or closure mechanism shall be performed at least once every month to ensure that the valve is maintained in the non-diverting position and the gas stream is not diverted through the bypass line
(3) For each source as defined in § 63.101, beginning no later than the compliance dates specified in § 63.100(k)(10):
(i) The use of a bypass line at any time on a closed vent system to divert emissions (subject to the emission standards in § 63.112) to the atmosphere or to a control device not meeting the requirements specified in this subpart is an emissions standards violation.
(ii) The last sentence in paragraph (d) of this section no longer applies. Instead, the exemptions specified in paragraphs (d)(3)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section apply.
(A) Except for pressure relief devices subject to § 63.165(e)(4) of subpart H of this part, equipment such as low leg drains and equipment subject to the requirements of subpart H of this part are not subject to this paragraph (d) of this section.
(B) Open-ended valves or lines that use a cap, blind flange, plug, or second valve and follow the requirements specified in § 60.482-6(a)(2), (b), and (c) of this chapter or follow requirements codified in another regulation that are the same as § 60.482-6(a)(2), (b), and (c) are not subject to this paragraph (d).
(e) The owner or operator shall establish a range that indicates proper operation of the control or recovery device for each parameter monitored under paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section based on the results of the most recent performance test. In order to establish the range, the information required in § 63.152(b) shall be submitted in the Notification of Compliance Status or the operating permit application or amendment. The range may be based upon a prior performance test conducted for determining compliance with a regulation promulgated by the EPA, and the owner or operator is not required to conduct an initial performance test under § 63.116, if the prior performance test was conducted using the same methods specified in § 63.116 and either no process changes have been made since the test, or the owner or operator can demonstrate that the results of the performance test, with or without adjustments, reliably demonstrate compliance despite process changes. Subsequent performance tests must be conducted according to § 63.103(b)(1).
