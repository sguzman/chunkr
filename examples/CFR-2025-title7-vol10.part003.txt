§ 1463.9
Payment of assessments.
(a) Assessments under this subpart are imposed for the expenditures CCC has determined it will incur in the 2005 through 2014 calendar years. Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, payment of such assessments are due to CCC no later than the end of each calendar year quarter. If prior to 30 calendar days before the end of a calendar year quarter CCC has not notified an entity of the amount that is required to be remitted in that quarter, no interest will be assessed by CCC under paragraph (d) of this section until 30 calendar days have elapsed from the date CCC provided notification of the amount owed.
(b) Payments due under this subpart must be submitted to CCC by electronic fund transfer unless prior written approval has been obtained from CCC.
(c) The final two calendar year quarterly payments due to CCC under this part shall be due to CCC on September 30, 2014.
(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, if CCC has not received payment of assessments determined to be owed at the end of a calendar year quarter, CCC will assess interest on such unpaid amount beginning on the first day of the calendar year quarter immediately following the end of such prior quarter. Such interest will be at the rate CCC assesses on delinquent debts in accordance with part 1403 of this title.
(e) With respect to funds placed in escrow that are refunded to the domestic manufacturer or importer of tobacco products due to the resolution of an appeal, interest will be paid on such amount from the date of receipt by CCC until the date of the refund. Such interest rate will be at the rate charged by the U.S. Treasury for CCC's borrowing that is in effect on the date of receipt by CCC of such funds.

(b) In addition to an action that may be taken under paragraph (a) of this section, with respect to any person who knowingly fails to provide information required to be filed under this subpart, or that provides false information under this subpart, a person may be subject to assessment of a civil penalty by CCC. Such civil penalty will be imposed by CCC taking into account the severity of the action; whether the action is of a repetitive nature; and the disruption the action has caused with respect to other parties subject to this subpart. Any such civil penalty will not exceed two percent of the value of the kind of tobacco products manufactured or imported by such entity in the fiscal year in which the violation occurred.
§ 1463.11
Appeals and judicial review.
(a) An entity may appeal any adverse determination made under this subpart, including with respect to the amount of the assessment, by submitting a written statement that sets forth the basis of the dispute to Darlene Soto, Tobacco Transition Assessment Program Manager, U.S. Department of Agriculture, 1400 Independence Avenue SW., Room 3722, Mail Stop 0515, Washington DC 20250-0514, within 30 business days of the date of receipt of the notification by CCC of its determination.
(b) The Executive Vice President shall assign a person to act as the hearing officer on behalf of CCC. The duty of the hearing officer will be to develop an administrative record that will provide the Executive Vice President, or a designee, with sufficient information to render a final determination on the matter in dispute. The hearing to be
conducted by the hearing officer will be an informal hearing at which the appellant may present oral and written evidence in support of the appellant's position. A copy of the rules of conduct that will be applicable to the proceeding will be provided to the appellant upon receipt of the appeal by CCC.
(c) For any appeals filed after October 1, 2014, appellants must submit all supporting documentation within 30 calendar days following the date of the initial written appeal to CCC. Any documents received after that time will not be considered by the hearing officer.
(1) The final date that entities may file an appeal is January 14, 2016.
(2) If 30 calendar days elapse following receipt by CCC of the final submission of supporting documentation by an appellant with respect to any appeal filed under this section regarding an assessment imposed on a domestic manufacturer or importer of tobacco products, without a final administrative decision by CCC, then all administrative remedies available to the appellant will be deemed to be exhausted; except, if the 30th calendar day would fall on a weekend day or federal holiday, then the 30th calendar day will be deemed the next business day following such weekend day or federal holiday.
(d) Any domestic manufacturer or importer of tobacco products aggrieved by a determination made by CCC under this subpart may seek review of the determination upon the exhaustion of the administrative remedies provided by this part in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, or for the district in which such importer or manufacturer has its principal place of business.

(ii) Such agreement had not been fulfilled or terminated prior to that date; and
(iii) The parties to the agreement are unable to agree to the disposition of the contract payment to be made with respect to the farm.
(2) If, on or before October 22, 2004, the owner of a farm had entered into an agreement for the permanent transfer of all or a portion of a tobacco marketing quota and the transfer had not been completed by such date, the owner of the farm to which such quota was to be transferred shall be considered to be the owner of the marketing quota for the purposes of this subpart. The BQL's for the transferring farm and the receiving farm will be adjusted to reflect this transfer.
(f) Any tobacco marketing quota preserved under part 1410 of this chapter as the result of the enrollment of a farm in the Conservation Reserve Program shall be included in the determination of the BQL of the farm.
§ 1463.106
Base quota levels for eligible tobacco producers.
(a) BQL is determined separately, for each of the years 2002, 2003 and 2004, for each kind of tobacco and for each farm for which a 2002 farm marketing quota had been established under part 723 of this title.
(b) The BQL for producers of burley tobacco is established as follows:
(1) The 2002-crop year BQL for burley producers is the 2002 effective quota pounds actually marketed, adjusted for disaster lease and transfer, and considered-planted undermarketings and overmarketings. The BQL is then multiplied by the producer's share in the 2002 crop to determine the producer's 2002 BQL. The adjustments for disaster lease and transfer and considered-planted undermarketings and overmarketings are made as follows:
(i) Disaster-leased pounds are added to the marketings of the transferring farm and deducted from the marketings of the receiving farm;
(ii) Considered-planted pounds are added to the farm's actual marketings, and includes only undermarketings that were not part of the farm's 2003 effective quota.
(iii) Pounds actually marketed as overmarketings and sold penalty-free are added to the farm BQL after the BQL adjustment factor of 1.12486 has been applied to the overmarketed pounds.
(2) The 2003-crop year BQL for burley producers is the 2003 effective quota pounds actually marketed, adjusted for disaster lease and transfer and considered-planted undermarketings and overmarketings, as follows:
(i) Disaster leases are added to the marketings of the transferring farm and deducted from the marketings of receiving farm.
(ii) Considered-planted pounds are added to the farm's actual marketings, and includes only undermarketings that were not part of the farm's 2004 effective quota.
(iii) Pounds actually marketed as overmarketings and sold penalty-free are added to the farm BQL after the BQL adjustment factor of 1.071295 has been applied to the overmarketed pounds.
(iv) After these adjustments the BQL is calculated as follows:
Step
Calculation
1
Subtract all 2002 undermarketings from the 2003 marketings, including undermarketings from the parent farm in any special tobacco combinations. Leased pounds are apportioned undermarketing history by dividing the transferring farm's undermarketings by the transferring farm's effective quota, before any temporary transfers, resulting in the percentage of undermarketings that were leased.
2
Multiply the 2003 marketings remaining after Step 1 times 1.12486 (the 2003-BQL adjustment factor).
3
Add the undermarketings that were subtracted in Step 1 to the sum of Step 2 to determine the farm 2003 BQL.
4
Multiply the sum from Step 3 times the producer's share in the 2003 crop to determine the producer's 2003 BQL.
(3) The 2004-crop year BQL for burley producers is the 2004 effective quota before disaster lease and transfer is calculated as follows:
Step
Calculation
1
Subtract all 2003 undermarketings from the 2004 effective quota, including undermarketings from the parent farm in any special tobacco combinations. Leased pounds are apportioned undermarketing history by dividing the transferring farm's undermarketings by the transferring farm's effective quota, before any temporary transfers, resulting in the percentage of undermarketings that were leased.
2
Multiply the 2004 effective quota remaining after Step 1 times 1.071295 (the 2004 BQL adjustment factor).
3
Multiply the undermarketings that were subtracted in Step 1 times 1.12486 (the 2003 BQL adjustment factor).
4
Add the effective quota from Step 2 to the undermarketings in Step 3 to determine the farm 2004 BQL.
5
Multiply the sum from Step 4 times the producer's share in the 2004 crop to determine the producer's 2004 BQL.
(c) The BQL for producers of flue-cured tobacco is established by year, as follows:
(1) The 2002-crop year BQL for flue-cured producers is the effective 2002 quota actually marketed, adjusted for disaster lease and transfer and considered-planted undermarketings and overmarketings. The BQL is then multiplied by the producer's share in the 2002 crop to determine the producer's 2002 BQL. Adjustments for disaster lease and transfer and considered-planted undermarketings and overmarketings are calculated as follows:
(i) Disaster-leased pounds are added to the marketings of the transferring farm and deducted from the marketings of the receiving farm;
(ii) Considered-planted pounds are added to the farm's actual marketings, and include only undermarketings that were not part of the farm's 2003 effective quota.
(iii) Pounds actually marketed as overmarketings and sold penalty-free are added to the farm BQL after the BQL adjustment factor of 1.10497 has been applied to the overmarketed pounds.
(2) The 2003-crop year BQL for flue-cured producers is the 2003 effective quota actually marketed, adjusted for disaster lease and transfer and considered-planted undermarketings and overmarketings, as follows:
(i) Disaster leases are added to the marketings of the transferring farm and deducted from the marketings of the receiving farm.
(ii) Considered-planted pounds are added to the farm's actual marketings, and includes only undermarketings that were in not part of the farm's 2004 effective quota.
(iii) Pounds actually marketed as overmarketings and sold penalty-free are added to the farm BQL after the BQL adjustment factor of 1.23457 has been applied to the overmarketed pounds.
(iv) After these adjustments the BQL is calculated as follows:
Step
Calculation
1
Subtract all 2002 undermarketings from the 2003 marketings, including undermarketings from the parent farm in any special tobacco combinations.
2
Multiply the 2003 marketings remaining after Step 1 times 1.10497 (the 2003 BQL adjustment factor).
3
Add the undermarketings that were subtracted in Step 1 to the sum of Step 2 to determine the farm 2003 BQL.
4
Multiply the sum from step 3 times the producer's share in the 2003 crop to determine the producer's 2003 BQL.
(3) The 2004-crop year BQL for flue-cured producers is the 2004 effective quota before disaster lease and transfer. The 2004 BQL is calculated as follows:
Step
Calculation
1
Subtract all 2003 undermarketings from the 2004 effective quota, including undermarketings from the parent farm in any special tobacco combinations.
2
Multiply the 2004 effective quota remaining after Step 1 times 1.23457 (the 2004 BQL adjustment factor).
3
Multiply the undermarketings that were subtracted in Step 1 times 1.10497 (the 2003 BQL adjustment factor).
4
Add the effective quota from Step 2 to the undermarketings in Step 3 to determine the farm 2004 BQL.
5
Multiply the sum from Step 4 times the producer's share in the 2004 crop to determine the producer's 2004 BQL.
(d) The BQL for producers of cigar filler and binder tobacco is established by years, as follows:
(1) The 2002-crop year BQL for cigar filler and binder tobaccos is calculated as follows:
Step
Calculation
1
Multiply the 2002 farm's basic allotment times the farm's average yield for 2001, 2002, and 2003 to get the 2004 farm base pounds total.
2
Multiply any 2002 special tobacco combination acres times the 2002-equivalence factor of 1.000.
3
Multiply the sum from Step 2 times the farm's average yield for 2001, 2002, and 2003 to get the 2002 farm special tobacco combination pounds total.
4
Add the sum from Step 1 to the sum from Step 3 to get the 2004 farm BQL total.
5
Multiply the sum from Step 4 times the producer's share in the 2002 crop to get the producer 2002 BQL.
(2) The 2003-crop year BQL for cigar filler and binder tobaccos is calculated as follows:
Step
Calculation
1
Multiply the 2002 farm's basic allotment times the farm's average yield for 2001, 2002, and 2003 to get the 2003 farm base pounds total.
2
Multiply any 2003 special tobacco combination acres times the 2003 BQL adjustment factor of 0.8929.
3
Multiply the sum from Step 2 times the farm's average yield for 2001, 2002, and 2003 to get the 2003 farm special tobacco combination pounds total.
4

(a) TTPP payments made to any person under this subpart shall be made without regard to questions of title under State law and without regard to any claim or lien against the tobacco quota, tobacco marketing allotment, or the farm for which a tobacco quota had been established under part 723 of this title by any creditor or any other person.
(b) The provisions of part 1404 of this title shall not apply to this part.
(c) A quota holder or tobacco producer who is eligible to receive a payment under this part may assign a payment, or a portion thereof, to be made under this part to another person using the correct CCC form. Such an assignment will become effective upon approval by CCC. In order to provide for the orderly issuance of payments under this part, CCC may limit, in its sole discretion, the number of assignments that may be made with respect to a contract.
(d)(1) CCC will establish, after consultation with the Department of the Treasury, a discount rate that reflects the value of any remaining payments due under this part if such payments were to be made as a lump sum payment in the current year. Unless there is consideration for such contract in an amount equal to or greater than the discounted value of the payments, subject to the assignment, based on the discount rate established for such payments by CCC, CCC will not approve any assignment other than to:
(i) A family member; or
(ii) A party who had purchased a tobacco marketing quota prior to October 22, 2004 and had placed the quota on a farm with the owner's consent prior to that date in the manner that had been prescribed by FSA under part 723 of this chapter.
(2) The discount rate established by CCC will be determined by adding 200 basis points to the prime lending rate, as determined by CCC. If this sum is a fraction of a number, CCC will round the discount rate to the nearest whole number. Rounding of a half percent will be to the next higher whole number.
(e) CCC will issue a payment to an assignee only to the extent and amount of payment that CCC would otherwise have issued to the quota holder or producer in the absence of the assignment. In accordance with part 1403 of this title, any claim owed by the assignor to the United States will be deducted from any payment made under this part prior to the issuance of the payment to the assignee.
(f) CCC will report to the Internal Revenue Service any payment assigned under this section as income earned by the assignor.
§ 1463.112
Successor in interest contracts.
(a) A quota holder or tobacco producer who is eligible to receive a payment under this part, and for whom a claim has not been established by the United States, may enter into a successor in interest contract with another party using the correct CCC form. Such successor in interest contract will become effective upon approval by CCC, and will not include the 2005 payment. Only one such successor in interest contract may be entered into by a quota holder or tobacco producer with respect to a farm for each kind of tobacco.
(b) Annually, CCC will establish, after consultation with the Department of the Treasury, a discount rate that reflects the value of any remaining payments due under this part if such payments were to be made as a lump sum payment in the current year. This discount rate will be determined as provided in § 1463.111(d)(2). Unless there is consideration for such contract in an amount equal to or greater than the discounted value of the payments, subject to the successor in interest or contract, based on the discount rate established for such payments by CCC,
CCC will not approve any succession in interest contract other than to:
(1) A family member; or
(2) A party who had purchased a tobacco marketing quota prior to October 22, 2004 and had placed the quota on a farm with the owner's consent prior to that date in the manner that had been prescribed by FSA under part 723 of this chapter.
(c) CCC will issue a payment, except the 2005 payment, to a successor party only if such party is otherwise in compliance with all other applicable regulations, which includes for successors to producer contracts only the wetlands and highly erodible land provisions of part 12 of this chapter. In accordance with part 1403 of this title, any claim owed by the successor party to the United States will be deducted from any payment made under this part prior to the issuance of the payment to the successor party.
(d) CCC will report to the Internal Revenue Service any payment made under a successor in interest contract as income earned by the successor party.
§ 1463.113
Issuance of payments in event of death.
If a quota holder or tobacco producer who is eligible to receive a payment under this subpart dies, the right to receive payments shall be transferred to the estate of the quota holder or tobacco producer unless such person is survived by a spouse or one or more dependents, in which case the right to receive the payments shall be transferred to the surviving spouse.

# Subpart A—General Provisions
§ 1464.1
Applicability.
(a) The purposes of the Regional Conservation Partnership Program (RCPP) are as follows:
(1) Carry out eligible activities to further the conservation, protection, restoration, and sustainable use of soil, water (including sources of drinking water and ground water), wildlife, agricultural land, and related natural resources on eligible land on a regional or watershed scale;
(2) Encourage eligible partners to cooperate with producers in—
(i) Meeting or avoiding the need for national, State, and local natural resource regulatory requirements related to production on eligible lands, including through alignment of partnership projects with other national, State, and local agencies and programs addressing similar natural resource or environmental concerns, and
(ii) Implementing projects that will result in the adoption, installation, and maintenance of eligible activities that affect multiple agricultural or nonindustrial private forest operations on a local, regional, State, or multistate basis;
(3) Encourage flexible and streamlined delivery of conservation assistance to producers through partnership agreements; and
(4) Engage producers and eligible partners in conservation projects to achieve greater conservation outcomes and benefits for producers than would otherwise be achieved.
(b) Through RCPP, NRCS provides technical and financial assistance to implement eligible activities through partnership and supplemental agreements with eligible partners and program contracts with producers.
(c) RCPP is available in any of the 50 States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands of the United States, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.
(d) Each program contract, partnership agreement, and supplemental agreement is subject to the regulations in place on the date it is executed.
§ 1464.2
Administration.
(a) The funds, facilities, and authorities of the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) are available to NRCS for carrying out RCPP. Accordingly, each reference to NRCS in this part also refers to CCC funds, facilities, and authorities where applicable.
(b) No delegation in this part to lower organizational levels will preclude the Chief of NRCS from making any determinations under this part, redelegating to other organizational levels, or from reversing or modifying any determination made under this part.
(c) NRCS may use other agency-wide authorities, such as 16 U.S.C. 3842 and 31 U.S.C. 1535, to enter into agreements with other Federal or State agencies, Indian Tribes, conservation districts, units of local government, public or private organizations, and individuals to assist NRCS with implementation of the program in this part.
(d) To assist in the implementation of the program, the Chief may waive the applicability of the limitation in section 1001D of the Food Security Act of 1985 for participating producers if the Chief determines that the waiver is necessary to fulfill the objectives of the program. Section 1001D of the Food Security Act of 1985 does not apply to eligible partners.
(e) NRCS will identify in each State a program coordinator who will serve as the primary point of contact for programmatic implementation of RCPP in that State.
(f) NRCS will establish guidance to assist eligible partners with quantifying conservation benefits of RCPP implementation. Due to the diversity of natural resource issues addressed by an RCPP project and the diversity of conservation activities that a project may undertake, NRCS will work with each partner to develop project-specific outcome approach that will be included in the partnership agreement.

means land that is not owned by a governmental entity, and includes acreage owned by Indian Tribes, as defined in this Part.
Restoration Cost-Share Agreement
means the legal document that describes the rights and obligations of participants who have been accepted to participate in WRP restoration cost-share enrollment option that is used to implement conservation practices and activities to protect, restore, or enhance wetlands values and functions to achieve the purposes of the program. The restoration cost-share agreement is an agreement between NRCS and the participant to share in the costs of implementing the Wetland Restoration Plan of Operations.
Riparian areas
means areas of land that occur along streams, channels, rivers, and other water bodies.

The hydrology and native self-sustaining vegetation being established will substantially replace original habitat functions and values and does not involve more than 30 percent of the wetland restoration area.
Wetlands Reserve Plan of Operations (WRPO)
means the conservation plan that identifies how the wetland functions and values will be restored, improved, and protected and which is approved by NRCS.
§ 1467.4
Program requirements.
(a)
General.
(1) Under the WRP, NRCS may purchase conservation easements from, or enter into 30-year contracts or restoration cost-share agreements with, eligible landowners who voluntarily cooperate to restore, protect, or enhance wetlands on eligible private and Tribal lands. The 30-year contract enrollment option is only available to acreage owned by Indian Tribes.
(2) To participate in WRP, a landowner must agree to the implementation of a WRPO, the effect of which is to restore, protect, enhance, maintain, and manage the hydrologic conditions of inundation or saturation of the soil, native vegetation, and natural topography of eligible lands. NRCS may provide cost-share assistance through a restoration cost-share agreement or an easement restoration agreement for the conservation practices and activities that promote the restoration, protection, enhancement, maintenance, and management of wetland functions and values. For easement transactions, NRCS may implement such conservation practices and activities through an agreement with the landowner, a contract with a vendor, or a cooperative agreement with a cooperating entity. Specific restoration, protection, enhancement, maintenance, and management actions may be undertaken by the landowner, NRCS, or other designee.
(b)
Acreage limitations.
(1) Except for areas devoted to windbreaks or shelterbelts after November 28, 1990, no more than 25 percent of the total cropland in any county, as determined by the FSA, may be enrolled in the CRP and the WRP, and no more than 10 percent of the total cropland in the county may be subject to an easement acquired through the WRP.
(2) NRCS and FSA shall concur before a waiver of the 25 percent limit of this paragraph can be approved for an easement proposed for enrollment in the WRP. Such a waiver will only be approved if the waiver will not adversely affect the local economy, and operators in the county are having difficulties complying with the conservation plans implemented under 16 U.S.C. 3812.
(c)
Landowner eligibility.
To be eligible to enroll in the WRP, a person, legal entity, or Indian Tribe must be in compliance with the highly erodible land and wetland conservation provisions in 7 CFR part 12. Persons or legal entities must be in compliance with the Adjusted Gross Income Limitation
provisions at Subpart G of 7 CFR part 1400, and:
(1) Be the landowner of eligible land for which enrollment is sought;
(2) For easement applications, have been the landowner of such land for the 7-year period prior to the time the land is determined eligible for enrollment unless it is determined by the State Conservationist that:
(i) The land was acquired by will or succession as a result of the death of the previous landowner;
(ii) The ownership change occurred due to foreclosure on the land and the owner of the land immediately before the foreclosure exercises a right of redemption from the mortgage holder in accordance with State law; or
(iii) The land was acquired under circumstances that give adequate assurances, as determined by NRCS, that such land was not acquired for the purposes of placing it in the program, such as demonstration of status as a beginning farmer or rancher.
(3) Agree to provide such information to NRCS as the agency deems necessary or desirable to assist in its determination of eligibility for program benefits and for other program implementation purposes.
(d) When a parcel of land that has been accepted for enrollment into the WRP is sold or transferred prior to the easement being perfected, the application or option agreement to purchase will be cancelled and acres will be removed from enrollment. If the new landowner wishes to continue enrollment, a new application must be filed so that all eligibility criteria may be examined and documented.
(e)
Land eligibility.
(1) Only private land or land owned by Indian Tribes may be considered for enrollment into WRP.
(2) NRCS shall determine whether land is eligible for enrollment and whether, once found eligible, the lands may be included in the program based on the likelihood of successful restoration of wetland functions and values when considering the cost of acquiring the easement and the cost of the restoration, protection, enhancement, maintenance, and management.
(3) Land shall only be considered eligible for enrollment in the WRP if NRCS determines, in consultation with the FWS, that:
(i) The enrollment of such land maximizes wildlife benefits and wetland values and functions;
(ii) Such land is—
(A) Farmed wetland or converted wetland, together with adjacent lands that are functionally dependent on the wetlands; or
(B) Cropland or grassland that was used for agricultural production prior to flooding from the natural overflow of a closed basin lake or pothole, together with the adjacent land, where practicable, that is functionally dependent on the cropland or grassland; and
(iii) The likelihood of the successful restoration of such land and the resultant wetland values merit inclusion of such land in the program, taking into consideration the cost of such restoration.
(4) Land may be considered farmed wetland or converted wetland under paragraph (3)(ii)(A) of this section if such land is identified by NRCS as:
(i) Wetlands farmed under natural conditions, farmed wetlands, prior converted cropland, commenced conversion wetlands, farmed wetland pastures, and lands substantially altered by flooding so as to develop wetland functions and values; or
(ii) Former or degraded wetlands that occur on lands that have been used or are currently being used for the production of food and fiber, including rangeland and forest production lands, where the hydrology has been significantly degraded or modified and will be substantially restored.
(5) Land under paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(B) of this section may be considered for enrollment into 30-year easements if it meets the criteria under paragraph (e)(3) of this section, it is located in the Prairie Pothole Region as defined under § 1467.3 of this part, and the size of the parcel offered for enrollment is a minimum of 20 contiguous acres. Such land meets the requirement of likelihood of successful restoration only if the soils are hydric and the depth of water is 6.5 feet or less.
(6) If land offered for enrollment is determined eligible under paragraph (e)(3) and (e)(5) of this section, then
NRCS may also enroll land adjacent or contiguous to such eligible land together with the eligible land, if such land maximizes wildlife benefits and:
(i) Is farmed wetland and adjoining lands enrolled in CRP, with the highest wetland functions and values, and is likely to return to production after it leaves CRP;
(ii) Is a riparian area along streams or other waterways that links or, after restoring the riparian area, will link wetlands which are protected by an easement or other device or circumstance that achieves the same objectives as an easement; or
(iii) Land adjacent to the eligible land that would contribute significantly to wetland functions and values, such as buffer areas, wetland creations, non-cropped natural wetlands, and restored wetlands, but not more than the State Conservationist, in consultation with the State Technical Committee, determines is necessary for such contribution.
(7) To be enrolled in the program, eligible land must be configured in a size and with boundaries that allow for the efficient management of the area for program purposes and otherwise promote and enhance program objectives, as determined by NRCS.
(f)
Enrollment of CRP lands.
Land subject to an existing CRP contract may be enrolled in the WRP only if the land and landowner meet the requirements of this part, and the enrollment is requested by the landowner and agreed to by NRCS. To enroll in WRP, the CRP contract for the property must be terminated or otherwise modified subject to such terms and conditions as are mutually agreed upon by FSA and the landowner.
(g)
Ineligible land.
The following land is not eligible for enrollment in the WRP:
(1) Converted wetlands if the conversion was commenced after December 23, 1985;
(2) Land that contains timber stands established under a CRP contract or pastureland established to trees under a CRP contract;
(3) Lands owned by an agency of the United States, other than held in trust for Indian Tribes;
(4) Lands owned in fee title by a State, including an agency or a subdivision of a State, or a unit of local government;
(5) Land subject to an easement or deed restriction which, as determined by NRCS, provides similar restoration and protection of wetland functions and values as would be provided by enrollment in WRP; and
(6) Lands where implementation of restoration practices would be undermined due to on-site or off-site conditions, such as risk of hazardous substances either on-site or off-site, proposed or existing rights of way, either on-site or off-site, for infrastructure development, or adjacent land uses, such as airports, that would either impede complete restoration or prevent wetland functions and values from being fully restored.
[74 FR 2328, Jan. 15, 2009, as amended at 74 FR 26284, June 2, 2009]
§ 1467.5
Application procedures.
(a)
Application for participation.
To apply for enrollment, a landowner must submit an Application for Participation in the WRP.
(b)
Preliminary agency actions.
By filing an Application for Participation, the landowner consents to an NRCS representative entering upon the land for purposes of assessing the wetland functions and values, and for other activities, such as the development of the preliminary WRPO, that are necessary or desirable for NRCS to evaluate applications. The landowner is entitled to accompany an NRCS representative on any site visits.
(c)
Voluntary reduction in compensation.
In order to enhance the probability of enrollment in WRP, a landowner may voluntarily offer to accept a lesser payment than is being offered by NRCS.
§ 1467.6
Establishing priority for enrollment of properties in WRP.
(a) When evaluating easement, 30-year contract, or restoration cost-share agreement offers from landowners, the NRCS, with advice from the State Technical Committee, may consider:
(1) The conservation benefits of obtaining an easement, or other interest in the land;
(2) The cost effectiveness of each easement or other interest in eligible land, so as to maximize the environmental benefits per dollar expended;
(3) Whether the landowner or another person is offering to contribute financially to the cost of the easement or other interest in the land to leverage Federal funds;
(4) The extent to which the purposes of the easement program would be achieved on the land;
(5) The productivity of the land; and
(6) The on-farm and off-farm environmental threats if the land is used for the production of agricultural commodities.
(b) To the extent practicable, taking into consideration costs and future agricultural and food needs, NRCS shall give priority to:
(1) Obtaining permanent easements over shorter term easements; and
(2) Acquiring easements based on the value of the easement for protecting and enhancing habitat for migratory birds and other wildlife, in consultation with FWS.
(c) NRCS, in consultation with the State Technical Committee, may place higher priority on certain geographic regions of the State where restoration of wetlands may better achieve State and regional goals and objectives.
(d) Notwithstanding any limitation of this part, the State Conservationist may, at any time, exclude enrollment of otherwise eligible lands if the participation of the adjacent landowners is essential to the successful restoration of the wetlands and those adjacent landowners are unwilling or ineligible to participate. The State Conservationist may coordinate with other Federal, State, and nonprofit organizations to encourage the restoration of wetlands on adjacent ineligible lands, especially in priority geographic areas.
(e)(1) The Chief will conduct an assessment during fiscal year 2008 and each subsequent fiscal year for the purpose of determining the interest and allocations for the Prairie Pothole Region to enroll land determined eligible under § 1467.4(d)(5) of this part into 30-year easements. Annually, the Chief will provide specific instructions for the assessment in writing to the applicable State Conservationists.
(2) The Chief will make an adjustment to the allocation for an applicable State for a fiscal year, based on the results of the assessment conducted under paragraph (e)(1) of this section for the State during the previous fiscal year.
§ 1467.7
Enrollment process.
(a)
Tentative Selection.
Based on the priority ranking, NRCS will notify an affected landowner of tentative acceptance into the program.
(b)
Effect of notice of tentative selection.
The notice of tentative acceptance into the program does not bind NRCS or the United States to enroll the proposed project in WRP, nor does it bind the landowner to continue with enrollment in the program. The notice informs the landowner of NRCS' intent to continue the enrollment process on their land unless otherwise notified by the landowner.
(c)
Acceptance and effect of offer of enrollment
—(1)
Easement.
For applications requesting enrollment through an easement, an option agreement to purchase will be presented by NRCS to the landowner, which will describe the easement area; the easement compensation amount; the easement terms and conditions; and other terms and conditions for participation that may be required by NRCS as appropriate. The landowner accepts enrollment in the WRP by signing the option agreement to purchase. NRCS will continue with easement acquisition activities after the property has been enrolled.
(2)
Restoration cost-share agreement.
For applications requesting enrollment through the restoration cost-share agreement option, a restoration cost-share agreement shall be presented by NRCS to the landowner, which will describe the enrolled area, the agreement terms and conditions, and other terms and conditions for participation that may be required by NRCS as appropriate. The landowner accepts enrollment in the WRP by signing the restoration cost-share agreement. NRCS will proceed with implementation of the WRPO after the property has been enrolled.
(3)
30-year contract.
For applications requesting enrollment through the 30-year contract option, a 30-year contract shall be presented by NRCS to the landowner, which will describe the contract area, the contract terms and conditions, and other terms and conditions for participation that may be required by NRCS as appropriate. The landowner accepts enrollment in the WRP by signing the 30-year contract. NRCS will proceed with implementation of the WRPO after the property has been enrolled.
(d)
Restoration responsibility and the scope of enrollment.
(1) The enrollment document establishes the terms of enrollment consistent with the terms and conditions of this part, and identifies the:
(i) Scope of the agreement between NRCS and the landowner;
(ii) Basis for NRCS to obligate funds; and
(iii) Nature and method through which NRCS will provide WRP technical and financial assistance to the landowner.
(2) The option agreement to purchase between NRCS and the landowner under the easement option constitutes the agreement for:
(i) Granting an easement on the enrolled land as set forth under § 1467.11;
(ii) Implementing a WRPO which provides for the restoration and protection of the functions and values of wetlands;
(iii) Recording the easement in accordance with applicable State law; and
(iv) Ensuring the title to the easement is superior to the rights of all others, except for exceptions to the title that are deemed acceptable by NRCS.
(3) The terms of the easement identified in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section includes the landowner's agreement to the implementation of a WRPO identified in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section. In particular, the easement deed identifies that NRCS has the right to enter the easement area to undertake, on a cost-share basis with the landowner or other entity, any activities to restore, protect, manage, maintain, enhance, and monitor the wetland and other natural values of the easement area.
(4) At the time NRCS enters into an agreement to purchase, NRCS agrees, subject to paragraph (e) of this section, to acquire and provide for restoration of the land enrolled into the program.
(e)
Withdrawal of offer of enrollment
Prior to execution of the easement deed by the United States and the landowner, NRCS may withdraw the land from enrollment at any time due to lack of availability of funds, inability to clear title, sale of the land, risk of hazardous substance contamination, or other reasons. The offer of enrollment to the landowner shall be void if not executed by the landowner within the time specified.
[74 FR 2328, Jan. 15, 2009, as amended at 74 FR 26284, June 2, 2009]

(2) Payments for non-permanent easements or 30-year contracts shall be not more than 75 percent of that which would have been paid for a permanent easement as determined by the methods listed in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
(3) NRCS shall pay as compensation the lowest of the following:
(i) The fair market value of the land using the Uniform Standards for Professional Appraisal Practices, or based on an area-wide market analysis or survey;
(ii) The geographic area rate cap determined under paragraph (a)(4) of this section; or
(iii) The landowner offer.
(4) The State Conservationist, in consultation with the State Technical Committee, shall establish one or more geographic area rate caps within a state. The State Conservationist shall submit geographic area rate caps and supporting documentation to the Chief for approval. Each State Conservationist will determine the geographic area rate cap using the best information which is readily available in that State. Such information may include: Soil types, type(s) of crops capable of
being grown, production history, location, real estate market values, and tax rates and assessments.
(b)
Acceptance of offered easement compensation.
(1) NRCS will not acquire any easement unless the landowner accepts the amount of the easement payment offered by NRCS. The easement payment may or may not equal the fair market value of the interests and rights to be conveyed by the landowner under the easement. By voluntarily participating in the program, a landowner waives any claim to additional compensation based on fair market value.
(2)(i) For easements or 30-year contracts valued at $500,000 or less, NRCS will provide compensation in up to 30 annual payments, as requested by the participant, as specified in the option agreement to purchase or 30-year contract between NRCS and the participant.
(ii) For easements or 30-year contracts valued at more than $500,000, the Secretary may provide compensation in at least 5, but not more than 30 annual payments. NRCS may provide compensation in a single payment for such easements or 30-year contracts when, as determined by the Chief, it would further the purposes of the program. The applicable payment schedule will be specified in the option agreement to purchase, warranty easement deed, or 30-year contract between NRCS and the participant.
(c)
Reimbursement of a landowner's expenses.
For completed easement conveyances, NRCS will reimburse participants for their fair and reasonable expenses, if any, incurred for legal boundary surveys and other related costs, as determined by NRCS. The State Conservationist, in consultation with the State Technical Committee, may establish maximum payments to reimburse participants for reasonable expenses, if incurred.
(d)
Tax implications of easement conveyances.
Subject to applicable regulations of the Internal Revenue Service, a participant may be eligible for a bargain sale tax deduction which is the difference between the fair market value of the easement conveyed to the United States and the easement payment made to the participant. NRCS disclaims any representations concerning the tax implications of any easement or cost-share transaction.
(e)
Per acre basis calculations.
If easement payments are calculated on a per acre basis, adjustment to stated easement payment will be made based on final determination of acreage.
§ 1467.9

(4) Selected proposals and associated funding will be provided to the State Conservationist to enter into WREP agreements with the eligible partner to carry out the project.
(b)
Reserved Rights Pilot.
(1) The Chief shall carry out a reserved rights pilot subject to the requirements established in this part.
(2) Under the reserved rights pilot, a landowner may reserve grazing rights
in the warranty easement deed or 30-year contract, if the State Conservationist determines that the reservation and use of the grazing rights:
(i) Is compatible with the land subject to the easement or 30-year contract; and
(ii) Is consistent with the long-term wetland protection and enhancement goals for which the easement or 30-year contract was established; and
(iii) Complies with a WRPO developed with NRCS.
(3) The State Conservationist will provide public notice of the availability of the reserved rights pilot and the reserved rights template deed or 30-year contract, approved by the Chief, to be used in the pilot.
(4) Compensation for easements or 30-year contracts entered into under the reserved rights pilot will be based on the method described in § 1467.8 with the following exceptions:
(i) Section 1467.8(a)(3)(i) is adjusted to reduce the fair market value of the land by an amount equal to the value of the retained grazing rights as determined by a Uniform Standards for Professional Appraisal Practices appraisal or a market survey; and
(ii) Section 1467.8(a)(3)(ii) is adjusted to reduce the geographic area rate cap determined as described in § 1467.8(a)(4) by an amount equal to the value of the retained grazing rights.
§ 1467.10
Cost-share payments.
(a) NRCS may share the cost with participants of implementing the WRPO on the enrolled land. The amount and terms and conditions of the cost-share assistance shall be subject to the following restrictions on the costs of establishing or installing conservation practices or activities specified in the WRPO:

(3) The total amount of payments that a person or legal entity may receive, directly or indirectly, for one or more restoration cost-share agreements, for any year, may not exceed $50,000.
(b) Cost-share payments may be made only upon a determination by NRCS that an eligible conservation practice or component of the conservation practice has been implemented in compliance with appropriate NRCS standards and specifications; or an eligible activity has been implemented in compliance with the appropriate requirements detailed in the WRPO. Identified conservation practices or activities may be implemented by the participant, NRCS, or other NRCS designee.
(c) Cost-share payments may be made for replacement of an eligible conservation practice, if NRCS determines that the practice is still needed and that the failure of the original conservation practice was due to reasons beyond the control of the participant.
(d) A participant may seek additional cost-share assistance from other public or private organizations as long as the conservation practices or activities funded are in compliance with this part. In no event shall the participant receive an amount that exceeds 100 percent of the total actual cost of the restoration.

(1) After an easement has been recorded, no modification will be made in the easement except by mutual agreement with the Chief and the participant. The Chief will consult with FWS and the Conservation District prior to making any modifications to easements.
(2) Approved modifications will be made only in an amended easement, which is duly prepared and recorded in conformity with standard real estate practices, including requirements for title approval, subordination of liens, and recordation.
(3) The Chief may approve modifications to facilitate the practical administration and management of the easement area or the program so long as the modification will not adversely affect the wetland functions and values for which the easement was acquired or when adverse impacts will be mitigated by enrollment and restoration of other lands that provide greater wetland functions and values at no additional cost to the government.
(4) Modifications must result in equal or greater environmental and economic values to the United States and address a compelling public need, as determined by the Chief.
(b)
WRPO.
Insofar as is consistent with the easement and applicable law, the State Conservationist may approve modifications to the WRPO that do not affect provisions of the easement in consultation with the participant and with consideration of site specific technical input from the FWS and the Conservation District. Any WRPO modification must meet WRP regulations and program objectives, comply with the definition of wetland restoration as defined in § 1467.3, must result in equal or greater wildlife benefits, wetland functions and values, and ecological and economic values to the United States.
§ 1467.14
Transfer of land.
(a)
Offers voided.
Any transfer of the property prior to the enrollment of the easement, 30-year contract, or restoration cost-share agreement contract, including the landowner entering into a contract or purchase agreement to sell the land subject to offer, shall void the offer of enrollment.
(b)
Payments to landowners.
For easements with multiple annual payments, any remaining easement payments will be made to the original participant unless NRCS receives an assignment of proceeds.
(c)
Claims to payments.
With respect to any and all payments owed to participants, NRCS shall bear no responsibility for any full payments or partial distributions of funds between the original participant and the participant's successor. In the event of a dispute or claim on the distribution of cost-share payments, NRCS may withhold payments without the accrual of interest pending an agreement or adjudication on the rights to the funds.
§ 1467.15
Violations and remedies.
(a)
Easement violations.
(1) In the event of a violation of the easement, 30-year contract, or any restoration cost-share agreement involving the participant, the participant shall be given reasonable notice and an opportunity to voluntarily correct the violation within 30 days of the date of the notice, or such additional time as the State Conservationist determines is necessary to correct the violation at the landowner's expense.
(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(1) of this section, NRCS reserves the right to enter upon the easement area at any time to remedy deficiencies or easement violations. Such entry may be made at the discretion of NRCS when such actions are deemed necessary to protect important wetland functions and values or other rights of the United States under the easement. The participant shall be liable for any costs incurred by the United States as a result of the participant's negligence or failure to comply with easement or contractual obligations.
(3) At any time there is a material breach of the easement covenants or any associated agreement, the easement shall remain in force and NRCS may withhold or require the refund of any easement and cost-share payments owed or paid to participants. Such withheld or refunded funds may be used to offset costs incurred by the United States in any remedial actions or retained as damages pursuant to court order or settlement agreement. This remedy is in addition to any and all legal or equitable remedies available to the United States under applicable Federal or State law.
(4) The United States shall be entitled to recover any and all administrative and legal costs, including attorney's fees or expenses, associated with any enforcement or remedial action.
(b)
30-year Contract and Restoration Cost-Share Agreement violations.
(1) If the NRCS determines that a participant is in violation of the terms of a 30-year contract, or restoration cost-share agreement, or documents incorporated by reference into the 30-year contract or restoration cost-share agreement, the participant shall be given reasonable notice and an opportunity to voluntarily correct the violation within 30 days of the date of the notice, or such additional time as the State Conservationist determines is necessary to correct the violation. If the violation continues, the State Conservationist may terminate the 30-year contract or restoration cost-share agreement.
(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, a restoration cost-share agreement or 30-year contract termination is effective immediately upon a determination by the State Conservationist that the participant has:
(i) Submitted false information;
(ii) Filed a false claim;
(iii) Engaged in any act for which a finding of ineligibility for payments is permitted under this part; or
(iv) Taken actions NRCS deems to be sufficiently purposeful or negligent to warrant a termination without delay.
(3) If NRCS terminates a restoration cost-share agreement or 30-year contract, the participant will forfeit all rights for future payments under the restoration cost-share agreement or 30-year contract, and must refund all or part, as determined by NRCS, of the payments received, plus interest.
§ 1467.16
Payments not subject to claims.
Any cost-share, contract, or easement payment or portion thereof due any person under this part shall be allowed without regard to any claim or lien in favor of any creditor, except agencies of the United States Government.
§ 1467.17
Assignments.
Any person entitled to any cash payment under this program may assign the right to receive such cash payments, in whole or in part.
§ 1467.18
Appeals.
(a) A person participating in the WRP may obtain a review of any administrative determination concerning eligibility for participation utilizing the administrative appeal regulations provided in 7 CFR part 614.
(b) Before a person may seek judicial review of any administrative action taken under this part, the person must
exhaust all administrative appeal procedures set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, and for purposes of judicial review, no decision shall be a final Agency action except a decision of the Chief of the NRCS under these procedures.
(c) Any appraisals, market analysis, or supporting documentation that may be used by the NRCS in determining property value are considered confidential information, and shall only be disclosed as determined at the sole discretion of the NRCS in accordance with applicable law.
(d) Enforcement actions undertaken by the NRCS in furtherance of its federally held property rights are under the jurisdiction of the federal courts and not subject to review under administrative appeal regulations.
§ 1467.19
Scheme and device.
(a) If it is determined by the NRCS that a participant has employed a scheme or device to defeat the purposes of this part, any part of any program payment otherwise due or paid such participant during the applicable period may be withheld or be required to be refunded with interest thereon, as determined appropriate by NRCS.
(b) A scheme or device includes, but is not limited to, coercion, fraud, misrepresentation, depriving any other person of payments for cost-share practices, contracts, or easements for the purpose of obtaining a payment to which a person would otherwise not be entitled.
(c) A participant who succeeds to the responsibilities under this part shall report in writing to the NRCS any interest of any kind in enrolled land that is held by a predecessor or any lender. A failure of full disclosure will be considered a scheme or device under this section.
§ 1467.20
Market-based conservation initiatives.
(a)
Acceptance and use of contributions.
Section 1241(e) of the Food Security Act of 1985, as amended, (16 U.S.C. 3841(e)), allows the Chief to accept and use contributions of non-Federal funds to support the purposes of the program. These funds shall be available without further appropriation and until expended, to carry out the program.
(b)
Ecosystem Services Credits for Conservation Improvements.
(1) USDA recognizes that environmental benefits will be achieved by implementing conservation practices and activities funded through WRP, and that environmental credits may be gained as a result of implementing activities compatible with the purposes of a WRP easement, 30-year contract, or restoration cost-share agreement. NRCS asserts no direct or indirect interest in these credits. However, NRCS retains the authority to ensure that the requirements of the WRPO, contract, and easement deed are met. Where activities required under an environmental credit agreement may affect land covered under a WRP easement, 30-year contract, or restoration cost-share agreement, participants are highly encouraged to request a compatibility assessment from NRCS prior to entering into such agreements.
(2) Section 1222(f)(2) of the Food Security Act of 1985 as amended, does not allow wetlands restored with Federal funds to be utilized for Food Security Act wetland mitigation purposes.

# Subpart A—General Provisions
§ 1468.1
Applicability.
(a) The regulations in this part set forth requirements, policies, and procedures for implementation of the Agricultural Conservation Easement Program (ACEP) administered by the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). ACEP purposes include:
(1) Combining the purposes and coordinating the functions of the Wetlands Reserve Program established under section 1237, the Grassland Reserve Program established under section 1238N, and the Farmland Protection Program established under section 1238I, as such sections were in effect on the day before the date of enactment of the Agricultural Act of 2014;
(2) Restoring, protecting, and enhancing wetlands on eligible land;
(3) Protecting the agricultural use and future viability, and related conservation values, of eligible land by limiting nonagricultural uses of that land that negatively affect the agricultural uses and conservation values; and
(4) Protecting grazing uses and related conservation values by restoring or conserving eligible land.
(b) The NRCS Chief may implement ACEP in any of the 50 States, the District of Columbia, Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands of the United States, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.
(c) Subpart B of this part sets forth additional requirements, policies, and procedures for implementation of the Agricultural Land Easements (ALE) component of ACEP.
(d) Subpart C of this part sets forth additional requirements, policies, and procedures for the Wetland Reserve Easement (WRE) component of ACEP.
(e) Easement lands previously enrolled under the predecessor programs Farm and Ranch Lands Protection Program (7 CFR part 1491), the Grassland Reserve Program (7 CFR part 1415), and the Wetlands Reserve Program (7 CFR part 1467) are considered enrolled in ACEP. Existing easements and agreements remain valid and enforceable, and subject to the legal framework in place at the time of enrollment, except that the long-term stewardship and management of these easements, and any ACEP funding made available for implementation, will be in accordance with this part.
§ 1468.2
Administration.
(a) The regulations in this part will be administered under the general supervision and direction of the NRCS Chief.
(b) NRCS may seek advice from the State technical committee on considerations relating to implementation and technical aspects of the program, such as identification of lands of statewide importance or special significance, review of State-level geographic area rate caps, development of ranking criteria, wetland restoration objectives, management considerations, including compatible use criteria, or related technical matters.
(c) NRCS may obtain input from Federal or State agencies, conservation districts, or other organizations in program administration. No determination by these agencies or organizations will compel NRCS to take any action which NRCS determines does not serve the purposes of the program established by this part.
(d) Applications may be submitted on a continuous basis or in response to specific program solicitations. NRCS may announce one or more application
cut-off dates for funding consideration within a given fiscal year.
(e) The Chief may allocate funds for purposes related to: Encouraging enrollment by beginning farmers or ranchers, socially disadvantaged farmers or ranchers, limited resource farmers or ranchers, Indian Tribes, and veteran farmers or ranchers as authorized by 16 U.S.C. 3844; implementing landscape and related initiatives, special pilot programs for easement management and monitoring; agreements with other agencies and organizations to assist with program implementation; coordination of easement enrollment across State boundaries; coordination of the development of easement plans for ACEP-WRE or conservation plans for ACEP-ALE; or for other goals of the ACEP found in this part.
(f) NRCS may delegate at any time its ACEP-WRE monitoring or management responsibilities to conservation organizations that have appropriate authority, expertise and technical and financial resources, as determined by NRCS, to carry out such delegated responsibilities.
(g) NRCS may delegate at any time its ACEP-WRE monitoring, management, or enforcement responsibilities to other Federal or State agencies that have the appropriate authority, expertise, and technical and financial resources, as determined by NRCS, to carry out such delegated responsibilities.
(h) For ACEP-ALEs, the easement holder is responsible to ensure the easement is monitored on an annual basis and to provide annually to NRCS a monitoring report. For ACEP-WREs, NRCS or its delegate, is responsible to monitor the easement on an annual basis and comply with applicable reporting requirements.
(i) No delegation in the administration of this part to lower organizational levels will preclude the Chief from making any determinations under this part, redelegating to other organizational levels, or from reversing or modifying any determination made under this part.
(j) The Chief may modify or waive nonstatutory, discretionary provisions of this part if the Chief determines the waiver of such discretionary provision is necessary to further the purposes of ACEP as part of an ACEP-ALE buy-protect-sell transaction or under the ACEP-WRE wetland reserve enhancement partnership option. The waiver must further ACEP purposes and be consistent with the specific ACEP-WRE or ACEP-ALE conservation purposes and objectives. No waiver will result in reducing the quality of wetland functions and values restored under ACEP-WRE, or the protection of agricultural viability under ACEP-ALE.
(k) To assist in ACEP implementation the Chief may also waive the applicability of the adjusted gross income limitation as authorized by section 1001D(b)(3) of the Food Security Act of 1985 for participating landowners if the Chief determines that environmentally sensitive land of special significance would be protected as a result of such waiver.
§ 1468.3
Definitions.
The definitions in this section apply to this part, and all documents issued in accordance with this part, unless specified otherwise:
30-year Contract
means an ACEP-WRE contract that is for a duration of 30 years and is limited to acreage owned by Indian Tribes.
Access
means legal and physical ingress and egress to the entire easement area over adjacent or contiguous lands for the exercise of any of the rights or interests under the easement for the duration of its term for the purposes of the program. Access for easement enrollments must be described in the easement deed.
Acreage owned by Indian Tribes
means lands held in private ownership by an Indian Tribe or individual Tribal member and lands held in trust by a native corporation, Tribe, or the Bureau of Indian Affairs. This land may be also be referred to as “Tribal land.”
Agreement
means the document that specifies the rights, requirements, and responsibilities of NRCS and any persons, legal entities, or eligible entities participating in the program or any document that authorizes the transfer of assistance between NRCS and a third party for provision of authorized goods and services associated with program implementation. Agreements
may include but are not limited to an agreement to purchase, an ALE-agreement, a buy-protect-sell arrangement, a wetland reserve easement restoration agreement, a cooperative agreement, a grant agreement, a partnership agreement, or an interagency agreement.
Agreement to purchase
means the legal document that is the equivalent of a real estate purchase and sale contract. The landowner signs the agreement to purchase, which is the authorization for NRCS to proceed with the ACEP-WRE acquisition process.
Agricultural commodity
means any agricultural commodity planted and produced in a State by annual tilling of the soil, including tilling by one-trip planters or sugarcane planted and produced in a State.
Agricultural land easement
means an easement or other interest in eligible land that is conveyed for the purposes of protecting natural resources and the agricultural nature of the land, and of promoting agricultural viability for future generations, and permits the landowner the right to continue agricultural production and related uses.
Agricultural land easement plan
means a document developed by the eligible entity that describes the activities which promote the long-term viability of the land to meet the purposes for which the easement was acquired. An agricultural land easement plan includes a description of the farm or ranch management system and the natural resource concerns on the land, describes the conservation measures and practices that may be implemented to address applicable resource concerns for which the easement was enrolled, and incorporates by reference any component plans such as a grasslands management plan, forest management plan, or conservation plan as defined in this part.
Agricultural uses
means those activities defined by a State's farm or ranch land protection program or where no program exists, by the State agricultural use tax assessment program. However, if NRCS determines that a State definition of agricultural use is so broad that an included use would constitute a violation of Federal law, limit future agricultural viability, degrade soils or the agricultural nature of the land or the related natural resources, NRCS reserves the right to impose greater deed restrictions on the property to be subject to an agricultural land easement. These deed restrictions would narrow the State definition of agricultural use in order to meet Federal law, or to protect soils, the agricultural nature of the land, or related natural resources.
ALE-agreement
means the document that outlines the rights, requirements, roles, and responsibilities of NRCS and eligible entities participating in the program under subpart B, including cost-share payment provisions.
At-risk species
means any plant or animal species listed as threatened or endangered; proposed or candidate for listing under the Endangered Species Act; a species listed as threatened or endangered under State law or Tribal law on Tribal land; State or Tribal land species of conservation concern; or other plant or animal species or community, as determined by the State conservationist, with advice from the State technical committee or Tribal Conservation Advisory Council, that has undergone, or is likely to undergo, population decline and may become imperiled without direct intervention.
Beginning farmer or rancher
means a person, Indian Tribe, Tribal corporation, or legal entity who:
(1) Has not operated a farm, ranch, or non-industrialized private forest land (NIPF), or who has operated a farm, ranch, or NIPF for not more than 10 consecutive years. This requirement applies to all members of an entity who will materially and substantially participate in the operation of the farm, ranch, or NIPF.
(2) In the case of an individual, individually, or with the immediate family, material and substantial participation requires that the individual provide substantial day-to-day labor and management of the farm, ranch, or NIPF consistent with the practices in the county or State where the farm is located.
(3) In the case of a legal entity or joint operation, all members must materially and substantially participate in the operation of the farm, ranch, or NIPF . Material and substantial participation requires that each of the
members provide some amount of the management or labor and management necessary for day-to-day activities, such that if each of the members did not provide these inputs, operation of the farm, ranch, or NIPF would be seriously impaired.
Buy-Protect-Sell transaction
means a legal arrangement between an eligible entity and NRCS relating to land owned or being purchased by an eligible entity on a transitional basis during which an agricultural land easement will be secured on eligible private or Tribal land, and ownership of the land transferred to a qualified farmer or rancher following conditions specified in this part.
Certified entity
means an eligible entity that NRCS has determined to meet the certification requirements in § 1468.26 for the purposes of ACEP-ALE.
Chief
means the Chief of the Natural Resources Conservation Service or the person delegated the authority to act for the Chief.

Compatible use
means a use or activity conducted on a wetland reserve easement that NRCS determines, in its sole discretion, is consistent with the long-term protection and enhancement of the wetland and other natural values of the easement area when performed according to amount, method, location, timing, frequency, intensity, and duration limitations prescribed by NRCS.
Conservation plan
is for ACEP-ALE the document that—
(1) Applies to highly erodible cropland;
(2) Describes the conservation-system applicable to the highly erodible cropland and describes the decisions of the person with respect to location, land use, tillage systems, and conservation treatment measures and schedules and where appropriate, may include conversion of highly erodible cropland to less intensive uses; and
(3) Is developed in accordance with 7 CFR part 12.
Conservation practice
means a specified treatment, such as a vegetative, structural, or land management practice, that is planned and applied according to NRCS standards and specifications.
Conservation Reserve Program (CRP)
means the program administered by the CCC as required by 16 U.S.C. 3831-3836.
Converted wetland
means a wetland that has been drained, dredged, filled, leveled, or otherwise manipulated (including the removal of woody vegetation or any activity that results in impairing or reducing the flow, circulation, or reach of water) for the purpose of, or to have the effect of, making possible the production of an agricultural commodity if such production would not have been possible but for such action, and before such action such land was wetland, farmed wetland, or farmed-wetland pasture and was neither highly erodible land nor highly erodible cropland.
Cost-share payment
means the payment made by NRCS to an eligible entity for the purchase of an ACEP-ALE easement as set forth in subpart B of this part.
Dedicated fund
means an account held by a certified nongovernmental organization which is sufficiently capitalized for the purpose of covering expenses associated with the management, monitoring, and enforcement of agricultural land easements and where such account cannot be used for other purposes.

Easement area
means the portion of a parcel that is encumbered by an ACEP easement.
Easement exchange
means a real estate transaction where NRCS, on behalf of the United States and in its sole discretion, relinquishes all or a portion of its rights or interests in an easement which are replaced by similar rights or interests in an easement that
have equivalent or greater conservation value, acreage, and economic value to the United States on land that is not adjacent to the original easement area. NRCS is not required to exchange any of its rights or interests in an easement, and easement exchanges are discretionary, voluntary, real estate transactions between the United States, landowner, and other parties with an interest in the easement.
Easement modification
means a real estate transaction where NRCS, on behalf of the United States and in its sole discretion, agrees to adjust the boundaries or terms of an easement that will result in equivalent or greater conservation value, acreage, and economic value to the United States, and the modification only involves lands within or physically adjacent to the original easement area. NRCS is not required to modify any of its rights or interests in an easement, and easement modifications are discretionary, voluntary, real estate transactions between the United States, landowner, and other parties with an interest in the easement that are subject to the requirements of this part.
Easement payment
means the consideration paid to a participant or their assignee for an easement conveyed to the United States under the ACEP-WRE, or the consideration paid to an Indian Tribe or Tribal members for entering into 30-year contracts under ACEP-WRE.
Easement restoration agreement
means the agreement or contract NRCS enters into with the landowner or a third party to implement the WRPO on a wetland reserve easement or 30-year contract.
Easement subordination
means a real estate transaction where NRCS, on behalf of the United States and in its sole discretion, agrees to subordinate all or a portion of its rights or interests in an easement. NRCS is not required to subordinate any of its rights or interests in an easement, and easement subordinations are discretionary, voluntary, real estate transactions between the United States, landowner, and other parties with an interest in the easement that are subject to the requirements of this part. As determined by NRCS, the subordination must be in the public interest or further the practical administration of the program, minimally affect the easement acreage, and increase or have limited negative effects on the conservation values of the easement area.
Easement termination
means a real estate transaction where NRCS, on behalf of the United States and in its sole discretion, agrees to terminate all or a portion of its rights or interests in an easement. The termination must address a compelling public need for which there is no practicable alternative even with avoidance and minimization of adverse impacts and must facilitate the practical administration of the program. The United States must be provided full compensation for such termination and any costs and damages related to the termination. NRCS is not required to terminate any of its rights or interests in an easement, and easement terminations are discretionary, voluntary, real estate transactions between the United States, landowner, and other parties that are subject to the requirements of this part. Unless and until the parties enter into a binding termination agreement, any party may withdraw its approval of a termination proposal at any time during the termination process.
Eligible activity
means an action other than a conservation practice that has the effect of alleviating problems or improving the condition of the resources, such as ensuring proper management or maintenance of the wetland functions and values restored, protected, or enhanced through an ACEP-WRE easement or 30-year contract as identified in the WRPO.
Eligible entity
means an Indian Tribe, State government, local government, or a nongovernmental organization that has a farmland or grassland protection program that purchases agricultural land easements for the purposes of protecting:
(1) The agricultural use and future viability, and related conservation values, of eligible land by limiting nonagricultural uses of that land that negatively affect the agricultural uses and conservation values; or
(2) Grazing uses and related conservation values by restoring or conserving eligible land.

Farm and ranch land of statewide importance
means, in addition to prime and unique farmland, land that is of statewide importance for the production of food, feed, fiber, forage, biofuels, and oilseed crops. Criteria for defining and delineating this land are to be determined by the appropriate State agency or agencies. Generally, additional farmlands of statewide importance include those that are nearly prime farmland and that economically produce high yields of crops when treated and managed according to acceptable farming methods. Some may produce as high a yield as prime farmlands if conditions are favorable. In some States, additional farmlands of statewide importance may include tracts of land that have been designated for agriculture by State law in accordance with 7 CFR part 657.
Farm or ranch succession plan
means a general plan to address the continuation of some type of agricultural business on the enrolled land.

# Editorial Note:
At 86 FR 8130, Feb. 4, 2021, § 1468.3 was amended; however, the amendment could not be incorporated due to inaccurate amendatory instruction.
§ 1468.4
Appeals.
(a)
ACEP-ALE eligibility of entities.
An entity which has submitted an ACEP-ALE application to be considered an eligible entity may obtain a review of any administrative determination concerning their eligibility for participation utilizing the administrative appeal regulations provided in 7 CFR parts 11 and 614.
(b)
ACEP-WRE applicants and participants.
An applicant or participant in the ACEP-WRE may obtain a review of any administrative determination concerning eligibility for participation or receipt of payment utilizing the administrative appeal regulations provided in 7 CFR parts 11 and 614.
(c)
Easement administration and management determinations under ACEP after easement closing.
NRCS determinations that are made pursuant to its rights or interests in an ACEP-funded easement after closing may only be appealed to the State conservationist as specified in the notice provided to the landowner or easement holder when NRCS exercises its rights under the easement. Such determinations are not subject to appeal under 7 CFR parts 11 or 614.
§ 1468.5
Scheme or device.
(a) In addition to other penalties, sanctions, or remedies that may apply, if it is determined by NRCS that anyone has employed a scheme or device to defeat the purposes of this part, any part of any program payment otherwise due or paid during the applicable period may be withheld or be required to be refunded with interest, thereon, as determined appropriate by NRCS.
(b) A scheme or device includes, but is not limited to, coercion, fraud, misrepresentation, depriving anyone of a program benefit, or for the purpose of obtaining a payment to which they would otherwise not be entitled.
§ 1468.6
Subordination, exchange, modification, and termination.
(a) After an easement has been recorded, no subordination, modification, exchange, or termination will be made in any interest in land, or portion of such interest, except as approved by the NRCS. NRCS may approve such easement administration actions if NRCS determines, in accordance with the sequencing considerations under the National Environmental Policy Act, that—
(1)(i) The subordination, modification, or exchange action results in no net loss of easement acres, and is in the public interest or will further the practical administration and management of the easement area or the program, as determined by the NRCS, or
(ii) The termination action will address a compelling public need for which there is no practicable alternative even with avoidance and minimization, and will further the practical
administration and management of the easement area or the program, as determined by the NRCS.
(2) For modification or exchange actions—
(i) There is no reasonable alternative that would avoid the easement area, or if the easement area cannot be avoided entirely, then the preferred alternative must minimize impacts to the original easement area and its conservation functions and values to the greatest extent practicable and any remaining adverse impacts must be mitigated, as determined by NRCS, at no cost to the government,
(ii) The action is consistent with the original intent of the easement and is consistent with the purposes of the program, and
(iii) The action results in equal or greater conservation functions and value and equal or greater economic value to the United States. A determination of equal or greater economic value to the United States will be made in accordance with an approved easement valuation methodology for agricultural land easements under subpart B or for wetland reserve easements under subpart C. In addition to the value of the easement itself, NRCS may consider other financial investments it has made in the acquisition, restoration, and management of the original easement to ensure that the easement administration action results in equal or greater economic value to the United States.
(3) For subordination actions, the action—
(i) Increases conservation functions and values or has a limited negative effect on conservation functions and values;
(ii) Is at no cost to the Government; and
(iii) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(5) of this section, will only minimally affect the acreage subject to the interest in land.
(4) For termination actions, the action—
(i) Is in the interest of the Federal Government; and
(ii) The United States will be fully compensated for the fair market value of the interest in land including any costs and damages related to the termination.
(5) The easement administration action will not affect more than 10 percent of the original easement area unless NRCS determines that it is impracticable to achieve program purposes on the original easements area, in which case NRCS may authorize a greater percentage of the original easement area to be affected.
(6) The landowner and, if applicable, the agricultural land easement holder agrees to such easement administration action prior to NRCS considering that such easement administration action may be approved.
(b) Easement subordinations or modifications are preferred to easement exchanges that may involve lands that are not physically adjacent to the original easement area. Easement exchanges are limited to circumstances where there are no available lands adjacent to the original easement area that will result in equal or greater conservation and economic values to the United States.
(c) Replacement of easement acres as part of an easement exchange must occur within the same State and within the same eight-digit watershed as determined by the hydrologic unit codes developed by the U.S. Geological Survey.
(d) Where NRCS determines that recordation of an amended or new easement deed is necessary to affect an easement administration action under this section, NRCS may use the most recent version of the ACEP deed document or deed terms approved by NRCS. The amended or new easement deed must be duly prepared and recorded in conformity with standard real estate practices, including requirements for title approval, subordination of liens, and recordation of documents.
(e) Modification or exchange of all or a portion of an interest in land enrolled in ACEP-ALE may not increase any payment to an easement holder.
(f)(1) A termination action must meet criteria identified in this part and are limited to those circumstances where NRCS determines it is in the Federal Government's interest to terminate all or a portion of the interest in the land enrolled in the program,
that the purposes of the program can no longer be achieved on the original easement area, or the terms of the easement are no longer enforceable and there are no acceptable replacement acres available.
(2) NRCS will enter into a compensatory agreement with the proponent of the termination that identifies the costs for which the United States must be reimbursed, including but not limited to the value of the easement itself based upon current valuation methodologies, repayment of legal boundary survey costs, legal title work costs, associated easement purchase and restoration costs, legal filing fees, costs relating to the termination, and any damages determined appropriate by NRCS.
(3) At least 90 days prior to taking any termination action, written notice of such termination action will be provided to the Committee on Agriculture of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry of the Senate.
(g) Insofar as is consistent with the easement and applicable law, NRCS may approve modifications to an easement plan that do not affect provisions of the easement. Easement plans include any conservation plan, WRPO, wetland reserve easement restoration agreements, grazing management plan, habitat management plans, or other plans required as a condition of enrollment. Any easement plan modification must meet this part and must result in equal or greater conservation benefits on the enrolled land.

§ 1468.7
Transfer of land.
(a)
Offers voided.
Any transfer of the property prior to recording the easement in the applicable land records or executing the 30-year contract may void the availability of ACEP funding for that transaction, unless the new landowner is determined eligible, the transfer is approved by NRCS, and the new landowner is willing to comply with ACEP requirements.
(b)
Payments to participants.
For wetland reserve easements with annual installment payments, any remaining easement payments will be made to the original participants unless NRCS receives an assignment of proceeds.
(c)
Claims to payments.
With respect to any and all payments owed to participants, NRCS will bear no responsibility for any full payments or partial distributions of funds between the original participant and the participant's successor. In the event of a dispute or claim on the distribution of payments, NRCS may withhold payments without the accrual of interest pending an agreement or adjudication on the rights to the funds.
§ 1468.8
Payments not subject to claims.
Any cost-share, contract, agreement, or easement payment or portion, thereof, due any person, legal entity, Indian Tribe, eligible entity, or other party under this part will be allowed without regard to any claim or lien in favor of any creditor, except agencies of the United States.
§ 1468.9
Assignments.
Any person, legal entity, Indian Tribe, eligible entity, or other party entitled to any cash payment under this program may assign the right to receive such cash payments, in whole or in part.
§ 1468.10
Environmental markets.
(a)
Ecosystem services credits for conservation improvements under a wetland reserve easement.
Landowners may obtain environmental credits under other programs if one of the purposes of such program is the facilitation of additional conservation benefits that are consistent with the conservation purposes for which the easement was acquired, and such action does not adversely affect the rights or interests granted under the easement to the United States.
(b)
Ecosystem services credits related to an agricultural land easement.
Landowners may obtain environmental credits under other programs if one of the purposes of such program is the facilitation of additional conservation benefits that are consistent with the conservation purposes for which the easement was acquired, and such action does not adversely affect the interests granted under the easement to
the grantee or to the United States right of enforcement.
(c)
Voluntary action.
ACEP funds may not be used to acquire easements to establish protections or to implement conservation practices that the landowner is required to establish as a result of a court order or to satisfy any mitigation requirement for which the ACEP landowner is otherwise responsible.

(a) To apply for enrollment an eligible entity must submit an entity application for an ALE-agreement and any associated individual parcel applications to NRCS. For buy-protect-sell transactions, additional information may be required at the time of application as identified by NRCS.
(b) NRCS may conduct initial eligibility determinations for the fiscal year an application is submitted. As determined by NRCS, the entity eligibility requirements must be met for the fiscal year in which the ALE-agreement is executed, and the land and landowner must be eligible for the fiscal year the parcel is approved for funding through an ALE-agreement. NRCS eligibility determinations are based on the application materials provided by the eligible entity, onsite assessments, and the criteria in § 1468.20.
§ 1468.22
Establishing priorities, ranking considerations, and project selection.
(a) NRCS will use national and State criteria to rank and select eligible parcels for funding. The national ranking criteria will comprise at least half of the ranking score. The State criteria will be developed by NRCS on a State-by-State basis, with input from the State technical committee. The weighting of ranking criteria, including adjustments to account for geographic differences, will be developed to maximize the benefit of the Federal investment under the program. Parcels are ranked and selected for funding at the State level.
(b) The national ranking criteria are—
(1) Percent of prime, unique, and other important farmland soils in the parcel to be protected;
(2) Percent of cropland, rangeland, grassland, historic grassland, pastureland, or nonindustrial private forest land in the parcel to be protected;
(3) Ratio of the total acres of land in the parcel to be protected to average farm size in the county according to the most recent USDA Census of Agriculture;
(4) Decrease in the percentage of acreage of farm and ranch land in the county in which the parcel is located between the last two USDA Censuses of Agriculture;
(5) Percent population growth in the county as documented by the United States Census;
(6) Population density (population per square mile) as documented by the most recent United States Census;
(7) Existence of a farm or ranch succession plan or similar plan established to address agricultural viability for future generations;
(8) Proximity of the parcel to other protected land, such as military installations; land owned in fee title by the United States or an Indian Tribe, State or local government, or by a nongovernmental organization whose purpose is to protect agricultural use and related conservation values; or land that is already subject to an easement or deed restriction that limits the conversion of the land to nonagricultural use or protects grazing uses and related conservation values;
(9) Proximity of the parcel to other agricultural operations and agricultural infrastructure;
(10) Maximizing the protection of contiguous or proximal acres devoted to agricultural use;
(11) Whether the land is currently enrolled in CRP in a contract that is set to expire within 1 year and is grassland that would benefit from protection under a long-term easement or is land under a CRP contract that is in transition to a covered farmer or rancher pursuant to 16 U.S.C. 3835(f);
(12) Decrease in the percentage of acreage of permanent grassland, pasture, and rangeland, other than cropland and woodland pasture, in the county in which the parcel is located between the last two USDA Censuses of Agriculture;
(13) Percent of the fair market value of the agricultural land easement that is the eligible entity's own cash resources for payment of easement compensation to the landowner and comes from sources other than the landowner; and
(14) Other criteria as determined by NRCS.
(c) State or local criteria as determined by NRCS, with advice of the State technical committee, may only include—
(1) The location of a parcel in an area zoned for agricultural use;
(2) The eligible entity's performance in managing and enforcing easements. Performance must be measured by the efficiency by which easement transactions are completed or percentage of parcels that have been monitored annually and the percentage of monitoring results that have been reported annually;
(3) Multifunctional benefits of farm and ranch land protection including—
(i) Social, economic, historic, and archaeological benefits;
(ii) Enhancing carbon sequestration;
(iii) Improving climate change resiliency;
(iv) At-risk species protection;
(v) Reducing nutrient runoff and improving water quality;
(vi) Other related conservation benefits.

(5) Diversity of natural resources to be protected or improved;
(6) Score in the land evaluation and site assessment system as identified in 7 CFR part 658 or equivalent measure for grassland enrollments, to serve as a measure of agricultural viability (access to markets and infrastructure);
(7) Measures that will be used to maintain or increase agricultural viability, such as succession plans, agricultural land easement plans, or entity deed terms that specifically address long-term agricultural viability; and
(8) Other criteria determined by NRCS that will account for geographic differences provided such criteria allow for the selection of parcels that will achieve ACEP-ALE purposes and continue to maximize the benefit of the Federal investment under the program.
(d) If NRCS determines that the purchase of two or more agricultural land easements are comparable in achieving program goals, NRCS will not assign a higher priority to any one of these agricultural land easements solely on the basis of lesser cost to the program.
(e) NRCS will rank all eligible parcels that have been submitted prior to an application cut-off date in accordance with the national and State ranking criteria before selecting parcels for funding.
(f) Eligible parcels selected for funding by NRCS will be identified in an agreement executed by NRCS and an eligible entity, either as part of the ALE-agreement or through a supplemental arrangement as agreed to by the parties.

# Subpart C—Wetland Reserve Easements
§ 1468.30
Program requirements.
(a)
General.
(1) Under the ACEP-WRE, NRCS may purchase wetland reserve easements from eligible landowners who voluntarily cooperate to restore, protect, and enhance wetlands on eligible private or Tribal lands. A 30-year contract enrollment option is also available for acreage owned by Indian Tribes.
(2) To participate in ACEP-WRE, a landowner must agree to the implementation of a WRPO, the effect of which is to restore, protect, enhance, maintain, manage, and monitor the hydrologic conditions of inundation or saturation of the soil, native vegetation, and natural topography of eligible lands.
(3) NRCS may provide financial assistance through an easement restoration agreement for the conservation practices and eligible activities that promote the restoration, protection, enhancement, maintenance, and management of wetland functions and values and associated habitats.
(4) For ACEP-WRE enrollments, NRCS may implement such conservation practices and eligible activities through an agreement with the landowner, a contract with a vendor, an interagency agreement, or a cooperative agreement. The specific restoration, protection, enhancement, maintenance, and management actions authorized by NRCS, may be undertaken by the landowner, NRCS, or its designee.
(5) The duration of a wetland reserve easement may be either perpetual, 30-years, or the maximum duration allowed by State law. The duration of a 30-year contract on acreage owned by Indian Tribes is 30 years.
(b)
Acreage limitations.
(1) No more than 25 percent of the total cropland in any county, as determined by the FSA, may be enrolled in CRP and ACEP-WRE, and no more than 15 percent of the total cropland in the county may be subject to an easement under ACEP-WRE.
(2) The limitations in paragraph (b)(1) of this section do not apply to areas devoted to windbreaks or
shelterbelts after November 28, 1990, or to cropland designated by NRCS with “subclass w” in the land capability classes IV through VIII because of severe use limitations due to factors related to excess water such as poor soil drainage, wetness, high water table, soil saturation, or inundation.
(3) NRCS and the FSA will concur before a waiver of the 25-percent limit of paragraph (b)(1) of this section can be approved for an easement proposed for enrollment in ACEP-WRE. Such a waiver will only be approved if the waiver will not adversely affect the local economy, and operators in the county are having difficulties complying with the conservation plans implemented under 16 U.S.C. 3812.
(c)
Landowner eligibility.
To be eligible to enroll in the ACEP-WRE, all landowners must be in compliance with the highly erodible land and wetland conservation provisions in 7 CFR part 12. Persons or legal entities must be in compliance with the Adjusted Gross Income Limitation provisions at 7 CFR part 1400 and:
(1) Be the landowner of eligible land for which enrollment is sought;
(2) Provide any documentation required by NRCS as necessary to determine eligibility; and
(3) For easement applications, have been the landowner of such land for the 24-month period prior to the time of application unless it is determined by NRCS that:
(i) The land was acquired by will or succession as a result of the death of the previous landowner or pursuant to the terms of an existing trust,
(ii) The ownership change occurred due to foreclosure on the land and the owner of the land immediately before the foreclosure exercises a right of redemption from the mortgage holder in accordance with State law, or
(iii) The land was acquired under circumstances that give adequate assurances, as determined by NRCS, that such land was not acquired for the purposes of placing it in the program. Adequate assurances will include documentation that the change of ownership resulted from circumstances such as:
(A) The prior landowner owned the land for 2 years or more and transferred ownership amongst members of the immediate family (father, mother, spouse, children, grandparents, or grandchildren),
(B) A completion of a contract for deed entered into 24 months or more prior to the application date,
(C) The new landowner had leased the land for agricultural purposes for 24 months or more prior to the application date, or
(D) The easement area is a portion of a larger property where the majority portion was acquired for agriculture purposes.
(4) Agree to provide such information to NRCS as the agency deems necessary to assist in its determination of eligibility for program benefits and for other program implementation purposes.
(d)
New landowner.
When a parcel of land that has been accepted for enrollment into the ACEP-WRE is sold or transferred prior to NRCS purchase of the easement, NRCS will cancel the application or agreement to purchase and remove the acres from enrollment unless the new landowner meets the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section and accepts the terms and conditions of enrollment. The new landowner must submit required documentation for NRCS review and execute any required agreements or contracts. The decision to approve and execute an enrollment transferred prior to closing is at NRCS's discretion.
(e)
Land eligibility.
(1) Only private land or acreage owned by an Indian Tribe may be considered for enrollment into ACEP-WRE.
(2) NRCS will determine whether land is eligible for enrollment and whether, once found eligible, the lands may be included in the program based on the likelihood of successful restoration of such land and resultant wetland functions and values merit inclusion of such land in the program when considering the cost of acquiring the easement and the cost of the restoration, protection, enhancement, maintenance, management, and monitoring.
(3) Land will only be considered eligible for enrollment in the ACEP-WRE if NRCS determines that the enrollment
of such land maximizes wildlife benefits and wetland function and values.
(4) To be determined eligible, NRCS must also determine that such land is—
(i) Farmed wetland or converted wetland, together with adjacent lands that are functionally dependent on the wetlands, if such land is identified by NRCS as:
(A) Wetlands farmed under natural conditions, farmed wetlands, prior converted cropland, commenced conversion wetlands, farmed wetland pastures, and agricultural lands substantially altered by flooding so as to develop and retain wetland functions and values; or
(B) Former or degraded wetlands that occur on lands that have been used or are currently being used for the production of food and fiber, including rangeland and forest production lands, where the hydrology has been significantly degraded or modified and will be substantially restored; or
(C) Farmed wetland and adjoining land enrolled in CRP that has the highest wetland functions and values and is likely to return to production after the land leaves CRP; or
(D) A riparian area along a stream or other waterway that links, or after restoring the riparian area, will link wetlands protected by the ACEP-WRE easement, another easement, or other device or circumstance that achieves the same objectives as an ACEP-WRE easement.
(ii) Cropland or grassland that was used for agricultural production prior to flooding from the natural overflow of—
(A) A closed basin lake, together with adjacent land that is functionally dependent upon it, if the State or other entity is willing to provide a 50-percent share of the cost of the easement; or
(B) A pothole and adjacent land that is functionally dependent on it; and
(C) The size of the parcel offered for enrollment is a minimum of 20 contiguous acres. Such land meets the requirement of likelihood of successful restoration only if the soils are hydric and the depth of water is 6.5 feet or less.
(5) If land offered for enrollment is determined eligible under this section, then NRCS may also enroll land adjacent or contiguous to such eligible land together with the eligible land, if such land maximizes wildlife benefits and contributes significantly to wetland functions and values. Such adjacent or contiguous land may include buffer areas, created wetlands, noncropped natural wetlands, riparian areas that do not meet the requirements of paragraph (e)(4)(i)(D) of this section, and restored wetlands, but not more than NRCS, in consultation with the State technical committee, determines is necessary to maximize wildlife benefits and contribute significantly to wetland functions and values. NRCS will not enroll as eligible adjacent or contiguous land any constructed wetlands that treat wastewater or contaminated runoff.
(6) To be enrolled in the program, eligible land must have sufficient access and be configured in a size and with boundaries that allow for the efficient management and monitoring of the area for program purposes and otherwise promote and enhance program objectives as determined by NRCS.
(f)
Enrollment of CRP lands.
Land subject to an existing CRP contract may be enrolled in ACEP-WRE only if the land and landowner meet the requirements of this part and the enrollment is requested by the landowner and agreed to by NRCS. To enroll in ACEP-WRE, the CRP contract for the property must be terminated or otherwise modified subject to such terms and conditions as are mutually agreed upon by FSA and the landowner.
(g)
Ineligible land.
The land specified in paragraphs (g)(1) through (7) of this section is not eligible for enrollment in the ACEP-WRE:
(1) Converted wetlands if the conversion was commenced after December 23, 1985;
(2) Land established to trees under the CRP, except in cases where the land meets all other WRE eligibility criteria, the established cover conforms to WRE restoration requirements and NRCS specifications, an active CRP contract will be terminated or otherwise modified upon purchase of the WRE easement, and any additional
criteria NRCS uses to determine if enrollment of such lands would further the purposes of the program;
(3) Lands owned by the United States other than held in trust for Indian Tribes;
(4) Lands owned in fee title by a State, including an agency or a subdivision of a State or a unit of local government;
(5) Land subject to an easement or deed restriction which, as determined by NRCS, provides similar restoration and protection of wetland functions and values as would be provided by enrollment in ACEP-WRE;
(6) Lands where the purposes of the program or implementation of restoration practices would be undermined due to onsite or offsite conditions, including, but not limited to—
(i) Risk of hazardous materials or petroleum products either onsite or offsite;
(ii) Permitted or existing rights of way, either onsite or offsite, for infrastructure development;
(iii) Adjacent land uses, such as airports, that would either impede complete restoration or prevent wetland functions and values from being fully restored; or
(7) Land which NRCS determines to have unacceptable exceptions to clear title or legal access that is encumbered, nontransferable, restricted, or otherwise insufficient.
§ 1468.31
Application procedures.
(a)
Application for participation.
To apply for enrollment, a landowner must submit an application to NRCS.
(b)
Preliminary agency action.
By filing an application, the landowner consents to an NRCS representative entering upon the land for purposes of assessing the wetland functions and values and for other activities, such as the ranking and development of the preliminary WRPO, that are necessary or desirable for NRCS to evaluate applications. The landowner is entitled to accompany an NRCS representative on any site visits.
(c)
Voluntary reduction in costs.
In order to enhance the probability of enrollment in ACEP-WRE, the landowner or someone other than the landowner may offer to contribute financially to the cost of the acquisition or restoration of the wetland reserve easement to leverage Federal funds. This offer must be made in writing to NRCS.
§ 1468.32
Establishing priorities, ranking consideration, and project selection.
(a) When evaluating easements or 30-year contract applications from landowners, NRCS, with advice from the State technical committee, may consider:
(1) The conservation benefits of obtaining an easement or other interest in the land, including but not limited to—
(i) Habitat that will be restored for the benefit of migratory birds and wetland-dependent wildlife, including diversity of wildlife that will be benefitted or life-cycle needs that will be addressed;
(ii) Extent and use of habitat that will be restored for threatened, endangered, or other at-risk species or number of different at-risk species benefitted;
(iii) Protection or restoration of native vegetative communities;
(iv) Habitat diversity and complexity to be restored;
(v) Proximity and connectivity to other protected habitats;
(vi) Extent of beneficial adjacent land uses;
(vii) Proximity to impaired water bodies;
(viii) Extent of wetland losses within a geographic area, including wetlands generally or specific wetland types;
(ix) Capacity of the wetland to improve water quality;
(x) Hydrology restoration potential, which must comprise at least 50 percent of the points for conservation benefits.
(2) The cost effectiveness of each easement;
(3) Whether the landowner or another person or entity is offering to contribute financially to the cost of the easement or other interest in the land to leverage Federal funds;
(4) The extent to which the purposes of this part would be achieved on the land;
(5) The productivity of the land;
(6) The on-farm and off-farm environmental threats if the land is used for the production of agricultural commodities;
(7) Such other factors as NRCS determines are necessary to carry out the purposes of the program.
(b) To the extent practicable, taking into consideration costs and future agricultural and food needs, NRCS will give priority to—
(1) Obtaining permanent easements over shorter term easements; and
(2) Acquiring easements based on the value of the easement for protecting and enhancing habitat for migratory birds and other wetland-dependent wildlife or improving water quality, in coordination with FWS at the local level, as may be appropriate.
(c) NRCS, in consultation with the State technical committee, may place higher priority on—
(1) Certain land types or geographic regions of the State where restoration of wetlands may better achieve State and regional goals and objectives; and
(2) Land that is currently enrolled in CRP in a contract that is set to expire within 1 year from the date of application or land under a CRP contract that is in transition to a covered farmer or rancher pursuant to 16 U.S.C. 3835(f), and such land and is farmed wetland and adjoining land that has the highest wetland functions and values and is likely to return to production after the land leaves CRP.
(d) Notwithstanding any limitation of this part regarding priority ranking, NRCS may enroll eligible lands at any time to encompass total wetland areas subject to multiple ownership or otherwise to achieve program objectives. NRCS may, at any time, exclude enrollment of otherwise eligible lands if the participation of the adjacent landowners is essential to the successful restoration of the wetlands and those adjacent landowners are unwilling or ineligible to participate.

§ 1468.33
Enrollment process.
(a)
Tentative selection.
Based on the priority ranking, NRCS will notify an affected landowner of tentative acceptance into the program.
(b)
Effect of notice of tentative selection.
The notice of tentative acceptance into the program does not bind NRCS or the United States to enroll the proposed project in ACEP-WRE, nor does it bind the landowner to continue with enrollment in the program. The notice informs the landowner of NRCS's intent to continue the enrollment process on their land.
(c)
Acceptance and effect of offer of enrollment
—(1)
Wetland reserve easement.
For applications requesting enrollment through a wetland reserve easement, NRCS will present an agreement to purchase to the landowner which will describe the easement area, the easement compensation amount, the easement terms and conditions, and other terms and conditions for participation that may be required by NRCS as appropriate. The easement compensation amount will be based upon the lowest of the fair market value of the land, the geographic area rate cap, or the landowner offer, as provided in § 1468.34 of this part. The landowner accepts enrollment in the ACEP-WRE by signing the agreement to purchase. NRCS will continue with easement acquisition activities after the property has been enrolled.
(2)
30-year contract.
For applications requesting enrollment of acreage owned by an Indian Tribe through the 30-year contract option, NRCS will present an agreement to enter 30-year contract to the Tribal landowner which will describe the contract area, the contract compensation amount, the contract terms and conditions, and other terms and conditions for participation that may be required by NRCS as appropriate. The Tribal landowner accepts enrollment in the ACEP-WRE by signing the agreement to enter 30-year contract. NRCS will proceed with implementation of the WRPO after the 30-year contract has been executed.
(d)
Restoration responsibility and the scope of enrollment.
(1) The agreement to purchase or agreement to enter 30-year contract is the enrollment document that establishes the terms of enrollment consistent with the terms and conditions of this part and identifies the—
(i) Scope of the agreement between NRCS and the landowner,
(ii) Basis for NRCS to obligate funds,
(iii) Nature and method through which NRCS will provide ACEP-WRE technical and financial assistance to the landowner, and
(iv) Withholding of the landowner's share of the restoration cost from the easement payment for applicable 30-year or nonpermanent easement or 30-year contract enrollments.
(2) The agreement to purchase between NRCS and the landowner under the easement option also constitutes the agreement for—
(i) Granting an easement on the enrolled land and sufficient access to the enrolled land as set forth under § 1468.37,
(ii) Implementing a WRPO which provides for the restoration, protection, and management of the wetland functions and values,
(iii) Recording the easement in accordance with applicable State law, and
(iv) Ensuring the title to the easement is superior to the rights of all others, except for exceptions to the title that are deemed acceptable by NRCS and in accordance with Department of Justice Title Standards.
(3) The terms of the easement identified in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section includes the landowner's agreement to the implementation of a WRPO identified in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section. In particular, the easement deed identifies that NRCS has the right to enter the easement area to undertake on its own or through an agreement with the landowner or other third party, any activities to restore, protect, enhance, manage, maintain, and monitor the wetland and other natural values of the easement area.
(4) At the time NRCS enters into an agreement to purchase, NRCS agrees, subject to paragraph (e) of this section, to acquire and provide for restoration of the land enrolled into the program.
(e)
Withdrawal of offer of enrollment.
Prior to execution of the easement deed or 30-year contract by the United States and the landowner, NRCS may withdraw the land from enrollment at any time due to lack of availability of funds, inability to clear title, insufficient access, sale of the land, risk of contamination from hazardous materials or petroleum products, or other reasons.
(f)
Landowner failure to accept enrollment offer in timely manner.
The offer of enrollment to the landowner will be void if not executed by the landowner within the time specified.
§ 1468.34

(a)
Determination of easement compensation values.
(1) Compensation for an easement or 30-year contract under this part will be made in cash in such amount as is agreed to and specified in the agreement to purchase or agreement to enter 30-year contract and finalized in the warranty easement deed or 30-year contract.
(2) Payments for 30-year easements, nonpermanent easements as limited by State law, or 30-year contracts will be not more than 75 percent of that which would have been paid for a permanent easement as determined by the methods listed in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
(3) NRCS will pay as compensation the lowest of the values from paragraphs (a)(3)(i) through (iii) of this section:
(i) The fair market value of the land using the Uniform Standards for Professional Appraisal Practices or based on an area-wide market analysis or survey,
(ii) The geographic area rate cap determined under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, or
(iii) A written offer made by the landowner.
(4) Each fiscal year NRCS, in consultation with the State technical committee, will establish one or more geographic area rate caps within a State. NRCS will determine the geographic area rate cap using the best information which is readily available in that State. Such information may include soil types, types of crops capable of being grown, production history, location, real estate market values, and tax rates and assessments.
(b)
Acceptance of offered easement compensation.
(1) NRCS will not acquire any easement unless the landowner accepts the amount of the easement payment offered by NRCS. The easement
payment may be less than the fair market value of the interests and rights to be conveyed by the landowner under the easement.
(2)(i) For easements or 30-year contracts valued at $500,000 or less, NRCS will provide compensation in up to 10 annual payments, as requested by the participant, as specified in the agreement to purchase or 30-year contract between NRCS and the participant.
(ii) For easements or 30-year contracts valued at more than $500,000, NRCS may provide compensation in at least 5, but not more than 10 annual payments. NRCS may provide compensation in a single payment for such easements or 30-year contracts when, as determined by the NRCS Chief, it would further the purposes of the program. The applicable payment schedule will be specified in the agreement to purchase or 30-year contract, entered into between NRCS and the landowner.
(c)
Reimbursement of a landowner's expenses.
For completed easement conveyances, NRCS will reimburse the landowner for fair and reasonable expenses, if any, incurred for legal boundary surveys and other related costs, as authorized and determined by NRCS.
(d)
Per-acre-basis-calculations.
If easement or 30-year contract compensation values are calculated on a per-acre basis, NRCS will identify an estimated amount in its agreement to purchase and the final easement or 30-year contract payment will be made based on final determination of value and acreage and specified in the warranty easement deed or 30-year contract.
§ 1468.35
Wetland Reserve Enhancement Partnerships.
(a) The purpose of the Wetland Reserve Enhancement Partnership (WREP) option is to target and leverage resources to address high priority wetland protection, restoration, and enhancement objectives through agreements with States (including a political subdivision or agency of a State), nongovernmental organizations, or Indian Tribes.
(b) NRCS will establish priorities for funding, required level of partner contribution of resources, ranking criteria, and other criteria. NRCS will prioritize proposals that address wetland restoration needs of national or regional importance, including special project or area-wide proposals.
(c) NRCS will make the information regarding WREP available to the public and potential partners.
(d) NRCS will evaluate proposals and make final funding selections based upon the priorities identified in the public notice of funding availability.
(e) NRCS will enter into WREP agreements with partners who have projects selected for funding.
§ 1468.36

(a) NRCS may provide financial assistance for implementing the WRPO on the enrolled land subject to an easement or 30-year contract. The amount and terms and conditions of the financial assistance will be subject to the restrictions in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section on the costs of establishing or installing conservation practices or eligible activities specified in the WRPO:
(1) On enrolled land subject to a permanent easement, NRCS will offer to pay at least 75 percent but not more than 100 percent of such costs; and
(2) On enrolled land subject to a 30-year or nonpermanent easement or 30-year contract, NRCS will offer to pay at least 50 percent but not more than 75 percent of such costs. The landowner's share of the WRPO implementation costs may be withheld from the easement or 30-year contract payment.
(b) Payments may be made only upon a determination by NRCS that an eligible conservation practice or component of the conservation practice has been implemented in compliance with appropriate NRCS standards and specifications; or an eligible activity has been implemented in compliance with the appropriate requirements detailed in the WRPO.
(c) Payments may be made for repair or replacement of an eligible conservation practice or activity, if NRCS determines that the conservation practice or eligible activity is still needed and that the disrepair or failure of the original conservation practice or eligible activity was due to reasons beyond the control of the participant.
(d) A participant may seek additional assistance from other public or private
organizations as long as the conservation practices or eligible activities funded are approved by NRCS and implemented in compliance with this part.
§ 1468.37
Easement and 30-year contract participation requirements.
(a)
Easement requirements.
(1) To enroll eligible land in ACEP-WRE through the permanent or 30-year easement option, a landowner will grant an easement to the United States. The easement will require that the easement area be maintained in accordance with ACEP-WRE goals and objectives for the duration of the term of the easement, including the restoration, protection, enhancement, maintenance, management, and monitoring of wetland and other land functions and values.
(2) For the duration of its term, the easement will require, at a minimum, that the landowner and the landowner's heirs, successors, and assigns will cooperate in the restoration, protection, enhancement, maintenance, management, and monitoring of the land in accordance with the warranty easement deed and with the terms of the WRPO. In addition, the easement will grant to the United States:
(i) A sufficient right of legal access to the easement area,
(ii) The right to authorize compatible uses of the easement area, including but not limited to such activities as hunting and fishing, managed timber harvest, water management, or periodic haying or grazing, if such use is consistent with the long-term protection and enhancement of the wetland resources for which the easement was established,
(iii) All rights, title, and interest in the easement area except those rights specifically reserved in the deed, and
(iv) The right to restore, protect, enhance, maintain, manage, and monitor activities on the easement area.
(3) The landowner will convey title to the easement in a manner that is acceptable to NRCS. The landowner will warrant that the easement granted to the United States is superior to the rights of all others, except for title exceptions deemed acceptable by NRCS.
(4) The participant will—
(i) Comply with the terms of the easement,
(ii) Comply with all terms and conditions of any related contract or agreement,
(iii) Agree to the permanent retirement of any existing cropland base and allotment history for the easement area, as determined by FSA,

(1) NRCS may include in the terms and conditions of an easement a provision under which the landowner reserves grazing rights if NRCS determines that the reservation and use of the grazing rights:
(i) Is compatible with the land subject to the wetland reserve easement or 30-year contract,
(ii) Is consistent with the historical natural uses of the land and long-term wetland restoration, protection, and enhancement goals for which the wetland reserve easement or 30-year contract was established,
(iii) Is subject to a recorded exhibit to the deed outlining grazing purposes and limitations, and
(iv) Complies with a WRPO developed by NRCS, which may include a grazing management plan component that is consistent with the WRPO and is reviewed and modified as necessary, at least every 5 years.
(2) Compensation for easements or 30-year contracts where the grazing rights are reserved under this section will be based on the method described in § 1468.34, except such compensation will be reduced by an amount equal to the value of the reserved grazing rights, as determined by NRCS.
§ 1468.38
Development and revision of the WRPO and associated compatible use authorizations.
(a) The WRPO will be developed and updated as determined by NRCS in consultation with the State technical committee and consideration of available site-specific technical input from FWS at the local level and others as appropriate.
(b) The WRPO will specify the manner in which the enrolled land will be restored, protected, enhanced, maintained, managed, and monitored to accomplish the goals of the program. The WRPO, and any revisions thereto, will be developed to ensure that cost-effective restoration and maximization of wildlife benefits and wetland functions and values will result. Specifically, the WRPO will consider and address, to the extent practicable, the onsite alterations and the offsite watershed conditions that adversely impact the hydrology and associated wildlife, water quality, and wetland functions and values.
(c) The WRPO will identify the conservation practices and eligible activities needed to restore the functions and values on the enrolled land. NRCS may review, revise, and supplement the WRPO as needed throughout the duration of the enrollment to ensure that program goals are fully and effectively achieved. Revisions to the WRPO may result in the addition of conservation practices or eligible activities needed to enhance, maintain, manage, repair, replace or otherwise to protect the functions and values of the easement or 30-year contract area.
(d) As required by the terms of the easement deed as described in § 1468.37(a)(2)(ii) or 30-year contract as described in § 1468.37(b)(2)(ii), NRCS may, in its sole discretion, authorize the landowner to conduct compatible uses as defined in this part on the easement or contract area. Compatible use authorizations are time-limited and may be modified or rescinded at any time by NRCS. In evaluating and authorizing compatible uses of the easement or contract area, NRCS will—
(1) Consider whether the authorized use will facilitate the practical administration and management of the land subject to the easement or contract; and
(2) Ensure that the authorized use furthers the functions and values for which the easement or 30-year contract was enrolled.
§ 1468.39
Violations and remedies.
(a)
Easement violations.
(1) In the event of a violation of the easement involving the landowner, the landowner will be given reasonable notice and an opportunity to voluntarily correct the violation within 30 days of the date of the notice, or such additional time as NRCS determines is necessary to correct the violation at the landowner's expense.
(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(1) of this section, NRCS reserves the right to enter upon the easement or 30-year area at any time to remedy deficiencies or easement violations. Such entry may be made at the discretion of NRCS when such actions are deemed necessary to protect important wetland functions and values or other rights of the United States under the easement. The landowner will be liable for any costs incurred by the United States as a result of the landowner's failure to comply with easement obligations.
(3) If there is failure to comply with easement obligations, the easement will remain in effect, and NRCS may, in addition to any other remedy available to the United States, retain any payment otherwise required to be paid under this part and require the refund of any payment previously made under this part.
(b)
30-year contract or wetland reserve easement restoration agreements violations.
(1) If NRCS determines that a landowner is in violation of the terms of a 30-year contract or wetland reserve easement restoration agreement, or documents incorporated by reference into the 30-year contract or wetland reserve easement restoration agreement, the landowner will be given reasonable notice and an opportunity to voluntarily correct the violation within 30 days of the date of the notice, or such additional time as NRCS determines is necessary to correct the violation. If the violation continues, NRCS may terminate the 30-year contract or wetland reserve easement restoration agreement.
(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, a 30-year contract or wetland reserve easement restoration agreement termination is effective immediately upon a determination by the NRCS that the landowner has—
(i) Submitted false information,
(ii) Filed a false claim, or
(iii) Engaged in any act for which a finding of ineligibility for payments is permitted under this part.
(3) If NRCS terminates a 30-year contract or wetland reserve easement restoration agreement, the landowner will forfeit all rights for future payments under the 30-year contract or wetland reserve easement restoration agreement, and must refund all or part, as determined by NRCS, of the payments received, plus interest.

Conservation practices and activities.
(a)
Conservation practice and activity selection.
(1) The Chief will provide a list of structural and land management practices and activities eligible for each CSP payment component. If the Chief's designee provides the list, it will be approved by the Director of the Financial Assistance Programs Division of NRCS. When determining the lists of practices and activities and their associated rates, the Chief will consider:
(i) The cost and potential conservation benefits;
(ii) The degree of treatment of significant resource concerns;
(iii) The number of resource concerns the practice or activity will address;
(iv) Locally available technology;
(v) New and emerging conservation technology;
(vi) Ability to address the resource concern based on site specific conditions; and,
(vii) The need for cost-share assistance for specific practices and activities to help producers achieve higher management intensity levels or to advance in tiers of eligibility.
(2) To address unique resource conditions in a State or region, the Chief may make additional conservation practices, measures, and enhancement activities eligible that are not included in the national list of eligible CSP practices.
(3) NRCS will make the list of eligible practices and activities and their individual payment rates available to the public.
(b) NRCS will consider the qualified practices and activities in its computation of CSP payments except as provided for in paragraph (d) of this section.
(c) NRCS will not make new practice payments for a conservation practice the producer has applied prior to application to the program.
(d) New practice payments will not be made to a participant who has implemented or initiated the implementation of a conservation practice prior to approval of the contract, unless a waiver was granted by the State Conservationist or the Designated Conservationist prior to the installation of the practice.
(e) Where new technologies or conservation practices that show high potential for optimizing environmental benefits are available, NRCS may approve interim conservation practice standards and financial assistance for pilot work to evaluate and assess the performance, efficacy, and effectiveness of the technology or conservation practices.
(f) NRCS will set the minimum level of treatment within land management practices at the national level; however, the State Conservationist may supplement specific criteria to meet localized conditions within the State or areas.
§ 1469.9
Technical assistance.
(a) NRCS may use the services of NRCS-approved or certified Technical Service Providers in performing its responsibilities for technical assistance.
(b) Technical assistance may include, but is not limited to: Assisting applicants during sign-up, processing and assessing applications, assisting the participant in developing the conservation stewardship plan; conservation practice survey, layout, design, installation, and certification; information, education, and training for producers; and quality assurance activities.
(c) NRCS retains approval authority over the certification of technical assistance done by non-NRCS personnel.
(d) NRCS retains approval authority of the conservation stewardship contracts and contract payments.
(e) Conservation stewardship plans will be developed by NRCS certified conservation planners.

# Subpart B—Contracts and Payments
§ 1469.20
Application for contracts.
(a) Applications must include:
(1) A completed self-assessment workbook;
(2) Benchmark condition inventory and conservation stewardship plan in accordance with § 1469.7 for the eligible land uses on the entire operation or, if Tier I, for the portion being enrolled;
(3) Any other requirements specified in the sign-up notice;
(4) For Tier I, clear indication of which acres the applicant wishes to enroll in the CSP; and,
(5) A certification that the applicant will agree to meet the relevant contract requirements outlined in the sign-up notice.
(b) Producers who are members of a joint operation, trust, estate, association, partnership or similar organization must file a single application for the joint operation or organization.
(c) Producers can submit only one application per sign-up.
(d) Participants can only have one active contract at any one time.
§ 1469.21
Contract requirements.
(a) To receive payments, each participant must enter into a conservation stewardship contract and comply with its provisions. Among other provisions, the participant agrees to maintain at least the level of stewardship identified in the benchmark inventory for the portion of land being enrolled for the entire contract period, as appropriate, and implement and maintain any new practices or activities required in the contract.
(b) Program participants will only receive payments from one conservation stewardship contract.
(c) CSP participants must address the following requirements or additional resource concerns to the minimum level of treatment by the end of their conservation stewardship contract:
(1) Tier I contract requirement: additional practices and activities as included by the applicant in the conservation stewardship plan and approved by NRCS, over the part of the agricultural operation enrolled in CSP.
(2) Tier II contract requirements:
(i) Address an additional locally significant resource concern, as described in section III of the NRCS FOTG over the entire agricultural operation. Applicants may satisfy this requirement by demonstrating that the locally significant resource concern is not applicable to their operation or that they have already addressed it in accordance with NRCS'; quality criteria; and
(ii) Additional practices and activities as included by the applicant in the conservation stewardship plan and approved by NRCS, over the entire agricultural operation, where applicable.
(3) Tier III contract requirement: additional practices and activities as included by the applicant in the conservation stewardship plan and approved by NRCS, over the entire agricultural operation, where applicable.
(d)
Transition to a higher tier of participation.
(1) Upon agreement by NRCS and the participant, a conservation stewardship contract may include provisions that lead to a higher tier of participation during the contract period. Such a transition does not require
a contract modification if that transition is laid out in the schedule of contract activities. In the event that such a transition begins with Tier I, only the land area in the agricultural operation that meets the requirements for enrollment in Tier I can be enrolled in the contract until the transition occurs. Upon transition from Tier I to a higher tier of participation, the entire agricultural operation must be incorporated into the contract. All requirements applicable to the higher tier of participation would then apply. NRCS will calculate all stewardship, existing practice, new practice payments, and enhancement payments using the applicable enrolled acreage at the time of the payment.
(2) A contract which transitions to higher tier(s) of participation must include:
(i) A schedule for the activities associated with the transition(s);
(ii) A date certain by which time the transition(s) must occur; and,
(iii) A specification that the CSP payment will be based on the current Tier of participation, which may change over the life of the contract.
(3) A contract which transitions to a higher tier will be modified to receive the higher payments once the required level of treatment has been achieved and field verified by NRCS.
(4) A contract which includes a transition from Tier I to Tier II or III may be adjusted in length up to 10 years beginning from the original contract date.
(e) A conservation stewardship contract must:
(1) Incorporate by reference the conservation stewardship plan;
(2) Be for 5 years for Tier I, and 5 to 10 years for Tier II or Tier III;
(3) Incorporate all provisions as required by law or statute, including participant requirements to—
(i) Implement and maintain the practices as identified and scheduled in the conservation stewardship plan, including those needed to be eligible for the specified tier of participation and comply with any additional sign-up requirements,
(ii) Not conduct any practices on the farm or ranch that tend to defeat the purposes of the contract,
(iii) Comply with the terms of the contract, or documents incorporated by reference into the contract. NRCS will give the participant a reasonable time, as determined by the State Conservationist, to correct any violation and comply with the terms of the contract and attachments thereto. If a violation continues, the State Conservationist may terminate the conservation stewardship contract, and
(iv) Supply records and information as required by CCC to determine compliance with the contract and requirements of CSP;
(4) Specify the requirements for operation and maintenance of the applied conservation practices;
(5) Specify the schedule of payments under the life of the contract, including how those payments—
(i) Relate to the schedule for implementing additional conservation measures as described in the conservation stewardship plan,
(ii) Relate to the actual implementation of additional conservation measures as described in the conservation stewardship plan, and
(iii) May be adjusted by NRCS if the participant's management decisions change the appropriate set or schedule of conservation measures on the operation; and,
(6) Incorporate any other provisions determined necessary or appropriate by NRCS, or included as a requirement for the sign-up.
(f) Practices scheduled in contracts must be applied and maintained within the timelines specified in the contract.
(g) Contracts expire on September 30 in the last year of the contract.
(h) Participants must:
(1) Implement the conservation stewardship contract approved by NRCS;
(2) Make available to NRCS, appropriate records showing the timely implementation of the contract;
(3) Comply with the regulations of this part; and
(4) Not engage in any activity that interferes with the purposes of the program, as determined by NRCS.
(i) NRCS will determine the payments under the contract as described in § 1469.23.
(j) For contracts encompassing the entire agricultural operation, the geographic boundaries of the acreage enrolled in the contract must include all fields and facilities under the participant's direct control, as determined by NRCS.
§ 1469.22
Conservation practice operation and maintenance.
(a) The contract will incorporate the operation and maintenance of the conservation practice(s) applied under the contract.
(b) The participant must operate and maintain any new conservation practice(s) for which a payment was received to ensure that the new practice or enhancement achieves its intended purpose for the life span of the conservation treatment, as identified in the contract or conservation stewardship plan, as determined by NRCS.
(c) Conservation practices that are installed before the execution of a contract, but are needed in the contract to obtain the intended environmental benefits, must be operated and maintained as specified in the contract whether or not an existing practice payment is made.
(d) NRCS may periodically inspect the conservation practices during the practice lifespan as specified in the contract to ensure that operation and maintenance are being carried out, and that the practice is fulfilling its intended objectives. When NRCS finds that a participant is not operating and maintaining practices installed through the CSP in an appropriate manner, NRCS will initiate contract violation procedures as specified in § 1469.25. If an existing practice is part of a system that meets the quality criteria, but does not technically meet NRCS minimum practice standards, the practice must be modified or updated to meet the standard according the FOTG as specified in § 1469.25(a) of this part.
§ 1469.23
Program payments.
(a)
Stewardship component of CSP payments.
(1) The conservation stewardship plan, as applicable, divides the land area to be enrolled in the CSP into land use categories, such as irrigated and non-irrigated cropland, irrigated and non-irrigated pasture, pastured cropland and range land, among other categories.
(2) NRCS will determine an appropriate stewardship payment rate for each land use category using the following methodology:
(i) NRCS will initially calculate the average 2001 rates using the Agriculture Foreign Investment Disclosure Act (AFIDA) Land Value Survey, the National Agriculture Statistics Service (NASS) land rental data, and Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) rental rates.
(ii) Where typical rental rates for a given land use vary widely within a State or between adjacent States, NRCS will adjust the county-level rates to ensure local and regional consistency and equity.
(iii) The State Conservationists can also contribute additional local data, with advice from the State Technical Committee.
(iv) The final stewardship payment rate will be the adjusted regional rates described in paragraph (a)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section multiplied by a reduction factor of 0.25 for Tier I, 0.50 for Tier II, and 0.75 for Tier III.
(v) Pastured cropland will receive the same stewardship payment as cropland.
(3) NRCS will compute the stewardship component of the CSP payment as the product of: the number of acres in each land use category (not including “other” or land not in the applicant's control); the corresponding stewardship payment rate for the applicable acreage; and a tier-specific percentage. The tier-specific percentage is 5 percent for Tier I payments, 10 percent for Tier II payments, and 15 percent for Tier III payments.
(4) Other incidental parcels as defined in § 1469.5(d)(1)(iv) may be given a stewardship rate as though they were the land use to which they are contiguous if they are serving a conservation purpose, such as wildlife habitat. Payment is limited to not more than ten percent of the contract acres. Minimum treatment requirements for the contract tier apply.
(5) Other land, as defined in § 1469.5(d)(1)(v), is not included in the stewardship payment computation.
(6) NRCS will publish the stewardship payment rates at the announcement of each program sign-up.
(b)
Existing practice component of CSP payments.
(1) The Chief will determine and announce which practices will be eligible for existing practice payments in accordance with § 1469.8(a).
(2) With exceptions including, but not limited to, paragraph (b)(3) and (4) of this section, NRCS may pay the participant a percentage of the average 2001 county cost of maintaining a land management, and structural practice that is documented in the benchmark condition inventory as existing upon enrollment in CSP. The Chief may offer alternative payment methods such as paying a percentage of the stewardship payment as long as the payment will not exceed 75 percent (or, in the case of a beginning farmer or rancher, 90 percent) of the average 2001 county costs of installing the practice in the 2001 crop year. NRCS will post the rates for payment at the time of the sign-up notices on the NRCS website and in USDA Service Centers.
(3) NRCS will not pay for maintenance of equipment.
(4) NRCS will not pay an existing practice component of CSP payments for any practice that is required to meet conservation compliance requirements found in 7 CFR Part 12.
(5) Existing practice payments are not intended to pay for routine maintenance activities related to production practices or practices considered typical in farm and ranch operations for a specific location.
(6) Existing practice payments will be made only on practices that meet or exceed the practice standards described in the FOTG.
(7) The Chief may reduce the rates in any given sign-up notice.
(c)
New practice payments.
(1) The Chief will determine and announce which practices will be eligible for new practice payments in accordance with § 1469.8(a).
(2) If the conservation stewardship contract requires the implementation of a new structural or land management practice, NRCS may pay a percentage of the cost of installing the new practice. NRCS will provide the list of approved practices and the percentage cost-share rate for each practice at the time of each CSP sign-up notice.
(3) Participants may contribute to their share of the cost of installing a new practice through in-kind sources, such as personal labor, use of personal equipment, or donated materials. Contributions for a participant's share of the practice may also be provided from non-Federal sources, as determined by the Chief.
(4) Cost-share payments may be provided by other programs; except that payments may not be provided through CSP and another program for the same practice on the same land area.
(5) If additional practices are installed or implemented to advance a contract from one tier of participation to a higher tier, the practice must be certified as meeting FOTG practice standards by NRCS.
(6) In no instance will the total financial contributions for installing a practice from all public and private entity sources exceed 100 percent of the actual cost of installing the practice.
(7) NRCS will not pay a new practice payment for any practice that is required to meet the conservation compliance plan requirements found in 7 CFR Part 12.
(8) The Chief may reduce the rates in any given sign-up notice.
(d)
Enhancement component of CSP payments.
(1) The Chief will establish a list of conservation practices and activities that are eligible for enhancement payments for a given sign-up. State Conservationists, with advice from the State Technical Committees, will tailor the list to meet the needs of the selected watersheds and submit to the Chief for concurrence.
(2) NRCS may pay an enhancement component of a CSP payment if a conservation stewardship plan demonstrates to the satisfaction of NRCS that the plan's activities will increase conservation performance including activities related to energy management as a result of additional effort by the participant and result in:
(i) The improvement of a resource concern by implementing or maintaining multiple conservation practices or measures that exceed the minimum eligibility requirements for the contract's
Tier of participation as outlined in the sign-up notice and as described in § 1469.5(e) and the contract requirements in § 1469.21; or
(ii) An improvement in a local resource concern based on local priorities and in addition to the national significant resource concerns, as determined by NRCS.
(3) NRCS may also pay an enhancement component of a CSP payment if a participant:
(i) Participates in an on-farm conservation research, demonstration, or pilot project as outlined in the sign-up notice; or
(ii) Cooperates with other producers to implement watershed or regional resource conservation plans that involve at least 75 percent of the producers in the targeted area; or
(iii) Carries out assessment and evaluation activities relating to practices included in the conservation stewardship plan as outlined in the sign-up notice.
(4) NRCS will not pay the enhancement component of a CSP payment for any practice that is required to meet the conservation compliance plan requirements found in 7 CFR Part 12.
(5)
Eligible enhancement payments.
(i) State Conservationists, with advice from the State Technical Committees, will develop proposed enhancement payment amounts for each practice and activity.
(ii) An enhancement payment will be made to encourage a producer to perform or continue a management practice or activity, resource assessment and evaluation project, or field-test a research, demonstration, or pilot project that produces enhanced environmental performance and benefits or produces information and data to improve a resource concern or update the NRCS technical guides. Enhancement payments will be:
(A) For activities where NRCS can demonstrate the economic value of the environmental benefits, based on a given activity's expected environmental benefit value. The payment may not exceed the activity's expected economic value; or
(B) For activities where NRCS cannot demonstrate the economic value of the environmental benefits, a rate that will not exceed a producer's cost to implement a given activity.
(iii) NRCS will post the list of approved enhancement activities and payment amounts for each activity concurrent with the CSP sign-up notice.
(6) The Chief may set a not-to-exceed limit or variable payment rate for the enhancement payment in any given sign-up notice.
(7) Enhancements above the minimum criteria for the resource concern that are included in the benchmark inventory may be included in the first CSP payment.
(e) Contracts will be limited as follows:
(1) $20,000 per year for a Tier I conservation stewardship contract,
(2) $35,000 per year for a Tier II conservation stewardship contract, or
(3) $45,000 per year for a Tier III conservation stewardship contract.
(4) Stewardship components of CSP payments cannot exceed $5,000 per year for Tier I, $10,500 per year for Tier II, or $13,500 per year for Tier III.
(5) The new practice payment will not exceed 50 percent of the average county costs of installing the practice (or a similar practice, if new) in the 2001 crop year with the exception of beginning and limited resource producers, in which case the new practice payment may be up to 65 percent.
(f) The new practice and enhancement components of the conservation stewardship contract payment may increase once the participant applies and agrees to maintain additional conservation practices and activities as described in the conservation stewardship plan.
(g) The Chief of NRCS may limit the stewardship, practice, and enhancement components of CSP payments in order to focus funding toward targeted activities and conservation benefits the Chief identifies in the sign-up notice and any subsequent addenda.
(h) In the event that annual funding is insufficient to fund existing contract commitments, the existing contracts will be pro-rated in that contract year.
(i) NRCS may not make any payments to participants for:
(1) Practices within their conservation stewardship plan that are required
to meet conservation compliance requirements found in 7 CFR Part 12;
(2) Practices that are included in maintenance agreements (with financial reimbursements for maintenance) that existed prior to the conservation stewardship contract approval;
(3) Construction or maintenance of animal waste storage or treatment facilities or associated waste transport or transfer devices for animal feeding operations;
(4) The purchase or maintenance of equipment;
(5) A non-land based structure that is not integral to a land based practice, as determined by the Chief; or
(6) New practices that were applied with cost-share assistance through other USDA cost-share programs.
§ 1469.24
Contract modifications and transfers of land.
(a) Contracts may be modified:
(1) At the request of the participant, if the modification is consistent with the purposes of the conservation security program, or;
(2) As required by the State Conservationist due to changes to the type, size, management, or other aspect of the agricultural operation that would interfere with achieving the purposes of the program.
(b) Participants may request a modification to their contract to change their tier of participation under a conservation stewardship contract once the measures determined necessary by NRCS to meet the next tier level have been established.
(c) Contract transfers are permitted when there is agreement among all parties to the contract and the contract area remains intact.
(1) NRCS must be notified within 60 days of the transfer of interest and the transferee's acceptance of the contract terms and conditions, or the contract will be terminated.
(2) The transferee must be determined by NRCS to be eligible and must assume full responsibility under the contract, including operation and maintenance of those conservation practices and activities already undertaken and to be undertaken as a condition of the contract.
§ 1469.25
Contract violations and termination.
(a) If the NRCS determines that a participant is in violation of the terms of a contract, or documents incorporated by reference into the contract, NRCS will give the participant a reasonable time, as determined by the State Conservationist, to correct the violation and comply with the terms of the contract and attachments thereto. If the violation continues, the State Conservationist may terminate the conservation stewardship contract.
(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, a contract termination is effective immediately upon a determination by the State Conservationist that the participant has: submitted false information; filed a false claim; engaged in any act for which a finding of ineligibility for payments is permitted under this part; or taken actions NRCS deems to be sufficiently purposeful or negligent to warrant a termination without delay.
(c) If NRCS terminates a contract due to breach of contract, the participant will forfeit all rights for future payments under the contract, and must refund all or part of the payments received, plus interest, and liquidated damages as determined in accordance with part 1403 of this chapter. The State Conservationist may require only partial refund of the payments received if a previously installed conservation practice can function independently, is not affected by the violation or other conservation practices that would have been installed under the contract, and the participant agrees to operate and maintain the installed conservation practice for the life span of the practice.
(d) If NRCS terminates a contract due to breach of contract, or the participant voluntarily terminates the contract before any contractual payments have been made, the participant will forfeit all rights for further payments under the contract, and must pay such liquidated damages as are prescribed in the contract. The State Conservationist has the option to waive the liquidated damages, depending upon the circumstances of the case.
(e) When making any contract termination decisions, the State Conservationist may reduce the amount of money owed by the participant by a proportion which reflects the good faith effort of the participant to comply with the contract, or the hardships beyond the participant's control that have prevented compliance with the contract including natural disasters or events.
(f) The participant may voluntarily terminate a contract, without penalty or repayment, if the State Conservationist determines that the contract terms and conditions have been fully complied with before termination of the contract.
(g) In carrying out this section, the State Conservationist may consult with the local conservation district.

# Subpart C—General Administration
§ 1469.30
Fair treatment of tenants and sharecroppers.
Payments received under this part must be divided in the manner specified in the applicable contract or agreement, and NRCS will ensure that potential participants who would have an interest in acreage being offered receive treatment which NRCS deems to be equitable, as determined by the Chief. NRCS may refuse to enter into a contract when there is a disagreement among multiple applicants seeking enrollment as to an applicant's eligibility to participate in the contract as a tenant.
§ 1469.31

(1) Payment rates, payment limits, and cost-share percentages;
(2) Eligible conservation practices; and,
(3) Other matters of general applicability.
(c) Before a participant can seek judicial review of any action taken under this part, the participant must exhaust all administrative appeal procedures set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, and for purposes of judicial review, no decision will be a final agency action except a decision of the Chief under these procedures.
§ 1469.32
Compliance with regulatory measures.
Participants who carry out conservation practices are responsible for obtaining the authorities, permits, easements, or other approvals necessary for the implementation, operation, and maintenance of the conservation practices in keeping with applicable laws and regulations. Participants must comply with all laws and are responsible for all effects or actions resulting from their performance under the contract.
§ 1469.33
Access to agricultural operation.
Any authorized NRCS representative has the right to enter an agricultural operation for the purpose of ascertaining the accuracy of any representations made in a contract or in anticipation of entering a contract, as to the performance of the terms and conditions of the contract. Access includes the right to provide technical assistance, inspect any work undertaken under the contract, and collect information necessary to evaluate the performance of conservation practices in the contract. The NRCS representative will make a reasonable effort to contact the participant prior to the exercise of this provision.
§ 1469.34
Performance based on advice or action of representatives of NRCS.
If a participant relied upon the advice or action of any authorized representative of CCC, and did not know or have reason to know that the action or advice was improper or erroneous, the State Conservationist may accept the advice or action as meeting the requirements of CSP. In addition, the State Conservationist may grant relief, to the extent it is deemed desirable by CCC, to provide a fair and equitable treatment because of the good faith reliance on the part of the participant.
§ 1469.35
Offsets and assignments.
(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, NRCS will make any payment or portion thereof to any participant without regard to questions of title under State law and without regard to any claim or lien against the crop, or proceeds thereof, in favor of the owner or any other creditor except agencies of the U.S. Government.

# Subpart A—General Provisions
§ 1470.1
Applicability.
(a) This part sets forth the policies, procedures, and requirements for the Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP) as administered by the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), for enrollment during fiscal year (FY) 2019 and thereafter. Contracts entered into prior to FY 2019 will use the regulations and policies in effect prior to December 20, 2018.
(b) The purpose of CSP is to encourage producers to address priority resource concerns and improve and conserve the quality and condition of natural resources in a comprehensive manner by—
(1) Undertaking additional conservation activities; and
(2) Improving, maintaining, and managing existing conservation activities.
(c) CSP is applicable in any of the 50 States, District of Columbia, Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, Virgin Islands of the United States, American Samoa, and Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.
(d) NRCS provides financial and technical assistance to eligible producers.
§ 1470.2
Administration.
(a) The regulations in this part will be administered under the general supervision and direction of the Chief, NRCS.
(b) No delegation in the administration of this part to lower organizational levels will preclude the Chief from making any determinations under this part, redelegating to other organizational levels, or from reversing or modifying any determination made under this part. The Chief may modify or waive a nonstatutory, discretionary provision of this part if the Chief determines the application of that provision to a particular limited situation is inappropriate and inconsistent with the purposes of the program.
(c) To achieve the conservation goals of CSP, NRCS will—
(1) Make the program available nationwide to eligible applicants on a continuous application basis with one or more ranking periods to determine enrollments. One of the ranking periods will occur in the first quarter of each fiscal year to the extent practicable.
(2) Establish a science-based stewardship threshold for each priority resource concern at the level of management required to conserve and improve the quality and condition of a natural resource. To the extent practicable, NRCS will use scientifically developed assessment tools and guides including, but not limited to, soil erosion prediction tools, wildlife habitat assessment tools, rangeland health assessments, and soil health assessments, to establish the stewardship threshold and measure the level of improvement once the participant applies additional conservation activities to meet or exceed a resource concern.

A split-rate annual payment structure is used to provide separate payments for additional and existing conservation activities in order to place emphasis on implementing additional conservation.
(1) NRCS will make equal annual payments for the existing activity portion of the payment, specific to the operation, based on the land uses and NRCS assessment of existing stewardship. NRCS will make payments for the additional conservation activities based on the complexity and extent of the individual activities completed by the participant during the previous fiscal year. Additional activities implemented may vary from year to year, so the total annual payment may fluctuate;
(2) In order to receive an annual payment for a land use, participants must schedule, install, and adopt at least one additional conservation activity on the land use type;
(3) At least one additional conservation activity must be implemented within the first 12 months of the contract. NRCS may extend this timeframe if NRCS determines that the participant is unable to complete the conservation activity for reasons beyond their control;
(4) NRCS will base the annual payment rates, to the maximum extent practicable, on the following factors:
(i) Costs incurred by the participant associated with planning, design, materials, installation, labor, management, maintenance, or training;
(ii) Income foregone by the participant;
(iii) Expected conservation benefits;
(iv) The extent to which priority resource concerns will be addressed through the installation and adoption of conservation activities on the agricultural operation;
(v) The level of stewardship in place at the time of application and maintained over the term of the contract;
(vi) The degree to which the conservation activities will be integrated across the entire agricultural operation for all State identified priority resource concerns over the term of the contract; and
(vii) Such other factors as determined by the Chief; and
(5) Participants will receive payments for cover crop activities at not less than 125 percent of the annual payment amount, as determined by NRCS.
(b)
Supplemental payments.
Subject to the availability of funds, NRCS will provide a supplemental payment to a participant receiving annual payments, who also agrees to adopt or improve a resource-conserving crop rotation or adopt advanced grazing management, as defined by NRCS, to achieve beneficial crop or grazing rotations as appropriate for the eligible land of the participant.
(1) NRCS will determine whether a resource-conserving crop rotation or advanced grazing management is eligible for supplemental payments based on whether the resource-conserving crop rotation or advanced grazing management is designed to provide natural resource conservation and production benefits;
(2) A participant must adopt or improve the resource-conserving crop rotation or adopt advanced grazing management during the term of the contract to be eligible to receive a supplemental payment;
(3) Supplemental payments will be based, to the maximum extent practicable, on the factors from paragraph (a)(4) of this section; and
(4) Supplemental payments will be not less than 150 percent of the annual payment amount, as determined by NRCS.

Indian Tribes and the Bureau of Indian Affairs will certify in writing that no one individual, directly or indirectly, will receive more than the payment limitation. Certification provided at the time of enrollment will cover the entire contract period. The Tribal entity must also provide, upon request from NRCS, a listing of individuals and payment made, by Social Security number or other unique identification number, during the previous year for calculation of overall payment limitations.
(j)
Tax Identification Number.
To be eligible to receive a CSP payment, all applicants must provide a tax identification number. In accordance with 7 CFR part 1400, applicants who participate as a legal entity or joint operation must provide a list of all members of the legal entity or joint operation and associated embedded entities, along with the members' Social Security numbers and percentage interest in the legal entity or joint operation. NRCS attributes payments directly to legal entity members for the purpose of complying with paragraph (f) of this section.
(k)
Unique identification numbers.
American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Pacific Islanders may use another unique identification number for each individual eligible for payment. Any participant that uses a unique identification number as an alternative to a tax identification number will use that identifier for all CSP contracts in which they participate.

§ 1470.25
Contract modifications and transfers of land.
(a) NRCS may modify a conservation stewardship contract, if—
(1) The participant agrees to the modification; and
(2) NRCS determines the modification is in the public interest.
(b) NRCS may allow modification to a conservation stewardship contract to accommodate certain changes in the agricultural operation, including—
(1) Removing contract acres the participant will enroll in CRP, protect with a wetland reserve easement through the Agricultural Conservation Easement Program (ACEP), or enroll in other Federal or State programs that offer greater natural resource protection through an easement, long-term contract, land use restrictions, or similar authority as determined by NRCS. NRCS may reduce payments for such modified contracts to reflect the modified acreage and performance. Participants will not be subject to liquidated damages or refund of payments received for enrolling land in these programs.
(2) Accommodating other limited changes, in response to a participant's request made prior to implementing the change, that would take land out of production or convert an area under contract to a different land use. These situations apply only to land for which the participant has and will retain effective control, and not for situations of involuntary loss of land.
(3) Allowing a participant to substitute a conservation activity as long
as the level of conservation performance agreed to at the time of enrollment remains the same or is improved with implementation of the substitute activity.
(i) Adjustments to existing activities may occur consistent with conservation performance requirements from § 1470.23.
(ii) [Reserved]
(4) Prior to approval, NRCS must determine that any modification under this section is authorized by the provisions of 16 U.S.C. 3838d-3838g.
(c) A contract modification under this section will not increase the scheduled annual payments under the program, except to make minor adjustments to a conservation activity, as determined by NRCS; implement an appeal determination; correct an administrative error as approved by NRCS; or to adjust payment limitations. Contracts transferred from an individual or entity to a joint operation will retain the original contract limit outlined in § 1470.24(h).
(d) Within the time specified in the contract, a participant must provide NRCS with written notice regarding any voluntary or involuntary loss of control of any acreage under the CSP contract, which includes changes in a participant's ownership structure or corporate form. Failure to provide timely notice may result in termination of the entire contract.
(e) Unless NRCS approves a transfer of contract rights under this paragraph (e), a participant losing control of any acreage may constitute a violation of the CSP contract and NRCS may terminate the contract and require a participant to refund all or a portion of any financial assistance provided. NRCS may approve a transfer of the contract if—
(1) NRCS receives written notice that identifies the new producer who will take control of the acreage, as required in paragraph (d) of this section;
(2) The new producer meets program eligibility requirements within a reasonable time frame, as specified in the CSP contract;
(3) The new producer agrees to assume the rights and responsibilities for the acreage under the contract; and
(4) NRCS determines that the purposes of the program will continue to be met despite the original participant's losing control of all or a portion of the land under contract.
(f) Until NRCS approves the transfer of contract rights, the new producer is not a participant in the program and may not receive payment for conservation activities commenced prior to approval of the contract transfer.
(g) NRCS may not approve a contract transfer and may terminate the contract in its entirety if NRCS determines that the loss of control of the land was voluntary, the new producer is not eligible or willing to assume responsibilities under the contract, or the purposes of the program cannot be met.
(h) In the case of death, incompetency, or disappearance of any participant, NRCS may, as identified in the CSP contract—
(i) Terminate the contract;
(ii) Make any payments due under this part pursuant to guidance under applicable provisions of 7 CFR parts 707 and 1400 (including payment to successor(s)); or
(iii) Take any further action that the Chief determines is fair and reasonable in light of all of the circumstances.

§ 1470.26
Contract renewal.
(a) During the first half of the fifth year of the initial contract period, NRCS may allow a participant to apply and compete for the opportunity under § 1470.20 to renew the contract to receive payments for an additional 5-year period, subject to the availability of funds, if the participant meets criteria from paragraph (b) of this section.
(b) To be considered for contract renewal, the participant must—
(1) Be in compliance with the terms of their existing contract as determined by NRCS;
(2) Add any newly acquired eligible land that is part of the agricultural operation that NRCS determines must be included in the renewal contract;
(3) Agree to adopt and continue to integrate new or improved conservation
activities across the entire agricultural operation, demonstrating continued improvement during the additional 5-year period, as determined by NRCS; and
(4) By the end of the renewal contract period, agree to meet or exceed the stewardship threshold of at least two additional priority resource concerns on the agricultural operation; or to adopt or improve conservation activities, as determined by NRCS, to achieve higher levels of conservation performance with respect to not less than two existing priority resource concerns that are specified by the Chief in the initial contract.
(c) NRCS will determine a participant ineligible for a new CSP contract on an agricultural operation for 2 years following expiration of their prior contract if the participant does not enter a renewal contract on the agricultural operation at the end of the prior contract period.

Contract violations and termination.
(a) NRCS may terminate a contract:
(1) Without the consent of the participant where NRCS determines that the participant—
(i) Violated the contract; or
(ii) Is unable to comply with the terms of the contract as the result of conditions beyond their control.
(2) With the consent of the participant if NRCS determines that the termination is in the public interest. NRCS will not assess liquidated damages for contracts terminated under this basis.
(b) When NRCS terminates a contract in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, NRCS may allow a participant to retain payments already received based on—
(1) The level of effort the participant has made to comply with the contract. NRCS may require a participant to provide only a partial refund of the payments received if a previously installed conservation activity has achieved the expected conservation performance improvement, is not adversely affected by any contract violation or the absence of other conservation activities that would have been installed under the contract, and has met the associated operation and maintenance requirement of the activity; or
(2) Hardship situations where circumstances beyond the participant's control prevented the participant from complying with the contract. Any hardship affecting the participant's ability to comply with the contract must not have existed at the time the contract was executed by the participant. Participants may submit a written request to NRCS, along with additional supporting documentation, for NRCS to consider granting a waiver of any requested repayment and/or assessment of liquidated damages.
(c) If NRCS determines that a participant is out of compliance with the contract terms or incorporated documents, NRCS will notify the participant to explain what the participant must do to regain compliance and the consequences for not correcting the violation. NRCS will give the participant reasonable time to complete all necessary corrective actions, not to exceed one year. NRCS may authorize additional time for the participant to complete the corrective actions if, during the initial period, the participant was unable to complete the corrective actions due to circumstances beyond their control. If a participant's contract continues in violation, NRCS may:
(1) Terminate the contract in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section; or
(2) Where NRCS determines the violation does not warrant termination, NRCS may require the participant to:
(i) Refund all or a portion of the payments provided; or
(ii) Agree to such adjustments to the contact terms as determined appropriate by NRCS.
(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section, NRCS will terminate a contract, effective immediately, upon a determination by NRCS that the participant:
(1) Has submitted false information or filed a false claim;
(2) Engaged in any act, scheme, or device for which NRCS found the participant ineligible for payments as provided in § 1470.36; or
(3) Incurred a contract violation that the participant cannot correct in a timeframe established by NRCS.
(e) If NRCS terminates a contract, the participant will forfeit all rights to future payments under the contract, pay liquidated damages, and refund all or part of the payments received, plus interest, except as otherwise noted in paragraph (b) of this section.
§ 1470.28

§ 1470.31
Appeals.
A participant may obtain administrative review of an adverse decision under this part in accordance with 7 CFR parts 11 and 614. Determinations in matters of general applicability, such as payment rates, payment limits, the designation of identified priority resource concerns, and eligible conservation activities are not subject to appeal.
§ 1470.32
Compliance with regulatory measures.
Participants will be responsible for obtaining the authorities, rights, easements, permits, or other approvals or legal compliance necessary for the implementation, operation, and maintenance associated with the conservation stewardship plan. Participants will be responsible for compliance with all laws and for all effects or actions resulting from the implementation of the contract.
§ 1470.33
Access to agricultural operation.
NRCS, or its authorized representative, will have the right to enter an agricultural operation to ascertain the accuracy of any representations, including natural resource information provided by an applicant to evaluate a contract application. Access will include the right to provide technical assistance, determine eligibility, assess natural resource conditions, inspect any work undertaken under the contract, and collect information necessary to evaluate the implementation of conservation activities in the contract. NRCS, or its authorized representative, will try to contact the participant prior to the exercise of the provision in this section.
§ 1470.34
Equitable relief.
(a) If a participant relied upon the advice or action of NRCS and did not know, or have reason to know, that the action or advice was improper or erroneous, the participant may be eligible for equitable relief under 7 CFR part 635. NRCS will not assume the financial or technical liability for any action by a participant that was taken based on the advice of a TSP. This liability will remain with the TSP.
(b) If NRCS finds that a participant is in violation of a provision of the conservation stewardship contract or any incorporated document through failure to comply fully with that provision, the participant may be eligible for equitable relief under 7 CFR part 635.
§ 1470.35
Offsets and assignments.
(a) Any payment or portion thereof due to any participant under this part will be allowed without regard to any claim or lien in favor of any creditor, except agencies of the United States Government.

§ 1470.37
Environmental credits for conservation improvements.
(a) NRCS will not prohibit a participant under this part from participating in, and receiving compensation from, an environmental services market if one of the purposes of the market is the facilitation of additional conservation benefits that are consistent with CSP purposes, as determined by NRCS. CSP participation may create environmental benefits that qualify for environmental credits under an environmental credit-trading program. NRCS will not prohibit a participant under this part from participating in, or receiving compensation from, an environmental credit-trading program, and
NRCS asserts no direct or indirect interest in these credits. However, in addition, any requirements or standards of an environmental market program in which a CSP participant simultaneously enrolls to receive environmental credits must be compatible with the purposes and requirements of the CSP contract and with this part. NRCS retains the authority to ensure that CSP purposes are met and that one of the purposes of the market is the facilitation of additional conservation benefits that are consistent with CSP purposes.
(b) The participant must meet all operation and maintenance requirements for CSP-funded activities, consistent with §§ 1470.21 and 1470.23. Where activities required under an environmental credit agreement may affect the land and conservation activities under a CSP contract, NRCS recommends that CSP participants request assistance with the development of a compatibility assessment prior to entering into any credit agreement. The CSP contract may be modified in accordance with policies outlined in § 1470.25 provided the modifications meet CSP purposes and is in compliance with this part.
(c) CSP participants may not use CSP funds to implement conservation practices and activities that the participant is required to establish because of a court order.

# Subpart A—General Information
§ 1484.10
General purpose and scope.
(a) This part sets forth the general terms and conditions governing the Commodity Credit Corporation's (CCC) operation of the Foreign Market Development (FMD) Cooperator program.
(b)(1) The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued guidance on “Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards” in 2 CFR part 200. In 2 CFR 400.1, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) adopted OMB's guidance in subparts A through F of 2 CFR part 200, as supplemented by 2 CFR part 400, as USDA policies and procedures for uniform administrative requirements, cost principles, and audit requirements for Federal awards.
(2) The OMB guidance at 2 CFR part 200, as supplemented by 2 CFR part 400 and this subpart, applies to the Cooperator program.
(3) In addition to the provisions of this part, other regulations that are generally applicable to grants and cooperative agreements of USDA, including the applicable regulations set forth in 2 CFR chapters I, II, and IV, also apply to the Cooperator program, to the extent that these regulations do not directly conflict with the provisions of this part. The provisions of the CCC Charter Act (15 U.S.C. 714
et seq.
) and any other statutory or regulatory provisions that are generally applicable to CCC also apply to the Cooperator program.
(c) Under the Cooperator program, CCC enters into agreements with eligible nonprofit U.S. trade organizations to share the costs of certain overseas marketing and promotion activities that are intended to create, maintain,
or expand foreign markets for U.S. agricultural commodities. When considering eligible nonprofit U.S. trade organizations, CCC generally gives priority to organizations that are nationwide in membership and scope and have the broadest producer representation and affiliated industry participation of the commodity being promoted. Agreements involve the promotion of agricultural commodities on a generic basis. CCC does not provide brand promotion assistance to Cooperators under this program. Agreements may not involve activities targeted directly toward consumers purchasing as individuals. Activities must contribute to the creation, maintenance, or growth of demand for U.S. agricultural commodities and must generally address long-term foreign import constraints and export growth opportunities by focusing on matters such as reducing infrastructural or historical market impediments, improving processing capabilities, modifying codes and standards, and identifying new markets or new applications or uses for the agricultural commodity in the foreign market.
(d) The Cooperator program generally operates on a reimbursement basis.
(e) CCC policy is to ensure that benefits generated by Cooperator agreements are broadly available throughout the relevant agricultural sector and no one entity gains an undue advantage or sole benefit from program activities. CCC also endeavors to enter into Cooperator agreements covering a broad array of agricultural commodity sectors. The Cooperator program is administered by the Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) on behalf of CCC.
(f) The paperwork and recordkeeping requirements imposed by this part have been approved by OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. OMB has assigned control number 0551-0026 for this information collection.
§ 1484.11
Definitions.
For purposes of this part the following definitions apply:
Activity
means a specific foreign market development effort undertaken by a Cooperator to address a constraint or opportunity.
Administrative expenses or costs
means expenses or costs of administering, directing, and controlling an organization that is a Cooperator. Generally, this would include expenses or costs such as those related to:
(1) Maintaining a physical office (including, but not limited to: Rent, office equipment, office supplies, office décor, office furniture, computer hardware and software, maintenance, extermination, parking, and business cards);
(2) Personnel (including, but not limited to: Salaries, benefits, payroll taxes, individual insurance, and training);
(3) Communications (including, but not limited to: Phone expenses, internet, mobile phones, personal digital assistants, email, mobile email devices, postage, courier services, television, radio, and walkie talkies);
(4) Management of an organization or unit of an organization (including, but not limited to: Planning, supervision, supervisory travel, teambuilding, recruiting, and hiring);
(5) Utilities (including, but not limited to: Sewer, water, and energy); and
(6) Professional services (including, but not limited to: Accounting expenses, financial services, and investigatory services).
Affiliate
means any partnership, association, company, corporation, trust, or any other such party in which the Cooperator has an investment, other than a mutual fund.
Agreement
means a document entered into between CCC and a Cooperator setting forth the terms and conditions of approved activities under the Cooperator program, including any subsequent amendments to such agreement.
Approval letter
means a document by which CCC informs an applicant that its FMD application for a program year has been approved for funding. This letter may also approve specific activities and contain terms and conditions in addition to the agreement. This letter requires a countersignature by the Cooperator before it becomes effective.
Attaché/Counselor
means the FAS employee representing USDA interests in the foreign country in which promotional activities are conducted.
Constraint
means a condition in a particular country or region that needs
to be addressed in order to develop, expand, or maintain exports of a specific eligible commodity.
Consumer promotion
means activities that are designed to directly influence consumers by changing attitudes or purchasing behaviors towards eligible commodities and that involve activities targeted directly toward consumers purchasing as individuals.
Cooperator
means a nonprofit U.S. agricultural trade organization that has entered into a foreign market development agreement with CCC.
Cooperator program
means the Foreign Market Development Cooperator program.
Contribution
means the funds,
e.g.,
money, personnel, materials, services, facilities, or supplies, provided by an FMD Cooperator, State agency, or entities in the FMD Cooperator's industry (“U.S. industry”) in support of an approved activity as well as funds provided by the FMD Cooperator, U.S. industry, or State agency in support of related promotion activities in the markets covered by the FMD Cooperator's agreement.
Credit memo
means a commercial document, also known as a credit memorandum, issued by the Cooperator to a commercial entity that owes the Cooperator a certain sum. A credit memo is used when the Cooperator owes the commercial entity a sum less than the amount the entity owes the Cooperator. The credit memo reflects an offset of the amount the Cooperator owes the entity against the amount the entity owes to the Cooperator.
Demonstration projects
means activities involving the erection or construction of a structure or facility or the installation of equipment.
Eligible commodity
means any agricultural commodity or product thereof, excluding tobacco, that is comprised of at least 50 percent by weight, exclusive of added water, of agricultural commodities grown or raised in the United States.
Expenditure
means either payment via the transfer of funds or offset reflected in a credit memo in lieu of a transfer of funds.
Foreign subrecipient
means a foreign entity that a Cooperator works with, in accordance with this part, to promote the export of an eligible commodity under the Cooperator program.
Generic promotion
means a promotion that does not involve the exclusive or predominant use of a single company name, logo, or brand name, or the brand of a U.S. agricultural cooperative, but rather promotes an eligible commodity generally. A generic promotion activity may include the promotion of a foreign brand (
i.e.,
a brand owned primarily by foreign interests and being used to market an agricultural commodity in a foreign market), if the foreign brand uses the promoted eligible commodity from multiple U.S. suppliers. A generic promotion activity may also involve the use of specific U.S. company names, logos, or brand names. However, in that case, the Cooperator must ensure that all U.S. companies seeking to promote such eligible commodity in the market have an equal opportunity to participate in the activity and that at least two U.S. companies participate. In addition, an activity that promotes separate items from multiple U.S. companies will be considered a generic promotion only if the promotion of the separate items maintains a unified theme (
i.e.,
a dominant idea or motif) and style and is subordinate to the promotion of the generic theme.
Market
means a country or region targeted by an activity.
Notification
means a document from the Cooperator by which the Cooperator proposes to CCC changes to the activities and/or funding levels in an approved agreement and/or approval letter.
Project funds
means the funds made available to a Cooperator under an agreement and authorized for expenditure in accordance with this part.
Program notice
means documents that CCC issues for informational purposes. These notices are currently made available electronically through the FAS website. These notices have no legal effect. They are intended to alert Cooperators of various aspects of CCC's current administration of the FMD program. For example, CCC issues notices to alert Cooperators of applicable Federal pay scale rates and lists of economic and trade sanctions against certain foreign countries.
Program year
means, unless otherwise agreed to in writing between CCC and a Cooperator, a 12-month period during which a Cooperator can undertake activities consistent with this part and its agreement and approval letter with CCC. This is also known as a project period, which in multiple year awards will be divided into budget periods.
Sales and trade relations expenditures (STRE)
means expenditures made on breakfast, lunch, dinner, receptions, and refreshments at approved activities; miscellaneous courtesies such as checkroom fees, taxi fares, and tips for approved activities; and decorations for a special promotional occasion that is part of an approved activity.
Trade team
means a group of individuals engaged in an approved activity intended to promote the interests of an entire agricultural sector rather than to result in specific sales by any of its members.
Unified Export Strategy (UES)
means a holistic marketing plan that outlines an applicant's proposed foreign market development activities and requested funding under each of the FAS market development programs.
Unified Export Strategy (UES) system
means an online internet system maintained by FAS through which applicants may apply to the Cooperator program and other FAS market development programs. The system is currently accessible at
https://apps.fas.usda.gov/ues/webapp/.
FAS may prescribe a different system through which applicants may apply to the FMD program and will announce such system in the applicable Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO).
U.S. agricultural commodity
means any agricultural commodity of U.S. origin, including food, feed, fiber, forestry product, livestock, insects, and fish harvested from a U.S. aquaculture farm or harvested by a vessel (as defined in Title 46 of the United States Code) in waters that are not waters (including the territorial sea) of a foreign country, and any product thereof.
§ 1484.12
Participation eligibility.
(a) To participate in the Cooperator program, an entity must be a nonprofit U.S. agricultural trade organization that promotes the exports of one or more U.S. agricultural commodities, does not have a business interest in or receive remuneration from specific sales of agricultural commodities, and contributes at least 50 percent of the value of resources reimbursed by CCC for activities conducted under the agreement.
(b) CCC may require that an agreement include a contribution level greater than that specified in paragraph (a) of this section. In requiring a higher contribution level, CCC will take into account such factors as past Cooperator contribution level, previous Cooperator program funding levels, the length of time an entity participates in the program, and the entity's ability to increase its contribution level.
(c) CCC will enter into agreements only for the promotion of eligible commodities.

# Subpart B—Application and Funding Allocation
§ 1484.20
Application process.
(a)
General application requirements.
CCC will periodically announce through a NOFO that it is accepting applications for participation in the Cooperator program for a specified program year. This announcement will be posted on the U.S. Government website for grant opportunities. Applications shall be submitted in accordance with the terms and requirements specified in the announcement and in this part. Currently, applicants are encouraged to submit applications through the UES system but are not required to do so.
(b)
Universal identifier and System for Award Management (SAM).
In accordance with 2 CFR part 25, each entity that applies to the Cooperator program and does not qualify for an exemption under 2 CFR 25.110 must:
(1) Be registered in the SAM prior to submitting an application or plan;
(2) Maintain an active SAM registration with current information at all times during which it has an active Federal award or an application or plan under consideration by CCC; and
(3) Provide its DUNS number, or a unique identifier designated as a DUNS replacement, in each application or plan it submits to CCC.
(c)
Reporting subaward and executive compensation information.
In accordance with 2 CFR part 170, each entity that applies to the Cooperator program and does not qualify for an exception under 2 CFR 170.110(b) must ensure it has the necessary processes and systems in place to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of 2 CFR part 170 should it receive Cooperator program funding.
§ 1484.21
Application review and formation of agreements.
(a)
General.
CCC will, subject to the availability of funds, approve those applications that it considers to present the best opportunity for creating, maintaining, or expanding export markets for U.S. agricultural commodities. CCC will review all proposals for eligibility and completeness. CCC will evaluate and score each proposal against the factors described in the NOFO. The purpose of this review is to identify meritorious proposals, recommend an appropriate funding level for each proposal, and submit the proposals and funding recommendations to appropriate officials for decision. CCC may, when appropriate to the subject matter of the proposal, request the assistance of other U.S. Government experts in evaluating the merits of a proposal. When considering eligible nonprofit U.S. trade organizations, CCC may weigh which organizations have the broadest producer representation and affiliated industry participation of the commodity being promoted. All reviewers will be required to sign a conflict of interest form, and when conflicts of interests are identified the reviewer will be recused from the objective review process.
(b)
Approval review criteria.
CCC follows results-oriented management principles and considers the following criteria when assessing the likelihood of success of the applications it receives, determining which applications to recommend for approval, and developing preliminary recommended funding levels:
(1) Strategic planning (25%);
(2) Program implementation (25%); and
(3) Program results and evaluation (50%).
§ 1484.22
Allocation factors.
CCC determines final funding levels after allocating available funds to approved applications on the basis of criteria that will be fully described in each program year's Cooperator program announcement. Generally, extensions will not be allowable.

# Subpart C—Program Operations
§ 1484.30
Approval decision.
CCC will notify each applicant in writing of the final disposition of its application. CCC will send an agreement, an approval letter, and a signature card to each approved applicant. The agreement and the approval letter will outline which activities and budgets are approved and will specify any special terms and conditions applicable to a Cooperator's program, including the required level of Cooperator contribution and program evaluations. An applicant that decides to accept the terms and conditions contained in the agreement and approval letter must so indicate by having its Chief Executive Officer (CEO) or designee sign the agreement and approval letter and submit them to CCC. Final agreement shall occur when the agreement and approval letter are signed by both parties. The agreement, the approval letter, and this part shall establish the terms and conditions of a Cooperator agreement between CCC and the approved applicant. CCC will provide each Cooperator with IDs and passwords for the UES, as necessary. Cooperators shall protect these IDs and passwords in accordance with USDA's information technology policies. Cooperators shall immediately notify CCC whenever a person who possesses the ID and password information no longer needs such information or a person who is not authorized gains such information.
§ 1484.31
Signature cards.
The Cooperator shall designate at least two individuals in its organization to sign agreements and amendments, approval letters, reimbursement claims, and advance requests. The Cooperator shall submit the signature card signed by those designated
individuals and by the Cooperator's CEO to CCC prior to the start of the program year. The Cooperator shall immediately notify CCC of any changes in signatories (
e.g.,
removal or addition of individuals, name changes, etc.), and shall submit a revised signature card accordingly.
§ 1484.32

Contracting procedures.
(a) Cooperators have full and sole responsibility for the legal sufficiency of all contracts and assume financial liability for any costs or claims resulting from suits, challenges, or other disputes based on contracts entered into by the Cooperator.

review, selection, award, or administration of a contract in which such entities or their affiliates have a financial or other interest;
(2) Conduct all contracting in an openly competitive manner. Individuals who develop or draft specifications, requirements, statements of work, invitations for bids, or requests for proposals for procurement of any goods or services, and such individuals' families or partners, or an organization that employs or is about to employ any of the aforementioned, shall be excluded from competition for such procurement;
(3) Base each solicitation for professional or technical services on a clear and accurate description of and requirements related to the services to be procured;
(4) Perform and document some form of price or cost analysis, such as a comparison of price quotations to market prices or other price indicia, to determine the reasonableness of the offered prices for procurements in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold in 2 CFR 200.88; and
(5) Document the decision-making process.
§ 1484.36
Property.
(a) A Cooperator shall maintain an inventory of all personal property having a useful life of more than one year and an acquisition cost of $500 or more that was acquired in furtherance of program activities. The inventory shall list and number each item and include the date of purchase or acquisition, cost of purchase, replacement value, serial number, make, model, and electrical requirements, as applicable.
(b) The Cooperator shall insure all real property and equipment that was acquired, in whole or in part, with project funds at a level minimally equal to the equivalent insurance coverage for property owned by the Cooperator. The Cooperator shall safeguard such property and equipment against theft, damage, and unauthorized use. The Cooperator shall promptly report any loss, theft, or damage of such property and equipment to the insurance company.
(c) Personal property having a useful life of more than one year and an acquisition cost of $500 or more purchased by the Cooperator, and for which the Cooperator is reimbursed, in whole or in part, with project funds, that is unusable, unserviceable, or no longer needed for project purposes shall be disposed of in one of the following ways.

(d) The Cooperator is responsible for reimbursing CCC for the value of any uninsured property at the time of the loss or theft of the property.
§ 1484.37
Federal Travel Regulations.
Except as otherwise provided in this part, travel funded by the Cooperator program shall conform to the U.S. Federal Travel Regulations (41 CFR parts 300 through 304) and 2 CFR part 200, and FMD-funded air travel shall conform to the requirements of the Fly America Act (49 U.S.C. 40118). The Cooperator shall notify the Attaché/Counselor in the destination countries in writing in advance of any proposed travel. The timing of such notice should be far enough in advance to enable the Attaché/Counselor to schedule appointments, make preparations, or otherwise provide any assistance being requested. Failure to provide advance notification of travel generally will result in disallowance of the expenses related to the travel, unless CCC determines it was impractical to provide such notification.
§ 1484.38
Program income.
Program income is gross income earned by the non-Federal entity that is directly generated by a supported activity or earned as a result of the Federal award during the period of performance. Any income generated from
an activity, the expenditures for which have been wholly or partially reimbursed with FMD funds, shall be used by the FMD Cooperator in furtherance of its approved FMD activities in the program year during which the FMD funds are available for obligation by the FMD Cooperator, or must be returned to CCC. The use of such income shall be governed by this subpart. Interest earned on funds advanced by CCC is not program income. Reasonable activity fees or registration fees, if identified as such in a project budget, may be charged for approved activities. The intent to charge a fee must be part of the original proposal, along with an explanation of how such fees are to be used. Any activity fees charged must be used to offset activity expenses or returned to FAS. Such fees may not be used as profit or counted as contribution.
§ 1484.39
Changes to activities and funding.
(a)
Adding a new activity.
(1) A Cooperator may not conduct a new activity without first obtaining an approved activity budget for such change. To request approval of such activity budget, the Cooperator shall submit a notification to CCC.
(2) A notification for a new activity shall provide an activity justification and identify any related adjustments to the approved strategic plan, including changes in the market, constraint, or opportunity that the activity proposes to address. The notification shall contain the activity description, the proposed budget, and a justification for the transfer of funds.
(3) After receipt of the notification, CCC will inform the Cooperator via the UES system whether the requested budget is approved.
(b)
Modifying existing activities and their funding levels.
(1) A Cooperator desiring to increase the funding level for existing, approved activities addressing a single constraint or opportunity by more than $25,000 or 25 percent of the approved funding level, whichever is greater, must first submit a notification explaining the adjustment to CCC before making such change.
(2) A Cooperator may make significant adjustments below the threshold in paragraph (b)(1) of this section to the funding levels for existing, approved activities without prior notification to CCC, but only if it submits a notification explaining the adjustments to CCC no later than 30 calendar days after the change. Minor adjustments to existing, approved activities and/or funding levels do not require notification.
(3) Notifications shall describe the activity and any changes to the activity, the existing funding level, or the proposed funding level and shall include a justification for the transfer of funds, if applicable.

However, non-travel expenditures associated with retail and trade exhibits and shows held inside the United States are reimbursable only if the exhibit or show is included on the list of approved U.S. exhibits and shows announced via a program notice issued on FAS' website and the exhibit or show is one that the Cooperator has not participated in within the last three calendar years using funds from a source other than FMD. Retail and trade exhibits and shows held inside the United States may be considered for inclusion on the list of approved exhibits and shows if they are:
(i) A food or agricultural exhibit or show with no less than 30% of exhibitors selling food or agricultural products; and
(ii) An international exhibit or show that targets buyers, distributors, and the like from more than one foreign country and no less than 15% of its visitors are from countries other than the host country;
(7) Where USDA has sponsored or endorsed a U.S. pavilion at a retail or trade exhibit or show, whether held outside or inside the United States, project funds may be used to reimburse the travel and/or non-travel expenditures of only those Cooperators located within the U.S. pavilion. Such expenditures must also adhere to the standard terms and conditions of the U.S. pavilion organizer. Upon written request, CCC may temporarily waive this paragraph (b)(7), on a case by case basis, where the trade show is segregated into product pavilions, a company's distributor or importer is located outside the U.S. pavilion, or when a company can demonstrate that there is a benefit to being located outside the U.S. pavilion. Such waiver will be provided to the Cooperator in writing;
(8) Expenditures, other than travel expenditures, associated with seminars and educational training, whether conducted in the United States or outside the United States, including space rental, equipment rental, and duplication of seminar materials;
(9) Production and distribution of publications;
(10) Demonstrators, interpreters, translators, receptionists, and similar temporary workers who help with the implementation of individual promotional activities, such as trade shows, food service promotions, and trade seminars;
(11) Giveaways, awards, prizes, gifts, and other similar promotional materials, subject to such reimbursement limitation as CCC may determine and announce in writing to Cooperators via a program notice issued on FAS' website. Reimbursement is available only when:
(i) The items are described in detail with a per unit cost in an approved strategic plan; and
(ii) Distribution of the promotional item is not contingent upon the target audience purchasing a good or service to receive the promotional item;
(12) Compensation and allowances for housing, educational tuition, and cost
of living adjustments paid to U.S. citizen employees or U.S. citizen contractors stationed overseas, provided such benefits are granted under established written policies, subject to the limitation that CCC shall not reimburse that portion of:
(i) The total of compensation and allowances that exceed 125 percent of the level of a GS-15, Step 10 salary for U.S. Government employees; or
(ii) Allowances that exceed the rate authorized for U.S. Embassy personnel;
(13) Foreign transfer, temporary lodging, and post hardship differential allowances for U.S. citizen employees, provided such benefits are granted under established written policies;
(14) Approved salaries or compensation for non-U.S. citizen employees and non-U.S. contractors stationed overseas. Generally, CCC will not reimburse any portion of a non-U.S. citizen employee's compensation that exceeds the compensation prescribed for the most comparable position in the Foreign Service National (FSN) salary plan applicable to the country in which the employee works. However, if the local FSN salary plan is inappropriate, a Cooperator may request a higher level of reimbursement for a non-U.S. citizen in accordance with the annual program announcement;
(15) Temporary contractor fees for contractors stationed overseas, except CCC will not reimburse any portion of any such fee that exceeds the daily gross GS-15, Step 10 salary for U.S. Government employees in effect on the date the fee is earned, unless a bidding process revels that such a contractor is not available at or below that salary rate;
(16) A retroactive salary adjustment for non-U.S. citizen staff employees or non-U.S. contractors stationed overseas that conforms to a change in FSN salary plans, effective as of the date of such change;
(17) Accrued annual leave as of the time employment is terminated or as of such time as required by local law;
(18) Overtime paid to clerical staff of approved FMD-funded overseas offices;
(19) Fees for professional and consultant services;
(20) Subject to paragraph (b)(7) of this section, international travel expenditures, including per diem and any fees for passports, visas, inoculations, and modifying the originally purchased airline ticket, for activities held outside the United States or in the United States, as allowed under the U.S. Federal Travel Regulations (41 CFR parts 300 through 304), except that if the activity is participation in a retail or trade exhibit or show held inside the United States, international travel expenditures are reimbursable only if the exhibit or show is included on the list of approved U.S. exhibits and shows announced via a program notice issued on FAS' website and the exhibit or show is one that the Cooperator has not participated in within the last three calendar years using funds from a source other than FMD. Retail and trade exhibits and shows held inside the United States may be considered for inclusion on the list of approved exhibits and shows if they are: A food or agricultural exhibit or show with no less than 30% of exhibitors selling food or agricultural products, and an international exhibit or show that targets buyers, distributors, and the like from more than one foreign country and no less than 15% of its visitors are from countries other than the host country;
(i) CCC generally will not reimburse any portion of air travel, including any fees for modifying the originally purchased ticket, in excess of the full fare economy rate. If a traveler flies in business class or a different premium class, the basis for reimbursement will be the full fare economy class rate for the same flight and the Cooperator shall provide documentation establishing such full fare economy class rate to support its reimbursement claim. If economy class is not offered for the same flight or if the traveler flies on a charter flight, the basis for reimbursement will be the average of the full fare economy class rate for flights offered by three different airlines between the same points on the same date and the Cooperator shall provide documentation establishing such average of the full fare economy class rates to support its reimbursement claim;
(ii) In very limited circumstances, the Cooperator may be reimbursed for air travel up to the business class rate
(
i.e.,
a premium class rate other than the first-class rate). Such circumstances are:
(A) Regularly scheduled flights between origin and destination points do not offer economy class (or equivalent) airfare and the Cooperator receives written documentation to that effect at the time the tickets are purchased;
(B) Business class air travel is necessary to accommodate an eligible traveler's disability. Such disability must be substantiated in writing by a physician; or
(C) An eligible traveler's origin and/or destination are outside of the continental United States and the scheduled flight time, beginning with the scheduled departure time and ending with the scheduled arrival time, including stopovers and changes of planes, exceeds 14 hours. In such cases, per diem and other allowable expenses will also be reimbursable for the day of arrival. However, no expenses will be reimbursable for a rest period or for any non-work days (
e.g.,
weekends, holidays, personal leave, etc.) immediately following the date of arrival. A stopover is the time a traveler spends at an airport, other than the originating or destination airport, which is a normally scheduled part of a flight. A change of planes is the time a traveler spends at an airport, other than the originating or destination airport, to disembark from one flight and embark on another. All travel should follow a direct or usually traveled route. Under no circumstances should a traveler select flights in a manner that extends the scheduled flight time to beyond 14 hours in part to secure eligibility for reimbursement of business class travel; and
(iii) Alternatively, in lieu of reimbursing up to the business class rate in such circumstances, CCC will reimburse economy class airfare plus per diem and other allowable travel expenses related to a rest period of up to 24 hours, either en route or upon arrival at the destination. For a trip with multiple destinations, each origin/destination combination will be considered separately when applying the 14-hour rule for eligibility of reimbursement of business class travel or rest period expenses;
(21) Automobile mileage at the local U.S. Embassy rate, or rental cars while in travel status;
(22) Subject to § 1484.37 and paragraph (b)(7) of this section, other allowable expenditures while in travel status;
(23) Organization costs for overseas offices approved in agreements. Such costs include incorporation fees, brokers' fees, fees to attorneys, accountants, or investment counselors, whether or not employees of the organization, incurred in connection with the establishment or reorganization of the overseas office, and rent, utilities, communications originating overseas, office supplies, accident liability insurance premiums (provided the types and extent and cost of coverage are in accordance with the Cooperator's policy and sound business practice), and routine accounting and legal services required to maintain the overseas office;
(24) With prior CCC approval, the purchase, lease, or repair of, or insurance premiums for capital goods that have an expected useful life of at least one year, such as furniture, equipment, machinery, removable fixtures, draperies, blinds, floor coverings, computer hardware and software, and portable electronic communications devices (including mobile phones, wireless email devices, and personal digital assistants);
(25) Premiums for health or accident insurance or other benefits for foreign national employees that the employer is required by law to pay, provided that such benefits are granted under established written policies;
(26) Accident liability insurance premiums for facilities used jointly with third party participants for Cooperator program activities, or such insurance premiums for Cooperator program-funded travel of non-Cooperator personnel, provided the types and extent and cost of coverage are in accordance with the Cooperator's policy and sound business practice;
(27) Market research, including research to determine the types of products that are desired in a market;
(28) Independent evaluations and audits, if not otherwise required by CCC, to ensure compliance with program requirements;
(29) Legal fees to obtain advice on the host country's labor laws;
(30) Employment agency fees;
(31) STRE incurred outside of the United States, and STRE incurred in conjunction with an approved activity taking place within the United States with prior written approval from CCC. Cooperators are required to use the appropriate American Embassy representational funding guidelines for breakfasts, lunches, dinners, and receptions. Cooperators may exceed Embassy guidelines only when they have received written authorization from the FAS Attaché/Counselor at the Embassy. The amount of unauthorized STRE expenses that exceed the guidelines will not be reimbursed. Cooperators must pay the difference between the total cost of STRE events and the appropriate amount as determined by the guidelines. For STRE incurred in the United States, the Cooperator should provide, in its request for approval, the basis for determining its proposed expenses;
(32) Travel costs for dependents as allowed in 2 CFR part 200 (
e.g.,
for travel of duration of six months or more with prior approval of CCC);
(33) Evacuation payments (safe haven) and shipment and storage of household goods and motor vehicles for relocations lasting at least 12 months;
(34) Approved demonstration projects;
(35) Purchase of trade and business periodicals containing material related to market development activities for use by overseas staffs;
(36) Training expenses in the United States for FSNs;
(37) Language training for U.S. citizen employees at the foreign post of assignment;
(38) Forward year financial obligations required by local law or custom, such as severance pay, attributable to employment of foreign nationals, or forfeiture of rent or deposits, attributable to the closure of an office;
(39) Rental or lease expenditures for storage space for program-related materials;
(40) Shipment of samples or other program materials;
(41) That portion of airtime for wireless phones that is devoted to program activities and monthly service fees prorated at the proportion of program-related airtime to total airtime;
(42) Non-travel expenditures associated with conducting international staff conferences held either in or outside the United States;
(43) An audit of a Cooperator as required by 2 CFR part 200, subpart F, if the Cooperator program is the Cooperator's largest source of Federal funding;
(44) The translation of written materials as necessary to carry out approved activities;
(45) Business cards that target a foreign audience;
(46) Expenditures associated with developing, updating, and servicing websites on the internet that: Contain a message related to exporting or international trade, include a discernible “link” to the FAS/Washington homepage or an FAS overseas homepage, and have been specifically approved by FAS. Expenditures related to websites or portions of websites that are accessible only to an organization's members are not reimbursable. Reimbursement claims for websites that include any sort of “members only” sections must be prorated to exclude the costs associated with those areas subject to restricted access;
(47) Expenditures related to copyright, trademark, or patent registration, including attorney fees;
(48) Expenditures not otherwise prohibited from reimbursement that are associated with activities held in the United States or abroad designed to improve market access by specifically addressing temporary, permanent, or impending technical barriers to trade that prohibit or threaten U.S. exports of agricultural commodities;
(49) Membership fees in professional, industry-related organizations; and
(50) Contracts with U.S.-based organizations when the only contracted service such organizations provide to a Cooperator is carrying out a specific market promotion activity in the United States directed to a foreign audience (
e.g.,
a trade mission of foreign buyers coming to the United States to visit U.S. exporters). Such contracts may be reimbursable as a direct promotional expense. If a U.S.-based organization provides administrative services to the Cooperator's domestic home
office during a program year, any direct promotional services such organization provides to the Cooperator, whether for the Cooperator's domestic or overseas offices, during the same program year are not reimbursable.

(1) The activity was approved by CCC prior to the end of the program year;
(2) The activity was completed within 30 calendar days following the end of the program year; and
(3) All expenditures were made for the activity within 6 months following the end of the program year.
(d) A Cooperator shall not use project funds for any activity, or any expenses incurred by the Cooperator prior to the date specified in the approval letter or after the date the agreement is suspended or terminated, except as otherwise permitted by CCC.
§ 1484.54
Reimbursement procedures.
(a) Following the implementation of a project for which CCC has agreed to provide funding, a Cooperator may submit claims for reimbursement of eligible expenses incurred in implementing FMD activities, to the extent that CCC has agreed to pay such expenses. Any changes to approved activities must be approved in writing by CCC before any reimbursable expenses associated with the change can be incurred. A Cooperator will be reimbursed after CCC reviews the claim and determines that it is complete.
(b) All claims for reimbursement shall be submitted by the FMD Cooperator's U.S. office to CCC. CCC will make all payments to Cooperators in U.S. dollars. FAS will initiate payment within 30 days after receipt of the billing, unless the billing is improper.
(c) Cooperators will be authorized to submit requests for reimbursement or advance at least monthly when electronic fund transfers (EFTs) are not used, and as frequently as desired when electronic transfers are used, in accordance with the provisions of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (15 U.S.C. 1693-1693r).
(d) CCC will not reimburse claims submitted later than 6 months after the end of an FMD Cooperator's program year.
(e) If CCC overpays a reimbursement claim, the FMD Cooperator shall repay CCC within 30 calendar days of such overpayment the amount of the overpayment either by submitting a check payable to CCC or by offsetting its next reimbursement claim. The FMD Cooperator shall make such payment in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise approved in advance by CCC.
(f) If a Cooperator receives a reimbursement or offsets an advanced payment which is later disallowed, the Cooperator shall repay CCC within 30 calendar days of such disallowance the amount disallowed either by submitting a check payable to CCC or by offsetting its next reimbursement claim. The Cooperator shall make such payment in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise approved in advance by CCC.
(g) FMD funds may be expended by FMD Cooperators only on legitimate, approved activities as set forth in the agreement and approval letter. If a Cooperator discovers that FMD funds have not been properly spent, it shall notify CCC and shall within 30 calendar days of its discovery repay CCC the amount owed either by submitting a check payable to CCC or by offsetting its next reimbursement claim. The FMD Cooperator shall make such payment in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise approved in advance by CCC.
(h) The FMD Cooperator shall report any actions that may have a bearing on the propriety of any claims for reimbursement in writing to the appropriate Attaché/Counselor and its U.S. office shall report such actions in writing to the appropriate FAS Division Director.
§ 1484.55
Advances.
(a)
Policy.
In general, CCC operates the Cooperator program on a reimbursable basis.
(b)
Exception.
Upon request, CCC may make two types of advance payments to a Cooperator. The first is a revolving fund operating advance provided by CCC only to Cooperators with foreign offices supported with project funds. The second is a special advance payment used to pay an impending large cost item. CCC will provide this type of advance expense payment in lieu of direct payments by CCC to vendors or other third parties. All Cooperators, with or without project fund-supported foreign offices, are eligible to request special advance payments. CCC will not make any special advance payment to a Cooperator where a special advance is outstanding from a prior program year. When approving a request for an advance, CCC may require the Cooperator to carry adequate fidelity bond coverage when the absence of such coverage is considered to create an unacceptable risk to the interests of the Cooperator program. Whether an “unacceptable risk” exists in a particular situation will depend on a number of factors, such as, the Cooperator's history of performance in the Cooperator program, the Cooperator's perceived financial stability and resources, and any other factors presented in the particular situation that may reflect on the Cooperator's responsibility or the riskiness of its activities.
(c)
Interest.
A Cooperator shall deposit and maintain in an insured account in the United States all funds advanced by CCC. The account shall be interest-bearing, unless the exceptions in 2 CFR part 200 apply. Interest earned by the Cooperator on funds advanced by CCC is not program income. Up to $500 of interest earned per year may be retained by the Cooperator for administrative expenses. Any additional interest earned on Federal advance payments shall be remitted annually to the appropriate entity as required in 2 CFR part 200.
(d)
Refunds due CCC.
A Cooperator shall fully expend all advances on approved activities within 90 calendar days after the date of disbursement by CCC. By the end of the 90 calendar days, the Cooperator must submit reimbursement claims to offset the advance and submit a check made payable to CCC for any unexpended balance. The Cooperator shall make such payment in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise approved in advance by CCC.

# Subpart E—Reporting, Evaluation, and Compliance
§ 1484.70
Reports.
(a) Cooperators are required to submit regular financial and performance reports in accordance with their agreement. Reporting requirements and formats for the required financial and performance reports will be specified in the agreement between CCC and the Cooperator.
(b)(1) In addition to the information required in 2 CFR 200.329(c)(2), a Cooperator's performance reports must include pertinent information regarding the Cooperator's progress, measured against established indicators, baselines, and targets, towards achieving the expected results specified in the agreement. This reporting must include, for each performance indicator, a comparison of actual accomplishments with the baseline and the targets established for the period. When actual accomplishments deviate significantly from targeted goals, the Cooperator must provide an explanation in the report.
(2) A Cooperator must ensure the accuracy and reliability of the performance data submitted to FAS in performance reports. At any time during the period of performance of the agreement, FAS may review the Cooperator's performance data to determine whether it is accurate and reliable. The Cooperator must comply with all requests made by FAS or an entity designated by FAS in relation to such reviews.
(c) All final performance reports will be made available to the public.
(d) Not later than 45 calendar days after the completion of travel (other than local travel), a Cooperator shall submit a trip report. The report must be submitted to the appropriate Attaché/Counselor(s) and must include the name(s) of the traveler(s), purpose
of travel, itinerary, names and affiliations of contacts, and a brief summary of findings, conclusions, recommendations, and specific accomplishments.
(e) Not later than 90 calendar days after the end of its program year, a Cooperator shall submit a report on any research conducted pursuant to the approved FMD program.
(f) If requested by FAS, a Cooperator must provide to FAS additional information or reports relating to the agreement.
(g) If a Cooperator requires an extension of a reporting deadline, it must ensure that FAS receives an extension request at least five business days prior to the reporting deadline. FAS may decline to consider a request for an extension that it receives after this time period. FAS will consider requests for reporting deadline extensions on a case by case basis and will make a decision based on the merits of each request. FAS will consider factors such as unforeseen or extenuating circumstances and past performance history when evaluating requests for extensions.
[85 FR 1084, Jan. 9, 2020, as amended at 86 FR 68882, Dec. 6, 2021]
§ 1484.71
Disclosure of program information.
(a) Documents submitted to CCC by Cooperators are subject to the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552, 7 CFR part 1, subpart A, and, specifically, 7 CFR 1.12.
(b) Upon request, a Cooperator shall provide to any person a copy of any document in its possession or control containing market information that is developed and produced under the terms of its agreement. The Cooperator may charge a fee not to exceed the costs for assembling, duplicating, and distributing the materials.
(c) Any research conducted by a Cooperator pursuant to an agreement and/or approval letter shall be subject to the provisions relating to intangible property in 2 CFR part 200.
§ 1484.72
Evaluation.
(a) The Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) of 1993 (5 U.S.C. 306, 31 U.S.C. 1105, 1115-1119, 3515, 9703-9704) requires performance measurement of Federal programs, including the Cooperator program. Evaluation of the Cooperator program's effectiveness will depend on a clear statement by each Cooperator of the constraints and opportunities facing U.S. exports, goals to be met within a specified time, a schedule of measurable milestones for gauging success, a plan for achievement, and reports of activity results at regular intervals. The overall goal of Cooperators' programming is to achieve or maintain sales that would not have occurred in the absence of FMD funding. A Cooperator that can demonstrate such sales, taking into account extenuating factors beyond the Cooperator's control, will have met the overall objective of the GPRA and the need for evaluation.
(b) Evaluation is an integral element of program planning and implementation, providing the basis for the strategic plan. The evaluation results guide the development and scope of a Cooperator's program, contribute to program accountability, and provide evidence of program effectiveness.
(c) When required by CCC, a Cooperator shall complete a program evaluation. A program evaluation is a review of the Cooperator's entire program, or an appropriate portion of the program as agreed to by the Cooperator and CCC, to determine the effectiveness of the Cooperator's strategy in meeting specified goals. The actual scope and timing of the program evaluation shall be determined by the Cooperator and CCC and specified in the Cooperator's approval letter. A Cooperator may contract with an independent evaluator to satisfy this requirement, although CCC reserves the right to have direct input and control over the design, scope, and methodology of any such evaluation, including direct contact with and provision of guidance to the independent evaluator. In addition to the requirements set forth in 2 CFR part 200, a program evaluation shall contain:
(1) The name of the party conducting the evaluation;
(2) The activities covered by the evaluation;
(3) A concise statement of the constraint(s) and opportunities and the
goals specified in the approved agreement;
(4) A description of the evaluation methodology;
(5) A description of additional export sales achieved, including the ratio of additional export sales in relation to Cooperator program funding received;
(6) A summary of the findings, including an analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the program(s); and
(7) Recommendations for future programs.
(d) A Cooperator shall submit, via a cover letter to CCC, an executive summary that assesses the program evaluation's findings and recommendations and proposed changes in program strategy or design as a result of the evaluation.
(e) On an annual basis, or more often when appropriate or required by CCC, a Cooperator shall complete and submit program success stories. CCC will announce to all Cooperators the detailed requirements for completing and submitting program success stories.
[85 FR 1084, Jan. 9, 2020, as amended at 86 FR 68882, Dec. 6, 2021]
§ 1484.73
Failure to make required contribution.
A Cooperator's required contribution will be specified in the Cooperator's approval letter. If a Cooperator fails to contribute the amount specified in its approval letter, the Cooperator shall pay to CCC in U.S. dollars the difference between the amount it has contributed, and the amount specified in the approval letter. If the Cooperator's required contribution is specified as a percentage of the total amount reimbursed by CCC, the Cooperator may either return to CCC the necessary amount of funds reimbursed by CCC to increase its actual contribution percentage to the required level or pay to CCC in dollars the difference between the amount actually contributed and the amount of funds necessary to increase its actual contribution percentage to the required level. A Cooperator shall remit such payment within six months after the end of its program year. The Cooperator shall make such payment in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise approved in advance by CCC.
§ 1484.74
Compliance reviews and notices.
(a) USDA staff may conduct compliance reviews of a Cooperator's activities under this program to ensure compliance with this part, applicable Federal laws and regulations, and the terms of the agreements and approval letters. Cooperators shall cooperate fully with relevant USDA staff conducting compliance reviews and shall comply with all requests from USDA staff to facilitate the conduct of such reviews. Program funds spent inappropriately or on unapproved activities must be returned to CCC.
(b) Any project or activity funded under the program is subject to review or audit at any time during the course of implementation or after the completion of the project.
(c) Upon conclusion of the compliance review, USDA staff will provide a written compliance report to the Cooperator. The compliance report will detail any instances where it appears that the Cooperator is not complying with any of the terms or conditions of the agreement, approval letter, or the applicable laws and regulations. The report will also specify if it appears that CCC may be entitled to recover funds from the Cooperator and will explain the basis for any recovery of funds from the Cooperator. If, as a result of a compliance review, CCC determines that further review is needed in order to ensure compliance with the requirements of the Cooperator program, CCC may require the Cooperator to contract for an independent audit.
(d) In addition, CCC may notify a Cooperator in writing at any time if CCC determines that CCC may be entitled to recover funds from the Cooperator. CCC will explain the basis for any recovery of funds from the Cooperator in the written notice. The Cooperator shall, within 30 calendar days of the date of the notice, repay CCC the amount owed either by submitting a check payable to CCC or by offsetting its next reimbursement claim. The Cooperator shall make such payment in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise approved in advance by CCC. If, however, a Cooperator notifies CCC within 30 calendar days of the date of the written notice that the Cooperator intends to file an
appeal pursuant to the provisions of this part, the amount owed to CCC by the Cooperator is not due until the appeal procedures are concluded and CCC has made a final determination as to the amount owed.
(e) The fact that a compliance review has been conducted by USDA staff does not signify that a Cooperator is in full compliance with its agreement, approval letter, and/or applicable laws and regulations.
§ 1484.75
Cooperator response to compliance report.
(a) A Cooperator shall, within 60 calendar days of the date of the issuance of a compliance report, submit a written response to CCC. The response may include additional documentation for consideration or a request for reconsideration of any finding along with supporting justification. If the Cooperator does not wish to contest the compliance report, the response shall include any money owed to CCC, which may be returned by submitting a check payable to CCC or by offsetting a reimbursement claim. The Cooperator shall make any payments in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise approved in advance by CCC. CCC, at its discretion, may extend the period for response.
(b) After reviewing the response, CCC shall determine whether the Cooperator owes any funds to CCC and will inform the Cooperator in writing of the basis for the determination. CCC may initiate action to collect such amount by providing the Cooperator a written demand for payment of the debt pursuant to debt settlement policies and procedures in 7 CFR part 1403.
§ 1484.76
Cooperator appeals of CCC determinations.
(a) Within 30 calendar days of the date of the issuance of a determination, the Cooperator may appeal the determination by making a request in writing that includes the basis for such reconsideration. The Cooperator may also request a hearing.
(b) If the Cooperator requests a hearing, CCC will set a date and time for the hearing. The hearing will be an informal proceeding. A transcript will not ordinarily be prepared unless the Cooperator bears the cost of a transcript; however, CCC may, at its discretion, have a transcript prepared at CCC's expense.
(c) CCC will base its final determination upon information contained in the administrative record. The Cooperator must exhaust all administrative remedies contained in this section before pursuing judicial review of a determination by CCC.
§ 1484.77
Submissions.
For all permissible methods of delivery, submissions required by this part shall be deemed submitted as of the date received by CCC.
§ 1484.78
Amendments.
An agreement may be amended in writing with the consent of CCC and the Cooperator. All requests for program amendments must be submitted to CCC in writing and contain a justification for why the amendment is necessary. All amendment requests must be reviewed and approved by CCC before an amendment can be issued.
§ 1484.79
Subrecipients.
(a) A Cooperator may utilize the services of a subrecipient to implement activities under the agreement if this is provided for in the agreement. The subrecipient may receive CCC-provided funds, program income, or other resources from the Cooperator for this purpose. The Cooperator must enter in to a written subaward with the subrecipient and comply with the applicable provisions of 2 CFR 200.332 and/or the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), if applicable. If required by the agreement, the Cooperator must provide a copy of such subaward to FAS, in the manner set forth in the agreement, prior to the transfer of CCC-provided funds or program income to the subrecipient.
(b) A Cooperator must include the following requirements in a subaward:
(1) The subrecipient is required to comply with the applicable provisions of this part and 2 CFR parts 200 and 400 and/or the FAR, if applicable. The applicable provisions are those that relate specifically to subrecipients, as well as those relating to non-Federal entities that impose requirements that would be reasonable to pass through to
a subrecipient because they directly concern the implementation by the subrecipient of one or more activities under the agreement. If there is a question about whether a particular provision is applicable, FAS will make the determination.
(2) The subrecipient must pay to the Cooperator the value of CCC-provided funds, interest, or program income that are not used in accordance with the subaward, or that are lost, damaged, or misused as a result of the subrecipient's failure to exercise reasonable care.
(3) In accordance with 2 CFR 200.501(h), subawards must include a description of the applicable compliance requirements and the subrecipient's compliance responsibility. Methods to ensure compliance may include pre-award audits, monitoring during the agreement, and post-award audits.
(c) A Cooperator must monitor the actions of a subrecipient as necessary to ensure that CCC-provided funds and program income provided to the subrecipient are used for authorized purposes in compliance with applicable U.S. Federal laws and regulations and the subaward and that performance indicator targets are achieved for both activities and results under the agreement.
[85 FR 1084, Jan. 9, 2020, as amended at 86 FR 68882, Dec. 6, 2021]
§ 1484.80
Audit requirements.
(a) Subpart F of 2 CFR part 200 applies to all Cooperators and subrecipients under this part other than those that are for-profit entities, foreign public entities, or foreign organizations.
(b) A Cooperator or subrecipient that is a for-profit entity or a subrecipient that is a foreign organization and that expends, during its fiscal year, a total of at least the audit requirement threshold in 2 CFR 200.501 in Federal awards, is required to obtain an audit. Such a Cooperator or subrecipient has the following two options to satisfy this requirement:
(1)(i) A financial audit of the agreement or subaward, in accordance with the Government Auditing Standards issued by the United States Government Accountability Office (GAO), if the Cooperator or subrecipient expends Federal awards under only one FAS program during such fiscal year; or
(ii) A financial audit of all Federal awards from FAS, in accordance with GAO's Government Auditing Standards, if the Cooperator or subrecipient expends Federal awards under multiple FAS programs during such fiscal year; or
(2) An audit that meets the requirements contained in subpart F of 2 CFR part 200.
(c) A Cooperator or subrecipient that is a for-profit entity or a subrecipient that is a foreign organization and that expends, during its fiscal year, a total that is less than the audit requirement threshold in 2 CFR 200.501 in Federal awards, is exempt from requirements under this section for an audit for that year, except as provided in paragraphs (d) and (f) of this section, but it must make records available for review by appropriate officials of Federal agencies.
(d) FAS may require an annual financial audit of an agreement or subaward when the audit requirement threshold in 2 CFR 200.501 is not met. In that case, FAS must provide funds under the agreement for this purpose, and the Cooperator or subrecipient, as applicable, must arrange for such audit and submit it to FAS.
(e) When a Cooperator or subrecipient that is a for-profit entity or a subrecipient that is a foreign organization is required to obtain a financial audit under this section, it must provide a copy of the audit to FAS within 60 days after the end of its fiscal year.
(f) FAS, the USDA Office of Inspector General, or GAO may conduct or arrange for additional audits of any Cooperators or subrecipients, including for-profit entities and foreign organizations. Cooperators and subrecipients must promptly comply with all requests related to such audits. If FAS conducts or arranges for an additional audit, such as an audit with respect to a particular agreement, FAS will fund the full cost of such an audit, in accordance with 2 CFR 200.503(d).
§ 1484.81
Suspension and termination of agreements.
(a) An agreement or subaward may be suspended or terminated in accordance with 2 CFR 200.339 or 200.340. FAS may suspend or terminate an agreement if it determines that:
(1) One of the bases in 2 CFR 200.339 or 200.340 for termination or suspension by FAS has been satisfied; or
(2) The continuation of the assistance provided under the agreement is no longer necessary or desirable.
(b) If an agreement is terminated, the Cooperator:
(1) Is responsible for using or returning any CCC-provided funds, interest, or program income that have not been disbursed, as agreed to by FAS; and
(2) Must comply with any closeout and post-closeout procedures specified in the agreement and 2 CFR 200.344 and 200.345.
[85 FR 1084, Jan. 9, 2020, as amended at 86 FR 68882, Dec. 6, 2021]
§ 1484.82
Noncompliance with an agreement.
(a) If a Cooperator fails to comply with any term in its agreement, approval letter, or this part, CCC may take one or more of the enforcement actions in 2 CFR part 200 and, if appropriate, initiate a claim against the Cooperator, following the procedures set forth in this part. CCC may also initiate a claim against a Cooperator if program income or CCC-provided funds are lost due to an action or omission of the Cooperator. If any Cooperator has engaged in fraud with respect to the Cooperator program, or has otherwise violated program requirements under this part, CCC may:
(1) Hold such Cooperator liable for any and all losses to CCC resulting from such fraud or violation;
(2) Require a refund of any assistance provided to such Cooperator plus interest as determined by FAS; and
(3) Collect liquidated damages from such Cooperator in an amount determined appropriate by FAS.
(b) The provisions of this section shall be without prejudice to any other remedy that is available under any other provision of law.

# Subpart B—Market Access Program
§ 1485.10
General purpose and scope.
(a) This subpart sets forth the general terms and conditions governing the Commodity Credit Corporation's (CCC) operation of the Market Access Program (MAP).
(b)(1) The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued guidance on Uniform Administrative Requirements,
Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards in 2 CFR part 200. In 2 CFR 400.1, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) adopted OMB's guidance in subparts A through F of 2 CFR part 200, as supplemented by 2 CFR part 400, as USDA policies and procedures for uniform administrative requirements, cost principles, and audit requirements for Federal awards.
(2) The OMB guidance at 2 CFR part 200, as supplemented by 2 CFR part 400 and this subpart, applies to the Market Access Program (MAP) Program.
(3) In addition to the provisions of this subpart, other regulations that are generally applicable to grants and cooperative agreements of USDA, including the applicable regulations set forth in 2 CFR chapters I, II, and IV, also apply to the MAP, to the extent that these regulations do not directly conflict with the provisions of this subpart. The provisions of the CCC Charter Act (15 U.S.C. 714
et seq.
) and any other statutory or regulatory provisions that are generally applicable to CCC also apply to the MAP.
(c) Under the MAP, CCC may provide grants to eligible U.S. entities to conduct certain marketing and promotion activities aimed at developing, maintaining, or expanding commercial export markets for U.S. agricultural commodities. MAP Participants may receive assistance for either generic or brand promotion activities. While activities generally take place overseas, reimbursable activities may also take place in the United States. CCC expects all activities that occur in the United States for which MAP reimbursement is sought to develop, maintain, or expand the commercial export market for the relevant U.S. agricultural commodity in accordance with the MAP Participant's approved MAP program.
(d) The MAP generally operates on a reimbursement basis.
(e) CCC's policy is to ensure that benefits generated by MAP agreements are broadly available throughout the relevant agricultural sector and that no single entity gains an undue advantage or sole benefit from program activities. CCC also endeavors to enter into MAP agreements covering a broad array of agricultural commodity sectors. The MAP is administered by the Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) acting on behalf of CCC.
§ 1485.11
Definitions.
For purposes of this subpart the following definitions apply:
Activity
means a specific foreign market development effort undertaken by a MAP Participant.
Administrative expenses or costs

i.e.,
a brand owned primarily by foreign interests and being used to market a commodity or product in a foreign market), if the foreign brand uses the promoted eligible commodity or product from multiple U.S. suppliers. A generic promotion activity may also involve the use of specific U.S. company names, logos, or brand names. However, in that case, the MAP Participant must ensure that all U.S. companies seeking to promote such eligible commodity in the market have an equal opportunity to participate in the activity and that at least two U.S. companies participate. In addition, an activity that promotes separate items from multiple U.S. companies will be considered a generic promotion only if
the promotion of the separate items maintains a unified theme (

Program notice
means documents that CCC issues for informational purposes. These notices are currently made available electronically through the FAS website. These notices have no legal effect.

U.S. agricultural commodity
means any agricultural commodity of U.S. origin, including food, feed, fiber, forestry product, livestock, insects, and fish harvested from a U.S. aquaculture farm or harvested by a vessel (as defined in Title 46 of the United States Code) in waters that are not waters (including the territorial sea) of a foreign country, and any product thereof.

§ 1485.14
Application review and formation of agreements.
(a)
General.
(1) CCC will, subject to the availability of funds, approve those applications that it considers to present the best opportunity for developing, maintaining, or expanding export markets for U.S. agricultural commodities. CCC will review all proposals for eligibility and completeness. CCC will evaluate and score each proposal against the factors described in the NOFO. The purpose of this review is to identify meritorious proposals, recommend an appropriate funding level for each proposal, and submit the proposals and funding recommendations to appropriate officials for decision. CCC may, when appropriate to the subject matter of the proposal, request the assistance of other U.S. Government experts in evaluating the merits of a proposal.
(2) When considering eligible nonprofit U.S. trade organizations, CCC may weigh which organizations have the broadest producer representation and affiliated industry participation of the commodity being promoted. CCC
may require that an applicant participate in the MAP through another MAP Participant or applicant. All reviewers will be required to sign a conflict of interest form, and when conflicts of interests are identified the reviewer will be recused from the objective review process.
(b)
Application review criteria.
CCC follows results-oriented management principles and considers the following criteria when assessing the likelihood of success of the applications it receives, determining which applications to recommend for approval, and developing preliminary recommended funding levels:
(1) Strategic planning (25%);
(2) Program implementation (25%); and
(3) Program results and evaluation (50%).
(c)
Allocation factors.
CCC determines final funding levels after allocating available funds to approved applications on the basis of criteria that will be fully described in each program year's MAP announcement. Generally, extensions will not be allowable.
(d)
Approval decision
—(1)
Approval decision.
CCC will approve those applications that it determines best satisfy the criteria and factors specified in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section.
(2)
Notification of decision.
CCC will notify each applicant in writing of the final disposition of its application. CCC will send an agreement, an approval letter, and a signature card to each approved applicant. The agreement and the approval letter will outline which activities and budgets are approved and will specify any special terms and conditions applicable to a MAP Participant's program, including any requirements with respect to contribution, cost share and program evaluations. An applicant that decides to accept the terms and conditions contained in the agreement and the approval letter must so indicate by having its Chief Executive Officer (CEO) or designee sign the agreement and the approval letter and submit these to CCC. Final agreement shall occur when the agreement and the approval letter are signed by both parties. The agreement, approval letter, and this subpart shall establish the terms and conditions of a MAP agreement between CCC and the approved applicant.
(e)
Signature cards.
The MAP Participant shall designate at least two individuals in its organization to sign agreements and amendments, approval letters, reimbursement claims, and advance requests. The MAP Participant shall submit the signature card signed by those designated individuals and by the MAP Participant's CEO to CCC prior to the start of the program year. The Participant shall immediately notify CCC of any changes in signatories (
e.g.,
removal or addition of individuals, name changes, etc.), and shall submit a revised signature card accordingly.
(f)
UES ID and passwords.
CCC will provide each MAP Participant with IDs and passwords for the UES system, as necessary. MAP Participants shall protect these IDs and passwords in accordance with USDA's information technology policies. MAP Participants shall immediately notify CCC whenever a person who possesses the ID and password information no longer needs such information or a person who is not authorized gains such information.
(g)
Annual size certification.
A MAP Participant through which small-sized U.S. for-profit entities and/or U.S. agricultural cooperatives are participating in the MAP program shall obtain annual certifications from all such entities that they are small-sized U.S. entities or U.S. agricultural cooperatives as defined in these regulations. The Participant shall retain these certifications in accordance with the recordkeeping requirements of this subpart.
(h)
Changes to activities and funding
—(1)
Adding a new activity.
(i) A MAP Participant may not conduct a new activity without first obtaining an approved activity budget for such change. To request approval of such activity budget, the MAP Participant shall submit a notification to CCC.
(ii) A notification for a new activity shall provide an activity justification and identify any related adjustments to the approved strategic plan, including changes in the market, constraint, or opportunity that the activity proposes to address. The notification shall contain the activity description, the
proposed budget, and a justification for the transfer of funds.
(iii) After receipt of the notification, CCC will inform the MAP Participant via the UES system whether the requested budget is approved.
(2)
Modifying existing activities and their funding levels.
(i) A MAP Participant desiring to increase the funding level for existing, approved activities addressing a single constraint or opportunity by more than $25,000 or 25 percent of the approved funding level, whichever is greater, must first submit a notification explaining the adjustment to CCC before making such change.
(ii) A MAP Participant may make significant adjustments below that threshold to the funding levels for existing, approved activities without prior notification to CCC, but only if it submits a notification explaining the adjustments to CCC no later than 30 calendar days after the change. Minor adjustments to existing, approved activities and/or funding levels do not require notification.
(iii) Notifications shall describe the activity and any changes to the activity, the existing funding level, or the proposed funding level and shall include a justification for the transfer of funds, if applicable.
§ 1485.15
Operational procedures for brand programs.
(a) Where CCC approves an application by a MAP Participant to run a brand promotion program that will include brand participants, the MAP Participant shall establish brand program operational procedures. The MAP Participant annually shall submit to CCC for approval its proposed brand program operational procedures for such program year. CCC will notify all new and existing MAP Participants in writing in each Participant's approval letter and through the FAS website as to applicable submission dates for brand program operation procedures. Such procedures shall include, at a minimum, a brand program application, application procedures, application review criteria, brand participant eligibility requirements, a participation agreement, reimbursement requirements, compliance requirements, reporting and recordkeeping requirements, employment practices, financial management requirements, contracting procedures, and evaluation requirements.
(b) The MAP Participant shall not enter into any participation agreements with brand participants nor shall it implement any MAP brand activities for the applicable program year unless and until CCC has communicated in writing its approval of the proposed operational procedures to the MAP Participant.
(c) Participation agreements between MAP Participants and brand participants. Where CCC approves a MAP Participant's application to run a brand promotion program that will include brand participants, the MAP Participant shall enter into participation agreements with brand participants. These agreements must:
(1) Specify a time period for such brand promotion and require that all brand promotion expenditures be made within the MAP Participant's approved program year;
(2) Make no allowance for extension or renewal;
(3) Limit reimbursable expenditures to those made in countries and for activities approved in the brand participant's activity plan;
(4) Specify the percentage of promotion expenditures that will be reimbursed, reimbursement procedures, and documentation requirements;
(5) Include a written certification by the brand participant that it either owns the brand of the product it will promote or has exclusive rights to promote the brand in each of the countries in which promotion activities will occur;
(6) Require: That all product labels, promotional material, and advertising will identify the origin of the eligible commodity as “American,” “Product of the United States of America,” “Product of the U.S.,” “Product of the U.S.A.,” “Product of America,” “Grown in the United States of America,” “Grown in the U.S.,” “Grown in the U.S.A.,” “Grown in America,” “Made in the United States of America,” “Made in the U.S.,” “Made in the U.S.A.,” “Made in America,” or product of, grown in, or made in any state
or territory of the United States of America spelled out in its entirety, or other U.S. regional designation if approved in advance by CCC; that such origin identification will be conspicuously displayed in a manner easily observed as identifying the origin of the product; and that such origin identification will conform, to the extent possible, to the U.S. standard of
1/6
inch (.42 centimeters) in height based on the lower case letter “o.” The use of these terms as a descriptor or in the name of the product (
e.g.,
Texas style chili, Bob's American Pizza) does not satisfy the product origin requirement. Phrases “product of,” “grown in,” or “made in” are encouraged, but not required. A MAP Participant that wishes to use an origin statement that varies from those set out in this subsection must submit the proposed statement to CCC for review and must receive approval to use the statement before its use in an activity. A MAP Participant may request an exemption from this requirement on a case by case basis. All such requests shall be in writing and include justification satisfactory to CCC that this labeling requirement would hinder a MAP Participant's promotional efforts. CCC will determine, on a case by case basis, whether sufficient justification exists to grant an exemption from the labeling requirement. In addition, CCC may temporarily waive this requirement where CCC has determined that such labeling will likely harm sales rather than help them. Such determinations will be announced to MAP Participants via a program notice issued on FAS' website;
(7) Include a written certification by the brand participant that it is either a small-sized entity as defined in this subpart or a U.S. agricultural cooperative;
(8) Require that the brand participant submit to the MAP Participant a statement certifying that any Federal funds received will supplement, but not supplant, any private or third-party funds or other contribution or cost share to program activities; and
(9) Require the brand participant to maintain all original records and documents relating to program activities for five calendar years following the end of the applicable program year and make such records and documents available upon request to authorized officials of the U.S. Government.

However, non-travel expenditures associated with retail, trade, and consumer exhibits and shows held inside the United States are reimbursable only if the exhibit or show is included on the list of approved U.S. exhibits and shows announced via a program notice issued on FAS' website and the exhibit or show is one that the MAP Participant has not participated in within the last three years using funds from a source other than the MAP. Retail, trade, and consumer exhibits and shows held inside the United States may be considered for inclusion on the list of approved exhibits and shows if they are:
(i) A food or agricultural exhibit or show with no less than 30% of exhibitors selling food or agricultural products; and

at a retail, trade, or consumer exhibit or show held outside the United States. Representatives may include employees and board members of private companies, employees or members of cooperatives, or any broker, consultant, or marketing representative contracted by the company or cooperative to represent the company or cooperative in sales transactions;
(9) Subscriptions that are of a technical, economic, or marketing nature and that are relevant to the approved activities of the MAP Participant;

(13) The design, production, and distribution of coupons for products other than the MAP Participant's promoted products. If such activities include both coupons or price discounts for products other than the MAP Participant's promoted products as well as for MAP-promoted products, expenditures for such activities will not be reimbursed in whole or in part (

destination country in advance of the travel;
(18) Where USDA has sponsored or endorsed a U.S. pavilion at a retail, trade, or consumer exhibit or show, whether held outside or inside the United States, MAP funds may be used to reimburse the travel and/or non-travel expenditures of only those MAP Participants located within the U.S. pavilion. Such expenditures must also adhere to the standard terms and conditions of the U.S. pavilion organizer. Upon written request, CCC may temporarily waive this paragraph (b)(18), on a case by case basis, where the trade show is segregated into product pavilions, a company's distributor or importer is located outside the U.S. pavilion, or when a company can demonstrate that there is a benefit to being located outside the U.S. pavilion. Such waiver will be provided to the MAP Participant in writing; and
(19) Contracts with U.S.-based organizations when the only contracted service such organizations provide to a MAP Participant is carrying out a specific market promotion activity in the United States directed to a foreign audience (
e.g.,
a trade mission of foreign buyers coming to the United States to visit U.S. exporters). Such contracts may be reimbursable as a direct promotional expense. If a U.S.-based organization provides administrative services to the MAP Participant's domestic home office during a program year, any direct promotional services such organization provides to the Participant, whether for the Participant's domestic or overseas offices, during the same program year are not reimbursable.
(c) Subject to paragraphs (a) and (d) of this section, as well as the cost principles in 2 CFR part 200 to the extent these principles do not directly conflict with the provisions of this subpart, but for generic promotion activities only, CCC will also reimburse, in whole or in part, the cost of:
(1) Compensation and allowances for housing, educational tuition, and cost of living adjustments paid to a U.S. citizen employee or a U.S. citizen contractor stationed overseas, provided such benefits are granted under established written policies, except CCC will not reimburse that portion of:
(i) The total of compensation and allowances that exceed 125 percent of the level of a GS-15 Step 10 salary for U.S. Government employees; or
(ii) Allowances that exceed the rate authorized for U.S. Embassy personnel.
(2) Approved Supergrade salaries for non-U.S. citizen employees and non-U.S. contractors stationed overseas;
(3) Compensation of non-U.S. citizen staff employees or non-U.S. contractors stationed overseas, subject to the following limitations:
(i) Where there is a local U.S. Embassy Foreign Service National (FSN) salary plan, CCC will not reimburse any portion of such compensation that exceeds the compensation prescribed for the most comparable position in the FSN salary plan, except for approved Supergrades; or
(ii) Where an FSN salary plan does not exist, CCC will not reimburse any portion of such compensation that exceeds locally prevailing levels, which the MAP Participant shall document by a salary survey or other means, except for approved Supergrades;
(4) A retroactive salary adjustment for non-U.S. citizen staff employees or non-U.S. contractors stationed overseas that conforms to a change in FSN salary plans, effective as of the date of such change;
(5) Accrued annual leave as of the time employment is terminated or as of such time as required by local law;
(6) Overtime paid to clerical staff of approved MAP-funded overseas offices;
(7) Temporary contractor fees for contractors stationed overseas, except CCC will not reimburse any portion of any such fee that exceeds the daily gross GS-15, Step 10 salary for U.S. Government employees in effect on the date the fee is earned, unless a bidding process reveals that such a contractor is not available at or below that salary rate;
(8)(i) Subject to paragraph (b)(18) of this section, international travel expenditures, including per diem and any fees for passports, visas, inoculations, and modifying the originally purchased airline ticket, for activities held outside the United States or in the United States, as allowed under the U.S. Federal Travel Regulations (41 CFR parts
300 through 304), except that if the activity is participation in a retail, trade, or consumer exhibit or show held inside the United States, international travel expenditures are reimbursable only if the exhibit or show is included on the list of approved U.S. exhibits and shows announced via a program notice issued on FAS' website and the exhibit or show is one that the Participant has not participated in within the last three years using funds from a source other than the MAP. Retail, trade, and consumer exhibits and shows held inside the United States may be considered for inclusion on the list of approved exhibits and shows if they are:
(A) A food or agricultural exhibit or show with no less than 30% of exhibitors selling food or agricultural products; and
(B) An international exhibit or show that targets buyers, distributors, and the like from more than one foreign country and no less than 15% of its visitors are from countries other than the host country.
(ii) CCC generally will not reimburse any portion of air travel, including any fees for modifying the originally purchased ticket, in excess of the full fare economy rate. If a traveler flies in business class or a different premium class, the basis for reimbursement will be the full fare economy class rate for the same flight and the MAP Participant shall provide documentation establishing such full fare economy class rate to support its reimbursement claim. If economy class is not offered for the same flight or if the traveler flies on a charter flight, the basis for reimbursement will be the average of the full fare economy class rate for flights offered by three different airlines between the same points on the same date and the MAP Participant shall provide documentation establishing such average of the full fare economy class rates to support its reimbursement claim.
(iii) In very limited circumstances, the MAP Participant may be reimbursed for air travel up to the business class rate (
i.e.,
a premium class rate other than the first class rate). Such circumstances are:
(A) Regularly scheduled flights between the origin and destination points do not offer economy class (or equivalent) airfare and the MAP Participant receives written documentation to that effect at the time the tickets are purchased;
(B) Business class air travel is necessary to accommodate an eligible traveler's disability. Such disability must be substantiated in writing by a physician; or
(C) An eligible traveler's origin and/or destination are outside of the continental United States and the scheduled flight time, beginning with the scheduled departure time and ending with the scheduled arrival time, including stopovers and changes of planes, exceeds 14 hours. In such cases, per diem and other allowable expenses will also be reimbursable for the day of arrival. However, no expenses will be reimbursable for a rest period or for any non-work days (
e.g.,
weekends, holidays, personal leave, etc.) immediately following the date of arrival. A stopover is the time a traveler spends at an airport, other than the originating or destination airport, which is a normally scheduled part of a flight. A change of planes is the time a traveler spends at an airport, other than the originating or destination airport, to disembark from one flight and embark on another. All travel should follow a direct or usually traveled route. Under no circumstances should a traveler select flights in a manner that extends the scheduled flight time to beyond 14 hours in part to secure eligibility for reimbursement of business class travel;
(iv) Alternatively, in lieu of reimbursing up to the business class rate in such circumstances, CCC will reimburse economy class airfare plus per diem and other allowable travel expenses related to a rest period of up to 24 hours, either en route or upon arrival at the destination. For a trip with multiple destinations, each origin/destination combination will be considered separately when applying the 14-hour rule for eligibility of reimbursement of business class travel or rest period expenses;
(9) Automobile mileage at the local U.S. Embassy rate or rental cars while in travel status;
(10) Other allowable expenditures while in travel status as authorized by the U.S. Federal Travel Regulations (41 CFR parts 300 through 304);
(11) Organization costs for overseas offices approved in agreements. Such costs include incorporation fees, brokers' fees, fees to attorneys, accountants, or investment counselors, whether or not employees of the organization, incurred in connection with the establishment or reorganization of the overseas office, and rent, utilities, communications originating overseas, office supplies, accident liability insurance premiums (provided the types and extent and cost of coverage are in accordance with the MAP Participant's policy and sound business practice), and routine accounting and legal services required to maintain the overseas office;
(12) With prior CCC approval, the purchase, lease, or repair of, or insurance premiums for, capital goods that have an expected useful life of at least one year, such as furniture, equipment, machinery, removable fixtures, draperies, blinds, floor coverings, computer hardware and software, and portable electronic communications devices (including mobile phones, wireless email devices, and personal digital assistants);
(13) Such premiums for health or accident insurance and other benefits for foreign national employees that the employer is required by law to pay, provided that such benefits are granted under established written policies;
(14) Accident liability insurance premiums for facilities used jointly with third-party participants for MAP activities or for MAP-funded travel of third-party participants, provided the types and extent and cost of coverage are in accordance with the MAP Participant's policy and sound business practice;
(15) Market research, including research to determine the types of products that are desired in a market;
(16) Independent evaluations and audits, if not otherwise required by CCC, to ensure compliance with program requirements;
(17) Legal fees to obtain advice on the host country's labor laws;
(18) Employment agency fees;
(19) STRE incurred outside of the United States, and STRE incurred in conjunction with an approved activity taking place within the United States with prior written approval from CCC. MAP Participants are required to use the appropriate American Embassy representational funding guidelines for breakfasts, lunches, dinners, and receptions. MAP Participants may exceed Embassy guidelines only when they have received written authorization from the FAS Attaché/Counselor at the Embassy. The amount of unauthorized STRE expenses that exceed the guidelines will not be reimbursed. MAP Participants must pay the difference between the total cost of STRE events and the appropriate amount as determined by the guidelines. For STRE incurred in the United States, the MAP Participant should provide, in its request for approval, the basis for determining its proposed expenses;
(20) Evacuation payments (safe haven) and shipment and storage of household goods and motor vehicles for relocations lasting at least 12 months;
(21) U.S. office(s) administrative support expenses for the National Association of State Departments of Agriculture, the SRTGs, and the Intertribal Agriculture Council;
(22) Non-travel expenditures associated with conducting international staff conferences held either in or outside the United States;
(23) Subject to paragraph (b)(18) of this section, domestic travel expenditures, as allowed under the U.S. Federal Travel Regulations (41 CFR parts 300 through 304), for international retail, trade, and consumer exhibits and shows conducted in the United States. Domestic travel expenses to such a show or exhibit are covered only if the exhibit or show is included on the list of approved U.S. exhibits and shows announced via a program notice issued on FAS' website and the exhibit or show is one that the Participant has not participated in within the last three years using funds from a source other than the MAP. Retail and trade exhibits and shows held inside the United States may be considered for inclusion on the list of approved exhibits and shows if they are:
(i) A food or agricultural exhibit or show with no less than 30% of exhibitors selling food or agricultural products; and
(ii) An international exhibit or show that targets buyers, distributors, and the like from more than one foreign country and no less than 15% of its visitors are from countries other than the host country;
(24) Domestic travel expenditures, as allowed under the U.S. Federal Travel Regulations (41 CFR parts 300 through 304), for seminars and educational training conducted in the United States;
(25) Domestic travel expenditures, as allowed under the U.S. Federal Travel Regulations (41 CFR parts 300 through 304), for one home office MAP Participant employee, one MAP Participant board member, or a state department of agriculture employee paid by the MAP Participant, when such individual accompanies foreign trade missions or technical teams while traveling in the United States where the following conditions are met:
(i) Such trade missions or technical team visits are identified in the MAP Participant's UES;
(ii) Such trade missions or technical team visits have been approved by CCC; and
(iii) The MAP-sponsored traveler submits a follow-up trip report to CCC that includes the following:
(A) Purpose for the individual's participation;
(B) Any pre-arranged business meetings;
(C) Itinerary and/or agenda for the trip; and
(D) Feedback from sponsors and trade mission/technical team members on the success of the trip.
(26) Approved demonstration projects;

(28) Rental or lease expenditures for storage space for program-related materials;
(29) Business cards that target a foreign audience;
(30) Expenditures associated with developing, updating, and servicing websites on the internet that: Contain a message related to exporting or international trade, include a discernible “link” to the FAS/Washington homepage or an FAS overseas homepage, and have been specifically approved by FAS. Expenditures related to websites or portions of websites that are accessible only to an organization's members are not reimbursable. Reimbursement claims for websites that include any sort of “members only” sections must be prorated to exclude the costs associated with those areas subject to restricted access;
(31) Expenditures not otherwise prohibited from reimbursement that are associated with activities held in the United States or abroad designed to improve market access by specifically addressing temporary, permanent, or impending technical barriers to trade that prohibit or threaten U.S. exports of agricultural commodities;
(32) Membership fees in professional, industry-related organizations;
(33) Travel costs for dependents, as allowed in 2 CFR part 200 (
e.g.,
for travel of duration of six months or more with prior approval of CCC);
(34) That portion of airtime for wireless phones that is devoted to program activities and monthly service fees prorated at the proportion of program-related airtime to total airtime; and
(35) Production and distribution of publications.
(d) CCC will not reimburse any cost of:
(1) Forward year financial obligations, such as severance pay, attributable to employment of foreign nationals;
(2) Expenses, fines, settlements, judgments, or payments relating to legal suits, challenges, or disputes, except as otherwise allowed in 2 CFR part 200;

(6) Slotting fees or similar sales expenditures;
(7) The purchase, construction, or lease of space for permanent, non-mobile displays,
i.e.,
displays that are constructed to remain permanently in the
same location beyond one program year. However, CCC may, at its discretion, reimburse the construction or purchase of permanent displays on a case by case basis, if the Participant sought and received prior written approval from CCC of such construction or purchase;
(8) Rental, lease, or purchase of warehouse space, except for storage space for program-related material;
(9) Coupon redemption or price discounts of the promoted commodity;
(10) Refundable deposits or advances;
(11) Giveaways, awards, prizes, gifts, and other similar promotional materials in excess of the limitation that CCC will determine. Such determination will be announced in writing via a program notice issued on FAS' website;

(13) The purchase, lease (except for use in authorized travel status), or repair of motor vehicles;
(14) Travel of applicants for employment interviews;
(15) Unused non-refundable airline tickets or associated penalty fees, except where travel was restricted by U.S. Government action or advisory;
(16) Independent evaluations or audits, including evaluations or audits of the activities of a subcontractor, if CCC determines that such a review is needed in order to confirm past or to ensure future agreement or regulatory compliance;
(17) Any arrangement that has the effect of reducing the selling price of an agricultural commodity;
(18) Goods, services, and salaries of personnel provided by a third party;
(19) Membership fees in clubs and social organizations;

(26) U.S. office(s) administrative expenses, including communication costs, except as noted in paragraph (c)(21) of this section and except that usage costs for communications devices incurred while on reimbursable international or domestic travel for approved MAP brand or generic promotion activities are reimbursable as eligible travel expenditures as allowed under the U.S. Federal Travel Regulations (41 CFR parts 300 through 304);
(27) Any expenditure on an activity that includes any derogatory reference or comparison to other U.S. agricultural commodities;
(28) Payment of U.S. and foreign employees' or contractors' share of personal taxes, except where a foreign country's laws require the MAP Participant to pay such employees' or contractors' share;
(29) Any expenditure made for an activity prior to CCC's approval of that activity;
(30) Contributions to a contingency reserve or any similar provision made for events the occurrence of which cannot be foretold with certainty as to time, intensity, or with an assurance of their happening;
(31) Credit card fees;
(32) Entertainment,
e.g.,
amusements, diversions, cover charges, personal gifts, or tickets to theatrical or sporting events;
(33) Refreshments, or related equipment, for office staff; and
(34) Expenditures associated with a MAP Participant's creation or review of their fraud prevention program, contracting procedures, or brand program operational procedures.
(e) Paragraphs (e)(1) through (4) of this section shall apply to the approval of Supergrades.
(1) With respect to individuals who are not U.S. citizens and who are hired by MAP Participants either as employees or contractors acting as employees, CCC will not ordinarily reimburse any portion of such individual's compensation that exceeds the compensation prescribed for the most comparable position in the FSN salary plan applicable to the country in which the employee or contractor works. However, a
MAP Participant may seek a higher level of reimbursement for a non-U.S. citizen employee or contractor who will be employed as a country director or regional director by requesting that CCC approve that employee or contractor as a Supergrade.
(2) To request approval of a Supergrade, the MAP Participant shall provide CCC with a detailed description of both the duties and responsibilities of the position and the qualifications and background of the employee or contractor concerned. The Participant shall also justify why the comparable FSN salary level is insufficient.
(3) Where a non-U.S. citizen employee or contractor will be employed as a country director, the MAP Participant may request approval for a “Supergrade I” salary level, equivalent to a single grade increase over the existing top grade of the FSN salary plan. The Supergrade I and its step increases are calculated by increasing each of the steps in the top FSN grade by the percentage difference between the second highest and the highest grade in the FSN salary plan. Where the non-U.S. citizen employee or contractor will be employed as a regional director, with responsibility for activities and/or offices in more than one country, the MAP Participant may request approval for a “Supergrade II” salary level, which is calculated relative to a Supergrade I in the same way the latter is calculated relative to the highest grade in the FSN salary plan.
(4) A U.S. citizen with dual citizenship with another foreign country or countries shall not be considered a non-U.S. citizen.
(f) For a brand promotion activity, CCC will reimburse no more than 50 percent of the total eligible expenditures made on that activity.
(g) CCC will reimburse for expenditures made after the conclusion of a MAP Participant's program year provided:
(1) The activity was approved by CCC prior to the end of the program year;
(2) The activity was completed within 30 calendar days following the end of the program year; and
(3) All expenditures were made for the activity within 6 months following the end of the program year.
(h) A MAP Participant shall not use MAP funds for any activity, or any expenses incurred by the MAP Participant prior to the date specified in the approval letter or after the date the agreement is suspended or terminated, except as otherwise permitted by CCC.
(i) Except as otherwise provided in this subpart, MAP-funded travel shall conform to the U.S. Federal Travel Regulations (41 CFR parts 300 through 304) and 2 CFR part 200, and MAP-funded air travel shall conform to the requirements of the Fly America Act (49 U.S.C. 40118). The MAP Participant shall notify the Attaché/Counselor in the destination country(ies) in writing in advance of any proposed travel. The timing of such notice should be far enough in advance to enable the Attaché/Counselor to schedule appointments, make preparations, or otherwise provide any assistance being requested. Failure to provide advance notification of travel generally will result in disallowance of the expenses related to the travel, unless CCC determines it was impractical to provide such notification.
(j) CCC may determine, at CCC's discretion, whether any cost not expressly listed in this section will be reimbursed.
[85 FR 1732, Jan. 13, 2020, as amended at 86 FR 68884, Dec. 6, 2021]
§ 1485.18
Reimbursement procedures.
(a) Following the implementation of a project for which CCC has agreed to provide funding, a Participant may submit claims for reimbursement of eligible expenses incurred in implementing MAP activities, to the extent that CCC has agreed to pay such expenses. Any changes to approved activities must be approved in writing by CCC before any reimbursable expenses associated with the change can be incurred. A Participant will be reimbursed after CCC reviews the claim and determines that it is complete.
(b) All claims for reimbursement shall be submitted by the MAP Participant's U.S. office to CCC. CCC will make all payments to Participants in U.S. dollars. FAS will initiate payment
within 30 days after receipt of the billing, unless the billing is improper.
(c) Participants will be authorized to submit requests for reimbursement or advance at least monthly when electronic fund transfers (EFTs) are not used, and as frequently as desired when electronic transfers are used, in accordance with the provisions of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (15 U.S.C. 1693-1693r).
(d) CCC will not reimburse claims submitted later than 6 months after the end of a MAP Participant's program year.
(e) If CCC overpays a reimbursement claim, the MAP Participant shall repay CCC within 30 calendar days of such overpayment the amount of the overpayment either by submitting a check payable to CCC or by offsetting its next reimbursement claim. The MAP Participant shall make such payment in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise approved in advance by CCC.
(f) If a MAP Participant receives a reimbursement or offsets an advanced payment which is later disallowed, the MAP Participant shall repay CCC within 30 calendar days of such disallowance the amount disallowed either by submitting a check payable to CCC or by offsetting its next reimbursement claim. The MAP Participant shall make such payment in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise approved in advance by CCC.
(g) MAP funds may be expended by MAP Participants only on legitimate, approved activities as set forth in the agreement and approval letter. If a MAP Participant discovers that MAP funds have not been properly spent, it shall notify CCC and shall within 30 calendar days of its discovery repay CCC the amount owed either by submitting a check payable to CCC or by offsetting its next reimbursement claim. The MAP Participant shall make such payment in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise approved in advance by CCC.
(h) The MAP Participant shall report any actions that may have a bearing on the propriety of any claims for reimbursement in writing to the appropriate Attaché/Counselor and its U.S. office shall report such actions in writing to the appropriate FAS Division Director.
§ 1485.19
Advances.
(a)
Policy.
In general, CCC operates the MAP on a reimbursable basis.
(b)
Exception.
A MAP Participant may request an advance of MAP funds from CCC for generic promotion activities, provided the MAP Participant meets the criteria for advance payments in 2 CFR part 200. CCC will not approve any request for an advance submitted after the end of a MAP Participant's program year. At any given time, total payments advanced shall not exceed 40 percent of a MAP Participant's total approved generic activity budget for the program year. CCC will not advance funds to a MAP Participant for brand promotion activities. When approving a request for an advance, CCC may require the MAP Participant to carry adequate fidelity bond coverage when the absence of such coverage is considered to create an unacceptable risk to the interests of the MAP. Whether an “unacceptable risk” exists in a particular situation will depend on a number of factors, such as, for example, the Participant's history of performance in the MAP, the Participant's perceived financial stability and resources, and any other factors presented in the particular situation that may reflect on the Participant's responsibility or the riskiness of its activities.
(c)
Interest.
A MAP Participant shall deposit and maintain all funds advanced by CCC in an insured account in the United States. The account shall be interest-bearing, unless the exceptions in 2 CFR part 200 apply. Interest earned by the MAP Participant on funds advanced by CCC is not program income. Up to $500 of interest earned per year may be retained by the MAP Participant for administrative expenses. Any additional interest earned on MAP advances shall be remitted annually to the appropriate entity as required in 2 CFR part 200.
(d)
Refunds due CCC.
A MAP Participant shall fully expend all advances on approved generic promotion activities within 90 calendar days after the date of disbursement by CCC. By the end of
the 90 calendar days, the MAP Participant must submit reimbursement claims to offset the advance and submit a check made payable to CCC for any unexpended balance. The MAP Participant shall make such payment in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise approved in advance by CCC.
§ 1485.20
Employment practices.
(a) A MAP Participant shall enter into written contracts with all overseas employees who are paid in whole or in part with MAP funds and shall ensure that all terms, conditions, and related formalities of such contracts conform to governing local law.
(b) A MAP Participant shall, in its overseas offices, conform its office hours, work week, and holidays to local law and to the custom generally observed by U.S. commercial entities in the local business community.
(c) A MAP Participant may pay salaries or fees in any currency (U.S. or foreign) in conformance with contract specifications. Participants should consult local laws regarding currency restrictions.
§ 1485.21
Financial management.
(a) A MAP Participant shall implement and maintain a financial management system that conforms to generally accepted accounting principles and complies with the standards in 2 CFR part 200.
(b) A MAP Participant shall institute internal controls and provide written guidance to commercial entities participating in its activities to ensure their compliance with these regulations.
(c) A MAP Participant shall retain all records concerning a MAP program transaction for a period of five years after completion of the transaction and permit authorized officials of the U.S. Government to have full and complete access, for such five-year period, to such records. These records shall include all documents related to employment of any employees whose salaries are reimbursed in whole or in part with MAP funds, whether such employees are based in the United States or overseas, such as employment applications, contracts, position descriptions, leave records, salary changes, and all records pertaining to contractors.
(d) A MAP Participant shall also maintain adequate documentation related to the proper disposition of all personal property having a useful life of more than one year and an acquisition cost of $500 or more purchased by the Participant and for which the Participant is reimbursed, in whole or in part, with MAP funds.
(e) A MAP Participant shall maintain its records of expenditures, contributions, and cost share in a manner that allows it to provide information by program year, activity plan, country or region (as applicable), activity number, and cost category. Such records shall include copies of:
(1) Receipts for all STRE (actual vendor invoices or restaurant checks, rather than credit card receipts);
(2) Receipts for any other program-related expenditure in excess of a minimum level that CCC shall determine and announce in writing to all MAP Participants via a program notice issued on the FAS website. Receipts for all actual M
IE reimbursements must be maintained, regardless of the amount;
(3) The exchange rate used to calculate the dollar equivalent of expenditures made in a foreign currency and the basis for such calculation;
(4) Reimbursement claims;
(5) An itemized list of claims charged to each of the MAP Participant's MAP accounts;
(6) Documentation, with accompanying English translation, supporting each reimbursement claim, including evidence to support the financial transactions, such as canceled checks, receipted paid bills, contracts, purchase orders, per diem calculations, travel vouchers, and credit memos; and
(7)(i) Each MAP Participant must keep records documenting all claimed contributions and cost share, to include:
(A) Copies of invoices or receipts for expenses paid by the U.S. industry or State agency and not reimbursed by the MAP Participant for the joint activity, or
(B) If invoices are not available, an itemized statement from the U.S. industry or State agency as to what costs
it incurred pursuant to the joint activity, or
(C) If neither of the foregoing is available, a statement from the U.S. industry or State agency as to what goods and services it provided, or
(D) If none of the foregoing are available, a memo to the files of the MAP Participant's estimate of what contribution or cost share was made by the U.S. industry or State agency, item by item, and the method used to assign a value to each.
(ii) The documentation required in paragraph (e)(7)(i) of this section must include the dates, purpose, and location of the activity for which the cash or in-kind items were claimed as a contribution or cost share, who conducted the activity, the participating groups or individuals, and the method of computing the claimed contribution or cost share. MAP Participants must retain and make available for compliance reviews and audits documentation related to claimed contribution or cost share.
(f) Upon request, a MAP Participant shall provide documents supporting reimbursement claims to CCC. CCC may deny a claim for reimbursement if the claim is not supported by adequate documentation.
§ 1485.22
Reports.
(a) Participants are required to submit regular financial and performance reports in accordance with their agreement. Reporting requirements and formats for the required financial and performance reports will be specified in the agreement between CCC and the Participant.
(b)(1) In addition to the information required in 2 CFR 200.329(c)(2), a Participant's performance reports must include pertinent information regarding the Participant's progress, measured against established indicators, baselines, and targets, towards achieving the expected results specified in the agreement. This reporting must include, for each performance indicator, a comparison of actual accomplishments with the baseline and the targets established for the period. When actual accomplishments deviate significantly from targeted goals, the Participant must provide an explanation in the report.
(2) A Participant must ensure the accuracy and reliability of the performance data submitted to FAS in performance reports. At any time during the period of performance of the agreement, FAS may review the Participant's performance data to determine whether it is accurate and reliable. The Participant must comply with all requests made by FAS or an entity designated by FAS in relation to such reviews.
(c) All final performance reports will be made available to the public.
(d) Not later than 45 calendar days after the completion of travel (other than local travel), a MAP Participant shall submit a trip report. The report must be submitted to the appropriate Attaché/Counselor(s) and must include the name(s) of the traveler(s), purpose of travel, itinerary, names and affiliations of contacts, and a brief summary of findings, conclusions, recommendations, and specific accomplishments.
(e) Not later than 90 calendar days after the end of its program year, a MAP Participant shall submit a report on any research conducted pursuant to the approved MAP program.
(f) If requested by FAS, a Participant must provide to FAS additional information or reports relating to the agreement.
(g) If a Participant requires an extension of a reporting deadline, it must ensure that FAS receives an extension request at least five business days prior to the reporting deadline. FAS may decline to consider a request for an extension that it receives after this time period. FAS will consider requests for reporting deadline extensions on a case by case basis and will make a decision based on the merits of each request. FAS will consider factors such as unforeseen or extenuating circumstances and past performance history when evaluating requests for extensions.
[85 FR 1732, Jan. 13, 2020, as amended at 86 FR 68884, Dec. 6, 2021]
§ 1485.23
Evaluation.
(a)(1) The Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) of 1993 (5 U.S.C. 306; 31 U.S.C. 1105, 1115-1119, 3515,
9703-9704) requires performance measurement of Federal programs, including the MAP. Evaluation of the MAP's effectiveness will depend on a clear statement by Participants of the constraints and opportunities facing U.S. exports, goals to be met within a specified time, schedule of measurable milestones for gauging success, plan for achievement, and assessment of results of activities at regular intervals. The overall goal of the MAP and of individual Participants' programming is to achieve or maintain sales that would not have occurred in the absence of MAP funding. A MAP Participant that can demonstrate such sales, taking into account extenuating factors beyond the Participant's control, will have met the overall objective of the GPRA and the need for evaluation.
(2) Evaluation is an integral element of program planning and implementation, providing the basis for the strategic plan. The evaluation results guide the development and scope of a MAP Participant's program, contribute to program accountability, and provide evidence of program effectiveness.
(b) When required by CCC, a MAP Participant shall complete a program evaluation. A program evaluation is a review of the MAP Participant's entire program, or an appropriate portion of the program as agreed to by the MAP Participant and CCC, to determine the effectiveness of the MAP Participant's strategy in meeting specified goals.The actual scope and timing of the program evaluation shall be determined by the MAP Participant and CCC and specified in the approval letter. A MAP Participant may contract with an independent evaluator to satisfy this requirement, although CCC reserves the right to have direct input and control over the design, scope, and methodology of any such evaluation, including direct contact with and provision of guidance to the independent evaluator. A MAP Participant shall submit, via a cover letter to CCC, an executive summary that assesses the program evaluation's findings and recommendations and proposed changes in program strategy or design as a result of the evaluation. In addition to the requirements set forth in 2 CFR part 200, a program evaluation shall contain:
(1) The name of the party conducting the evaluation;
(2) The scope of the evaluation;
(3) A concise statement of the market constraint(s)/opportunity(ies) and the goals specified in the approved strategic plan;
(4) A description of the evaluation methodology;
(5) A description of additional export sales achieved, including the ratio of additional export sales in relation to the MAP Participant's program funding received;
(6) A summary of the findings, including an analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the program(s); and
(7) Recommendations for future programs.
(c) MAP Participants conducting a branded program must also complete a brand promotion evaluation. A brand promotion evaluation is a review of the U.S. and foreign commercial entities' export sales to determine whether the activity achieved the goals specified in the approved MAP program. This evaluation shall be completed and submitted to CCC no later than 6 months following the end of the Participant's program year.
(d) On an annual basis, or more often when appropriate or required by CCC, a MAP Participant shall complete and submit program success stories. CCC will announce to all MAP Participants the detailed requirements for completing and submitting program success stories.
[85 FR 1732, Jan. 13, 2020, as amended at 86 FR 68884, Dec. 6, 2021]
§ 1485.24
Compliance reviews and notices.
(a) USDA staff may conduct compliance reviews of the Participant's activities under this program to ensure compliance with this subpart, applicable Federal laws and regulations, and the terms of the agreements and approval letters. Participants shall cooperate fully with relevant USDA staff conducting compliance reviews and shall comply with all requests from USDA staff to facilitate the conduct of such reviews. Program funds spent inappropriately or on unapproved activities must be returned to CCC.
(b) Any project or activity funded under the program is subject to review or audit at any time during the course of implementation or after the completion of the project.
(c) Upon conclusion of the compliance review, USDA staff will provide a written compliance report to the Participant. The compliance report will detail any instances where it appears that the Participant is not complying with any of the terms or conditions of the agreement, approval letter, or the applicable laws and regulations. The report will also specify if it appears that CCC may be entitled to recover funds from the Participant and will explain the basis for any recovery of funds from the Participant. If, as a result of a compliance review, CCC determines that further review is needed in order to ensure compliance with the requirements of the program, CCC may require the Participant to contract for an independent audit.
(d) In addition, CCC may notify a Participant in writing at any time if CCC determines that CCC may be entitled to recover funds from the Participant. CCC will explain the basis for any recovery of funds from the Participant in the written notice. The Participant shall, within 30 calendar days of the date of the notice, repay CCC the amount owed either by submitting a check payable to CCC or by offsetting its next reimbursement claim. The Participant shall make such payment in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise approved in advance by CCC. If, however, a Participant notifies CCC within 30 calendar days of the date of the written notice that the Participant intends to file an appeal pursuant to the provisions of this subpart, the amount owed to CCC by the Participant is not due until the appeal procedures are concluded and CCC has made a final determination as to the amount owed.
(e) The fact that a compliance review has been conducted by USDA staff does not signify that a Participant is in full compliance with its agreement, approval letter, and/or applicable laws and regulations.
(f) For a Participant response to compliance report:
(1) A Participant shall, within 60 calendar days of the date of the issuance of a compliance report, submit a written response to CCC. The response may include additional documentation for consideration or a request for reconsideration of any finding along with supporting justification. If the Participant does not wish to contest the compliance report, the response shall include any money owed to CCC, which may be returned by submitting a check payable to CCC or by offsetting a reimbursement claim. The Participant shall make any payments in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise approved in advance by CCC. CCC, at its discretion, may extend the period for response.
(2) After reviewing the response, CCC shall determine whether the Participant owes any funds to CCC and will inform the Participant in writing of the basis for the determination. CCC may initiate action to collect such amount by providing the Participant a written demand for payment of the debt pursuant to debt settlement policies and procedures, 7 CFR part 1403.
(g) For Participant appeals of CCC determinations:
(1) Within 30 calendar days of the date of the issuance of a determination, the Participant may appeal the determination by making a request in writing that includes the basis for such reconsideration. The Participant may also request a hearing.
(2) If the Participant requests a hearing, CCC will set a date and time for the hearing. The hearing will be an informal proceeding. A transcript will not ordinarily be prepared unless the Participant bears the cost of a transcript; however, CCC may, at its discretion, have a transcript prepared at CCC's expense.
(3) CCC will base its final determination upon information contained in the administrative record. The Participant must exhaust all administrative remedies contained in this section before pursuing judicial review of a determination by CCC.
§ 1485.25
Failure to make required contribution or cost share.
A MAP Participant's required contribution or cost share will be specified in the approval letter. If the MAP Participant's required contribution or cost share is specified as a dollar amount
and the MAP Participant does not make the required contribution or cost share, the MAP Participant shall pay to CCC in dollars the difference between the amount actually contributed and the amount specified in the approval letter. If the MAP Participant's required contribution or cost share is specified as a percentage of the total amount reimbursed by CCC, the MAP Participant may either return to CCC the necessary amount of funds reimbursed by CCC to increase its actual contribution or cost share percentage to the required level or pay to CCC in dollars the difference between the amount actually contributed and the amount of funds necessary to increase its actual contribution or cost share percentage to the required level. A MAP Participant shall remit such payment within six months after the end of its program year. The MAP Participant shall make such payment in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise approved in advance by CCC.
§ 1485.26
Submissions.
For all permissible methods of delivery, submissions required by this subpart shall be deemed submitted as of the date received by CCC.
§ 1485.27
Disclosure of program information.
(a) Documents submitted to CCC by MAP Participants are subject to the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552, 7 CFR part 1, subpart A, and specifically 7 CFR 1.12.
(b) Upon request, a Participant shall provide to any person a copy of any document in its possession or control containing market information developed and produced under the terms of its agreement. The Participant may charge a fee not to exceed the costs for assembling, duplicating, and distributing the materials.
(c) Any research conducted by a MAP Participant pursuant to an agreement and/or approval letter shall be subject to the provisions relating to intangible property in 2 CFR part 200.
§ 1485.28
Ethical conduct.
(a) A MAP Participant shall conduct its business in accordance with the laws and regulations of the country(s) in which an activity is carried out and in accordance with applicable U.S. Federal, state, and local laws and regulations. A MAP Participant shall conduct its business in the United States in accordance with applicable Federal, state, and local laws and regulations.
(b) Except for a U.S. agricultural cooperative or a U.S. for-profit entity, neither a MAP Participant nor its affiliates shall make export sales of eligible commodities covered under the terms of the applicable MAP agreement. Nor shall such entities charge a fee for facilitating an export sale. A MAP Participant may, however, collect check-off funds and membership fees that are required for membership in the MAP Participant's organization.
(c) A MAP Participant shall not limit participation in its MAP activities to members of its organization. Participants shall ensure that their MAP-funded programs and activities are open to all otherwise qualified individuals and entities on an equal basis and without regard to any non-merit factors. The MAP Participant shall publicize its program and make participation possible for commercial entities throughout the relevant commodity sector or, in the case of SRTGs, throughout the corresponding region. This includes providing to such commercial entities, upon request, a copy of any document in its possession or control containing market information developed and produced under the terms of its MAP agreement. The Participant may charge a fee not to exceed the costs for assembling, duplicating, and distributing the materials. This paragraph does not apply to U.S. agricultural cooperatives when implementing their own brand program.
(d) A MAP Participant shall select U.S. agricultural industry representatives to participate in generic MAP activities such as trade teams, sales teams, and trade fairs based on criteria that ensure participation on an equitable basis by a broad cross section of the U.S. industry. If requested by CCC, a MAP Participant shall submit such selection criteria to CCC for approval.
(e) All MAP Participants should endeavor to ensure fair and accurate fact-
based advertising. Deceptive or misleading promotions may result in cancellation or termination of a MAP Participant's agreement and the recovery of CCC funds related to such promotions from the Participant.
(f) The MAP Participant must report any actions or circumstances that may have a bearing on the propriety of its MAP program to the appropriate Attaché/Counselor, and its U.S. office shall report such actions or circumstances in writing to CCC.
§ 1485.29
Subawarding procedures.
(a) MAP Participants have full and sole responsibility for the legal sufficiency of all contracts and assume financial liability for any costs or claims resulting from suits, challenges, or other disputes based on contracts entered into by the MAP Participant. Neither CCC nor any other agency of the U.S. Government nor any official or employee of CCC, FAS, USDA, or the U.S. Government has any obligation or responsibility with respect to MAP Participant contracts with third parties.
(b) A MAP Participant shall comply with the procurement standards set forth below and in 2 CFR part 200 when procuring goods and services and when engaging in construction to implement agreements.
(c) Each MAP Participant shall establish open, fair, and competitive contracting procedures for contracts that are funded, in whole or in part, with MAP funds.
(d) Each MAP Participant shall submit to CCC, for CCC approval, written contracting guidelines for contracts that are funded, in whole or in part, with MAP funds. CCC will notify all new and existing MAP Participants in writing in each Participant's approval letter and through the FAS website as to applicable submission dates for and dates for approvals of contracting guidelines. CCC's approval of such contracting guidelines will remain in place until CCC retracts its approval in writing, or until new guidelines are approved that supersede them. Once approved by CCC, these contracting guidelines shall govern all of a Participant's MAP-funded contracting involving contracts with an annual minimum value that CCC shall determine and announce in writing to all MAP Participants via a program notice issued on the FAS website. The guidelines shall indicate the method for evaluating proposals received for all contract competitions, the method for monitoring and evaluating performance under contracts, and the method for initiating corrective action for unsatisfactory performance under contracts. The MAP Participant may modify and resubmit these guidelines for re-approval at any time. In addition to the requirements in 2 CFR part 200, these guidelines shall include, at a minimum, the following:
(1) Procedures for developing and publicizing requests for proposals, invitations for bids, and similar documents that solicit third party offers to provide goods or services. Solicitations for professional and technical services shall be based on clear and accurate descriptions of and requirements related to the services to be procured. Such procedures must include a conflict of interest provision that states that no employee, officer, board member, or agent thereof of the MAP Participant will participate in the review, selection, award, or administration of a contract if a real or apparent conflict of interest would arise. Such a conflict would arise when an employee, official, board member, agent, or the employee's, officer's, board member's, or agent's family, partners, or an organization that employs or is about to employ any of these parties or their affiliates has a financial or other interest in the contract. Procedures shall provide that officers, employees, board members, and agents thereof shall neither solicit nor accept gratuities, favors, or anything of monetary value from contractors or subcontractors. Procedures shall also provide for disciplinary actions to be applied for violations of such standards by officers, employees, board members, or agents thereof;
(2) Procedures for reviewing proposals, bids, or other offers to provide goods and services. Separate procedures shall be developed for various situations, including, but not limited to: solicitations for highly technical services; solicitations for services that are not common in a specific market; sole
source contracts; solicitations that yield receipt of three or more bids; or solicitations that yield receipt of fewer than three bids;
(3) Requirements to conduct all contracting in an openly competitive manner. Individuals who develop or draft specifications, requirements, statements of work, invitations for bids, and/or requests for proposals for procurement of any goods or services, and such individuals' families or partners, or an organization that employs or is about to employ any of the aforementioned, shall be excluded from competition for such procurement. MAP Participants' written contracting guidelines may detail special situations where the prohibitions in this subparagraph do not apply, such as in situations involving highly specialized technical services or situations where the services are not commonly offered in a specific market;
(4) Requirements to perform and document in the procurement files some form of price or cost analysis, such as a comparison of price quotations to market prices or other price indicia, to determine the reasonableness of the offered prices in connection with every procurement action that is governed by the contracting guidelines;
(5) Requirements to conduct an appropriate form of competition every 3 years on all multi-year contracts that are governed by the contracting guidelines. However, contracts for market representation are not required to be re-competed after the initial reward. Instead, the performance of market representation must be evaluated and documented by the MAP Participant annually to ensure that the terms of the contract are being met in a satisfactory manner; and
(6) Requirements for written contracts with each provider of goods, services, or construction work. Such contracts shall require such providers to maintain adequate records to account for funds provided to them by the MAP Participant.
(e) A MAP Participant may undertake MAP promotional activities directly or through a domestic or foreign subrecipient. However, the MAP Participant shall remain responsible and accountable to CCC for all MAP promotional activities and related expenditures undertaken by such subrecipient and shall be responsible for reimbursing CCC for any funds that CCC determines should be refunded to CCC in relation to such subrecipient's promotional activities and expenditures.
[85 FR 1732, Jan. 13, 2020, as amended at 86 FR 68884, Dec. 6, 2021]
§ 1485.30
Property standards.
(a) A Participant shall maintain an inventory of all personal property having a useful life of more than one year and an acquisition cost of $500 or more that was acquired in furtherance of program activities. The inventory shall list and number each item and include the date of purchase or acquisition, cost of purchase, replacement value, serial number, make, model, and electrical requirements, as applicable.
(b) The Participant shall insure all real property and equipment that was acquired, in whole or in part, with MAP funds at a level minimally equal to the equivalent insurance coverage for property owned by the Participant. The Participant shall safeguard such property and equipment against theft, damage, and unauthorized use. The Participant shall promptly report any loss, theft, or damage of such property and equipment to the insurance company.
(c) Personal property having a useful life of more than one year and an acquisition cost of $500 or more purchased by the Participant, and for which the Participant is reimbursed, in whole or in part, with MAP funds, that is unusable, unserviceable, or no longer needed for project purposes shall be disposed of in one of the following ways. The Participant may:
(1) Exchange or sell the property, provided that it applies any exchange allowance, insurance proceeds, or sales proceeds toward the purchase of other property needed in the project;
(2) With CCC approval, transfer the property to other Participants for their activities, or to a foreign entity; or
(3) Upon Attaché/Counselor approval, donate the property to a local charity, or convey the property to the Attaché/Counselor, along with an itemized inventory list and any documents of title.
(d) The Participant is responsible for reimbursing CCC for the value of any uninsured property at the time of the loss or theft of the property.
§ 1485.31
Anti-fraud requirements.
(a)
All MAP Participants.
(1) All MAP Participants annually shall submit to CCC for approval a detailed fraud prevention program. CCC will notify all new and existing MAP Participants in writing in each Participant's approval letter and through the FAS website as to applicable submission dates for and dates for approvals of fraud prevention programs. MAP Participants should review their fraud prevention programs annually. The fraud prevention program shall, at a minimum, include an annual review of physical controls and weaknesses, a standard process for investigating and remediation of suspected fraud cases, and training in risk management and fraud detection for all current and future employees. The MAP Participant shall not conduct or permit any MAP promotion activities to occur unless and until CCC has communicated in writing approval of the MAP Participant's fraud prevention program.
(2) The MAP Participant, within five business days of receiving an allegation or information giving rise to a reasonable suspicion of misrepresentation or fraud that could give rise to a claim by CCC, shall report such allegation or information in writing to such USDA personnel as specified in the Participant's agreement and/or approval letter. The MAP Participant shall cooperate fully in any USDA investigation of such allegation or occurrence of misrepresentation or fraud and shall comply with any directives given by CCC or USDA to the MAP Participant for the prompt investigation of such allegation or occurrence.
(b)
MAP Participants with brand programs.
(1) The MAP Participant may charge a fee to brand participants to cover the cost of the fraud prevention program.
(2) The MAP Participant shall repay to CCC funds paid to a brand participant through the MAP Participant on claims that the MAP Participant or CCC subsequently determines are unauthorized or otherwise non-reimbursable expenses within 30 calendar days of the MAP Participant's determination or CCC's disallowance. The MAP Participant shall repay CCC by submitting a check to CCC or by offsetting the MAP Participant's next reimbursement claim. The MAP Participant shall make such payment in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise approved in advance by CCC. A MAP Participant operating a brand program in strict accordance with an approved fraud prevention program, however, will not be liable to reimburse CCC for MAP funds paid on such claims if the claims were based on misrepresentations or fraud of the brand participant, its employees, or agents, unless CCC determines that the MAP Participant was grossly negligent in the operation of the brand program regarding such claims. CCC shall communicate any such determination to the MAP Participant in writing.
§ 1485.32
Program income.
Program income is gross income earned by the non-Federal entity that is directly generated by a supported activity or earned as a result of the Federal award during the period of performance. Any income generated from an activity, the expenditures for which have been wholly or partially reimbursed with MAP funds, shall be used by the MAP Participant in furtherance of its approved MAP activities in the program year during which the MAP funds are available for obligation by the MAP Participant, or must be returned to CCC. The use of such income shall be governed by this subpart. Interest earned on funds advanced by CCC is not program income. Reasonable activity fees or registration fees, if identified as such in a project budget, may be charged for approved activities. The intent to charge a fee must be part of the original proposal, along with an explanation of how such fees are to be used. Any activity fees charged must be used to offset activity expenses or returned to FAS. Such fees may not be used as profit or counted as contribution or cost share.
§ 1485.33
Amendments.
An agreement may be amended in writing with the consent of CCC and the MAP Participant. All requests for
program amendments must be submitted to CCC in writing and contain a justification for why the amendment is necessary. All amendment requests must be reviewed and approved by CCC before an amendment can be issued.
§ 1485.34
Subrecipients.
(a) A Participant may utilize the services of a subrecipient to implement activities under the agreement if this is provided for in the agreement. The subrecipient may receive CCC-provided funds, program income, or other resources from the Participant for this purpose. The Participant must enter in to a written subaward with the subrecipient and comply with the applicable provisions of 2 CFR 200.332 and/or the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), if applicable. If required by the agreement, the Participant must provide a copy of such subaward to FAS, in the manner set forth in the agreement, prior to the transfer of CCC-provided funds or program income to the subrecipient.
(b) A Participant must include the following requirements in a subaward:
(1) The subrecipient is required to comply with the applicable provisions of this part and 2 CFR parts 200 and 400 and/or the FAR, if applicable. The applicable provisions are those that relate specifically to subrecipients, as well as those relating to non-Federal entities that impose requirements that would be reasonable to pass through to a subrecipient because they directly concern the implementation by the subrecipient of one or more activities under the agreement. If there is a question about whether a particular provision is applicable, FAS will make the determination.
(2) The subrecipient must pay to the Participant the value of CCC-provided funds, interest, or program income that are not used in accordance with the subaward, or that are lost, damaged, or misused as a result of the subrecipient's failure to exercise reasonable care.
(3) In accordance with 2 CFR 200.501(h), subawards must include a description of the applicable compliance requirements and the subrecipient's compliance responsibility. Methods to ensure compliance may include pre-award audits, monitoring during the agreement, and post-award audits.
(c) A Participant must monitor the actions of a subrecipient as necessary to ensure that CCC-provided funds and program income provided to the subrecipient are used for authorized purposes in compliance with applicable U.S. Federal laws and regulations and the subaward and that performance indicator targets are achieved for both activities and results under the agreement.
[85 FR 1732, Jan. 13, 2020, as amended at 86 FR 68884, Dec. 6, 2021]
§ 1485.35
Audit requirements.
(a) Subpart F of 2 CFR part 200 applies to all Participants and subrecipients under this part other than those that are for-profit entities, foreign public entities, or foreign organizations.
(b) A Participant or subrecipient that is a for-profit entity or a subrecipient that is a foreign organization and that expends, during its fiscal year, a total of at least the audit requirement threshold in 2 CFR 200.501 in Federal awards, is required to obtain an audit. Such a Participant or subrecipient has the following two options to satisfy this requirement:
(1)(i) A financial audit of the agreement or subaward, in accordance with the Government Auditing Standards issued by the United States Government Accountability Office (GAO), if the Participant or subrecipient expends Federal awards under only one FAS program during such fiscal year; or
(ii) A financial audit of all Federal awards from FAS, in accordance with GAO's Government Auditing Standards, if the Participant or subrecipient expends Federal awards under multiple FAS programs during such fiscal year; or
(2) An audit that meets the requirements contained in subpart F of 2 CFR part 200.
(c) A Participant or subrecipient that is a for-profit entity or a subrecipient that is a foreign organization and that expends, during its fiscal year, a total that is less than the audit requirement threshold in 2 CFR 200.501 in Federal awards, is exempt from requirements under this section for an audit for that year, except as provided in paragraphs
(d) and (f) of this section, but it must make records available for review by appropriate officials of Federal agencies.
(d) FAS may require an annual financial audit of an agreement or subaward when the audit requirement threshold in 2 CFR 200.501 is not met. In that case, FAS must provide funds under the agreement for this purpose, and the Participant or subrecipient, as applicable, must arrange for such audit and submit it to FAS.
(e) When a Participant or subrecipient that is a for-profit entity or a subrecipiet that is a foreign organization is required to obtain a financial audit under this section, it must provide a copy of the audit to FAS within 60 days after the end of its fiscal year.
(f) FAS, the USDA Office of Inspector General, or GAO may conduct or arrange for additional audits of any Participants or subrecipients, including for-profit entities and foreign organizations. Participants and subrecipients must promptly comply with all requests related to such audits. If FAS conducts or arranges for an additional audit, such as an audit with respect to a particular agreement, FAS will fund the full cost of such an audit, in accordance with 2 CFR 200.503(d).
§ 1485.36
Suspension and termination of agreements.
(a) An agreement or subaward may be suspended or terminated in accordance with 2 CFR 200.339 or 200.340. FAS may suspend or terminate an agreement if it determines that:
(1) One of the bases in 2 CFR 200.339 or 200.340 for termination or suspension by FAS has been satisfied; or
(2) The continuation of the assistance provided under the agreement is no longer necessary or desirable.
(b) If an agreement is terminated, the Participant:
(1) Is responsible for using or returning any CCC-provided funds, interest, or program income that have not been disbursed, as agreed to by FAS; and
(2) Must comply with any closeout and post-closeout procedures specified in the agreement and 2 CFR 200.344 and 200.345.
[85 FR 1732, Jan. 13, 2020, as amended at 86 FR 68884, Dec. 6, 2021]
§ 1485.37
Noncompliance with an agreement.
(a) If a MAP Participant fails to comply with any term in its agreement or approval letter, CCC may take one or more of the enforcement actions in 2 CFR part 200 and, if appropriate, initiate a claim against the MAP Participant, following the procedures set forth in this subpart. CCC may also initiate a claim against a MAP Participant if program income or CCC-provided funds are lost due to an action or omission of the MAP Participant. If any MAP Participant has engaged in fraud with respect to the MAP, or has otherwise violated program requirements under this subpart, CCC may:
(1) Hold such MAP Participant liable for any and all losses to CCC resulting from such fraud or violation;
(2) Require a refund of any assistance provided to such MAP Participant plus interest as determined by FAS; and
(3) Collect liquidated damages from such MAP Participant in an amount determined appropriate by FAS.
(b) The provisions of this section shall be without prejudice to any other remedy that is available under any other provision of law.
§ 1485.38
Paperwork reduction requirements.
The paperwork and recordkeeping requirements imposed by this subpart have been approved by OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. OMB has assigned control number 0551-0026 for this information collection.

§ 1486.100
General purpose and scope.
(a) The E (Kika) de la Garza Emerging Markets Program (EMP) is established to develop, maintain, or expand markets for exports of United States agricultural commodities and to promote cooperation and exchange of information between agricultural institutions and agribusinesses in the United States and emerging markets. While the program is primarily intended to support the export market development efforts of the private sector, the program's resources may also be used to assist public agricultural organizations.
(b) This part sets forth the general terms, conditions, and policies governing the Commodity Credit Corporation's (CCC) operation of the EMP.
(c)(1) The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued guidance on Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards in 2 CFR part 200. In 2 CFR 400.1, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) adopted OMB's guidance in subparts A through F of 2 CFR part 200, as supplemented by 2 CFR part 400, as USDA policies and procedures for uniform administrative requirements, cost principles, and audit requirements for Federal awards.
(2) The OMB guidance at 2 CFR part 200, as supplemented by 2 CFR part 400 and this part, applies to the EMP.
(3) In addition to the provisions of this part, other regulations that are generally applicable to grants and cooperative agreements of USDA, including the applicable regulations set forth in 2 CFR chapters I, II, IV, also apply to the EMP, to the extent that these regulations do not directly conflict with the provisions of this part. The provisions of the CCC Charter Act (15 U.S.C. 714
et seq.
) and any other statutory or regulatory provisions that are generally applicable to CCC also apply to the EMP.
(d) Under the EMP, CCC provides grants to eligible U.S. private or government entities who demonstrate a role or interest in the export of U.S. agricultural commodities to conduct assessments of food and rural business system needs of emerging markets, make recommendations on measures necessary to enhance the effectiveness of such systems, including potential reductions in trade barriers, and identify and carry out specific opportunities and projects to enhance the effectiveness of such systems. The EMP may only be used to support exports of U.S. agricultural commodities through generic activities.
(e) Only initiatives that support the export of U.S. agricultural commodities are eligible for assistance under the program. The program's resources may not be used to support the export of another country's products to the United States or another country, or to promote the development of a foreign economy as a primary objective.
(f) The EMP generally operates on a reimbursement basis. The program is administered by the Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) acting on behalf of CCC.
(g) EMP recipients are responsible for complying with all applicable laws and regulations.
§ 1486.101
Definitions.
For purposes of this part, the following definitions apply:
Activities
means components of a project that carries out one or more statutorily-authorized activities,
e.g.,
activities that assess the food and rural business system needs of emerging markets; promote information exchange with such markets; and/or carry out recommendations, projects, and opportunities in emerging markets to enhance the effectiveness of such systems.
Agreement
means a legally binding grant entered into between CCC and an EMP applicant setting forth the terms and conditions of approved activities under the EMP, including any subsequent amendments to such agreement.
Approval letter
means a document by which CCC informs an applicant that its EMP proposal has been approved for funding. This letter may also approve specific activities and contain terms and conditions in addition to the agreement.
Attaché/Counselor
means the FAS employee representing United States Department of Agriculture interests in a foreign country.
Cost share
means the portion of project costs not paid by Federal funds (unless otherwise authorized by Federal statute). In terms of the EMP program, cost share is the funds provided by the Recipient, the U.S. industry, or a State agency in support of an approved activity.
Emerging market
means generally any country, foreign territory, customs union, or other economic market that CCC determines is taking steps toward a market-oriented economy through its food, agriculture, or rural business sectors of the economy and has the potential to provide a viable and significant market for U.S. agricultural commodities. CCC has determined that any country that is not designated as a high-income country by the World Bank is an eligible emerging market under this program. The World Bank periodically redefines the income limits for its country classification. Consequently, the list of “emerging market” countries may change over time. CCC will provide guidance on country eligibility in each program announcement.
Generic activities
mean an activity that does not involve or promote the exclusive or predominant use of an individual company name, logo, or brand name, or the brand of a U.S. agricultural cooperative, but rather promotes a U.S. agricultural commodity generally.
Project
means an approach or undertaking made up of one or more activities that, taken together, carries out one or more statutorily-authorized activities under the EMP (
e.g.,
activities that assess the food and rural business system needs of emerging markets and develop recommendations on measures necessary to enhance the effectiveness of such systems; promote information exchange with such markets; or identify and carry out specific recommendations, opportunities, or projects to enhance the effectiveness of such systems).
Project funds
means the funds made available to a Recipient by CCC under an agreement and authorized for expenditure in accordance with this part.
Proposal
means an application for funding.
Recipient
means a U.S. entity receiving financial assistance from CCC to carry out a project under the EMP.
SRTG
is the acronym for State Regional Trade Group. An STRG is a non-profit association of state-funded agricultural promotion agencies.
STRE
is the acronym for sales and trade relations expenditures. Expenditures made on breakfast, lunch, dinner, receptions, and refreshments at approved activities; miscellaneous courtesies such as checkroom fees, taxi fares and tips for approved activities; and decorations for a special promotional occasion that is part of an approved activity.
Unified Export Strategy (UES) system
means an online internet system maintained by FAS through which applicants may apply to the EMP and other FAS market development programs. The system is currently accessible at
https://apps.fas.usda.gov/ues/webapp/.
FAS may prescribe a different system
through which applicants may apply to EMP and will announce such system in the applicable Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO).
U.S. agricultural commodity
means any agricultural commodity of U.S. origin, including food, feed, fiber, forestry product, livestock, insects, and fish harvested from a U.S. aquaculture farm or harvested by a vessel (as defined in Title 46 of the United States Code) in waters that are not waters (including the territorial sea) of a foreign country, and any product thereof.
§ 1486.102
Regional projects.
Projects that focus on regions, such as the Caribbean Basin, rather than individual countries are eligible for consideration provided such projects target qualifying emerging markets in the specified region. CCC may also consider activities that target qualified emerging markets in a specific region but are conducted in a non-emerging market because of its importance as a central location and ease of access to that region.

# Subpart B—Eligibility, Applications, and Funding
§ 1486.200
Participation eligibility.
(a) To participate in the EMP, U.S. private or government entities must demonstrate a role or interest in the exports of U.S. agricultural commodities. Government organizations consist of Federal, state, and local agencies. Private entities include non-profit trade associations, universities, agricultural cooperatives, SRTGs, consulting businesses, research institutions, and profit-making entities. Foreign organizations, whether government or private, may participate as subrecipients in activities carried out by U.S. entities, but are not eligible for direct funding assistance from the program.
(b) Proposals from research and consulting entities will be considered for funding assistance only with evidence of substantial participation in and financial support to the proposed project by U.S. industry. Such support is most credibly demonstrated through actual monetary contributions to the cost of the project.
(c) For-profit entities shall not use program funds to conduct private business, promote private self-interests, or promote their own products or services beyond specific uses approved in a given project. For-profit entities shall not use program funds to supplement the costs of normal day-to-day operations.
§ 1486.201
Eligible commodities.
Any agricultural commodity or product thereof, excluding tobacco, that is comprised of at least 50 percent by weight, exclusive of added water, of agricultural commodities grown or raised in the United States is eligible for funding. Projects that seek support for multiple commodities are also eligible.
§ 1486.202
Application process.
(a)
Announcement of accepting EMP applicants.
CCC will periodically announce that it is accepting applications for participation in the EMP. All relevant information, including application deadlines and proposal content, will be noted in the announcement, and proposals must be submitted in accordance with the terms and requirements specified in the announcement and in this part. Currently, applicants are encouraged to submit applications through the UES system but are not required to do so. CCC may request any additional information it deems necessary from any applicant in order to properly evaluate any proposal.
(b)
Universal identifier and System for Award Management (SAM).
In accordance with 2 CFR part 25, each entity that applies to the EMP and does not qualify for an exemption under 2 CFR 25.110 must:
(1) Be registered in the SAM prior to submitting an application or plan;
(2) Maintain an active SAM registration with current information at all times during which it has an active Federal award or an application or plan under consideration by CCC; and
(3) Provide its DUNS number, or a unique identifier designated as a DUNS replacement, in each application or plan it submits to CCC.
(c)
Reporting subaward and executive compensation information.
In accordance with 2 CFR part 170, each entity that
applies to the EMP and does not qualify for an exception under 2 CFR 170.110(b) must ensure it has the necessary processes and systems in place to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of 2 CFR part 170 should it receive EMP funding.
§ 1486.203
Application review and formation of agreements.
(a)
General.
Proposals received in accordance with the announcement and this part will undergo a multi-phase review by CCC to determine eligibility for the program, the qualifications, quality, and appropriateness of proposed projects, and the reasonableness of proposed project budgets.
(b)
Evaluation criteria.
CCC will review all proposals for eligibility and completeness. CCC will evaluate and score each proposal against the factors described in the NOFO. All proposals that meet the eligibility and completeness criteria described in the NOFO and receive a passing score will be recommended for funding to the FAS Administrator. The purpose of this review is to identify meritorious proposals, recommend an appropriate funding level for each proposal, and submit the proposals and funding recommendations to appropriate officials for decision. CCC may, when appropriate to the subject matter of the proposal, request the assistance of other U.S. Government experts in evaluating the merits of a proposal. Demonstration of substantial U.S. industry participation in or financial or other support of a proposal will be a positive factor in the consideration of proposals. The degree of commitment to a proposed project, represented by the amount and type of cost share, is used in determining which proposals will be approved. Proposals in which the private sector is willing to commit funds, rather than in-kind items such as staff resources, and those with higher amounts of cost share will be given priority consideration. All reviewers will be required to sign a conflict of interest form, and when conflicts of interests are identified the reviewer will be recused from the objective review process.
(c)
Approval decision.
CCC will approve those applications that it determines best satisfy the criteria and factors specified in the announcement and this part. All decisions regarding the disposition of an application are final.
§ 1486.204
Funding limits.
(a) The EMP is a relatively small program intended to develop, maintain, or expand access to qualified emerging markets. Its funds are intended for focused projects with specific activities, rather than expansive concept papers that contain only broad ideas. Large, overly expensive projects (
i.e.,
in excess of $500,000) will not be funded.
(b) CCC will not reimburse 100 percent of the cost of any project undertaken by the private sector. The program is intended to provide appropriate assistance to projects that have significant financial contributions from other sources, especially U.S. private industry.
(c) Proposals for projects exceeding one year in duration may be considered, but proposals for projects that last longer than five years will not be considered. If approved, funding for multi-year projects may be provided one year at a time, with commitments beyond the first-year subject to interim evaluations intended to assess the progress of the project toward meeting its intended objectives.
(d) Funding for continuing and substantially similar projects is generally limited to three calendar years, although FAS will entertain requests to extend an agreement's expiration date up to a maximum of five calendar years. After that time, the project is assumed to have proven its viability and, if necessary, should be continued by the Recipient with its own or with alternative sources of funding. Recipients must submit in writing a valid justification for why an extension is necessary no later than 60 days before the end of the period of performance. If warranted, extensions generally will be granted in one-year increments. Recipients must wait for written approval from FAS before proceeding with the project.

# Subpart C—Program Operations
§ 1486.300
Applicant notification.
(a) CCC will notify each applicant in writing of the final decision on its application. CCC will send an agreement and an approval letter to each approved applicant. An applicant that accepts the terms and conditions contained in the agreement must so indicate by having the appropriate authorizing official sign the agreement and return it to CCC. The applicant may not begin to implement approved activities until the applicant's authorizing official and CCC have signed the agreement. The applicant is authorized to begin implementation of the project as of the date specified in the approval letter, unless otherwise indicated.
(b) The approval letter and agreement will outline the activities and budgets that are approved and will specify the terms and conditions applicable to the project, including the levels of EMP funding and cost-share requirements.
§ 1486.301
Amendments.
(a) Recipients may request to modify approved projects if circumstances change in such a way that they would likely affect the progress and ultimate success of a project. Such modification must be made through a written amendment to the agreement. All requests for project modifications must be made in writing to CCC and must include:
(1) A justification as to why changes to the project as originally designed are needed;
(2) An explanation of the necessary adjustments in approach or strategy; and
(3) A description of necessary changes in the project's time line(s) and/or budget (
e.g.,
shifting of budgetary resources from one-line item to another in order to accommodate the changes).
(b) All requests for project modifications must be reviewed and approved by CCC. Upon approval, CCC will issue an amendment to the agreement, which must be signed by CCC and the Recipient.
§ 1486.302
Subrecipients.
(a) A Recipient may utilize the services of a subrecipient to implement activities under the agreement if this is provided for in the agreement. The subrecipient may receive CCC-provided funds, program income, or other resources from the Recipient for this purpose. The Recipient must enter in to a written subaward with the subrecipient and comply with the applicable provisions of 2 CFR 200.331 and/or the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), if applicable. If required by the agreement, the Recipient must provide a copy of such subaward to FAS, in the manner set forth in the agreement, prior to the transfer of CCC-provided funds or program income to the subrecipient.
(b) A Recipient must include the following requirements in a subaward:
(1) The subrecipient is required to comply with the applicable provisions of this part and 2 CFR parts 200 and 400 and/or the FAR, if applicable. The applicable provisions are those that relate specifically to subrecipients, as well as those relating to non-Federal entities that impose requirements that would be reasonable to pass through to a subrecipient because they directly concern the implementation by the subrecipient of one or more activities under the agreement. If there is a question about whether a particular provision is applicable, FAS will make the determination.
(2) The subrecipient must pay to the Recipient the value of CCC-provided funds, interest, or program income that are not used in accordance with the subaward, or that are lost, damaged, or misused as a result of the subrecipient's failure to exercise reasonable care.
(3) In accordance with 2 CFR 200.501(h), subawards must include a description of the applicable compliance requirements and the subrecipient's compliance responsibility. Methods to ensure compliance may include pre-award audits, monitoring during the agreement, and post-award audits.
(c) A Recipient must monitor the actions of a subrecipient as necessary to ensure that CCC-provided funds and
program income provided to the subrecipient are used for authorized purposes in compliance with applicable U.S. Federal laws and regulations and the subaward and that performance indicator targets are achieved for both activities and results under the agreement.
(d) Recipients have full and sole responsibility for the legal sufficiency of all subawards they may enter into with one or more subrecipients in order to carry out an approved project and shall assume financial liability for any costs or claims resulting from suits, challenges, or other disputes based on subawards entered into by the Recipient. Neither CCC nor any other agency of the United States Government nor any official or employee of CCC, FAS, USDA, or the United States Government has any obligation or responsibility with respect to Recipient subawards with third parties.
(e) Recipients are responsible for ensuring to the greatest extent possible that the terms, conditions, and costs of subawards constitute the most economical and effective use of project funds.
(f) All fees for professional and technical services paid to subrecipients in any part with project funds must be covered by written subawards.
(g) A Recipient shall:
(1) Ensure that all expenditures for goods and services in excess of $25 reimbursed by CCC are documented by a purchase order or invoice;
(2) Ensure that no employee, officer, board member, agent, or the employee's, officer's, board member's, or agent's family, partners, or an organization that employs or is about to employ any of the parties indicated herein, participates in the review, selection, award or administration of a subaward in which such entities or their affiliates have a financial or other interest;
(3) Conduct all contracting in an openly competitive manner. Individuals who develop or draft specifications, requirements, statements of work, invitations for bids, or requests for proposals for procurement of any goods or services, and such individuals' families or partners, or an organization that employs or is about to employ any of the aforementioned shall be excluded from competition for such procurement;
(4) Conduct all awarding of grants and agreements in an openly competitive manner, except under the following conditions:
(i) Non-monetary awards of property or services;
(ii) Awards of less than $75,000;
(iii) Awards to fund continuing work already started under a previous award;
(iv) Awards that cannot be delayed due to an emergency or a substantial danger to health or safety;
(v) Awards when it is impracticable to secure competition; or
(vi) Awards to fund unique and innovative unsolicited applications;
(5) Base each solicitation for professional or technical services on a clear and accurate description of and requirements related to the services to be procured;
(6) Perform and document some form of fee, price, or cost analysis, such as a comparison of price quotations to market prices or other price indicia, to determine the reasonableness of the offered fees or prices for procurements in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold defined at 2 CFR 200.88; and
(7) Document the decision-making process.

# Subpart D—Cost Share and Reimbursements
§ 1486.400
Cost share.
(a) The EMP is intended to complement, not supplant, the efforts of the U.S. private sector. Therefore, no private sector proposal will be considered without the element of cost share from the Recipient and/or U.S. partners.
(b) There is no minimum or maximum required amount of cost share. The degree of commitment to a proposed project, represented by the amount and type of private funding, is used as one factor in determining which proposals will be approved. The type of cost share is also not specified, though some contributions are ineligible (see § 1486.402). Cost share may be actual cash invested or professional time of staff assigned to the project.
Proposals in which the private sector is willing to commit funds, rather than in-kind items such as staff resources, and those with higher amounts of cost share will be given priority consideration.
(c) Cost share is not required for proposals from Federal, state, or local government agencies. It is mandatory from all other eligible entities, even when they are party to a joint proposal with a government agency.
(d) Contributions from foreign (non-U.S.) organizations may not be counted toward the cost share requirement but may be included in the total cost of the project.
(e) An activity that is undertaken by an entity at the request of FAS may be exempted from the cost share requirement. This determination is made at the discretion of FAS.
(f) A Recipient's cost share requirement will be specified in the agreement and approval letter. If a Recipient fails to contribute the total specified in the agreement, the difference between the amount contributed and the total amount required must be repaid to CCC in U.S. dollars within six months after the end of the period of performance of the agreement. If a Recipient is reimbursed by CCC for less than the amount of funds approved in the agreement, then the final required cost share shall equal, on a percentage basis, the original ratio of cost share to the authorized EMP funding level.
§ 1486.401
Eligible cost share.
(a) In calculating the amount of cost share that it will make and the cost share U.S. entities or a State or local agency will make, a Recipient may include those costs (or such prorated costs) not proscribed under § 1486.402 if:
(1) The expenditures are necessary and reasonable for accomplishment of the Recipient's overall EMP;
(2) The expenditures are not included as cost share for any other Federal award;
(3) The expenditures are not paid by the Federal Government under another Federal award, except where the Federal statute authorizing a program specifically provides that Federal funds made available for such program can be applied to matching or cost sharing requirements of other Federal programs; and
(4) The cost share is made during the period covered by the agreement.
(b) Cost share must be included in a project's line item budget.
§ 1486.402
Ineligible cost share.
(a) The following are not eligible as cost share:
(1) Normal operating expenses and other costs not directly related to the project;
(2) Any portion of salary or compensation of an individual who is the target of an approved project activity;
(3) The cost of insuring articles owned by private individuals;
(4) The cost of product development, product modification, or product research;
(5) Slotting fees or similar sales expenditures;
(6) Funds, services, capital goods, or personnel provided by any U.S. Government agency;
(7) The value of any services generated by a Recipient or a third party that involve no expenditure by the Recipient or third party,
e.g.,
free publicity;
(8) The cost of developing any application/proposal for EMP funding;
(9) Membership fees in clubs and social organizations; and
(10) Any expenditure for an activity prior to CCC's approval of that activity.
(b) CCC shall determine, at CCC's discretion, whether any cost not expressly listed in this section may be included as an eligible cost share.
§ 1486.403
Reimbursement rules.
(a) A Recipient may seek reimbursement for an eligible expenditure if:
(1) The expenditure was necessary and reasonable for the performance of an approved activity; and
(2) The Recipient has not been and will not be reimbursed for such expenditure by any other source.
(b) Subject to paragraph (a) of this section, as well as applicable cost principles in 2 CFR part 200, to the extent these principles do not directly conflict with the provisions of this part, CCC will reimburse, in whole or in part, the cost of:
(1) Salaries and benefits of the Recipient's existing personnel or any other participating entity that are directly assigned to EMP-funded projects. Salaries of administrative and clerical staff should normally be treated as indirect costs. Federal, state, and local government Recipients may not be reimbursed for salaries and benefits. Reimbursement of salaries and benefits for other Recipients is limited to:
(i) The actual daily rate paid by the Recipient for the employee's salary or the daily rate of a GS-15, Step 10 U.S. Government employee in effect during the calendar year in which the project or activity is approved for funding, whichever is less;
(ii) The actual assigned time of the employee to the project; and
(iii) Benefits at a maximum rate of 30 percent of the existing salary of the employee, prorated to the time assigned to the project, provided that such benefits are required and granted pursuant to the Recipient's established written policies.
(2) Consulting fees for professional services, limited to the daily rate of a GS-15, Step 10 U.S. Government employee in effect during the calendar year in which the project or activity is approved for funding. Reimbursement is authorized only for actual days worked and is not authorized for travel and rest days. Benefits are not reimbursable.
(3) STRE for social events or receptions that are primarily attended by foreign officials and that are held at foreign venues and are part of an approved activity. Such expenses must conform to the American Embassy representational funding guidelines as the standard for judging the appropriateness of the STRE costs. The amount of unauthorized STRE expenses that exceed the guidelines will not be reimbursed. Recipients must pay the difference between the total cost of STRE events and the appropriate amount as determined by the guidelines. STRE incurred in the United States is not authorized for reimbursement but may be counted as a cost share to the project.
(4) Travel expenses, subject to the following:
(i) All expenses while in travel status must conform to the U.S. Federal Travel Regulations (41 CFR parts 300 through 304);
(ii) Air travel must comply with the Fly America Act (49 U.S.C. App. 1517) and is limited to the full-fare economy class rate;
(iii) Per diem is limited to the allowable rate for each domestic or foreign locale (41 CFR part 301-11). Expenses in excess of the authorized per diem rates may be allowed in special or unusual circumstances (41 CFR part 301-11), but must be approved in advance; and
(iv) The Recipient shall notify the Attaché/Counselor in the destination countries in writing in advance of any proposed travel by the Recipient or its consultants or other Recipients. The timing of such notice should be far enough in advance to enable the Attaché/Counselor to schedule appointments, make preparations, or otherwise provide any assistance being requested. Failure to provide advance notification of travel generally will result in disallowance of the expenses related to the travel, unless CCC determines it was impractical to provide such notification.
(5) Direct administrative costs.
(6) Indirect costs not identified as direct costs, but which are necessary for the implementation of a project. Indirect costs must be specified to be eligible for reimbursement. Indirect costs may be reimbursed up to a maximum of 10 percent of the EMP-funded portion of the project budget, excluding indirect costs, except that Recipients in FAS' Market Access Program and the Foreign Market Development Cooperator Program, SRTGs, for-profit entities, and government Recipients may not be reimbursed for indirect costs.
(7) Rental costs for equipment necessary to carry out approved projects. Equipment rentals must be returned by the Recipient to the supplier in accordance with the lease agreements, but in no case later than 90 calendar days from the completion date of the project.
(8) Procuring samples of specific agricultural commodities that are appropriate and necessary to the success of a technical assistance activity.
§ 1486.404
Ineligible expenditures.
(a) CCC will not reimburse expenditures made prior to approval of a Recipient's proposal, unreasonable expenditures, or any cost of:
(1) Branded product promotions,
e.g.,
in-store promotions, restaurant advertising, labeling, etc.;
(2) Administrative and operational expenses for trade shows;
(3) Advertising;
(4) Preparation and printing of magazines, brochures, flyers, posters, etc., except in connection with specific approved activities such as training;
(5) Design, development, and maintenance of information technology projects;
(6) Purchase of equipment,
e.g.,
office equipment or other fixed assets;
(7) Subsidizing or otherwise providing funds for graduate programs at colleges and/or universities (salaries or fees for individual students who are directly assigned to specific project activities appropriate to their backgrounds may be covered on a pro-rated basis);
(8) Subsidizing normal, day-to-day operating costs of an entity, except as allowed under § 1486.403(b)(6);
(9) Honoraria for speakers;
(10) Costs of product research or new product development;
(11) Costs of developing technical assistance proposals submitted to the program;
(12) Refundable deposits or advances;
(13) STRE expenses within the United States;
(14) All costs related to the shipping, over land and sea, of commodity samples;
(15) Expenses, fines, settlements, judgments, or payments relating to legal suits, challenges, or disputes, including legal fees and costs associated with trade disputes, except as otherwise allowed in 2 CFR part 200;
(16) Real estate costs other than allowable rental costs for office space whose use is assigned specifically to a project funded by the EMP; and
(17) Any expenditure that has been or will be reimbursed by any other source.
(b) CCC may determine, at CCC's discretion, whether any cost not expressly listed in this section will be reimbursed.
§ 1486.405
Reimbursement procedures.
(a) Following the implementation of a project for which CCC has agreed to provide funding, a Recipient may submit claims for reimbursement of eligible expenses incurred in implementing an EMP project, to the extent that CCC has agreed to pay such expenses. Any changes to approved activities must be approved in writing by CCC before any reimbursable expenses associated with the change can be incurred. A Recipient will be reimbursed after CCC reviews the claim and determines that it is complete.
(b) CCC will make all payments to the Recipients in U.S. dollars. FAS will initiate payment within 30 days after receipt of the billing, unless the billing is improper.
(c) Recipients will be authorized to submit requests for reimbursements or advances at least monthly when electronic fund transfers (EFTs) are not used, and as frequently as desired when electronic transfers are used, in accordance with the provisions of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (15 U.S.C. 1693-1693r).
(d) Recipients may submit claims for reimbursement of the expenses incurred in implementing EMP projects, to the extent CCC has agreed to pay for such costs, limited initially to 85 percent of the total amount specified in the agreement. The Recipient may be reimbursed for the remaining 15 percent of the funds only after the final performance report containing the information required by the agreement is submitted to and approved by FAS.
(e) Final claims for reimbursement must be received no later than 90 calendar days after the completion date of the project or following the expiration or termination date of the agreement, whichever is sooner, and are subject to FAS approval of the Recipient's final performance report. Recipients are required to use a prescribed system to submit their claims. This system will be clearly stated in the NOFO. Currently the CCC's internet-based UES system is being used to request reimbursement for eligible EMP program expenses.
(f) Recipients shall maintain complete records of all program expenditures, identified by EMP agreement
number, program year, country or region, activity number, and cost category. Such records shall be accompanied by documentation that supports the expenditure and shall be made available to CCC upon request. CCC may deny a claim for reimbursement if the claim is not supported by acceptable documentation.
(g) In the event that a reimbursement claim is overpaid or is disallowed after payment already has been made, the Recipient shall repay CCC within 30 calendar days of such overpayment or disallowance the amount overpaid or disallowed either by submitting a check payable to CCC and referencing the applicable project, or by offsetting its next reimbursement claim. The Recipient shall make such payment in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise approved in advance by CCC.
(h) The Recipient shall report any actions that may have a bearing on the propriety of any claims for reimbursement in writing to the appropriate Attaché/Counselor and FAS Division Director.
§ 1486.406
Advances.
(a)
Policy.
In general, CCC operates the EMP on a cost reimbursable basis.
(b)
Exception.
Upon request, CCC may make advance payments to a Recipient against an approved project budget. Up to 40 percent of the approved project budget may be provided as an advance, either at one time or in incremental payments. Advances should be limited to the minimum amounts needed and requested as close as is administratively feasible to the actual time of disbursement by the Recipient. Reimbursement claims will be used to offset advances. Recipients shall deposit and maintain advances in insured, interest-bearing accounts, unless the exceptions in 2 CFR part 200 apply. Interest earned by the Recipient on funds advanced by CCC is not program income. Up to $500 of interest earned per year may be retained by the Recipient for administrative expenses. Any additional interest earned on Federal advance payments shall be remitted annually to the appropriate entity as required in 2 CFR part 200.
(c)
Refunds due CCC.
A Recipient shall fully expend all advances on approved activities within 90 calendar days after the date of disbursement by CCC. By the end of 90 calendar days, the Recipient must submit reimbursement claims to offset the advance and submit a check made payable to CCC for any unexpended balance. The Recipient shall make such payment in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise approved in advance by CCC.

# Subpart E—Reporting, Evaluation, and Compliance
§ 1486.500
Reports.
(a) Recipients are required to submit regular financial and performance reports in accordance with their agreement. Reporting requirements and formats for both annual financial and performance reports and final financial and performance reports will be specified in the agreement between CCC and the Recipient.
(b)(1) In addition to the information required in 2 CFR 200.328(b)(2), a Recipient's performance reports must include pertinent information regarding the Recipient's progress, measured against established indicators, baselines, and targets, towards achieving the expected results specified in the agreement. This reporting must include, for each performance indicator, a comparison of actual accomplishments with the baseline and the targets established for the period. When actual accomplishments deviate significantly from targeted goals, the Recipient must provide an explanation in the report.
(2) A Recipient must ensure the accuracy and reliability of the performance data submitted to FAS in performance reports. At any time during the period of performance of the agreement, FAS may review the Recipient's performance data to determine whether it is accurate and reliable. The Recipient must comply with all requests made by FAS or an entity designated by FAS in relation to such reviews.
(c) All final performance reports will be made available to the public.
(d) If requested by FAS, a Recipient must provide to FAS additional information or reports relating to the agreement.
(e) If a Recipient requires an extension of a reporting deadline, it must ensure that FAS receives an extension request at least five business days prior to the reporting deadline. FAS may decline to consider a request for an extension that it receives after this time period. FAS will consider requests for reporting deadline extensions on a case by case basis and will make a decision based on the merits of each request. FAS will consider factors such as unforeseen or extenuating circumstances and past performance history when evaluating requests for extensions.
§ 1486.501
Evaluation.
Project evaluations may be carried out by CCC at its option with or without Recipients. CCC may also seek outside expertise to conduct or participate in evaluations.
§ 1486.502
Compliance reviews and notices.
(a)
Compliance review process.
(1) USDA staff may conduct compliance reviews of Recipient's activities under the EMP to ensure compliance with this part, applicable Federal laws and regulations, and the terms of the agreements and approval letters. Recipients shall cooperate fully with relevant USDA staff conducting compliance reviews and shall comply with all requests from USDA staff to facilitate the conduct of such reviews. Program funds spent inappropriately or on unapproved activities must be returned to CCC.
(2) Any project or activity funded under the program is subject to review or audit at any time during the course of implementation or after the completion of the project.
(3) Upon conclusion of the compliance review, USDA staff will provide a written compliance report to the Recipient. The compliance report will detail any instances where it appears that the Recipient is not complying with any of the terms or conditions of the agreement, approval letter, or the applicable laws and regulations. The report will also specify if it appears that CCC may be entitled to recover funds from the Recipient and will explain the basis for any recovery of funds from the Recipient. If, as a result of a compliance review, CCC determines that further review is needed in order to ensure compliance with the requirements of the EMP, CCC may require the Recipient to contract for an independent audit.
(4) In addition, CCC may notify a Recipient in writing at any time if CCC determines that CCC may be entitled to recover funds from the Recipient. CCC will explain the basis for any recovery of funds from the Recipient in the written notice. The Recipient shall, within 30 calendar days of the date of the notice, repay CCC the amount owed either by submitting a check payable to CCC or by offsetting its next reimbursement claim. The Recipient shall make such payment in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise approved in advance by CCC. If, however, a Recipient notifies CCC within 30 calendar days of the date of the written notice that the Recipient intends to file an appeal pursuant to the provisions of this part, the amount owed to CCC by the Recipient is not due until the appeal procedures are concluded and CCC has made a final determination as to the amount owed.
(5) The fact that a compliance review has been conducted by USDA staff does not signify that a Recipient is in full compliance with its agreement, approval letter, and/or applicable laws and regulations.
(b)
Recipient response to compliance report.
(1) A Recipient shall, within 60 calendar days of the date of the issuance of a compliance report, submit a written response to CCC. The response may include additional documentation for consideration or a request for reconsideration of any finding along with supporting justification. If the Recipient does not wish to contest the compliance report, the response shall include any money owed to CCC, which may be returned by submitting a check payable to CCC or by offsetting a reimbursement claim. The Recipient shall make any payments in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise approved in advance by CCC. CCC, at its discretion, may extend the period for response.
(2) After reviewing the response, CCC shall determine whether the Recipient owes any funds to CCC and will inform the Recipient in writing of the basis for the determination. CCC may initiate
action to collect such amount by providing the Recipient a written demand for payment of the debt pursuant to the debt settlement policies and procedures in 7 CFR part 1403.
(c)
Recipient appeals of CCC determinations.
(1) Within 30 calendar days of the date of the issuance of a determination, the Recipient may appeal the determination by making a request in writing that includes the basis for such reconsideration. The Recipient may also request a hearing.
(2) If the Recipient requests a hearing, CCC will set a date and time for the hearing. The hearing will be an informal proceeding. A transcript will not ordinarily be prepared unless the Recipient bears the cost of a transcript; however, CCC may, at its discretion, have a transcript prepared at CCC's expense.
(3) CCC will base its final determination upon information contained in the administrative record. The Recipient must exhaust all administrative remedies contained in this section before pursuing judicial review of a determination by CCC.
§ 1486.503
Records retention.
Each Recipient shall retain all records relating to the project for three calendar years from the date of submission of the final expenditure report. All records related to the project, including records pertaining to contractors, shall be made available upon request to authorized officials of the U.S. Government.
§ 1486.504
Program income.
Program income means gross income earned by the Recipient that is directly generated by a supported activity or earned as a result of the Federal award during the period of performance. Any such income generated from an activity, the expenditures for which have been wholly or partially reimbursed with EMP funds, shall be used by the Recipient in furtherance of its approved activities in the program period during which the EMP funds are available for obligation by the Recipient, or must be returned to CCC. The use of such income shall be governed by this part. Reasonable activity fees or registration fees, if identified as such in a project budget, may be charged for projects approved for program funding. The intent to charge a fee must be part of the original proposal, along with an explanation of how such fees are to be used. Any activity fees charged must be used to offset activity expenses or returned to CCC. Such fees may not be used as profit or counted as cost share.
§ 1486.505
Audit requirements.
(a) Subpart F of 2 CFR part 200 applies to all Recipients and subrecipients under this part other than those that are for-profit entities, foreign public entities, or foreign organizations.
(b) A Recipient or subrecipient that is a for-profit entity or a subrecipient that is a foreign organization and that expends, during its fiscal year, a total of at least the audit requirement threshold in 2 CFR 200.501 in Federal awards, is required to obtain an audit. Such a Recipient or subrecipient has the following two options to satisfy the requirement in this paragraph (b):
(1)(i) A financial audit of the agreement or subaward, in accordance with the Government Auditing Standards issued by the United States Government Accountability Office (GAO), if the Recipient or subrecipient expends Federal awards under only one FAS program during such fiscal year; or
(ii) A financial audit of all Federal awards from FAS, in accordance with GAO's Government Auditing Standards, if the Recipient or subrecipient expends Federal awards under multiple FAS programs during such fiscal year; or
(2) An audit that meets the requirements contained in subpart F of 2 CFR part 200.
(c) A Recipient or subrecipient that is a for-profit entity or a subrecipient that is a foreign organization and that expends, during its fiscal year, a total that is less than the audit requirement threshold in 2 CFR 200.501 in Federal awards, is exempt from requirements under this section for an audit for that year, except as provided in paragraphs (d) and (f) of this section, but it must make records available for review by appropriate officials of Federal agencies.
(d) FAS may require an annual financial audit of an agreement or subaward
when the audit requirement threshold in 2 CFR 200.501 is not met. In that case, FAS must provide funds under the agreement for this purpose, and the Recipient or subrecipient, as applicable, must arrange for such audit and submit it to FAS.
(e) When a Recipient or subrecipient that is a for-profit entity or a subrecipient that is a foreign organization is required to obtain a financial audit under this section, it must provide a copy of the audit to FAS within 60 days after the end of its fiscal year.
(f) FAS, the USDA Office of Inspector General, or GAO may conduct or arrange for additional audits of any Recipients or subrecipients, including for-profit entities and foreign organizations. Recipients and subrecipients must promptly comply with all requests related to such audits. If FAS conducts or arranges for an additional audit, such as an audit with respect to a particular agreement, FAS will fund the full cost of such an audit, in accordance with 2 CFR 200.503(d).
§ 1486.506
Disclosure of program information.
(a) Documents submitted to CCC by Recipients are subject to the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552, and 7 CFR part 1, subpart A, including, specifically, 7 CFR 1.11.
(b) Any research conducted by a Recipient pursuant to an agreement and/or approval letter shall be subject to the provisions relating to intangible property in 2 CFR part 200.
§ 1486.507
Ethical conduct.
(a) The Recipient shall maintain written standards of conduct governing the performance of its employees engaged in the award and administration of contracts.

(c) Neither a Recipient nor its affiliates shall make export sales of U.S. agricultural commodities covered under the terms of an agreement. Neither a Recipient nor its affiliates shall charge a fee for facilitating an export sale. A Recipient may collect check-off funds and membership fees that are required for membership in the Recipient's organization.
(d) The Recipient shall not use program activities or project funds to promote private self-interests or conduct private business.
(e) A Recipient shall not limit participation in its EMP activities to members of its organization. Recipients shall ensure that their EMP-funded programs and activities are open to all otherwise qualified individuals and entities on an equal basis and without regard to any non-merit factors.
(f) A Recipient shall select U.S. agricultural industry representatives to participate in activities based on criteria that ensure participation on an equitable basis by a broad cross section of the U.S. industry. If requested by CCC, a Recipient shall submit such selection criteria to CCC for approval.
(g) The Recipient must report any actions or circumstances that may have a bearing on the propriety of program activities to the appropriate Attaché/Counselor, and the Recipient's U.S. office shall report such actions or circumstances in writing to CCC.
(h) The officers, employees, board members, and agents of the Recipient shall neither solicit nor accept gratuities, favors, or anything of monetary value from contractors, sub-contractors, or parties to sub-agreements. However, Recipients may set standards for situations in which the financial interest is not substantial, or the gift is an unsolicited item of nominal value. The standards of conduct shall provide for disciplinary actions to be applied for violations of such standards by officers, employees, board members, or agents of the Recipient.
§ 1486.508
Suspension and termination.
(a) An agreement or subaward may be suspended or terminated in accordance with 2 CFR 200.338 or 200.339. FAS
may suspend or terminate an agreement if it determines that:
(1) One of the bases in 2 CFR 200.338 or 200.339 for termination or suspension by FAS has been satisfied; or
(2) The continuation of the assistance provided under the agreement is no longer necessary or desirable.
(b) If an agreement is terminated, the Recipient:
(1) Is responsible for using or returning any CCC-provided funds, interest, or program income that have not been disbursed, as agreed to by FAS; and
(2) Must comply with any closeout and post-closeout procedures specified in the agreement and 2 CFR 200.343 and 200.344.
§ 1486.509
Noncompliance with an agreement.
(a) If a Recipient fails to comply with any term in its agreement, approval letter, or this part, CCC may take one or more of the enforcement actions in 2 CFR part 200 and, if appropriate, initiate a claim against the Recipient, following the procedures set forth in this part. CCC may also initiate a claim against a Recipient if program income or CCC-provided funds are lost due to an action or omission of the Recipient. If any Recipient has engaged in fraud with respect to the EMP program, or has otherwise violated program requirements under this part, CCC may:
(1) Hold such Recipient liable for any and all losses to CCC resulting from such fraud or violation;
(2) Require a refund of any assistance provided to such Recipient plus interest as determined by FAS; and
(3) Collect liquidated damages from such Recipient in an amount determined appropriate by FAS.
(b) The provisions of this section shall be without prejudice to any other remedy that is available under any other provision of law.
§ 1486.510

§ 1487.1
General purpose and scope.
(a) Under the Technical Assistance for Specialty Crops (TASC) program, the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC), an agency and instrumentality of the United States within the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), provides grant funds to eligible organizations to implement activities that are intended to address existing or potential sanitary, phytosanitary, or technical barriers that prohibit or threaten the export of U.S. specialty crops that are currently available on a commercial basis. The TASC program is intended to benefit the represented industry rather than a specific company or brand.
(b) This part sets forth the general terms, conditions, and policies governing CCC's operation of the TASC program.
(c)(1) The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued guidance on Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards in 2 CFR
part 200. In 2 CFR 400.1, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) adopted OMB's guidance in subparts A through F of 2 CFR part 200, as supplemented by 2 CFR part 400, as USDA policies and procedures for uniform administrative requirements, cost principles, and audit requirements for Federal awards.
(2) The OMB guidance at 2 CFR part 200, as supplemented by 2 CFR part 400 and this part, applies to the TASC program.
(3) In addition to the provisions of this part, other regulations that are generally applicable to grants and cooperative agreements of USDA, including the applicable regulations set forth in 2 CFR chapters I, II, and IV, also apply to the TASC program, to the extent that these regulations do not directly conflict with the provisions of this part. The provisions of the CCC Charter Act (15 U.S.C. 714
et seq.
) and any other statutory provisions or regulatory provisions that are generally applicable to CCC also apply to the TASC program.
(d) The TASC program generally operates on a reimbursement basis. The program is administered by the Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS), acting on behalf of CCC.
§ 1487.2
Definitions.
For purposes of this part, the following definitions apply:
Activity
means a discrete undertaking within a project to be carried out by a Participant, directly or through a subrecipient or contractor, that is specified in an agreement and is intended to fulfill a specific objective of the agreement.
Agreement
means a legally binding grant entered into between CCC and a TASC applicant setting forth the terms and conditions to implement an approved project under the TASC program, including any subsequent amendments to such agreement.
Approval letter
means a document by which CCC informs an applicant that its TASC proposal has been approved for funding. This letter may also approve specific activities and contain terms and conditions in addition to the agreement.
Attaché/Counselor
means the FAS employee representing United States Department of Agriculture interests in a foreign country.
Eligible organization
means any U.S. organization that demonstrates a role or interest in the exports of specialty crops, including, but not limited to: U.S. Government agencies, State government agencies, non-profit trade associations, universities, agricultural cooperatives, and private companies.
Participant
means an entity that has entered into a TASC agreement with CCC.
Specialty crop
means most cultivated plants produced in the United States, or the products thereof, except wheat, feed grains, oilseeds, cotton, rice, peanuts, sugar, and tobacco.
Unified Export Strategy (UES) system
means the online internet system maintained by FAS through which applicants currently may apply to TASC and the other FAS market development programs. The system is currently accessible at
https://apps.fas.usda.gov/ues/webapp/.
FAS may prescribe a different system through which applicants may apply to TASC and will announce such system in the applicable Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO).
United States
means each of the States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the territories and possessions of the United States.
§ 1487.3
Program eligibility.
(a) An eligible organization can submit an application under this part to become a Participant under the TASC Program. FAS will set forth specific eligibility information, including any factors or priorities that will affect the eligibility of an applicant or application for selection, in the full text of the applicable NOFO posted on the U.S. Government website for grant opportunities.
(b) In order to be eligible for funding under the TASC program, activities must address existing or potential sanitary, phytosanitary, or technical barriers to the export of U.S. specialty crops. Examples of expenses that CCC may agree to cover under the TASC program include but are not limited to expenses associated with: Initial pre-
clearance programs, export protocol and work plan support, seminars and workshops, study tours, field surveys, development of pest lists, pest and disease research, database development, reasonable logistical and administrative support, and travel and per diem expenses.
(c) Eligible projects may take place in the United States or abroad.
(d) Proposals from research and consulting entities will be considered for funding assistance only with evidence of substantial participation in and financial support to the proposed project by U.S. industry. Such support is most credibly demonstrated through actual monetary contributions to the cost of the project.
(e) Foreign organizations, whether government or private, may participate as third parties in activities carried out by U.S. entities, but are not eligible for funding assistance from the program.
§ 1487.4
Limits on the scope of proposals.
(a)
Funding cap.
Proposals that request more than $500,000 of CCC funding in a given year will not be considered.
(b)
Length of activities.
Awards will generally be granted for a project period not exceeding five calendar years. However, FAS will entertain requests to extend agreements beyond five years when valid justifications are submitted. Participants must submit in writing a valid justification for why an extension is necessary no later than 60 days before the end of the period of performance. Extensions generally will be granted in one-year increments, if warranted. A Participant must wait for written approval from FAS before proceeding with the project.
(c)
Target countries.
Proposals may target barriers in any eligible export market, including single countries or reasonable regional groupings of countries.
(d)
Multiple proposals.
Applicants may submit multiple proposals, but no Participant may have more than five approved projects underway at any given time.
(e)
Program funds only for specific uses.
Participants shall not use program funds to supplement the costs of normal day-to-day operations or to promote their own products or services beyond specific uses approved in a given project.
§ 1487.5
Application process.
(a)
Announcement for TASC program participant.
CCC will periodically announce that it is accepting applications for participation in the TASC program. All relevant information, including application deadlines and proposal content, will be noted in the announcement, and proposals must be submitted in accordance with the terms and conditions, as well as other requirements specified in the announcement and in this part. Currently, applicants are encouraged to submit applications through the UES system, but are not required to use the UES system. CCC may request any additional information it deems necessary from any applicant in order to properly evaluate any proposal
(b)
Universal identifier and System for Award Management (SAM).
In accordance with 2 CFR part 25, each entity that applies to the TASC program and does not qualify for an exemption under 2 CFR 25.110 must:
(1) Be registered in the SAM prior to submitting an application or plan;
(2) Maintain an active SAM registration with current information at all times during which it has an active Federal award or an application or plan under consideration by CCC; and
(3) Provide its DUNS number, or a unique identifier designated as a DUNS replacement, in each application or plan it submits to CCC.
(c)
Reporting subaward and executive compensation information.
In accordance with 2 CFR part 170, each entity that applies to the TASC program and does not qualify for an exception under 2 CFR 170.110(b) must ensure it has the necessary processes and systems in place to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of 2 CFR part 170 should it receive TASC funding.
§ 1487.6
Application review and formation of agreements.
(a)
General.
Proposals received in accordance with the announcement and
this part will undergo a multi-phase review by CCC to determine eligibility for the program, the qualifications, quality, and appropriateness of proposed projects, and the reasonableness of proposed project budgets.
(b)
Evaluation criteria.
CCC will review all proposals for eligibility and completeness. CCC will evaluate and score each proposal against the factors described in the NOFO. The purpose of this review is to identify meritorious proposals, recommend an appropriate funding level for each proposal, and submit the proposals and funding recommendations to appropriate officials for decision. CCC may, when appropriate to the subject matter of the proposal, request the assistance of other U.S. Government experts in evaluating the merits of a proposal. Demonstration of substantial U.S. industry participation in or financial or other support of a proposal will be a positive factor in the consideration of proposals. All reviewers will be required to sign a conflict of interest form, and when conflicts of interests are identified the reviewer will be recused from the objective review process.
(c)
Approval decision.
CCC will approve those applications that it determines best satisfy the criteria and factors specified in the announcement and this part. All decisions regarding the disposition of an application are final.
§ 1487.7
Applicant notification.
(a) CCC will notify each applicant in writing of the final decision on its application. CCC will send an agreement and an approval letter to each approved applicant. An applicant that accepts the terms and conditions contained in the agreement and approval letter must so indicate by having the appropriate authorizing official sign the agreement and submit it to CCC. The applicant may not begin to implement approved activities until the applicant's authorizing official and CCC have signed the agreement. The applicant is authorized to begin implementation of the project as of the date specified in the approval letter, unless otherwise indicated.
(b) The approval letter and agreement will outline the activities and budgets that are approved and will specify the terms and conditions applicable to the project, including the levels of TASC funding and cost share requirements.
§ 1487.8
Reimbursements and advances.
(a)
Reimbursement procedures.
(1) Following the implementation of a project for which CCC has agreed to provide funding, a Participant may submit claims for reimbursement of eligible expenses incurred in implementing a TASC project, to the extent that CCC has agreed to pay such expenses. Any changes to approved activities must be approved in writing by CCC before any reimbursable expenses associated with the change can be incurred. A Participant will be reimbursed after CCC reviews the claim and determines that it is complete.
(2) CCC will make all payments to the Participants in U.S. dollars. FAS will initiate payment within 30 days after receipt of the billing, unless the billing is improper.
(3) Participants will be authorized to submit requests for reimbursements or advances at least monthly when electronic fund transfers (EFTs) are not used, and as frequently as desired when electronic transfers are used, in accordance with the provisions of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (15 U.S.C. 1693-1693r).
(4) Participants may submit claims for reimbursement of the expenses incurred in implementing TASC projects, to the extent CCC has agreed to pay for such costs, limited initially to 85 percent of the total amount specified in the agreement. The Participant may be reimbursed for the remaining 15 percent of the funds only after the final performance report containing the information required by the agreement is submitted to and approved by FAS.
(5) Final claims for reimbursement must be received no later than 90 calendar days after the completion date of the project or following the expiration or termination date of the agreement, whichever is sooner, and are subject to FAS approval of the Participant's final performance report. Participants are required to use a prescribed system to submit their claims. This system will
be clearly stated in the NOFO. Currently the CCC's internet-based UES system is being used to request reimbursement for eligible TASC program expenses.
(6) Participants shall maintain complete records of all program expenditures, identified by TASC agreement number, program year, country or region, activity number, and cost category. Such records shall be accompanied by documentation that supports the expenditure and shall be made available to CCC upon request. CCC may deny a claim for reimbursement if the claim is not supported by acceptable documentation.
(7) In the event that a reimbursement claim is overpaid or is disallowed after payment already has been made, the Participant shall repay CCC within 30 calendar days of such overpayment or disallowance the amount overpaid or disallowed either by submitting a check payable to CCC and referencing the applicable project, or by offsetting its next reimbursement claim. The Participant shall make such payment in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise approved in advance by CCC.
(8) The Participant shall report any actions that may have a bearing on the propriety of any claims for reimbursement in writing to the appropriate Attaché/Counselor and FAS Division Director.
(b)
Advances
—(1)
Policy.
In general, CCC operates the TASC program on a cost reimbursable basis.
(2)
Exception.
Upon request, CCC may make advance payments to a Participant against an approved project budget. Participants may request an advance of up to 85 percent of the funding approved in any given program year. Advances should be limited to the minimum amounts needed and requested as close as is administratively feasible to the actual time of disbursement by the Participant. Reimbursement claims will be used to offset advances. Participants shall deposit and maintain advances in insured, interest-bearing accounts, unless the exceptions in 2 CFR part 200 apply. Interest earned by the Participant on funds advanced by CCC is not program income. Up to $500 of interest earned per year may be retained by the Participant for administrative expenses. Any additional interest earned on Federal advance payments shall be remitted annually to the appropriate entity as required in 2 CFR part 200.
(3)
Refunds due CCC.
A Participant shall fully expend all advances on approved activities within 90 calendar days after the date of disbursement by CCC. By the end of 90 calendar days, the Participant must submit reimbursement claims to offset the advance and submit a check made payable to CCC for any unexpended balance. The Participant shall make such payment in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise approved in advance by CCC.
§ 1487.9
Reporting.
(a) Participants are required to submit regular financial and performance reports in accordance with their agreement. Reporting requirements and formats for both annual financial and performance reports and final financial and performance reports will be specified in the agreement between CCC and the Participant.
(b)(1) In addition to the information required in 2 CFR 200.328(b)(2), a Participant's performance reports must include pertinent information regarding the Participant's progress, measured against established indicators, baselines, and targets, towards achieving the expected results specified in the agreement. This reporting must include, for each performance indicator, a comparison of actual accomplishments with the baseline and the targets established for the period. When actual accomplishments deviate significantly from targeted goals, the Participant must provide an explanation in the report.
(2) A Participant must ensure the accuracy and reliability of the performance data submitted to FAS in performance reports. At any time during the period of performance of the agreement, FAS may review the Participant's performance data to determine whether it is accurate and reliable. The Participant must comply with all requests made by FAS or an entity designated by FAS in relation to such reviews.
(c) All final performance reports will be made available to the public.
(d) If requested by FAS, a Participant must provide to FAS additional information or reports relating to the agreement.
(e) If a Participant requires an extension of a reporting deadline, it must ensure that FAS receives an extension request at least five business days prior to the reporting deadline. FAS may decline to consider a request for an extension that it receives after this time period. FAS will consider requests for reporting deadline extensions on a case by case basis and will make a decision based on the merits of each request. FAS will consider factors such as unforeseen or extenuating circumstances and past performance history when evaluating requests for extensions.
§ 1487.10
Notification of international travel.
The Participant shall notify the Attaché/Counselor in the destination countries in writing in advance of any proposed travel by the Participant or its consultants or other participants. The timing of such notice should be far enough in advance to enable the Attaché/Counselor to schedule appointments, make preparations, or otherwise provide any assistance being requested. Failure to provide advance notification of travel generally will result in disallowance of the expenses related to the travel, unless CCC determines it was impractical to provide such notification.
§ 1487.11
Evaluation.
Project evaluations may be carried out by CCC at its option with or without Participants. CCC may also seek outside expertise to conduct or participate in evaluations.
§ 1487.12
Compliance reviews and notices
(a)
Compliance review process.
(1) USDA staff may conduct compliance reviews of Participant's activities under the TASC program to ensure compliance with this part, applicable Federal laws and regulations, and the terms of the agreements and approval letters. Participants shall cooperate fully with relevant USDA staff conducting compliance reviews and shall comply with all requests from USDA staff to facilitate the conduct of such reviews. Program funds spent inappropriately or on unapproved activities must be returned to CCC.
(2) Any project or activity funded under the program is subject to review or audit at any time during the course of implementation or after the completion of the project.
(3) Upon conclusion of the compliance review, USDA staff will provide a written compliance report to the Participant. The compliance report will detail any instances where it appears that the Participant is not complying with any of the terms or conditions of the agreement, approval letter, or the applicable laws and regulations. The report will also specify if it appears that CCC may be entitled to recover funds from the Participant and will explain the basis for any recovery of funds from the Participant. If, as a result of a compliance review, CCC determines that further review is needed in order to ensure compliance with the requirements of the TASC program, CCC may require the Participant to contract for an independent audit.
(4) In addition, CCC may notify a Participant in writing at any time if CCC determines that CCC may be entitled to recover funds from the Participant. CCC will explain the basis for any recovery of funds from the Participant in the written notice. The Participant shall, within 30 calendar days of the date of the notice, repay CCC the amount owed either by submitting a check payable to CCC or by offsetting its next reimbursement claim. The Participant shall make such payment in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise approved in advance by CCC. If, however, a Participant notifies CCC within 30 calendar days of the date of the written notice that the Participant intends to file an appeal pursuant to the provisions of this part, the amount owed to CCC by the Participant is not due until the appeal procedures are concluded and CCC has made a final determination as to the amount owed.
(5) The fact that a compliance review has been conducted by USDA staff does not signify that a Participant is in full compliance with its agreement, approval letter, and/or applicable laws and regulations.
(b)
Participant response to compliance report.
(1) A Participant shall, within 60 calendar days of the date of the issuance of a compliance report, submit a written response to CCC. The response may include additional documentation for consideration or a request for reconsideration of any finding along with supporting justification. If the Participant does not wish to contest the compliance report, the response shall include any money owed to CCC, which may be returned by submitting a check payable to CCC or by offsetting a reimbursement claim. The Participant shall make any payments in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise approved in advance by CCC. CCC, at its discretion, may extend the period for response.
(2) After reviewing the response, CCC shall determine whether the Participant owes any funds to CCC and will inform the Participant in writing of the basis for the determination. CCC may initiate action to collect such amount by providing the Participant a written demand for payment of the debt pursuant to the debt settlement policies and procedures in 7 CFR part 1403.
(c)
Participant appeals of CCC determinations.
(1) Within 30 calendar days of the date of the issuance of a determination, the Participant may appeal the determination by making a request in writing that includes the basis for such reconsideration. The Participant may also request a hearing.
(2) If the Participant requests a hearing, CCC will set a date and time for the hearing. The hearing will be an informal proceeding. A transcript will not ordinarily be prepared unless the Participant bears the cost of a transcript; however, CCC may, at its discretion, have a transcript prepared at CCC's expense.
(3) CCC will base its final determination upon information contained in the administrative record. The Participant must exhaust all administrative remedies contained in this section before pursuing judicial review of a determination by CCC.
§ 1487.13
Records retention.
All records related to the project, including records pertaining to subawards, shall be made available upon request to authorized officials of the U.S. Government.
§ 1487.14
Program income.
Program income means gross income earned by the Participant that is directly generated by a supported activity or earned as a result of the Federal award during the period of performance. Any such income generated from an activity, the expenditures for which have been wholly or partially reimbursed with TASC funds, shall be used by the Participant in furtherance of its approved activities in the program period during which the TASC funds are available for obligation by the Participant, or must be returned to CCC. The use of such income shall be governed by this part. Reasonable activity fees or registration fees, if identified as such in a project budget, may be charged for projects approved for program funding. The intent to charge a fee must be part of the original proposal, along with an explanation of how such fees are to be used. Any activity fees charged must be used to offset activity expenses or returned to CCC. Such fees may not be used as profit or counted as cost share.
§ 1487.15
Subrecipients.
(a) A Participant may utilize the services of a subrecipient to implement activities under the agreement if this is provided for in the agreement. The subrecipient may receive CCC-provided funds, program income, or other resources from the Participant for this purpose. The Participant must enter in to a written subaward with the subrecipient and comply with the applicable provisions of 2 CFR 200.331 and/or the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), if applicable. If required by the agreement, the Participant must provide a copy of such subaward to FAS, in the manner set forth in the agreement, prior to the transfer of CCC-provided funds or program income to the subrecipient.
(b) A Participant must include the following requirements in a subaward:
(1) The subrecipient is required to comply with the applicable provisions of this part and 2 CFR parts 200 and 400
and/or the FAR, if applicable. The applicable provisions are those that relate specifically to subrecipients, as well as those relating to non-Federal entities that impose requirements that would be reasonable to pass through to a subrecipient because they directly concern the implementation by the subrecipient of one or more activities under the agreement. If there is a question about whether a particular provision is applicable, FAS will make the determination.
(2) The subrecipient must pay to the Participant the value of CCC-provided funds, interest, or program income that are not used in accordance with the subaward, or that are lost, damaged, or misused as a result of the subrecipient's failure to exercise reasonable care.

# Documents Required After Financing
§ 1488.10
Evidence of entry into country of destination.
(a) Commodities exported under a financing agreement must enter the destination country specified in the financing agreement.
(b) For a financing agreement under which the financing period is in excess
of 12 months, within 90 days, or such extension of time as may be granted in writing by the Assistant Sales Manager, following shipment from the United States of any agricultural commodity exported under the financing agreement, the exporter shall furnish to the office specified in § 1488.22, documentary evidence verifying entry of the commodity into the country of destination specified in the financing agreement. The documentary evidence must:
(1) Identify the agricultural commodity (or permit identification through supplementary documents also furnished) as that exported under the financing agreement,
(2) State the quantity and date of entry of the commodity into the destination country, and
(3) Be signed by (i) a customs official of the destination country, or (ii) the importer, or (iii) a representative of an independent superintending or controlling firm.
(c) When the commodity enters the country of destination in bond, a statement by the importer will be acceptable which:
(1) Identifies the commodity as that exported under the financing agreement,
(2) States the quantity of the commodity entered under bond and date of entry into the destination country, and
(3) Certifies that the commodity will be withdrawn from bonded storage at a later date for consumption in the destination country.
(d) If the evidence of entry is in other than the English language, the exporter shall also provide an English translation thereof.
(e) Failure to furnish, within the time specified, evidence of entry of the commodity into the country of destination shall constitute prima facie evidence of failure to enter or to cause the entry of the commodity into such country as required. In such case, the financing agreement may be terminated by the Assistant Sales Manager, and if full payment under the bank obligation or account receivable has not yet been received, the bank obligation and the account receivable shall at the option of CCC, become due and payable and liquidated damages shall be payable in accordance with § 1488.11. The remedy herein provided shall not be exclusive of other rights available to the Federal government if the commodity enters a country other than that specified in the financing agreement.

# Delivery Requirements
§ 1488.11
Liquidated damages.
Failure of the exporter to export or cause to be exported, within the period provided therefor, any agricultural commodity financed, when delivery is made before export under the terms of the financing agreement, or failure of the exporter to enter or cause the entry of, such commodity into the country of destination, shall constitute a breach of the financing agreement which will result in serious and substantial damage to CCC and to its program. Since it will be difficult, if not impossible, to prove the exact amount of such damage, the exporter shall pay to CCC promptly on demand, as reasonable compensation and not as a penalty, liquidated damages in lieu of probable actual damages, as follows:
(a) For each day of delay in exportation after the final date for exportation, when delivery is made before export under the terms of the financing agreement, .15 percent of the amount financed under the financing agreement for the commodity not exported; (b) for failure to export or cause exportation, when delivery is made before export under the terms of the financing agreement, 5 percent of the amount financed under the financing agreement for the commodity not exported; (c) for failure, after exportation, to enter or cause the entry of the commodity into the country of destination, at the rate of 5 percent a year of the amount financed under the financing agreement for such commodity from the start of the financing period until payment to CCC of the amount financed;
Provided however,
That the aggregate of all amounts assessed under this § 1488.11 with respect to the same commodity shall not exceed 5 percent of the amount financed for such commodity. Liquidated damages shall not be assessed: Under paragraph (a) of this section if the Assistant Sales manager determines that the delay was due to
such causes as acts of God or government or public enemy, fires, floods, epidemics, quarantine restrictions, strikes, freight embargoes, or unusually severe weather; under paragraph (b) of this section if the Assistant Sales Manager determines that failure to export was due to loss, damage, destruction or deterioration of the commodity or act of God or government or public enemy; and under paragraph (c) of this section if the Assistant Sales Manager determines that failure to enter or cause the entry of the commodity into the country of destination was due to loss, damage, destruction or deterioration of the commodity or act of God or government or public enemy.

# Bank Obligations and Repayment
§ 1488.12
Coverage of bank obligations.
(a) U.S. banks and branch banks shall be liable without regard to risk (1) for payment of bank obligations issued by them or (2) for payment of bank obligations confirmed by them without regard to risk if a requirement for such confirmation is included in the financing agreement or (3) as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.
(b) An obligation issued by a foreign bank must be confirmed and advised, as provided in paragraphs (a), (c), (d), (e), and (f) of this section, by a U.S. bank or a branch bank, or may be confirmed by an agency bank when determined by the President or Vice President, CCC after consultation with the Controller, CCC, to be in the interest of CCC.
(c) A U.S. bank must confirm the full amount of an obligation issued by its foreign branch. CCC will hold the U.S. bank liable for payment without regard to risks.
(d) If a branch bank confirms an obligation issued by its home office, or by another branch of its home office, it must confirm the full amount thereof. CCC will hold the branch bank liable for payment without regard to risks.
(e) If CCC accepts an agency bank confirmation of a foreign bank obligation, it must be for the full amount thereof without regard to risks and will be subject to such terms and conditions as may be contained in the financing agreement. CCC will not accept an agency bank confirmation of an obligation issued by its home office, or by a branch of its home office.
(f) Except as provided in paragraphs (a), (c), and (d) of this section, if a U.S. bank or a branch bank confirms an obligation issued by a foreign bank, it must confirm at least 10 percent pro rata and must advise the remainder of the foreign bank obligation. The percentage of confirmation shall be the same for both the account receivable and the interest portions of the obligation. For the confirmed amount, except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, CCC will hold the U.S. bank or branch bank liable for commercial risks but not for non-commercial risks. For the advised amount, CCC will not hold the U.S. bank or branch bank liable for commercial or non-commercial risks. CCC will hold the foreign bank liable without regard to risks for all amounts not recovered from the U.S. or branch bank.
(g) Under special circumstances, on application in writing, the Vice President, CCC, may reduce or waive requirements for 10 percent confirmation by a U.S. or branch bank, but a bank will not be relieved of any obligation it undertakes.
(h) Any bank obligation which provides for a bank acceptance of a time draft by CCC (banker's acceptance) shall not be acceptable to CCC.
(i) CCC will consent to cancellation or reduction of a bank obligation to the extent of any payment it receives from other sources or amounts otherwise payable under such bank obligation.
(j) Collection of accounts receivable purchased under GSM-5 will be effected through the issuance by CCC of sight drafts against the bank obligations, but this method of collection shall not be exclusive of any other collection procedures or rights available to CCC.
[42 FR 10999, Feb. 25, 1977, as amended at 42 FR 27569, May 31, 1977; 42 FR 30833, June 17, 1977; 43 FR 45551, Oct. 3, 1978; 44 FR 51187, Aug. 31, 1979]
§ 1488.13
CCC drafts.
CCC will draw one draft for each payment due under bank obligations. If any portion of a CCC draft is dishonored, the U.S. bank or branch bank
shall return the dishonored draft together with its statement of the reason for nonpayment. If a draft which is drawn under a partially confirmed bank obligation is dishonored, CCC will replace the draft with separate drafts for the confirmed and unconfirmed portions at the request of the confirming bank. Such replacement shall not alter the confirming bank's obligation for timely payment to CCC of the confirmed portion of the credit. For confirmed amounts, except as provided in § 1488.12(a), (c) and (d), a U.S. or branch bank may request refund from CCC of the amount paid if it certifies to CCC that it is unable to recover funds from the foreign bank due to a stipulated non-commercial risk which existed on the date payment was made to CCC under the draft. If CCC finds that inability to recover funds was due to such a non-commercial risk, the refund shall be promptly made together with interest at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York discount rate from and including the date payment was originally made to CCC but not include the date of refund by CCC. For unconfirmed amounts, remittance to CCC shall be considered final, and the U.S. bank or branch bank shall not thereafter have recourse to CCC.
[42 FR 10999, Feb. 25, 1977, as amended at 42 FR 27569, May 21, 1977; 42 FR 30833, June 17, 1977]
§ 1488.14
Interest charges.
The account receivable assigned to CCC and the related bank obligation(s) shall bear interest as specified in this section. Rates of interest applicable to financing agreements shall be published in USDA announcement. The interest rate applicable to that portion of an account receivable for which payment is assured by a bank obligation issued or confirmed for all risks according to § 1488.12(a)(ii) or pro rata confirmed by a U.S. bank shall be lower than the interest rate applicable for the remainder of the account receivable. The interest rate applicable to that portion of an account receivable the payment of which is assured by a bank obligation issued or pro rata confirmed by a branch bank shall, when determined by the President or Vice President, CCC after consultation with the Controller, CCC, to be in the interest of CCC, be lower than the interest rate applicable for the remainder of the account receivable. The interest rates applicable to accounts receivable the payment of which is assured by an agency bank confirmation may, when determined by the President or Vice President, CCC, after consultation with the Controller, CCC, to be in the interest of CCC, be lower than the interest rate applicable for the remainder of the account receivable. The interest rate applicable will be the rate in effect on the date CCC receives the sale registration request under § 1488.4. Interest shall accrue on the account receivable from the date of delivery or the weighted average delivery date of the agricultural commodities delivered under the financing agreement to the date of payment, or to the date of expiration of the financing period, or to the date of expiration of the bank obligation, whichever occurs first, and shall be payable as specified in the financing agreement. Thereafter, interest shall accrue on any unpaid part of both the principal and interest due as of such expiration date.
[42 FR 10999, Feb. 25, 1977, as amended at 42 FR 27569, May 31, 1977]
§ 1488.15
Advance payment.
If, before expiration of the financing period, the exporter or the U.S. bank or the agency or branch bank accepts payment from or on behalf of the foreign importer of any part of the account receivable, it shall be remitted promptly to CCC. Such prepayment shall be applied first to interest on the unpaid balance of the account receivable to the date CCC receives such prepayment and then to the principal.
§ 1488.16
Liability for payment.
If delivery is made within the coverage of the bank obligation(s) submitted in accordance with § 1488.8, CCC will look to the obligating bank or banks and the foreign importer, rather than to the exporter or intervening purchaser, for payment of all amounts due at maturity of the account receivable and of the bank obligation(s), but the exporter and the intervening purchaser shall remain liable for any loss arising from breach of any contractual
obligation, certification or warranty made by them pursuant to the financing agreement, and the exporter shall remain liable for any amounts not covered by the bank obligation which are owing to CCC, and any remittance or refund required by § 1488.15 and § 1488.18, together with interest thereon at the rate specified in the documents evidencing the account receivable, as well as for any liquidated damages provided for in § 1488.11. The liability of the bank and the importer under their respective obligations shall be several.

# Miscellaneous Provisions
§ 1488.17
Assignment.
The exporter shall not assign any claim or rights or any amounts payable under the financing agreement, in whole or in part, without written approval of the Vice President, CCC, or the Controller, CCC.
§ 1488.18
Covenant against contingent fees.
The exporter warrants that no person or selling agency has been employed or retained to solicit or secure the financing agreement on an agreement or understanding for a commission, percentage, brokerage, or contingent fee, except bona fide employees or bona fide established commercial or selling agencies maintained by the exporter for the purpose of securing business. For breach or violation of this warranty, CCC shall have the right, without limitation on any other rights it may have, to annul the financing agreement without liability to CCC. Should the financing agreement be annulled, CCC will promptly consent to the reduction or cancellation or related bank obligations except for amounts outstanding under a financing agreement. Such amounts shall, on demand, be refunded to CCC by the exporter.
§ 1488.19
[Reserved]
§ 1488.20
Officials not to benefit.
No member of or delegate to Congress, or Resident Commissioner, shall be admitted to any share or part of the financing agreement or to any benefit that may arise therefrom, but this provision shall not be construed to extend to the financing agreement if made with a corporation for its general benefit.
§ 1488.21
Exporter's records and accounts.
CCC shall have access to and the right to examine any directly pertinent books, documents, papers and records of the exporter involving transactions related to the financed export credit sale until the expiration of three years after the end of the financing period.
§ 1488.22
Communications.
(a) Unless otherwise provided, written requests, notifications, or communications by the applicant pertaining to the financing agreement shall be addressed to the Assistant Sales Manager, Commercial Export Programs, Office of the General Sales Manager, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC 20250.

§ 1489.10
General purpose and scope.
(a) This part sets forth the general terms, conditions, and policies governing the Commodity Credit Corporation's (CCC) operation of the Regional Agricultural Promotion Program (RAPP), which subsumes the former Agricultural Trade Promotion Program (ATP). This program will provide assistance to eligible organizations that conduct market promotion activities, including activities to address existing or potential non-tariff barriers to trade, to promote U.S. agricultural commodities in certain foreign markets. Specific program requirements will be set forth in Notices of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) announced through the
Grants.gov
website.
(b)(1) In addition to the provisions of this part, other regulations of general applicability issued by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), including the regulations set forth in chapter XXX of this title, may apply to the RAPP and RAPP Participants, to the extent that the regulations of general applicability in this paragraph (b)(1) do not directly conflict with the provisions of this part. The regulations include, but are not limited to:
(i) 7 CFR part 1, subpart A.
(ii) 7 CFR part 3.
(iii) 7 CFR part 15, subpart A.
(iv) 2 CFR part 417.
(v) 2 CFR part 418.
(vi) 2 CFR part 421.
(vii) 48 CFR part 31.
(2) In addition, relevant provisions of the CCC Charter Act (15 U.S.C. 714
et seq.
) and any other statutory provisions that are generally applicable to the CCC are also applicable to the RAPP and the regulations set forth in this part.
(3) RAPP Participants must also comply with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and related civil rights regulations and policies.
(4) Other laws and regulations that apply to the RAPP and RAPP Participants include, but are not limited to:
(i) 2 CFR part 25.
(ii) 2 CFR part 170.
(iii) 2 CFR part 175.
(iv) 2 CFR part 180.
(v) 2 CFR part 200.
(vi) 2 CFR part 400.
(vii) 37 CFR 401.1.
(viii) Executive Order 13224, as amended, “Blocking Property and Prohibiting Transactions with Persons Who Commit, Threaten to Commit, or Support Terrorism.”
(c) Under the RAPP, the CCC may provide multi-year grant assistance to eligible U.S. entities to conduct certain marketing and promotion activities, including activities to address existing or potential non-tariff trade barriers, aimed at developing, maintaining, or expanding commercial export markets for U.S. agricultural commodities. RAPP Participants may receive assistance for either generic or brand promotion activities. While activities generally take place overseas, reimbursable activities may also take place in the United States. The CCC expects that all activities that occur in the United States for which RAPP reimbursement is sought will develop, maintain, or expand the commercial export market for the relevant eligible commodity in accordance with the RAPP Participant's approved RAPP program.
(d) The RAPP generally operates on a reimbursement basis.
(e) The CCC's policy is to ensure that benefits generated by RAPP agreements are broadly available throughout the relevant agricultural sector and that no single entity gains an undue advantage. The CCC also endeavors to enter into RAPP agreements covering a broad array of agricultural commodity sectors. The RAPP is administered by personnel of the Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) acting on behalf of the CCC.
§ 1489.11
Definitions.
For purposes of this part the following definitions apply:
Activity
means a specific foreign market development effort undertaken by a RAPP Participant.
Administrative expenses or costs
means expenses or costs of administering, directing, and controlling an organization that is a RAPP Participant. Generally, this would include expenses or costs such as those related to:
(1) Maintaining a physical office (including, but not limited to: rent, office equipment, office supplies, computer hardware and software, office maintenance);

Attaché/Counselor
means the FAS employee representing USDA interests in the foreign country in which promotional activities are conducted.
Brand participant
means a U.S. for-profit entity that owns the brand(s) of the eligible commodity to be promoted (or has the exclusive rights to use such brand(s)) and that is participating in the RAPP brand promotion program of another RAPP Participant. This definition does not include any U.S. agricultural cooperatives.
Brand promotion
means an activity that involves the exclusive or predominant use of a single U.S. company name, or the logo or brand name of a single U.S. company, or the brand of a U.S. agricultural cooperative, or any activity undertaken by a brand participant in a brand program.

a brand owned primarily by foreign interests and being used to market a commodity or product in a foreign market), if the foreign brand uses the promoted eligible commodity from multiple U.S. suppliers. A generic promotion activity may also involve the use of specific U.S. company names, logos, or brand names. However, in that case, the RAPP Participant must ensure that all U.S. companies seeking to promote such eligible commodity in the market have an equal opportunity to participate in the activity and that at least two U.S. companies participate. In addition, an activity that promotes separate items from multiple U.S. companies will be considered a generic promotion only if the promotion of the separate items maintains a unified theme (
i.e.,
a dominant idea or motif) and style and is subordinate to the promotion of the generic theme.
Market

Notification
means a document from the RAPP Participant by which the RAPP Participant proposes to CCC changes to the activities and/or funding levels in an approved RAPP program agreement and/or approval letter.

website announcing that it is accepting applications for participation in the RAPP. Applications shall be submitted in accordance with the terms and requirements specified in the NOFO and in this part. Applicants may apply to conduct a generic promotion program and/or a brand promotion program that provides RAPP funds to brand participants for brand promotion, as well as to conduct other market promotion activities, including activities to address existing or potential non-tariff trade barriers. An applicant that is a U.S. agricultural cooperative may also apply for funds to conduct its own brand promotion program.
(b)
Requests for evaluation information.
CCC may request any information that it deems necessary to evaluate an application, including, but not limited to, performance measurement information. Applicants shall provide any requested information in the manner and according to the timeframe specified by CCC.
(c)
Special rules governing demonstration projects funded with CCC resources.
CCC will consider proposals for demonstration projects, provided:
(1) No more than one such demonstration project per constraint is undertaken within a market;
(2) The constraint to be addressed in the target market is a lack of technical knowledge or expertise;
(3) The demonstration project is a practical and cost-effective method of overcoming the constraint; and
(4) A third party must participate in such project through a written agreement with the RAPP Participant.
(d)
Universal identifier and System for Award Management (SAM).

§ 1489.14
Application review and formation of agreements.
(a)
General.
(1) CCC will review all proposals for eligibility and completeness. CCC will evaluate each eligible proposal against the factors described in the appropriate NOFO to identify those applications that it considers to best meet the criteria and objectives outlined in the NOFO. Based on its review and evaluation, CCC will, subject to the availability of funds, recommend an appropriate funding level for each proposal and submit the proposals and funding recommendations to the appropriate officials for decision. CCC may, when appropriate to the subject matter of the proposal, request the assistance of other U.S. Government experts in evaluating a proposal. All reviewers will be required to sign a conflict-of-interest form, and when conflicts of interests are identified the reviewer will be recused from the objective review process.
(2) When considering applicant organizations, CCC may give priority to those organizations that have the broadest producer representation and affiliated industry participation of the commodity being promoted, as determined by CCC. CCC may require that an applicant participate in the RAPP through another RAPP Participant or applicant.
(3) CCC will approve those applications that it determines best satisfy the criteria and factors specified in the NOFO.
(4) CCC will notify each applicant in writing of the final disposition of its application.
(b)
Formation of agreements.
CCC will send a program agreement (or amendment to an existing program agreement), an approval letter, and a signature card to each approved applicant. The program agreement or amendment and the approval letter will outline which activities and budgets are approved and will specify any special terms and conditions applicable to a RAPP Participant's program, including any requirements with respect to contributions and program evaluations. An applicant that decides to accept the terms and conditions contained in the program agreement or amendment and the approval letter must so indicate by having the appropriate personnel sign the program agreement or amendment and the approval letter and submit these to CCC. Final agreement shall occur when the program agreement or amendment and the approval letter are signed by both parties.
(c)
Signature cards.
The RAPP Participant is encouraged to designate at least two individuals in its organization to sign program agreements and amendments, approval letters, reimbursement claims, and advance requests. The RAPP Participant shall submit the signature card signed by those designated individuals and by the RAPP Participant's Chief Executive Officer (or designee) to CCC. The Participant shall immediately notify CCC in writing of any changes in signatories and shall submit a revised signature card accordingly.
(d)
UES ID and passwords.
CCC will provide each RAPP Participant with IDs and passwords for the UES website, as necessary. RAPP Participants shall immediately notify CCC whenever a person who possesses the ID and password information no longer needs such information, or when a person who is not authorized gains such information.
(e)
Annual certifications.
A RAPP Participant through which U.S. for-profit entities are participating in the RAPP program shall obtain annual certifications from all such entities that certify their size, as defined in this part. The Participant shall retain these certifications in accordance with the recordkeeping requirements of this part.
(f)
Changes to activities and funding
—(1)
Adding a new activity.
(i) A RAPP Participant may not conduct a new activity without first obtaining an approved activity budget for such change. To request approval of such activity budget, the RAPP Participant shall submit a notification to CCC.
(ii) A notification for a new activity shall provide an activity justification and identify any related adjustments to the approved strategic plan, including changes in the market, constraint, or opportunity that the activity proposes to address. The notification shall contain the activity description and the proposed budget.
(iii) After receipt of the notification, CCC will inform the RAPP Participant via the UES website whether the requested budget is approved.
(2)
Modifying existing activities and their funding levels.
(i) A RAPP Participant desiring to increase the funding level for existing, approved activities addressing a single constraint or opportunity by more than $25,000 or 25 percent of the approved funding level, whichever is greater, must first submit a notification explaining the adjustment to CCC before making such change.
(ii) A RAPP Participant may make significant adjustments below $25,000 or 25 percent of the approved funding level, whichever is greater, to the funding levels for existing, approved activities without prior notification to CCC, but only if it submits a notification explaining the adjustments to CCC no later than 30 days after the change. Minor adjustments to existing, approved activities and/or funding levels do not require notification.
(iii) Notifications shall describe the activity, changes to the activity, the existing funding level, the proposed funding level, and a justification for transfer of funds, if applicable.
§ 1489.15
Operational procedures for brand promotion programs.
(a) Where CCC approves an application by a RAPP Participant to run a brand promotion program that will include brand participants, the RAPP Participant shall establish brand program operational procedures. The RAPP Participant shall submit to CCC for approval its proposed brand program operational procedures. CCC will notify all RAPP Participants in writing in each Participant's approval letter as to applicable submission dates for and dates for approvals of brand program operation procedures. Such procedures shall include, at a minimum, a brand program application, application procedures, application review criteria, brand participant eligibility requirements, a participation agreement, reimbursement requirements, compliance requirements, reporting and recordkeeping requirements, employment practices, financial management requirements, contracting procedures, and evaluation requirements. The RAPP Participant must submit to CCC for approval any proposed changes to already approved brand program operational procedures before implementing such proposed changes.
(b) The RAPP Participant shall not enter into any participation agreements with brand participants, nor shall it implement any RAPP brand activities, unless and until CCC has communicated in writing its approval of the proposed operational procedures to the RAPP Participant.
(c) Where CCC approves a RAPP Participant's application to run a brand promotion program that will include brand participants, the RAPP Participant shall enter into participation agreements with brand participants. Brand participants' size may not exceed 300 percent of the applicable small business size standard as found in 13 CFR part 121. These agreements must:
(1) Specify a time period for such brand promotion and require that all brand promotion expenditures be made within the RAPP Participant's approved budget period;
(2) Make no allowance for extension or renewal;
(3) Limit reimbursable expenditures to those made in countries and for activities approved in the brand participant's activity plan;
(4) Specify the percentage of promotion expenditures that will be reimbursed, reimbursement procedures, and documentation requirements;
(5) Include a written certification by the brand participant that it either owns the brand of the product it will promote or has exclusive rights to promote the brand in each of the countries in which promotion activities will occur;
(6) Require that all product labels, promotional material, and advertising will identify the origin of the eligible commodity as “American”, “Product of the United States of America”, “Product of the U.S.”, “Product of the U.S.A.”, “Product of America”, “Grown in the United States of America”, “Grown in the U.S.”, “Grown in the U.S.A.”, “Grown in America”, “Made in the United States of America,” “Made in the U.S.”, “Made in the U.S.A.”, “Made in America”, or product of, grown in or made in any state or territory of the United States of America spelled out in its entirety, or other U.S. regional designation if approved in advance by the CCC; that such origin identification will be conspicuously displayed in a manner easily observed as identifying the origin of the product; and that such origin identification will conform, to the extent possible, to the U.S. standard of
1/6
inch (.42 centimeters) in height based on the lower case letter “o”. The use of the above terms as a descriptor or in the name of the product (
e.g.,
Cincinnati style chili, Gina's American Pizza) does not satisfy the product origin requirement. Phrases “product of”, “grown in” or “made in” are encouraged, but not required. A RAPP Participant that wishes to use an origin statement that varies from those set out in this subsection must submit the proposed statement to CCC for review and must receive approval to use the statement before its use in an activity. A RAPP Participant may request an exemption from this requirement on a case-by-case basis. All such requests shall be in writing and include justification satisfactory to the CCC that the labeling requirement in this paragraph (c)(6) would hinder a RAPP Participant's promotional efforts. CCC will determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether sufficient justification exists to grant an exemption from the labeling requirement. In addition, the CCC may temporarily waive this requirement where the CCC has determined that such labeling will likely harm sales rather than help them. Such determinations will be announced to RAPP Participants via a RAPP notice issued on the FAS website;
(7) Include a written certification by the brand participant that identifies its size on the date of its application for branded program funding, or that it is a U.S. agricultural cooperative;
(8) Require that the brand participant submit to the RAPP Participant a statement certifying that any Federal funds received will supplement, but not supplant, any private or third-party funds or other contributions to program activities; and
(9) Require the brand participant to maintain all original records and documents relating to program activities for three calendar years following the end of the applicable budget period and make such records and documents available upon request to authorized officials of the U.S. Government.
§ 1489.16
Contribution rules.
(a) In RAPP generic promotion programs, a RAPP Participant shall contribute a total amount in goods, services, and/or cash equal to at least 10 percent of the value of resources provided by the CCC for all generic promotion activities undertaken by the RAPP Participant.
(b) In RAPP brand promotion programs, a RAPP Participant conducting its own brand promotion or a brand participant that is participating in the RAPP brand promotion program of another RAPP Participant shall contribute at least 50 percent of the total eligible expenditures submitted in accordance with § 1489.17 made on each approved brand promotion.
(c) A RAPP Participant must use its own funds and may not use RAPP program funds to pay any administrative costs of the RAPP Participant's U.S. office(s), including legal fees, except as

(i) Are necessary and reasonable for accomplishment of an approved activity;
(ii) Are not included as contributions for any other Federal award; and

§ 1489.17
Reimbursement rules.
(a) A RAPP Participant may seek reimbursement for an eligible expenditure if:
(1) The expenditure was necessary and reasonable for the accomplishment of an approved RAPP activity; and
(2) The Participant has not been and will not be reimbursed for such expenditure by any other source.
(b) Subject to paragraphs (a) and (d) of this section, as well as the cost principles in 2 CFR part 200 to the extent these principles do not directly conflict with the provisions of this part, for either brand or generic promotion activities, the CCC will reimburse, in whole or in part, the costs of:
(1) Production and placement of advertising, in print, electronic media, billboards, or posters, which may include advertising the availability of price discounts, except that advertising associated with a coupon or price discount for the RAPP-promoted product is not reimbursable. If advertising is related to both coupons or price discounts for products other than the RAPP Participant's promoted products as well as for RAPP-promoted products, then expenditures for such advertising will not be reimbursed in whole or in part (
e.g.,
expenditures may not be prorated and submitted for reimbursement). Electronic media include, but are not limited to, radio, television, electronic mail, internet, telephone, text messaging, social media, and podcasting.
(2) Production and distribution of banners, recipe cards, table tents, shelf talkers, and other similar point of sale materials.

However, with regard to non-travel expenditures associated with retail, trade and consumer exhibits and shows held inside the United States, such expenditures are reimbursable only if the exhibit or show is: a food or agricultural show with no less than 30 percent of exhibitors selling food or agricultural products; and, an international show that targets buyers, distributors and the like from more than one foreign country and no less than 15 percent of its visitors are from outside the U.S. CCC will compile a list of approved retail, trade and consumer exhibits and shows held inside the United States for which RAPP reimbursement is available, and such list will be announced to RAPP Participants via a RAPP notice issued on FAS' website.
(8) Subject to paragraph (b)(18) of this section, international travel expenditures, not to exceed the full fare economy rate, including any fees for modifying the originally purchased airline ticket, per diem, passports, visas and inoculations, as allowed under the U.S. Federal Travel Regulations (41 CFR parts 301 through 304) and 2 CFR part 200, for no more than two representatives of a single brand participant (or RAPP Participant directly running its own brand program) to exhibit their company's (or cooperative's) products at a retail, trade, or consumer exhibit or show held outside the United States. Representatives may include employees and board members of private companies, employees or members
of cooperatives, or any broker, consultant, or marketing representative contracted by the company or cooperative to represent the company or cooperative in sales transactions. All travel should follow a direct or usually traveled route.
(9) Subscriptions that are of a technical, economic, or marketing nature and that are relevant to the approved activities of the RAPP Participant.
(10) Demonstrators, interpreters, translators, receptionists, and similar temporary workers who help with the implementation of individual promotional activities, such as trade shows, in-store promotions, food service promotions, and trade seminars.
(11) Giveaways, awards, prizes, gifts and other similar promotional materials, subject to such reimbursement limitation as CCC may determine and announce in writing to RAPP Participants via a RAPP notice issued on FAS' website. Reimbursement is available only when:
(i) The items are described in detail with a per unit cost in an approved strategic plan; and
(ii) Distribution of the promotional item is not contingent upon the consumer, or other target audience, purchasing a good or service to receive the promotional item.
(12) The design and production of packaging, labeling or origin identification, to be used during the budget period in which the expenditure is made, if such packaging, labeling or origin identification is necessary to meet the importing requirements of a foreign country.
(13) The design, production, and distribution of coupons for products other than the RAPP Participant's promoted products. If such activities include both coupons or price discounts for products other than the RAPP Participant's promoted products as well as for RAPP-promoted products, then expenditures for such activities will not be reimbursed in whole or in part (
e.g.,
expenditures may not be prorated and submitted for reimbursement).
(14) An audit of a RAPP Participant as required by 2 CFR part 200, subpart F, if the RAPP is the RAPP Participant's largest source of Federal funding.

(i) Trade mission travel for company (or cooperative) representatives was identified as a separate approved activity in the RAPP Participant's UES;
(ii) The trade mission included representatives, as defined in paragraph (b)(8) of this section, from a minimum of five different companies (or cooperatives), and no more than two representatives from each participating company (or cooperative);
(iii) The appropriate FAS overseas office supported the trade mission by dedicating meaningful funding or other resources (such as facilities or staff time) to the activity; and
(iv) The RAPP Participant with the approved brand program produced an itinerary or agenda for the trade mission that demonstrated that company (or cooperative) representatives would be engaged for a minimum of 6 hours per day (except for the first and last days of the mission) in trade mission activities that include, at a minimum, each of the following:
(A) A product showcase where the FAS overseas office approved an invitation list of qualified buyers;
(B) Pre-arranged one-on-one business meetings; and
(C) Evaluation and feedback sessions with FAS staff and trade mission sponsors.
(v) Reimbursement is conditional on the RAPP Participant having notified in writing the Attaché/Counselor in the destination country in advance of the travel to that country or region. All
travel should follow a direct or usually traveled route.
(18) Where USDA has sponsored or endorsed a U.S. pavilion at a retail, trade and consumer exhibit or show, whether held outside or inside the United States, RAPP funds may be used to reimburse the travel and/or non-travel expenditures of only those RAPP Participants located within the U.S. pavilion. Such expenditures must also adhere to the standard terms and conditions of the U.S. pavilion organizer. All travel should follow a direct or usually traveled route. Upon written request, the CCC may temporarily waive this subsection, on a case-by-case basis, where:
(i) The trade show is segregated into product pavilions; or
(ii) A company's distributor or importer is located outside the U.S. pavilion. Such waiver will be provided to the RAPP Participant in writing.
(19) Contracts with U.S.-based organizations when the only contracted service such organizations provide to a RAPP Participant is carrying out a specific market promotion activity in the United States directed to a foreign audience (
e.g.,
a trade mission of foreign buyers coming to the United States to visit U.S. exporters). Such contracts may be reimbursable as a direct promotional expense. If a U.S.-based organization provides administrative services to the RAPP Participant's domestic home office during a budget period, any direct promotional services such organization provides to the Participant, whether for the Participant's domestic or overseas offices, during the same budget period are not reimbursable.
(c) Subject to paragraphs (a) and (d) of this section as well as the cost principles in 2 CFR part 200 to the extent these principles do not directly conflict with the provisions of this part, but for generic promotion activities only, the CCC will also reimburse, in whole or in part, the cost of:
(1) Temporary contractor fees for contractors stationed overseas, except the CCC will not reimburse any portion of any such fee that exceeds the daily gross salary of a GS-15, Step 10 for U.S. Government employees in effect on the date the fee is earned, unless a bidding process reveals that such a contractor is not available at or below that salary rate.
(2) Subject to paragraph (b)(18) of this section, international travel expenditures, not to exceed the full fare economy rate, including any fees for modifying the originally purchased airline ticket, per diem, passports, visas, and inoculations, for activities held outside the United States or in the United States, as allowed under the U.S. Federal Travel Regulations (41 CFR parts 301 through 304) and 2 CFR part 200, except that if the activity is participation in a retail, trade, or consumer exhibit or show held inside the United States, then international travel expenditures are covered only if the exhibit or show is: a food or agricultural show with no less than 30 percent of exhibitors selling food or agricultural products; and, an international show that targets buyers, distributors and the like from more than one foreign country and no less than 15 percent of its visitors are from countries other than the United States. The CCC will compile a list of approved retail, trade, and consumer exhibits and shows held inside the United States for which RAPP reimbursement is available, and such list will be announced to RAPP Participants via a RAPP notice issued on FAS' website.
(i) The CCC generally will not reimburse any portion of air travel, including any fees for modifying the originally purchased ticket, in excess of the full fare economy rate or when the RAPP Participant fails to notify the Attaché/Counselor in the destination country in advance of the travel to that country or region, unless the CCC determines it was impractical to provide such notice. If a traveler flies in business class or a different premium class, the basis for reimbursement will be the full fare economy class rate for the same flight and the RAPP Participant shall provide documentation establishing such full fare economy class rate to support its reimbursement claim. If economy class is not offered for the same flight or if the traveler flies on a charter flight, the basis for reimbursement will be the average of the full fare economy class rate for
flights offered by three different airlines between the same points on the same date, and the RAPP Participant shall provide documentation establishing such average of the full fare economy class rates to support its reimbursement claim.
(ii) In limited circumstances, the RAPP Participant may be reimbursed for air travel up to the business class rate (
i.e.,
a premium class rate other than the first class rate) upon prior written approval by the CCC. Such circumstances are:
(A) Regularly scheduled flights between origin and destination points do not offer economy class (or equivalent) airfare, and the RAPP Participant receives written documentation from its travel agent to that effect at the time the tickets are purchased;
(B) Business class air travel is necessary to accommodate an eligible traveler's disability. Such disability must be substantiated in writing by a physician; and
(C) If an eligible traveler is an employee, contractor, or member of a RAPP participant organization, and the eligible traveler's origin and/or destination are outside of the continental United States and the scheduled flight time, beginning with the scheduled departure time, ending with the scheduled arrival time, and including stopovers and changes of planes, exceeds 14 hours. In such case, per diem and other allowable expenses will also be reimbursable for the day of arrival. However, no expenses will be reimbursable for a rest period or for any non-work days (
e.g.,
weekends, holidays, personal leave, etc.) immediately following the date of arrival.
(D) If an eligible traveler is the target of a market development activity (
e.g.,
a foreign buyer, foreign importer, member of the foreign media), then the RAPP Participant may be reimbursed for air travel up to the business class rate when the eligible traveler's origin and/or destination are outside of the continental United States and the scheduled flight time, beginning with the scheduled departure time, ending with the scheduled arrival time, and including stopovers and changes of planes, exceeds five hours. In such cases, per diem and other allowable expenses will also be reimbursable for the day of arrival. However, no expenses will be reimbursable for a rest period or for any non-work days (
e.g.,
weekends, holidays, personal leave, etc.) immediately following the date of arrival.
(iii) Alternatively, in lieu of reimbursing up to the business class rate in such circumstances noted in paragraphs (c)(2)(ii)(C) and (D) of this section, the CCC will reimburse economy class airfare plus per diem and other allowable travel expenses related to a rest period of up to 24 hours, either
en route
or upon arrival at the destination. For a trip with multiple destinations, each origin/destination combination will be considered separately when applying the 14-hour rule for eligibility of reimbursement of business class travel or rest period expenses.
(iv) A stopover for purposes of this paragraph (c)(2) is the time a traveler spends at an airport, other than the originating or destination airport, which is a normally scheduled part of a flight. A change of planes is the time a traveler spends at an airport, other than the originating or destination airport, to disembark from one flight and embark on another.
(v) All travel under this paragraph (c)(2) should follow a direct or usually traveled route. Under no circumstances should a traveler select flights in a manner that extends the scheduled flight time to beyond 14 hours in part to secure eligibility for reimbursement of business class travel. An eligible traveler that is the target of a market development activity is only eligible for a rest period when that traveler flies in economy class and meets the 14-hour test.
(3) Automobile mileage at the local U.S. Embassy rate or rental cars while in travel status.
(4) Other allowable expenditures while in travel status as authorized by the U.S. Federal Travel Regulations (41 CFR parts 301 through 304) and 2 CFR part 200.
(5) Accident liability insurance premiums for facilities used jointly with third-party participants for RAPP activities or for RAPP-funded travel of third-party participants, provided the types and extent and cost of coverage
are in accordance with the RAPP Participant's policy and sound business practice.
(6) Market research, including research to determine the types of products that are desired in a market.
(7) Legal fees incurred in resolving trade issues with foreign countries.
(8) The sample purchase price, and the cost of transporting samples domestically in the United States to the port of export and then to the first foreign port or first point of entry, for samples of eligible commodities used to provide on-site technical assistance to the trade necessary to facilitate successful use of the relevant eligible commodity by importers. The target of such activity must be the trade, and not consumers, but any product resulting from the technical training can be used to determine consumer preferences.
(9) STRE incurred outside of the United States and STRE incurred within the United States in conjunction with an approved activity where the STRE has a programmatic purpose and are authorized with prior written approval from the CCC. RAPP Participants are required to use the appropriate American Embassy representational funding guidelines for breakfasts, lunches, dinners and receptions incurred outside of the United States as the basis for their calculating eligible expenses. RAPP Participants may exceed Embassy guidelines by up to 25 percent without prior approval. RAPP Participants may only exceed 125 percent of Embassy guidelines when they have received written authorization from the FAS Agricultural Counselor at the Embassy. The amount of unauthorized STRE expenses that exceed 125 percent of the guidelines will not be reimbursed. RAPP Participants must pay the difference between the total cost of STRE events and the appropriate amount as determined by the guidelines and this part. For STRE incurred in the United States, the RAPP Participant should provide, in its request for approval, the basis for determining its proposed expenses.
(10) U.S. office(s) administrative support expenses, incurred specifically to administer the RAPP, for the National Association of State Departments of Agriculture, the SRTGs, and the Intertribal Agriculture Council. The level of such funding will be established in the approval letter.

(f) The CCC will reimburse for expenditures made after the conclusion of a RAPP Participant's period of performance, provided:
(1) The activity was completed prior to the expiration date shown in the RAPP Participant's program agreement; and
(2) All expenditures for the activity were made within 6 months following the expiration date shown in the RAPP Participant's program agreement.

For international travel, the RAPP Participant shall notify the Attaché/Counselor in the destination countries in writing in advance of any proposed travel.
(i) The CCC may determine, at the CCC's discretion, whether any cost not expressly listed in this section will be reimbursed.
§ 1489.18
Reimbursement procedures.
(a) Participants are required to use the CCC's UES system to request reimbursement for eligible expenditures under RAPP.
(b) All claims for reimbursement shall be submitted by the RAPP Participant's U.S. office to the CCC through the UES system.
(c) [Reserved]
(d) The CCC will not reimburse claims submitted later than 6 months after the expiration date shown in the RAPP Participant's program agreement.
(e) If the CCC overpays a reimbursement claim, then the RAPP Participant shall repay the CCC the amount of the overpayment either by submitting a check payable to the CCC or by offsetting its next reimbursement claim. The Participant shall make such payment within 30 calendar days of the date that they discover, or are made aware, of any overpayment. The RAPP Participant shall make such payment in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise approved in advance, in writing, by the CCC.
(f) If a RAPP Participant receives a reimbursement or offsets an advanced payment that is later disallowed, the RAPP Participant shall repay the CCC within 30 days of such disallowance the amount disallowed either by submitting a check payable to the CCC or by offsetting its next reimbursement claim. The RAPP Participant shall make such payment in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise approved in advance, in writing, by the CCC.
(g) RAPP funds may be expended by RAPP Participants only on legitimate, approved activities as set forth in the program agreement and approval letter. If a RAPP Participant discovers that RAPP funds have not been properly spent, it shall notify the CCC and shall within 30 calendar days of its discovery repay the CCC the amount owed either by submitting a check payable to the CCC or by offsetting its next reimbursement claim. The RAPP Participant shall make such payment in U.S. dollars.
(h) The RAPP Participant shall report any actions that may have a bearing on the propriety of any claims for reimbursement in writing to CCC.
§ 1489.19
Advances.
(a)
Policy.
In general, the CCC operates the RAPP on a reimbursable basis.
(b)
Exception.
A RAPP Participant may request an advance of RAPP funds from the CCC for generic promotion activities, provided the RAPP Participant meets the criteria for advance payments in 2 CFR part 200. The CCC will not approve any request for an advance submitted after the expiration date shown in the RAPP Participant's program agreement. At any given time, total payments advanced shall not exceed 40 percent of a RAPP Participant's approved generic activity budget for the budget period. The CCC will not advance funds to a RAPP Participant for brand promotion activities. When approving a request for an advance, the CCC may require the RAPP Participant to carry adequate fidelity bond coverage when the absence of such coverage is considered by the CCC to create an unacceptable risk to the interests of the RAPP. Whether an “unacceptable risk” exists in a particular situation will depend on a number of factors, such as, for example, the Participant's history of performance in RAPP; the Participant's perceived financial stability and resources; and any other factors presented in the particular situation that may reflect on the Participant's responsibility or the riskiness of its activities.
(c)
Interest.
A RAPP Participant shall deposit and maintain in an insured bank account in the United States all funds advanced by the CCC. The account shall be interest-bearing unless the exceptions in 2 CFR part 200 apply. Interest earned by the RAPP Participant on funds advanced by the CCC is not program income. The RAPP Participant shall remit any interest earned on the advanced funds to the appropriate entity as set forth in 2 CFR part 200.
(d)
Refunds due the CCC.
A RAPP Participant shall fully expend all advances on approved generic promotion activities within 90 calendar days after the date the advance was approved in the UES. By the end of the 90 calendar days, the RAPP Participant must submit reimbursement claims to offset the advance or submit a check made payable to CCC for any unexpended balance. The RAPP Participant shall make such payment in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise approved in advance, in writing, by the CCC.
§ 1489.20
Financial management.
(a) A RAPP Participant shall implement and maintain a financial management system that conforms to generally accepted accounting principles. A RAPP Participant's financial management system shall comply with the standards in 2 CFR part 200.
(b) A RAPP Participant shall institute internal controls and provide written guidance to commercial entities participating in its activities to ensure their compliance with this part.
(c) A RAPP Participant shall retain all records concerning a RAPP program transaction for a period of three years after completion of the program transaction and permit the CCC to have full and complete access to such records during the transaction period and for such three-year period after completion of the program transaction. These records shall include all records pertaining to contractors.
(d) A RAPP Participant shall maintain its records of expenditures and contributions in a manner that allows it to provide information by activity plan, country, activity number, and cost category. Such records shall include:
(1) Receipts for all STRE (actual vendor invoices or restaurant checks, rather than credit card receipts);
(2) Original receipts for any other program-related expenditure in excess of a set amount that CCC will determine and announce in writing to all RAPP Participants via a RAPP notice issued on the FAS website. The CCC may, from time to time, set a different minimum amount. In that case, the CCC will announce the new amount in writing to all RAPP Participants via a RAPP notice issued on the FAS website;
(3) The exchange rate used to calculate the dollar equivalent of expenditures made in a foreign currency and the basis for such calculation;
(4) Copies of reimbursement claims;
(5) An itemized list of claims charged to each of the RAPP Participant's CCC resources accounts;
(6) Documentation with accompanying English translation supporting each reimbursement claim, including original evidence to support the financial transactions such as canceled checks, receipted paid bills, contracts or purchase orders, per diem calculations, travel vouchers, and credit memos; and
(7) Documentation supporting contributions. These must include the dates, purpose, and location of the activity for which the cash or in-kind items were claimed as a contribution; who conducted the activity; the participating groups or individuals; and the method of computing the claimed contributions. RAPP Participants must retain and make available for compliance review documentation related to claimed contributions.
(e) Upon request, a RAPP Participant shall provide to the CCC originals of documents supporting reimbursement claims.
§ 1489.21
Reports.
(a)
Contribution report.
Not later than 6 months after the expiration date shown in the RAPP Participant's program agreement, a RAPP Participant shall submit a report that identifies, by cost category and in U.S. dollar equivalent, contributions made by the Participant, the applicable U.S. industry, and the States during the Participant's RAPP period of performance. Foreign third-party contributions are not to be included in the contribution report.
(b)
Trip reports.
Not later than 45 days after completion of travel (other than local travel), a RAPP Participant shall electronically submit a trip report. The report must include the name(s) of the traveler(s), purpose of travel, itinerary, names and affiliations of contacts, and a brief summary of findings, conclusions, recommendations, and specific accomplishments.
(c)
Research reports.
Not later than 6 months after the expiration date shown in the RAPP Participant's program agreement, a RAPP Participant shall submit a report on any research conducted pursuant to the approved RAPP program.
(d)
Evaluation reports.
Not later than 6 months after the expiration date shown in the RAPP Participant's program agreement, a RAPP Participant shall submit a report on any evaluations conducted in accordance with the approved RAPP program, including the
outcome of action taken with RAPP funding and the increased market access or exports that can be directly attributed to the RAPP program.
(e)
Annual audits.
Where the CCC is designated the cognizant agency for audit, the CCC may require the RAPP Participant to submit to the CCC an annual audit in accordance with 2 CFR part 200. If the CCC requires an additional audit with respect to a particular agreement, then the RAPP Participant shall arrange for such audit and shall submit to the CCC, in the manner to be specified by the CCC, such audit of the agreement.
(f)
Additional reports.
The CCC may require the submission of additional reports.
(g)
Approval letters.
A RAPP Participant's program agreement and/or approval letter shall specify to whom the Participant shall submit the reports required in this section.
(h)
Program reviews.
FAS, through its authorized representatives, may review project accomplishments, management control systems, and administration of funding provided through the program to ensure adherence to the requirements in this part. During such reviews, FAS will review recipients' files related to the grant-funded program, and technical assistance may be required.
§ 1489.22
Evaluation.
(a)(1) The Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) of 1993 (5 U.S.C. 306; 31 U.S.C. 1105, 1115-1119, 3515, 9703-9704) requires performance measurement of Federal programs, including the RAPP. Evaluation of the RAPP's effectiveness will depend on a clear statement by Participants of goals to be met within a specified time, schedule of measurable milestones for gauging success, plan for achievement, and assessment of results of activities at regular intervals. The overall goal of the RAPP and of individual Participants' programming is to increase sales that would not have occurred in the absence of RAPP funding. A RAPP Participant that can demonstrate such sales, taking into account extenuating factors beyond the Participant's control, will have met the overall objective of the GPRA and the need for evaluation.
(2) Evaluation is an integral element of program planning and implementation, providing the basis for the strategic plan. The evaluation results guide the development and scope of a RAPP Participant's program, contributing to program accountability and providing evidence of program effectiveness that directly ties program funds to increased sales.
(b) All RAPP Participants must report annual results against their target market and/or regional constraint/opportunity performance measures. These are outcome results usually based on multiple activities and should demonstrate progress made in the market during the latest budget period. This report shall be completed and submitted to the CCC no later than 6 months following the end of each Participant's budget period.
(c) When deemed appropriate or required by the CCC, a RAPP Participant shall complete a program evaluation. A program evaluation is a review of the RAPP Participant's entire program, or an appropriate portion of the program as agreed to by the RAPP Participant and CCC, to determine the effectiveness of the RAPP Participant's strategy in meeting specified goals. Actual scope and timing of the program evaluation shall be determined by the RAPP Participant and CCC and specified in the approval letter. A RAPP Participant shall submit, via a cover letter to CCC, an executive summary that assesses the program evaluation's findings and recommendations, as well as any proposed changes in program strategy or design as a result of the evaluation. A program evaluation shall contain:
(1) The name of the party conducting the evaluation;
(2) The scope of the evaluation;
(3) A concise statement of the market constraint(s)/opportunity(ies) and the goals specified in the approved strategic plan;
(4) A description of the evaluation methodology;
(5) A description of export sales achieved;
(6) A summary of the findings, including an analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the program(s); and
(7) Recommendations for future programs.
(d) When deemed appropriate or required by the CCC, RAPP Participants conducting a branded program must also complete a brand promotion evaluation. A brand promotion evaluation is a review of the U.S. and foreign commercial entities' export sales to determine whether the activity achieved the goals specified in the approved RAPP program. Actual scope and timing of the brand promotion evaluation shall be determined by the RAPP Participant and CCC and specified in the approval letter.
(e) On an annual basis, or more often when appropriate or required by the CCC, a RAPP Participant shall complete and submit program success stories. The CCC will announce to all RAPP Participants in writing the detailed requirements for completing and submitting program success stories.
§ 1489.23
Compliance reviews and notices.
(a) USDA staff may conduct compliance reviews of RAPP Participants' activities under the RAPP program. RAPP Participants shall cooperate fully with relevant USDA staff conducting compliance reviews and shall comply with all requests from USDA staff to facilitate the conduct of such reviews.
(b) Upon conclusion of the compliance review, USDA staff will provide a written compliance report to the RAPP Participant. The compliance report will specify whether USDA staff believe that CCC may be entitled to recover funds from the Participant and/or it appears that the Participant is not complying with any of the terms or conditions of the program agreement, approval letter, or the applicable laws and regulations. The compliance report will explain the basis for any recovery of funds from the Participant. Within 60 calendar days of the date the compliance report cover letter is signed, the RAPP Participant shall repay the CCC the amount owed either by submitting a check payable to the CCC or by offsetting its next reimbursement claim. The RAPP Participant shall make such payment in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise approved in advance, in writing, by the CCC. If, however, a RAPP Participant notifies the CCC within 60 calendar days of the date the compliance report cover letter is signed that the Participant intends to file an appeal pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section, then the amount owed to the CCC by the RAPP Participant is not due until the appeal procedures are concluded and the CCC has made a final written determination as to the amount owed. If, as a result of a compliance review, the CCC determines that further review is needed in order to ensure compliance with the requirements of RAPP, then the CCC may require the Participant to contract for an independent audit.
(c) In addition, the CCC may notify a RAPP Participant in writing at any time if CCC determines that CCC may be entitled to recover funds from the Participant. The CCC will explain the basis for any recovery of funds from the Participant in the written notice. The RAPP Participant shall, within 30 calendar days of the date of the notice, repay the CCC the amount owed either by submitting a check payable to the CCC or by offsetting its next reimbursement claim. The RAPP Participant shall make such payment in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise approved in advance, in writing, by the CCC. If, however, a RAPP Participant notifies the CCC within 30 calendar days of the date of the written notice that the Participant intends to file an appeal pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section, then the amount owed to the CCC by the RAPP Participant is not due until the appeal procedures are concluded and the CCC has made a final determination as to the amount owed.
(d) The fact that a compliance review has been conducted by USDA staff does not signify that a RAPP Participant is in compliance with its program agreement, approval letter, and/or applicable laws and regulations.
(e) For appeals:
(1) A RAPP Participant may, within 60 calendar days of the date of the compliance report or written notice from the CCC, submit a written response to the CCC appealing the report or notice.
CCC, at its discretion, may extend the period for response.
(2) After review of the Participant's response, the CCC shall determine whether the Participant owes any funds to the CCC and will inform the Participant in writing of the basis for the determination. The CCC will initiate action to collect such amount by providing the Participant a written demand for payment of the debt pursuant to Debt Settlement Policies and Procedures, 7 CFR part 3.
(3) Within 30 calendar days of the date of the determination, the Participant may request in writing that the CCC reconsider the determination and shall submit in writing the basis for such reconsideration. The Participant may also request a hearing.
(4) If the Participant requests a hearing, the CCC will set a date and time for the hearing. The hearing will be an informal proceeding. A transcript will not ordinarily be prepared unless the Participant bears the cost of a transcript; however, the CCC may in its discretion have a transcript prepared at the CCC's expense.
(5) The CCC will base its final determination upon information contained in the administrative record. The Participant must exhaust all administrative remedies contained in this section before pursuing judicial review of a determination by the CCC.
§ 1489.24
Failure to make required contribution.
A RAPP Participant's required contribution will be specified in the approval letter. If the RAPP Participant's required contribution is specified as a dollar amount and the RAPP Participant does not contribute a total dollar amount sufficient to make the required contribution, then the RAPP Participant shall pay to the CCC in dollars the difference between the amount actually contributed and the amount specified in the approval letter. If the RAPP Participant's required contribution is specified as a percentage of the total amount reimbursed by the CCC and the RAPP Participant does not provide a dollar amount of contributions sufficient to achieve the specified percentage, then the RAPP Participant may either return to the CCC the amount of funds reimbursed by the CCC to increase its actual contribution percentage to the required level or pay to the CCC in U.S. dollars the difference between the amount actually contributed and the amount of funds necessary to increase its actual contribution percentage to the required level. A RAPP Participant shall remit such payment within six months after the expiration date shown in the RAPP Participant's program agreement. The RAPP Participant shall make such payment in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise approved in advance, in writing, by the CCC.
§ 1489.25
Submissions.
For all permissible methods of delivery, submissions required by this part shall be deemed submitted as of the date received by the CCC.
§ 1489.26
Disclosure of program information.
(a) Documents submitted to CCC by RAPP Participants are subject to the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552, and 7 CFR part 1, subpart A, specifically § 1.12.
(b) Any research conducted by a RAPP Participant pursuant to a RAPP program agreement and/or approval letter shall be subject to the provisions relating to intangible property in 2 CFR part 200.
§ 1489.27
Ethical conduct.
(a) A RAPP Participant shall conduct its business in accordance with the laws and regulations of the country in which an activity is carried out and in accordance with applicable U.S. Federal, State, and local laws and regulations. A RAPP Participant shall conduct its business in the United States in accordance with applicable Federal, State, and local laws and regulations. All RAPP Participants must comply with the regulations in 2 CFR part 200 and this part.
(b) Except for a U.S. agricultural cooperative or a U.S. for-profit entity, neither a RAPP Participant nor its affiliates shall make export sales of eligible commodities covered under the terms of the applicable RAPP agreement. Nor shall such entities charge a
fee for facilitating an export sale. A RAPP Participant may, however, collect check-off funds and membership fees that are required for membership in the RAPP Participant. For the purposes of this paragraph (b),
affiliate
means any partnership, association, company, corporation, trust, or any other such party in which the Participant has an investment other than in a mutual fund.
(c) A RAPP Participant shall not limit participation in its RAPP activities to members of its organization. Participants shall ensure that their RAPP-funded programs and activities are open to all otherwise qualified individuals and entities on an equal basis and without regard to any non-merit factors. The RAPP Participant shall publicize its program and make participation possible for commercial entities throughout the relevant commodity sector or, in the case of SRTGs, throughout the corresponding region. This includes providing to such commercial entities, upon request, a copy of any document in its possession or control containing market information developed and produced under the terms of its RAPP agreement. The Participant may charge a fee not to exceed the costs for assembling, duplicating and distributing the materials. This paragraph (c) does not apply to any U.S. agricultural cooperative when implementing its own brand program.
(d) A RAPP Participant shall select U.S. agricultural industry representatives to participate in generic RAPP activities such as trade teams, sales teams, and trade fairs based on criteria that ensure participation on an equitable basis by a broad cross section of the U.S. industry. If requested by the CCC, a RAPP Participant shall submit such selection criteria to the CCC for approval.
(e) All RAPP Participants should endeavor to ensure fair and accurate fact-based advertising. Deceptive or misleading promotions may result in cancellation or termination of a Participant's RAPP agreement and the recovery of CCC funds related to such promotions from the Participant.
(f) The RAPP Participant must report any actions or circumstances that may have a bearing on the propriety of its RAPP program to the appropriate Attaché/Counselor, and its U.S. office shall report such actions or circumstances in writing to the CCC.
§ 1489.28
Contracting procedures.
(a) Neither the CCC nor any other agency of the U.S. Government nor any official or employee of the CCC, FAS, USDA, or the U.S. Government has any obligation or responsibility with respect to RAPP Participant contracts with third parties.
(b) A RAPP Participant shall comply with the procurement standards set forth in paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section when procuring goods and services and when engaging in construction to implement program agreements.
(c) Each RAPP Participant shall establish contracting procedures, for contracts that are funded, in whole or in part, with RAPP funds, that are open, fair, and competitive.
(d) Each RAPP Participant shall submit to the CCC, for CCC approval, written contracting guidelines for contracts that are funded, in whole or in part, with RAPP funds. The CCC will notify all new and existing RAPP Participants in writing in each Participant's approval letter and through the FAS website as to applicable submission dates for and dates for approvals of contracting guidelines. The CCC's approval of such contracting guidelines will remain in place until the CCC retracts its approval in writing, or until new guidelines are approved that supersede them. Once approved by the CCC, these contracting guidelines shall govern all of a Participant's RAPP-funded contracting involving contracts with a minimum annual value that CCC will determine and announce in writing to all RAPP Participants via a RAPP notice issued on the FAS website. The CCC may, from time to time, set a different minimum value. In that case, the CCC will announce the new amount in writing to all RAPP Participants via a RAPP notice issued on the FAS website. The guidelines shall indicate the method for evaluating proposals received for all contract competitions, the method for monitoring and evaluating performance under contracts, and the method
for initiating corrective action for unsatisfactory performance under contracts. The RAPP Participant may modify and resubmit these guidelines for re-approval at any time. In addition to the requirements in 2 CFR part 200, these guidelines shall include, at a minimum, the following:
(1) Procedures for developing and publicizing requests for proposals, invitations for bids, and similar documents that solicit third party offers to provide goods or services. Solicitations for professional and technical services shall be based on clear and accurate descriptions of and requirements related to the services to be procured. Such procedures must include a conflict-of-interest provision that states that no employee, officer, board member, or agent thereof of the RAPP Participant will participate in the review, selection, award or administration of a contract if a real or apparent conflict of interest would arise. Such a conflict would arise when an employee, official, board member, agent, or the employee's, officer's, board member's, agent's family, partners, or an organization that employs or is about to employ any of the parties indicated in this paragraph (d)(1), has a financial or other interest in the firm selected for an award. Procedures shall provide that officers, employees, board members, and agents thereof shall neither solicit nor accept gratuities, favors, or anything of monetary value from contractors or subcontractors. Procedures shall also provide for disciplinary actions to be applied for violations of such standards by officers, employees, board members or agents thereof;
(2) Procedures for reviewing proposals, bids, or other offers to provide goods and services. Separate procedures shall be developed for various situations, including, but not limited to: solicitations for highly technical services; solicitations for services that are not common in a specific market; solicitations that yield receipt of three or more bids; solicitations that yield receipt of fewer than three bids;
(3) Requirements to conduct all contracting in an openly competitive manner. Individuals who develop or draft specifications, requirements, statements of work, invitations for bids, and/or requests for proposals for procurement of any goods or services, and such individuals' families or partners, or an organization that employs or is about to employ any of the aforementioned, shall be excluded from competition for such procurement. RAPP Participants' written contracting guidelines may detail special situations where the prohibitions in this subparagraph do not apply, such as in situations involving highly specialized technical services or situations where the services are not commonly offered in a specific market;
(4) Requirements to perform and document in the procurement files some form of price or cost analysis, such as a comparison of price quotations to market prices or other price indicia, to determine the reasonableness of the offered prices in connection with every procurement action that is governed by the contracting guidelines;
(5) Requirements to conduct an appropriate form of competition every three years on all multi-year contracts that are governed by the contracting guidelines. However, contracts for in-country representation are not required to be re-competed after the initial award. Instead, the performance of in-country representation must be evaluated and documented by the RAPP Participant annually to ensure that the terms of the contract are being met in a satisfactory manner; and
(6) Requirements for written contracts with each provider of goods, services, or construction work. Such contracts shall require such providers to maintain adequate records to account for funds provided to them by the RAPP Participant.
(e) A RAPP Participant may undertake RAPP promotional activities directly or through a domestic or foreign third party. However, the RAPP Participant shall remain responsible and accountable to the CCC for all RAPP promotional activities and related expenditures undertaken by such third party and shall be responsible for reimbursing CCC for any funds that CCC determines should be refunded to the CCC in relation to such third party's promotional activities and expenditures.
§ 1489.29
Property standards.
The RAPP Participant shall insure all RAPP-funded property and equipment acquired in furtherance of program activities and safeguard such against theft, damage and unauthorized use. The Participant shall promptly report any loss, theft, or damage of property to the insurance company.
§ 1489.30
Anti-fraud requirements.
(a)
All RAPP Participants.
(1) All RAPP Participants shall submit to the CCC for approval a detailed fraud prevention program. The CCC will notify all new and existing RAPP Participants in writing in each Participant's approval letter and through the FAS website as to applicable submission dates for and dates for approvals of fraud prevention programs. RAPP Participants should review their fraud prevention programs annually. The fraud prevention program shall, at a minimum, include an annual review of physical controls and weaknesses, a standard process for investigating and remediation of suspected fraud cases, and training in risk management and fraud detection for all current and future employees. The RAPP Participant shall not conduct or permit any RAPP promotion activities to occur unless and until the CCC has communicated in writing approval of the RAPP Participant's fraud prevention program.
(2) The RAPP Participant, within five business days of receiving an allegation or information giving rise to a reasonable suspicion of misrepresentation or fraud that could give rise to a claim by CCC, shall report such allegation or information in writing to such USDA personnel as specified in the Participant's RAPP program agreement and/or approval letter. The RAPP Participant shall cooperate fully in any USDA investigation of such allegation or occurrence of misrepresentation or fraud and shall comply with any directives given by the CCC or USDA to the RAPP Participant for the prompt investigation of such allegation or occurrence.
(b)
RAPP Participants with brand programs.
(1) The RAPP Participant may charge a fee to brand participants to cover the cost of the fraud prevention program.
(2) The RAPP Participant shall repay to the CCC funds paid to a brand participant through the RAPP Participant on claims that the RAPP Participant or the CCC subsequently determines are unauthorized or otherwise non-reimbursable expenses within 30 days of the RAPP Participant's determination or CCC's disallowance. The RAPP Participant shall repay CCC by submitting a check to CCC or by offsetting the RAPP Participant's next reimbursement claim. The RAPP Participant shall make such payment in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise approved in advance by CCC. A RAPP Participant operating a brand program in strict accordance with an approved fraud prevention program, however, will not be liable to reimburse CCC for RAPP funds paid on such claims if the claims were based on misrepresentations or fraud of the brand participant, its employees or agents, unless the CCC determines that the RAPP Participant was grossly negligent in the operation of the brand program regarding such claims. The CCC shall communicate any such determination to the RAPP Participant in writing.
§ 1489.31
Program income.
Any revenue or refunds generated from an activity,
e.g.,
participation fees, proceeds of sales, refunds of value added taxes (VAT), the expenditures for which have been wholly or partially reimbursed with RAPP funds, shall be used by the RAPP Participant in furtherance of its approved RAPP activities in the budget period during which the RAPP funds are available for obligation by the RAPP Participant. The use of such revenue or refunds shall be governed by this part. Interest earned on funds advanced by the CCC is not program income.
§ 1489.32
Amendment.
A program agreement may be amended in writing with the written consent of the CCC and the RAPP Participant.
§ 1489.33
Noncompliance with an agreement or this part.
If a RAPP Participant fails to comply with any term in its program agreement or approval letter, or this part, the CCC may take one or more of
the enforcement actions in 2 CFR part 200 and, if appropriate, initiate a claim against the RAPP Participant, following the procedures set forth in this part. The CCC may also initiate a claim against a RAPP Participant if program income or CCC-provided funds are lost due to an action or omission of the RAPP Participant.
§ 1489.34
Suspension, termination, and closeout of agreements.
A program agreement may be suspended or terminated in accordance with the suspension and termination procedures in 2 CFR part 200. If an agreement is terminated, the applicable regulations in 2 CFR part 200 will apply to the closeout of the agreement.
§ 1489.35
Paperwork reduction requirements.
The paperwork and record keeping requirements imposed by this part have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. The control number for this information collection is 0551-0049.

§ 1491.3
Definitions.
The following definitions will apply to this part, and all documents issued in accordance with this part, unless specified otherwise:
Agricultural uses
are defined by the State's FRPP or equivalent, or where no program exists. Agricultural uses should be defined by the State agricultural use tax assessment program. However, if NRCS finds that a State definition of agriculture is so broad that an included use could lead to the degradation of soils and agriculture productivity, NRCS reserves the right to impose greater deed restrictions on the property than allowable under that State definition of agriculture in order to protect agricultural use and related conservation values.
Certified entity
means an eligible entity that NRCS has determined to meet the requirements of § 1491.4(d) of this part.
Chief
means the Chief of NRCS or designee.
Commodity Credit Corporation
is a government-owned and operated entity that was created to stabilize, support, and protect farm income and prices. The CCC is managed by a Board of Directors, subject to the general supervision and direction of the Secretary of Agriculture, who is an ex-officio director and chairperson of the Board. The CCC provides the funding for FRPP, and NRCS administers FRPP on its behalf.
Conservation easement
means a voluntary, legally recorded restriction, in the form of a deed, on the use of property, in order to protect resources such as agricultural lands, historic structures, open space, and wildlife habitat.
Conservation plan
is the document that—
(1) Applies to highly erodible cropland;
(2) Describes the conservation system applicable to the highly erodible cropland and describes the decisions of the person with respect to location, land use, tillage systems, and conservation treatment measures and schedules;
(3) Is developed by NRCS in consultation with the landowner through the local soil conservation district, in consultation with the local committees, established under section 8(b)(5) of the Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act (16 U.S.C. 5909h(b)(5)) and the Secretary, or by the Secretary.
Cooperative agreement
means the document that specifies the obligations and rights of NRCS and eligible entities participating in the program.
Dedicated fund
means an account held by a nongovernmental organization which is sufficiently capitalized for the purpose of covering expenses associated with the management, monitoring, and enforcement of conservation easements and where such account cannot be used for other purposes.
Eligible entity
means Indian Tribe, State government, local government, or a nongovernmental organization which has a farmland protection program that purchases agricultural conservation easements for the purpose of protecting agriculture use and related conservation values by limiting conversion to non-agricultural uses of the land.
Eligible land
means privately owned land on a farm or ranch that NRCS has determined to meet the requirements of § 1491.4(f) of this part.
Fair market value
means the value of a conservation easement as ascertained through standard real property appraisal methods, as established in § 1491.4(g).
Farm and ranch land of local importance
means farm or ranch land used to produce food, feed, fiber, forage, bio-fuels, and oilseed crops that are not identified as having national or statewide importance. Where appropriate, these lands are to be identified by the local agency or agencies concerned.
Farmlands of local importance may include tracts of land that have been designated for agriculture by local ordinance.
Farm and ranch land of statewide importance
means, in addition to prime and unique farmland, land that is of statewide importance for the production of food, feed, fiber, forage, bio-fuels, and oil seed crops. Criteria for defining and delineating this land are to be determined by the appropriate State agency or agencies. Generally, additional farmlands of statewide importance include those that are nearly prime farmland and that economically produce high yields of crops when treated and managed according to acceptable farming methods. Some may produce as high a yield as prime farmlands if conditions are favorable. In some States, additional farmlands of statewide importance may include tracts of land that have been designated for agriculture by State law in accordance with 7 CFR part 657.
Farm or ranch succession plan
means a general plan to address the continuation of some type of agricultural business on the conserved land. The farm or ranch succession plan may include specific intra-family succession agreements or strategies to address business asset transfer planning to create opportunities for beginning farmers or ranchers.
Field Office Technical Guide
means the official local NRCS source of resource information and interpretations of guidelines, criteria, and requirements for planning and applying conservation practices and conservation management systems.

Examples of such crops include citrus, tree nuts, olives, cranberries, fruits, and vegetables. Additional information on the definition of prime, unique, or other productive soil can be found in 7 CFR part 657 and 7 CFR part 658.
§ 1491.4
Program requirements.
(a) Under FRPP, the Chief, on behalf of the CCC, will facilitate and provide funding for the purchase of conservation easements or other interests in eligible land that is subject to a pending offer from an eligible entity for the purpose of protecting the agricultural use and related conservation values of the land by limiting non-agricultural uses of the land. Eligible entities submit applications to NRCS State offices to partner with NRCS to acquire conservation easements on farm and ranch land. NRCS enters into cooperative agreements with selected entities and provides funds for up to 50 percent of the fair market value of the easement. In return, the eligible entity agrees to acquire, hold, manage, and enforce the easement. A Federal right of enforcement must also be included in each FRPP funded easement deed for the protection of the Federal investment.
(b) The term of all easements or other interests in land will be in perpetuity unless prohibited by State law. In States that limit the term of the easement or other interest in land, the term of the easement or other interest in land must be the maximum allowed by State law.
(c) To be eligible to receive FRPP funding, an Indian Tribe, State, unit of local government, or a nongovernmental organization must meet the definition of eligible entity as listed in § 1491.3. In addition, eligible entities interested in receiving FRPP funds must demonstrate:
(1) A commitment to long-term conservation of agricultural lands;
(2) A capability to acquire, manage, and enforce easements;
(3) Sufficient number of staff dedicated to monitoring and easement stewardship; and
(4) The availability of funds.
(d) To be considered for certification, an entity must submit a written request for certification to NRCS, and must:
(1) Meet the requirements identified in paragraph (c) of this section;
(2) Use or agree to use for FRPP funded acquisitions, the Uniform Standards for Professional Appraisal Practice or the Uniform Appraisal Standards for Federal Land Acquisitions in conducting appraisals;
(3) Hold, manage, and monitor a minimum of 25 agricultural land conservation easements, unless the entity requests and receives a waiver of this requirement from the Chief;
(4) Hold, manage, and monitor a minimum of five FRPP or Farmland Protection Program conservation easements;
(5) Have the demonstrated ability to complete acquisition of easements in a timely fashion;
(6) Have the capacity to enforce the provisions of easement deeds;
(7) For nongovernmental organizations, possess a dedicated fund for the purposes of easement management, monitoring, and enforcement where such fund is sufficiently capitalized in accordance with NRCS standards. The dedicated fund must be dedicated to the purposes of managing, monitoring, and enforcing each easement held by the eligible entity;
(8) Be willing to adjust procedures to ensure that the conservation easements acquired meet FRPP purposes and are enforceable; and
(9) Have a plan for administering easements enrolled under this part, as determined by the Chief.
(e) NRCS will notify an entity in writing whether they have been certified and the rationale for the agency's decision. Once NRCS determines an entity qualifies as certified:
(1) NRCS will enter into a cooperative agreement with the certified entity through which NRCS may obligate funding for up to 5 years. New parcels or prior-year unfunded parcels submitted for funding by certified entities must compete for funding each year. Selected parcels and funding will be added to the existing cooperative agreement using an amendment to the cooperative agreement. Funding expiration dates for the added parcels will be in the amendment to the cooperative agreement;
(2) NRCS will accept applications from certified entities continuously throughout the fiscal year;
(3) Certified entities may elect to close easements without NRCS approving the conservation easement deeds, titles, or appraisals before closing;
