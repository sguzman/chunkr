refers to title 40, part 700, section 17.

# Explanation
The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
Title 1 through Title 16
as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27
as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41
as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50
as of October 1
The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.

# LEGAL STATUS
The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

# HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, July 1, 2025), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

# EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.

# OMB CONTROL NUMBERS
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request.
Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.

# PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.

# “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.

# INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
What is incorporation by reference?
Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
What is a proper incorporation by reference?
The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
(b) The matter incorporated is adequately summarized in the preamble of the final rule and is available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?
If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or email fr.inspection@nara.gov.

# CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES
A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR
Index and Finding Aids.
This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.
An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

# REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

(b)
Identifying manufacturers subject to fees
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of identifying manufacturers subject to fees for section 4 test rules and section 6 EPA-initiated risk evaluations, EPA will publish a preliminary list of manufacturers identified through a review of data sources described in paragraph (b)(2) of this subsection; provide an opportunity for public comment; and publish a final list specifying the manufacturers responsible for payment.
(2)
Data sources.
To compile the preliminary list, EPA will rely on information submitted to the Agency (such as the information submitted under sections 5(a), 8(a), 8(b), and to the Toxics Release Inventory) as well as other information available to the Agency, including publicly available information or information submitted to other agencies to which EPA has access. To be able to include the most recent CDR data and to account for annual or other typical fluctuations in manufacturing, EPA will use the five most recent years of data submitted or available to the Agency to develop the preliminary list.
(3)
Publication of preliminary list.
(i) For risk evaluations initiated by EPA under section 6, the preliminary list will be published at the time of final designation of the chemical substance as a High-Priority Substance.
(ii) For test rules under section 4, the preliminary list will be published with the proposed test rule.
(4)
Public comment period.
Following publication of the preliminary list, EPA will provide a period of public comment that is no less than 30 days.
(5)
Self-identification.
All manufacturers other than those listed in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) through (iii) and (a)(3)(i) through (iii) of this section who have manufactured (including imported) the chemical substance in the previous five years must submit notice to EPA, irrespective of whether they are included in the preliminary list specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. The notice must be submitted electronically via EPA's Central Data Exchange (CDX), the Agency's electronic reporting portal, using the Chemical Information Submission System (CISS) reporting tool, and must contain the following information:
(i)
Contact information.
The name and address of the submitting company, the name and address of the authorized official for the submitting company, and the name and telephone number of a person who will serve as technical contact for the submitting company and who will be able to answer questions about the information submitted by the company to EPA.
(ii)
Certification of cessation.
If a manufacturer has manufactured in the five-year period preceding publication of the preliminary list but has ceased manufacture prior to the certification cutoff dates identified in paragraph (b)(6) of this section and will not manufacture the substance again in the successive five years, the manufacturer
may submit a certification statement attesting to these facts. If EPA receives such a certification statement from a manufacturer, the manufacturer will not be included in the final list of manufacturers described in paragraph (b)(7) of this section and will not be obligated to pay the fee under this section.
(iii)
Certification of no manufacture.
If a manufacturer is identified on the preliminary list but has not manufactured the chemical in the five-year period preceding publication of the preliminary list, the manufacturer may submit a certification statement attesting to these facts. If EPA receives such a certification statement from a manufacturer, the manufacturer will not be included in the final list of manufacturers described in paragraph (b)(7) of this section and will not be obligated to pay the fee under this section.
(iv)
Certification of meeting exemption.
If a manufacturer is identified on the preliminary list and exclusively meets one or more of the exemptions as described in paragraph (a)(2) or (a)(3) of this section, the manufacturer must submit a certification statement attesting to these facts in order to not be included in the final list of manufacturers described in paragraph (b)(7) of this section. If a manufacturer is not on a preliminary list and exclusively meets one or more of the exemptions as described in paragraph (a)(2) or (a)(3) of this section, the manufacturer may submit a certification statement attesting to these facts. If EPA receives such a certification statement from a manufacturer, the manufacturer will not be included in the final list of manufacturers described in paragraph (b)(7) of this section and will not be obligated to pay the fee under this section, unless all manufacturers of that chemical substance meet the exemption as described in (a)(2)(vi) or (a)(3)(vi) of this section.
(v)
Production volume.
If a manufacturer has not submitted certification of cessation, as described in paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section, or certification of no manufacture, as described in paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this section, for purposes of identifying manufacturers subject to fees for TSCA section 6 EPA-initiated risk evaluations and does not meet one or more of the exemptions in paragraph (a)(3)(i) through (v) of this section, the manufacturer must submit their production volume as defined in 40 CFR 700.43 for the applicable substance for the three calendar years prior to publication of the preliminary list. Only production volume reported to EPA prior to the final list being published will be used in determining fees described in § 700.45(f).
(6)
Certification cutoff date.
(i) For a section 6 EPA-initiated risk evaluation, the cutoff date for purposes of paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section is the day prior to initiation of the prioritization process for the applicable chemical substance.
(ii) For a section 4 test rule, the cutoff date for purposes of paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section is the day prior to publication of the proposed test rule for the applicable chemical substance.
(7)
Publication of final list.
EPA expects to publish a final list of manufacturers to identify the specific manufacturers subject to the applicable fee. This list will indicate if additional manufacturers self-identified pursuant to paragraph (b)(5) of this section, if other manufacturers were identified through credible public comment, and if manufacturers submitted certification of cessation, no manufacture, or meeting exemption pursuant to paragraph (b)(5)(ii), (iii), or (iv) of this section. The final list will be published no later than concurrently with the final scope document for risk evaluations initiated by EPA under TSCA section 6, and with the final test rule for test rules under TSCA section 4. EPA may modify the list after the publication of the final list.
(8)
Effect of final list.
Manufacturers who are listed on the final list are subject to the applicable fee identified in paragraph (c) of this section.
(9)
Identifying manufacturers for other fee categories.
For Section 4 Test Orders and enforceable consent agreements, and Section 6 Manufacturer-Requested Risk Evaluations, EPA will not conduct the identification process described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (8) of this section, as manufacturers self-identify through a submission or are already otherwise known to Agency.
However, those manufacturers are required to provide an information submission to EPA for the purposes of fee administration. The notice must be submitted electronically via the Agency's electronic reporting software (
e.g.,
Central Data Exchange (CDX)) and must contain the manufacturers: Full name, address, telephone number and email address. Timing of this submission must be as follows:
(i) For section 4 test orders and enforceable consent agreements, the informational submission in this paragraph (b)(9) must be provided within 30 days following notification from EPA.
(ii) For section 6 manufacturer-requested risk evaluations, the informational submission in this paragraph (b)(9) is required as part of the procedural process for making such requests, and must be completed at the time of making the request.
(10)
Recordkeeping.

I = Producer Price Index for Chemicals and Allied Products inflation value with 2024 as a base year.
(2) Updated fee amounts for PMNs, SNUNs, MCANs, exemption notices, exemption applications, and manufacturer-requested risk evaluation requests apply to submissions received by the Agency on or after October 1 of every three-year fee adjustment cycle beginning in fiscal year 2024 (October 1, 2023). Updated fee amounts also apply to test rules, test orders, enforceable consent agreements and EPA-initiated risk evaluations that are “noticed” on or after October 1 of every three-year fee adjustment cycle, beginning in fiscal year 2026.
(3) The Agency will initiate public consultation through notice-and-comment rulemaking prior to making fee adjustments beyond inflation. If it is determined that no additional adjustment is necessary beyond for inflation, EPA will provide public notice of the inflation-adjusted fee amounts through posting to the Agency's web page by the beginning of each three-year fee adjustment cycle (October 1, 2026, October 1, 2029, etc.). If the Agency determines that adjustments beyond inflation are necessary, EPA will provide public notice of that determination and the process to be followed to make those adjustments.
(e)
No fee required.
Persons are exempt from remitting any fee for Tier I exemption submissions under § 725.424 and polymer exemption reports submitted under § 723.250 of this chapter.
(f)
Multiple parties, including joint submitters and consortia.
(1) Joint submitters of a TSCA section 5 notice are required to remit the applicable fee identified in paragraph (c) of this section for each section 5 notice submitted. Only one fee is required for each submission, regardless of the number of joint submitters for that notice. To qualify for the fee identified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, each joint submitter of a TSCA section 5 notice must qualify as a small business concern under § 700.43 of this chapter.
(2) Any consortium formed to split the cost of the applicable fee under section 4 of the Act is required to remit the appropriate fee identified in paragraph (c) of this section for each test rule, test order, or enforceable consent agreement regardless of the number of manufacturers and/or processors in that consortium. For the consortium to qualify for the fee identified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, each person in the consortium must qualify as a small business concern under § 700.43 of this chapter. Failure to submit fee payment pursuant to this paragraph, or to provide notice of failure to reach agreement pursuant to paragraph (f)(2)(v) of this section constitutes a violation by each consortium member.
(i) The consortium must identify a principal sponsor and provide notification to EPA that a consortium has formed. The notification must be accomplished within 90 days of the publication date of a test rule under section 4 of the Act, or within 90 days of the effective date of a test order under section 4 of the Act, or within 90 days of the signing of an enforceable consent agreement under section 4 of the Act. EPA may permit additional entities to join an existing consortium after the expiration of the notification period if the principal sponsor provides updated notification.
(ii) Notification must be submitted electronically via the Agency's electronic reporting software—Central Data Exchange (CDX)—and include the following information:
(A) Full name, address, telephone number and signature of principal sponsor;
(B) Name(s) and contact information for each manufacturer and/or processor associating with the consortium.
(iii) It is up to the consortium to determine how fees will be split among the persons in the consortium.
(iv) Consortia are strongly encouraged to set lower fees for small business concerns participating in the consortium.
(v) If a consortium is unable to come to terms on how fees will be split among the persons in the consortium, the principal sponsor must notify EPA in writing before the end of the notification period in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section.
(vi) If a consortium provides notice to EPA under paragraph (f)(2)(v) of this section that they failed to reach agreement on payment, EPA will assess fees to all persons as individuals described under paragraph (f)(4) of this section.
(3) Any consortium formed to split the cost of the applicable fee supporting a risk evaluation under section 6(b) of the Act is required to remit the appropriate fee identified in paragraph (c) of this section for each risk evaluation, regardless of the number of manufacturers in that consortium. For the consortium to qualify for the fee identified in paragraph (c)(1)(vii) of this section, each person in the consortium must qualify as a small business concern under § 700.43 of this chapter. Failure to provide notice or submit fee payment pursuant to this paragraph (f)(3) constitutes a violation by each consortium member.
(i) Notification must be provided to EPA that a consortium has formed. The notification must be accomplished within 90 days of the publication of the final scope of a chemical risk evaluation under section 6(b)(4)(D) of the Act or within 90 days of EPA providing notification to a manufacturer that a manufacturer-requested risk evaluation has been granted. EPA may permit additional entities to join an existing consortium after the expiration of the notification period if the principal sponsor provides updated notification.
(ii) Notification must be submitted electronically via the Agency's electronic reporting software—Central Data Exchange (CDX)—and include the following information:
(A) Full name, address, telephone number and signature of principal sponsor;
(B) Name(s) and contact information for each manufacturer and/or processor associating with the consortium.
(iii) It is up to the consortium to determine how fees will be split among the persons in the consortium.
(iv) Consortia are strongly encouraged to set lower fees for small business concerns participating in the consortium.
(v) If a consortium is unable to come to terms on how fees will be split among the persons in the consortium, the principal sponsor must notify EPA in writing before the end of the notification period in paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section.
(vi) If a consortium provides notice to EPA under paragraph (f)(3)(v) of this section that they failed to reach agreement on payment, EPA will assess fees to all persons as individuals as described under paragraph (f)(4) of this section.
(4) If multiple persons are subject to fees triggered by section 4 or 6(b) of the Act and no consortium is formed, EPA will determine the portion of the total applicable fee to be remitted by each person subject to the requirement.
(i) Each person's share of the applicable fees triggered by section 4 of the Act specified in paragraph (c) of this section shall be in proportion to the total number of manufacturers and/or processors of the chemical substance, with lower fees for small businesses:

ER21FE24.001
(iii) Remaining manufacturers (
i.e.,
those that do not qualify as a small business concern) are then ranked in ascending order (from lowest to highest) based on reported production volume as described in § 700.45(b)(v). Each remaining manufacturer is assigned a number with 1 for lowest production volume, 2 for second lowest production volume, etc.

(iv) In the event there are three or less manufacturers identified for a chemical substance, EPA will distribute the fee evenly among those three or less fee payers, regardless of production volume.
(v) In the event the number assigned to the top 20th percentile is not an integer, EPA will round to the nearest integer to determine the manufacturer(s) with the reported production volume as described in § 700.45(b)(v) greater than or equal to the top 20th percentile.
(vi) In the event multiple manufacturers report the same production volume as described in § 700.45(b)(v) and are greater than or equal to the top 20th percentile, EPA will include all manufacturers with that same production volume in the fee calculation for the top 20th percentile group.
(5) If multiple persons are subject to fees triggered by section 4 of the Act and some inform EPA of their intent to form a consortium while others choose not to associate with the consortium, EPA will take the following steps to allocate fee amounts:
(i) Count the total number of manufacturers, including the number of manufacturers within any consortia; divide the total fee amount by the total number of manufacturers; and allocate equally on a per capita basis to generate a base fee;
(ii) Provide all small businesses who are either not associated with a consortium, or associated with an all- small business consortium, with an 80% discount from the base fee referenced previously;
(iii) Calculate the total remaining fee and total number of remaining manufacturers by subtracting out the discounted fees and the number of small businesses identified;
(iv) Reallocate the remaining fee across those remaining individuals and groups in equal amounts, counting each manufacturer in a consortium as one person; and
(v) Inform consortia and individuals of their requisite fee amount. Small businesses in a successfully-formed consortium, other than a consortium of all small businesses, will not be afforded the 80% discount by EPA, but consortia managers are strongly encouraged to provide a discount for small business concerns.
(6) If multiple persons are subject to fees triggered by section 6(b) of the Act and some inform EPA of their intent to form a consortium while others choose not to associate with the consortium, EPA will take the following steps to allocate fee amounts:
(i) Count the total number of manufacturers, including the number of manufacturers within any consortia; divide the total fee amount by the total number of manufacturers; and allocate equally on a per capita basis to generate a base fee;
(ii) Provide all small businesses who are either not associated with a consortium, or associated with an all-small business consortium, with an 80% discount from the base fee referenced previously;
(iii) Calculate the total remaining fee and total number of remaining manufacturers by subtracting out the discounted fees and the number of small businesses identified;
(iv) Place remaining manufacturers in ascending order (from lowest to highest) based on reported production volume as described in § 700.45(b)(v). Assign each remaining manufacturer a number with 1 for lowest production volume, 2 for second lowest production volume, etc.;
(v) Determine the manufacturer(s) in the top 20th percentile by multiplying the total number of remaining manufacturers by 0.8. then comparing that number to the manufacturer(s) with that assigned number as described in paragraph (f)(6)(iv) of this section;
(vi) Reallocate 80% of the total remaining fee evenly across that manufacturer(s) with a production volume amount equal to or larger than that manufacturer(s) (the top 20th percentile), counting each manufacturer in a consortium as one person;
(vii) Reallocate the remaining fee evenly across the remaining manufacturers, counting each manufacturer in a consortium as one person; and
(viii) Inform consortia and individuals of their requisite fee amount. Small businesses in a successfully formed consortium, other than a consortium of all small businesses, will not be afforded the 80% discount by EPA, but consortia managers are strongly encouraged to provide a discount for small business concerns.

§ 702.1
General provisions.
(a)
Purpose.
This regulation establishes the risk-based screening process for designating chemical substances as a High-Priority Substance or a Low-Priority Substance for risk evaluation as required under section 6(b) of the Toxic Substances Control Act, as amended (15 U.S.C. 2605(b)).
(b)
Scope of designations.
EPA will make priority designations pursuant to these procedures for a chemical substance, not for a specific condition or conditions of uses of a chemical substance.
(c)
Categories of chemical substances.
Nothing in this subpart shall be interpreted as a limitation on EPA's authority under 15 U.S.C. 2625(c) to take action, including the actions contemplated in this subpart, on a category of chemical substances.
(d)
Prioritization timeframe.
The Agency will publish a final priority designation for a chemical substance in no fewer than 9 months and no longer than 1 year following initiation of prioritization pursuant to § 702.7.
(e)
Metals or metal compounds.
EPA will identify priorities for chemical substances that are metals or metal compounds in accordance with 15 U.S.C. 2605(b)(2)(E).
(f)
Applicability.
These regulations do not apply to any chemical substance for which a manufacturer requests a risk evaluation under 15 U.S.C. 2605(b)(4)(C).
(g)
Scientific standards and weight of the scientific evidence.
EPA's proposed priority designations under § 702.9 and final priority designations under § 702.11 will be consistent with the scientific standards provision in 15 U.S.C. 2625(h) and the weight of the scientific evidence provision in 15 U.S.C. 2625(i).
(h)
Interagency collaboration.
EPA will consult with other relevant Federal Agencies during the administration of this subpart.
§ 702.3
Definitions.
For purposes of this subpart, the following definitions apply:
Act
means the Toxic Substances Control Act, as amended (15 U.S.C. 2601
et seq.
).
Conditions of use
means the circumstances, as determined by the Administrator, under which a chemical substance is intended, known, or reasonably foreseen to be manufactured, processed, distributed in commerce, used, or disposed of.
EPA
means the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
High-priority substance
means a chemical substance that EPA determines,
without consideration of costs or other non-risk factors, may present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment because of a potential hazard and a potential route of exposure under the conditions of use, including an unreasonable risk to potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulations identified as relevant by EPA.
Low-priority substance
means a chemical substance that EPA concludes, based on information sufficient to establish, without consideration of costs or other non-risk factors, does not meet the standard for a High-Priority Substance.
Potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulation
means a group of individuals within the general population identified by the Administrator who, due to either greater susceptibility or greater exposure, may be at greater risk than the general population of adverse health effects from exposure to a chemical substance or mixture, such as infants, children, pregnant women, workers, or the elderly.
Reasonably available information
means information that EPA possesses or can reasonably generate, obtain and synthesize for use, considering the deadlines specified in 15 U.S.C. 2605(b) for prioritization and risk evaluation. Information that meets such terms is reasonably available information whether or not the information is confidential business information that is protected from public disclosure under 15 U.S.C. 2613.
§ 702.4
[Reserved]
§ 702.5
Candidate selection.
(a)
General objective.
In selecting candidates for a High-Priority Substance designation, it is EPA's general objective to select those chemical substances with the greatest hazard and exposure potential first, considering reasonably available information on the relative hazard and exposure of potential candidates. In selecting candidates for Low-Priority Substance designation, it is EPA's general objective to select those chemical substances with hazard and/or exposure characteristics under the conditions of use such that a risk evaluation is not warranted at the time to determine whether the chemical substance presents an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment, including an unreasonable risk to potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulations identified as relevant by EPA.
(b)
Available information.
EPA expects to ensure that there is reasonably available information to meet the deadlines for prioritization under the Act.
(c)
Preferences and TSCA work plan.
In selecting a candidate for prioritization as a High-Priority Substance, EPA will:
(1) Give preference to:
(i) Chemical substances that are listed in the 2014 update of the TSCA Work Plan for Chemical Assessments as having a persistence and bioaccumulation score of 3; and
(ii) Chemical substances that are listed in the 2014 update of the TSCA Work Plan for Chemical Assessments that are known human carcinogens and have high acute and chronic toxicity; and
(2) Identify a sufficient number of candidates from the 2014 update of the TSCA Work Plan for Chemical Assessments to ensure that, at any given time, at least 50 percent of risk evaluations being conducted by EPA are drawn from that list until all substances on the list have been designated as either a High-Priority Substance or Low-Priority Substance pursuant to § 702.11.
(d)
Purpose.
The purpose of the preferences and criteria in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section is to inform EPA's decision whether or not to initiate the prioritization process pursuant to § 702.7, and the proposed designation of the chemical substance as either a High-Priority Substance or a Low-Priority Substance pursuant to § 702.9.
(e)
Insufficient information.
If EPA believes it would not have sufficient information for purposes of prioritization, EPA generally expects to obtain the information necessary to inform prioritization prior to initiating the process pursuant to § 702.9, using voluntary means of information gathering and, as necessary, exercising its
authorities under the Act in accordance with the requirements of 15 U.S.C. 2603, 15 U.S.C. 2607, and 15 U.S.C. 2610. In exercising its authority under 15 U.S.C. 2603(a)(2), EPA will identify the need for the information in accordance with 15 U.S.C. 2603(a)(3).
§ 702.7
Initiation of prioritization process.
(a) EPA generally expects to initiate the prioritization process for a chemical substance only when it believes that the information necessary to prioritize the substance is reasonably available.
(b) EPA will initiate prioritization by publishing a notice in the
Federal Register
identifying a chemical substance for prioritization. EPA will include a general explanation in this notice for why it chose to initiate the process on the chemical substance.
(c) The prioritization timeframe in § 702.1(d) begins upon EPA's publication of the notice described in paragraph (b) of this section.
(d) Publication of the notice in the
Federal Register
pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section will initiate a period of 90 days during which interested persons may submit relevant information on that chemical substance. Relevant information might include, but is not limited to, any information that may inform the screening review conducted pursuant to § 702.9(a). EPA will open a separate docket for each chemical substance to facilitate receipt of information.
(e) EPA may, in its discretion, extend the public comment period in paragraph (d) of this section for up to three months in order to receive or evaluate information submitted under 15 U.S.C. 2603(a)(2)(B). The length of the extension will be based upon EPA's assessment of the time necessary for EPA to receive and/or evaluate information submitted under 15 U.S.C. 2603(a)(2)(B).
§ 702.9
Screening review and proposed priority designation.
(a)
Screening review.
Following the close of the comment period described in § 702.7(d), including any extension pursuant to paragraph (e) of that section, EPA will generally use reasonably available information to screen the candidate chemical substance against the following criteria and considerations:
(1) The chemical substance's hazard and exposure potential;
(2) The chemical substance's persistence and bioaccumulation;
(3) Potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulations;
(4) Storage of the chemical substance near significant sources of drinking water;
(5) The chemical substance's conditions of use or significant changes in conditions of use;
(6) The chemical substance's production volume or significant changes in production volume; and
(7) Other risk-based criteria that EPA determines to be relevant to the designation of the chemical substance's priority.
(b)
Information sources.
In conducting the screening review in paragraph (a) of this section, EPA expects to consider sources of information relevant to the listed criteria and consistent with the scientific standards provision in 15 U.S.C. 2625(h), including, as appropriate, sources for hazard and exposure data listed in Appendices A and B of the TSCA Work Plan Chemicals: Methods Document (February 2012).
(c)
Proposed designation.
Based on the results of the screening review in paragraph (a) of this section, relevant information received from the public as described in § 702.7(d), and other information as appropriate and consistent with 15 U.S.C. 2625(h) and (i), EPA will propose to designate the chemical substance as either a High-Priority Substance or Low-Priority Substance, along with an identification of the information, analysis, and basis used to support the proposed designation.
(d)
Costs and non-risk factors.
EPA will not consider costs or other non-risk factors in making a proposed priority designation.
(e)
Insufficient information.
If information remains insufficient to enable the proposed designation of the chemical substance as a Low-Priority Substance after any extension of the initial public comment period pursuant to § 702.7(e), EPA will propose to designate the chemical substance as a High-Priority Substance.
(f)
Conditions of use.
EPA will propose to designate a chemical substance as a High-Priority Substance based on the proposed conclusion that the chemical substance satisfies the definition of High-Priority Substance in § 702.3 under one or more activities that the Agency determines constitute conditions of use. EPA will propose to designate a chemical substance as a Low-Priority Substance based on the proposed conclusion that the chemical substance meets the definition of Low-Priority Substance in § 702.3 under the activities that the Agency determines constitute conditions of use.
(g)
Publication.
EPA will publish the proposed designation in the
Federal Register,
along with an identification of the information, analysis and basis used to support a proposed designation, in a form and manner that EPA deems appropriate, and provide a comment period of 90 days, during which time the public may submit comment on EPA's proposed designation. EPA will open a docket to facilitate receipt of public comment.
§ 702.11
Final priority designation.
(a) After considering any additional information collected from the proposed designation process in § 702.9, as appropriate, EPA will finalize its designation of a chemical substance as either a High-Priority Substance or a Low-Priority Substance consistent with 15 U.S.C. 2625(h) and (i).
(b) EPA will not consider costs or other non-risk factors in making a final priority designation.
(c) EPA will publish each final priority designation in the
Federal Register,
along with an identification of the information, analysis, and basis used to support a final designation consistent with 15 U.S.C. 2625(h), (i) and (j). For High-Priority Substance designations, EPA generally expects to indicate which condition(s) of use were the primary basis for such designations.
(d) As required in 15 U.S.C. 2605(b)(3)(C), EPA will finalize a designation for at least one High-Priority Substance for each risk evaluation it completes, other than a risk evaluation that was requested by a manufacturer pursuant to subpart B of this part. The obligation in 15 U.S.C. 2605(b)(3)(C) will be satisfied by the designation of at least one High-Priority Substance where such designation specifies the risk evaluation that the designation corresponds to, and where the designation occurs within a reasonable time before or after the completion of the risk evaluation.
§ 702.13
Revision of designation.
EPA may revise a final designation of a chemical substance from Low-Priority to High-Priority Substance at any time based on reasonably available information. To revise such a designation, EPA will re-initiate the prioritization process on that chemical substance in accordance with § 702.7, re-screen the chemical substance and propose a priority designation pursuant to § 702.9, and finalize the priority designation pursuant to § 702.11.
§ 702.15
Effect of designation as a low-priority substance.
Designation of a chemical substance as a Low-Priority Substance under § 702.11 means that a risk evaluation of the chemical substance is not warranted at the time, but does not preclude EPA from later revising the designation pursuant to § 702.13, if warranted. Designation as a Low-Priority Substance is not a finding that the chemical substance does not present an unreasonable risk, but rather that it does not meet the High-Priority Substance definition.
§ 702.17
Effect of designation as a high-priority substance.
Final designation of a chemical substance as a High-Priority Substance under § 702.11 initiates a risk evaluation pursuant to subpart B of this part. Designation as a High-Priority Substance is not a final agency action and is not subject to judicial review until the date of promulgation of the associated final rule under section 6(a). Designation as a High-Priority Substance is not a finding that the chemical substance presents an unreasonable risk.

(a)
Considerations.
(1) EPA will use applicable EPA guidance when conducting risk evaluations, as appropriate and where it represents the best available science.
(2) EPA will document that the risk evaluation is consistent with the best available science and based on the weight of the scientific evidence. In determining best available science, EPA shall consider as applicable:
(i) The extent to which the scientific information, technical procedures, measures, methods, protocols, methodologies, or models employed to generate the information are reasonable for and consistent with the intended use of the information;
(ii) The extent to which the information is relevant for the Administrator's use in making a decision about a chemical substance or mixture;
(iii) The degree of clarity and completeness with which the data, assumptions, methods, quality assurance, and analyses employed to generate the information are documented;
(iv) The extent to which the variability and uncertainty in the information, or in the procedures, measures, methods, protocols, methodologies, or models, are evaluated and characterized; and
(v) The extent of independent verification or peer review of the information or of the procedures, measures, methods, protocols, methodologies or models.
(3) EPA will ensure that all supporting analyses and components of the risk evaluation are suitable for their intended purpose, and tailored to the problems and decision at hand, in order to inform the development of a technically sound determination as to whether a chemical substance presents an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment under the conditions of use, based on the weight of the scientific evidence.
(4) EPA will not exclude conditions of use from the scope of the risk evaluation, but a fit-for-purpose approach may result in varying types and levels of analysis and supporting information for certain conditions of use, consistent with paragraph (b) of this section. The extent to which EPA will refine its evaluations for one or more condition of use in any risk evaluation will vary as necessary to determine whether a chemical substance presents an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment.
(5) EPA will evaluate chemical substances that are metals or metal compounds in accordance with 15 U.S.C. 2605(b)(2)(E).
(b)
Information and information sources.
(1) EPA will base each risk evaluation on reasonably available information.
(2) EPA will apply systematic review methods to assess reasonably available information, as needed to carry out risk evaluations that meet the requirements in TSCA section 26(h) and (i), in a manner that is objective, unbiased, and transparent.
(3) EPA may determine that certain information gaps can be addressed through application of assumptions, uncertainty factors, models, and/or screening to conduct its analysis with respect to the chemical substance, consistent with 15 U.S.C. 2625. The approaches used will be determined by the quality of reasonably available information, the deadlines specified in
TSCA section 6(b)(4)(G) for completing the risk evaluation, and the extent to which the information reduces uncertainty.
(4) EPA expects to use its authorities under the Act, and other information gathering authorities, when necessary to obtain the information needed to perform a risk evaluation for a chemical substance before initiating the risk evaluation for such substance. EPA will also use such authorities during the performance of a risk evaluation to obtain information as needed and on a case-by-case basis to ensure that EPA has adequate, reasonably available information to perform the evaluation. Where appropriate, to the extent practicable, and scientifically justified, EPA will require the development of information generated without the use of new testing on vertebrates.
(5) Among other sources of information, EPA will also consider information and advice provided by the Science Advisory Committee on Chemicals established pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 2625(o).
§ 702.39
Components of risk evaluation.
(a)
In general.
Each risk evaluation will include all of the following components:
(1) A Scope;
(2) A Hazard Assessment;
(3) An Exposure Assessment;
(4) A Risk Characterization; and
(5) A Risk Determination.
(b)
Scope of the risk evaluation.
The scope of the risk evaluation will include all the following:
(1) The condition(s) of use the EPA expects to consider in the risk evaluation.
(2) The potentially exposed populations, including any potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulations as identified as relevant to the risk evaluation by EPA under the conditions of use that EPA plans to evaluate.
(3) The ecological receptors that EPA plans to evaluate.
(4) The hazards to health and the environment that EPA plans to evaluate.
(5) A description of the reasonably available information and scientific approaches EPA plans to use in the risk evaluation.
(6) A conceptual model that describes the actual or predicted relationships between the chemical substance, its associated conditions of use through predicted exposure scenarios, and the identified human and environmental receptors and human and ecological health hazards.
(7) An analysis plan that includes hypotheses and descriptions about the relationships identified in the conceptual model and the approaches and strategies EPA intends to use to assess exposure and hazard effects, and to characterize risk; and a description, including quality, of the data, information, methods, and models, that EPA intends to use in the analysis and how uncertainty and variability will be characterized.
(8) EPA's plan for peer review consistent with § 702.41.
(c)
Hazard assessment.
(1) The hazard assessment process includes the identification, evaluation, and synthesis of information to describe the potential health and environmental hazards of the chemical substance under the conditions of use.
(2) Hazard information related to potential health and environmental hazards of the chemical substance will be reviewed in a manner consistent with best available science based on the weight of scientific evidence and all assessment methods will be documented.
(3) Consistent with § 702.37(b), information evaluated may include, but would not be limited to: Human epidemiological studies, in vivo and/or in vitro laboratory studies, biomonitoring and/or human clinical studies, ecological field data, read across, mechanistic and/or kinetic studies in a variety of test systems. These may include but are not limited to: toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics (
e.g.,
physiological-based pharmacokinetic modeling), and computational toxicology (
e.g.,
high-throughput assays, genomic response assays, data from structure-activity relationships, in silico approaches, and other health effects modeling).
(4) The hazard information relevant to the chemical substance will be evaluated for identified human and environmental receptors, including all identified potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulation(s) determined
to be relevant, for the exposure scenarios relating to the conditions of use.
(5) The relationship between the dose of the chemical substance and the occurrence of health and environmental effects or outcomes will be evaluated.
(6) Hazard identification will include an evaluation of the strengths, limitations, and uncertainties associated with the reasonably available information.
(d)
Exposure assessment.
(1) Where relevant, the likely duration, intensity, frequency, and number of exposures under the conditions of use will be considered.
(2) Exposure information related to potential human health or ecological hazards of the chemical substance will be reviewed in a manner consistent with best available science based on the weight of scientific evidence and all assessment methods will be documented.
(3) Consistent with § 702.37(b), information evaluated may include, but would not be limited to: chemical release reports, release or emission scenarios, data and information collected from monitoring or reporting, release estimation approaches and assumptions, biological monitoring data, workplace monitoring data, chemical exposure health data, industry practices with respect to occupational exposure control measures, and exposure modeling.
(4) Chemical-specific factors, including, but not limited to physical-chemical properties and environmental fate and transport parameters, will be examined.
(5) The human health exposure assessment will consider all potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulation(s) determined to be relevant.
(6) Environmental health exposure assessment will characterize and evaluate the interaction of the chemical substance with the ecological receptors and the exposures considered, including populations and communities, depending on the chemical substance and the ecological characteristic involved.
(7) EPA will describe whether sentinel exposures under the conditions of use were considered and the basis for their consideration.
(8) EPA will consider aggregate exposures to the chemical substance, and, when supported by reasonably available information, consistent with the best available science and based on the weight of scientific evidence, include an aggregate exposure assessment in the risk evaluation, or will otherwise explain in the risk evaluation the basis for not including such an assessment.
(9) EPA will assess all exposure routes and pathways relevant to the chemical substance under the conditions of use, including those that are regulated under other federal statutes.
(e)
Risk characterization.
(1)
Requirements.
To characterize the risks from the chemical substance, EPA will:
(i) Integrate the hazard and exposure assessments into quantitative and/or qualitative estimates relevant to specific risks of injury to health or the environment, including any potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulations identified, under the conditions of use;
(ii) Not consider costs or other non-risk factors; and
(iii) Describe the weight of the scientific evidence for the identified hazards and exposures.
(2)
Summary of considerations.
EPA will summarize, as applicable, the considerations addressed throughout the evaluation components, in carrying out the obligations under 15 U.S.C. 2625(h). This summary will include, as appropriate, a discussion of:
(i)
Considerations regarding uncertainty and variability.
Information about uncertainty and variability in each step of the risk evaluation (
e.g.,
use of default assumptions, scenarios, choice of models, and information used for quantitative analysis) will be integrated into an overall characterization and/or analysis of the impact of the uncertainty and variability on estimated risks. EPA may describe the uncertainty using a qualitative assessment of the overall strength and limitations of the data and approaches used in the assessment.
(ii)
Considerations of data quality.
A discussion of data quality (
e.g.,
reliability, relevance, and whether methods employed to generate the information are reasonable for and consistent with the intended use of the information), as well as assumptions used, will
be included to the extent necessary. EPA also expects to include a discussion of the extent of independent verification or peer review of the information or of the procedures, measures, methods, protocols, methodologies, or models used in the risk evaluation.
(iii)
Considerations of alternative interpretations.
If appropriate and relevant, where alternative interpretations are plausible, a discussion of alternative interpretations of the data and analyses will be included.
(iv)
Additional considerations for environmental risk.
For evaluation of environmental risk, it may be necessary to discuss the nature and magnitude of the effects, the spatial and temporal patterns of the effects, implications at the individual, species, population, and community level, and the likelihood of recovery subsequent to exposure to the chemical substance.
(f)
Risk determination.
(1) As part of the risk evaluation, EPA will make a single determination as to whether the chemical substance presents an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment, without consideration of costs or other non-risk factors, including an unreasonable risk to a potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulation, under the conditions of use.
(2) In determining whether unreasonable risk is presented, EPA's consideration of occupational exposure scenarios will take into account reasonably available information, including known and reasonably foreseen circumstances where subpopulations of workers are exposed due to the absence or ineffective use of personal protective equipment. EPA will not consider exposure reduction based on assumed use of personal protective equipment as part of the risk determination.
(3) EPA will determine whether a chemical substance does or does not present an unreasonable risk after considering the risks posed under the conditions of use and, where EPA makes a determination of unreasonable risk, EPA will identify the conditions of use that significantly contribute to such determination.
§ 702.41
Peer review.
EPA will conduct peer review activities on risk evaluations conducted pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 2605(b)(4)(A). EPA expects such activities, including decisions regarding the appropriate scope and type of peer review, to be consistent with the applicable peer review policies, procedures, and methods in guidance promulgated by the Office of Management and Budget and EPA, and in accordance with 15 U.S.C. 2625(h) and (i).
§ 702.43
Risk evaluation actions and timeframes.
(a)
Draft scope.
(1) For each risk evaluation to be conducted, EPA will publish a document that specifies the draft scope of the risk evaluation EPA plans to conduct and publish a notice of availability in the
Federal Register.
The document will address the elements in § 702.39(b).
(2) EPA generally expects to publish the draft scope during the prioritization process concurrent with publication of a proposed designation as a High-Priority Substance pursuant to § 702.9(g), but no later than 3 months after the initiation of the risk evaluation process for the chemical substance.

The circumstances under which EPA will undertake substantive revisions to scope and risk evaluation documents are as follows:
(1)
Draft documents.
To the extent there are changes to a draft scope or draft risk evaluation, EPA will describe such changes in the final document.
(2)
Final scope.
To the extent there are changes to the scope of the risk evaluation after publication of the final scope document, EPA will describe such changes in the draft risk evaluation, or, where appropriate and prior to the issuance of a draft risk evaluation, may make relevant information publicly available in the docket and publish a notice of availability of that information in the
Federal Register
.
(3)
Final risk evaluation.
For any chemical substance for which EPA has already finalized a risk evaluation, EPA will generally not revise, supplement, or reissue a final risk evaluation without first undergoing the procedures at § 702.7 to re-initiate the prioritization process for that chemical substance, except where EPA has determined it to be in the interest of protecting human health or the environment to do so, considering the statutory responsibilities and deadlines under 15 U.S.C. 2605.
(4)
Process for revisions to final risk evaluations.
Where EPA determines to revise or supplement a final risk evaluation pursuant to paragraph (g)(3) of this section, EPA will follow the same procedures in this section including publication of a new draft and final risk evaluation and solicitation of public comment in accordance with §§ 702.43(c) and (d), and peer review, as appropriate, in accordance with § 702.41.

EPA process for reviewing requests.
(1)
Public notification of receipt of request.
Within 15 days of receipt of a manufacturer-requested risk evaluation, EPA will notify the public that such request has been received.
(2)
Initial review for completeness.
EPA will determine whether the request appears to meet the requirements specified in this section (
i.e.,
complete), or whether the request appears to not have met the requirements specified in this section (
i.e.,
incomplete). EPA will notify the requesting manufacturer of the outcome of this initial review. For requests initially determined to be incomplete, EPA will cease review, pending actions taken by the requesting manufacturer pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section. For requests initially determined to be complete, EPA will proceed to the public notice and comment process described in paragraph (e)(3) of this section.
(3)
Public notice and comment.
No later than 90 days after initially determining a request to be complete pursuant to paragraph (e)(2) of this section, EPA will submit for publication the receipt of the request in the
Federal Register,
open a docket for that request and provide no less than a 60-day public comment period. The docket will contain the CBI sanitized copies of the request and all supporting information. The notice will encourage the public to submit comments and information relevant to the manufacturer-requested risk evaluation, including, but not limited to, identifying information not provided in the request, information the commenter believes necessary to conduct a risk evaluation, and any other information relevant to the conditions of use.
(4)
Secondary review for sufficiency.
Within 90 days following the end of the comment period in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, EPA will further consider whether public comments highlight deficiencies in the request not identified during EPA's initial review, and/or that the available information is not sufficient to support a reasoned evaluation. EPA will notify the requesting manufacturer of the outcome of this review. For requests determined to not
be supported by sufficient information, EPA will cease review, pending actions taken pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section. For requests determined to be supported by sufficient information, EPA will proceed with request review process in accordance with paragraph (e)(5) of this section.
(5)
Grant.
Where EPA determines a request to be complete and sufficiently supported in accordance with paragraphs (e)(2) and (4) of this section, and subject to the percentage limitations in TSCA section 6(b)(4)(E)(i)(II), EPA will grant the request. A grant does not mean that EPA has all information necessary to complete the risk evaluation.
(6)
Publication of draft conditions of use and request for information.
EPA will publish a notice in the
Federal Register
that identifies draft conditions of use, requests relevant information from the public, and provides no less than a 60-day public comment period. Within 90 days following the close of the public comment period in this paragraph, EPA will determine whether further information is needed to carry out the risk evaluation and notify the requesting manufacturer of its determination, pursuant to paragraph (e)(7) of this section. If EPA determines at this time that no further information is necessary, EPA will initiate the risk evaluation, pursuant to paragraph (e)(9) of this section.
(7)
Identification of information needs.
Where additional information needs are identified, EPA will notify the requesting manufacturer and set a reasonable amount of time, as determined by EPA, for response. In response to EPA's notice, and subject to the limitations in paragraph (g) of this section, the requesting manufacturer may:
(i)
Provide the necessary information.
EPA will set a reasonable amount of time, as determined by EPA, for the requesting manufacturer to produce or develop and produce the information. Upon receipt of the new information, EPA will review for sufficiency and make publicly available to the extent possible, including CBI-sanitized copies of that information; or
(ii)
Withdraw the risk evaluation request.
Fees to be collected or refunded shall be determined pursuant to paragraph (k) of this section and 40 CFR 700.45; or
(iii)
Request that EPA obtain the information using authorities under TSCA sections 4, 8 or 11.
The requesting manufacturer must provide a rationale as to why the information is not reasonably ascertainable to them. EPA will review and provide notice of its determination to the requesting manufacturer. Upon receipt of the information, EPA will review the additional information for sufficiency and provide additional public notice.
(8)
Unfulfilled information needs.
In circumstances where there have been additional data needs identified pursuant to paragraph (e)(7) of this section that are not fulfilled, because the requesting manufacturer is unable or unwilling to fulfill those needs in a timely manner, the requesting manufacture has produced information that is insufficient as determined by EPA, or EPA determines that a request to use TSCA authorities under section 4, 8 or 11 is not warranted, EPA may deem the request to be constructively withdrawn under paragraph (e)(7)(ii) of this section.
(9)
Initiation of the risk evaluation.
Within 90 days of the end of the comment period provided in paragraph (e)(6) of this section, or within 90 days of EPA determining that information identified and received pursuant to paragraph (e)(7) of this section is sufficient, EPA will initiate the requested risk evaluation and follow all requirements in this subpart, including but not limited to §§ 702.37 through 702.43 and §§ 702.47 through 702.49 of this subpart, and notify the requesting manufacturer and the public. Initiation of the risk evaluation does not limit or prohibit the Agency from identifying additional data needs during the risk evaluation process.
(f)
Incomplete or insufficient request.
Where EPA has determined that a request is incomplete or insufficient pursuant to paragraph (e)(2) or (4) of this section, the requesting manufacturer may supplement and resubmit the request. EPA will follow the process described in paragraph (e) of this section as it would for a new request.
(g)
Withdrawal of request.
The requesting manufacturer may withdraw a
request at any time prior to EPA's grant of such request pursuant to paragraph (e)(5) of this section, or in accordance with paragraph (e)(7) of this section and subject to payment of applicable fees. The requesting manufacturer may not withdraw a request once EPA has initiated the risk evaluation. EPA may deem a request constructively withdrawn in the event of unfulfilled information needs pursuant to paragraph (e)(8) of this section or non-payment of fees as required in 40 CFR 700.45. EPA will notify the requesting manufacturer and the public of the withdrawn request.
(h)
Data needs identified post-initiation.
Where EPA identifies additional data needs after the risk evaluation has been initiated, the requesting manufacturer may remedy the deficiency pursuant to paragraph (e)(7)(i) or (iii) of this section.
(i)
Supplementation of original request.
At any time prior to the end of the comment period described in paragraph (e)(6) of this section, the requesting manufacturer(s) may supplement the original request with any new information that becomes available to the requesting manufacturer(s). At any point prior to the completion of a manufacturer-requested risk evaluation pursuant to this section, the requesting manufacturer(s) must supplement the original request with any information that meets the criteria in 15 U.S.C. 2607(e) and this section, or with any other reasonably ascertainable information that has the potential to change EPA's risk evaluation. Such information must be submitted consistent with 15 U.S.C. 2607(e) if the information is subject to that section or otherwise within 30 days of when the requesting manufacturer(s) obtain the information.
(j)
Limitations on manufacturer-requested risk evaluations.
(1)
In general.
EPA will initiate a risk evaluation for all requests from manufacturers for non-TSCA Work Plan Chemicals that meet the criteria in this subpart, until EPA determines that the number of manufacturer-requested chemical substances undergoing risk evaluation is equal to 25% of the High-Priority Substances identified in subpart A as undergoing risk evaluation. Once that level has been reached, EPA will initiate at least one new manufacturer-requested risk evaluation for each manufacturer-requested risk evaluation completed so long as there are sufficient requests that meet the criteria of this subpart, as needed to ensure that the number of manufacturer-requested risk evaluations is equal to at least 25% of the High-Priority substances risk evaluations and not more than 50%.
(2)
Preferences.
In conformance with § 702.35(c), in evaluating requests for TSCA Work Plan Chemicals and requests for non-TSCA Work Plan chemicals, EPA will give preference to requests for risk evaluations on chemical substances:
(i) First, for which EPA determines that restrictions imposed by one or more States have the potential to have a significant impact on interstate commerce, health or the environment; and then
(ii) Second, based on the order in which the requests are received.
(k)
Fees.
Manufacturers must pay fees to support risk evaluations as specified under 15 U.S.C. 2605(b)(4)(E)(ii), and in accordance with 15 U.S.C. 2625(b) and 40 CFR 700.45. In the event that a request for a risk evaluation is withdrawn by the requesting manufacturer pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section, the total fee amount due will be either, in accordance with 40 CFR 700.45(c)(2)(x) or (xi) (as adjusted by 40 CFR 700.45(d) when applicable), 50% or 100% of the actual costs expended in carrying out the risk evaluation as of the date of receipt of the withdrawal notice. The payment amount will be determined by EPA, and invoice or refund issued to the requesting manufacturer as appropriate.
§ 702.47
Interagency collaboration.
During the risk evaluation process, not to preclude any additional, prior, or subsequent collaboration, EPA will consult with other relevant Federal agencies.
§ 702.49
Publicly available information.
For each risk evaluation, EPA will maintain a public docket at
https://www.regulations.gov
to provide public
access to the following information, as applicable for that risk evaluation:
(a) The draft scope, final scope, draft risk evaluation, and final risk evaluation;
(b) All notices, determinations, findings, consent agreements, and orders;
(c) Any information required to be provided to EPA under 15 U.S.C. 2603;
(d) A nontechnical summary of the risk evaluation;
(e) A list of the studies, with the results of the studies, considered in carrying out each risk evaluation;
(f) Any final peer review report, including the response to peer review and public comments received during peer review;
(g) Response to public comments received on the draft scope and the draft risk evaluation; and
(h) Where unreasonable risk to workers is identified via inhalation, EPA's calculation of a risk-based occupational exposure value.

§ 703.1
Purpose and applicability.
(a) The purpose of this part is to describe procedures for asserting and maintaining confidentiality claims in accordance with TSCA section 14, and for EPA review of such claims. The procedures described in this part are generally applicable to the submission and EPA review of any TSCA submission, except to the extent that application of the requirements would be inconsistent with TSCA section 14(i). The procedures include requirements concerning the form and manner in which TSCA submissions must be made to meet requirements in TSCA sections 14(b) and (c), to facilitate EPA review of such claims in accordance with TSCA sections 14(f) and (g), and to facilitate disclosure of non-confidential information to the public in accordance with TSCA, FOIA, and their implementing regulations.
(b) This part applies to all information that is reported to or otherwise obtained by EPA pursuant to TSCA or its implementing regulations. This includes information that was first obtained by EPA other than pursuant to the authority of TSCA or its implementing regulations, provided that the following two criteria have been met:
(1) EPA has authority to collect the information under TSCA; and
(2) Either:
(i) Subsequent to its submission the information is being used to satisfy the obligation of a person under TSCA or its implementing regulations; or
(ii) EPA makes use of the information in the course of carrying out its responsibilities under TSCA (e.g., EPA considered such information in its actions under TSCA sections 4, 5, or 6).
(c)(1) This part applies regardless of the following:
(i) Whether the information is intended by its submitter to be used by EPA in implementing TSCA;
(ii) Whether TSCA or an implementing regulation was cited as authority for the request or submission of the information; or
(iii) Whether the information was provided directly to EPA or through some third person.
(2) However, where such information is not protected from disclosure under TSCA Section 14, but the statute under which the information was originally provided to EPA limits disclosure for reasons other than business confidentiality (for example, limited disclosure of pesticide data to multinational pesticide producers under 7 U.S.C. 136h(g)), the disclosure limitation in the statute under which the information was obtained by EPA continues to apply, except where TSCA expressly requires disclosure of that information.
(d) The provisions of 40 CFR part 2, subpart B, apply to this section, as modified by 40 CFR 2.306.
§ 703.3

[88 FR 37166, June 7, 2023, as amended at 89 FR 102789, Dec. 18, 2024]
§ 703.5
Requirements for asserting and maintaining confidentiality claims.
Any person who submits information under TSCA or these implementing regulations may assert a business confidentiality claim to information included in such submission except where such a claim is disallowed by applicable regulation under this subchapter. Such claim must be made concurrent with submission of the information. If no such claim accompanies the submission, EPA will not recognize a confidentiality claim, and the information in or referred to in that submission may be made available to the public (e.g., by publication of specific chemical name and CASRN on the public portion of the TSCA Inventory) without further notice.
(a)
Supporting statement and certification.
(1) A person asserting a confidentiality claim must submit a statement that the person has:
(i) Taken reasonable measures to protect the confidentiality of the information;
(ii) Determined that the information is not required to be disclosed or otherwise made available to the public under any other Federal law;
(iii) A reasonable basis to conclude that disclosure of the information is likely to cause substantial harm to the competitive position of the person; and
(iv) A reasonable basis to believe that the information is not readily discoverable through reverse engineering.
(2) The person must also certify that these four statements and any information required to substantiate the confidentiality claim in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section are true and correct.
(b)
Substantiation.
(1) Confidentiality claims must be substantiated at the time of submission to EPA, unless exempt under paragraph (b)(5) of this section. In the case of information collected by EPA or on behalf of EPA in person at the site of a TSCA inspection under section 11 of the Act, the affected company must assert its confidentiality claim(s) in writing at the time the information is collected, and then must provide substantiation of its confidentiality claims and the supporting statement and certification described in paragraph (a) of this section within ten business days after the inspection ends. Confidentiality claims lacking required substantiation after ten business days will be treated as deficient under paragraph (e) of this section. Unless otherwise directed by EPA, such information or materials must be submitted via CDX. In the case of an unusually voluminous document collection under section 11 of the Act, the affected company may request additional time to assert claims and provide substantiation, which EPA may grant at its discretion. The inspection is considered to have ended when the inspector physically exits the regulated facility on the last day of the inspection.
(2) Information in substantiations may be claimed as confidential. Such claims must be accompanied by the certification described in paragraph (a) of this section but need not be themselves separately substantiated.
(3) Substantiation questions for all claims. Unless otherwise specified elsewhere in this subchapter (e.g., 40 CFR part 711), answers to the following questions must be provided for each confidentiality claim in a TSCA submission:
(i) Please specifically explain what harm to the competitive position of your business would be likely to result from the release of the information claimed as confidential. How would that harm be
substantial
? Why is the substantial harm to your competitive position
likely
(
i.e.,
probable) to be caused by release of the information rather than just
possible
? If you claimed multiple types of information to be confidential (e.g., site information, exposure information, environmental release information, etc.), explain how disclosure of each type of information would be likely to cause substantial harm to the competitive position of your business.
(ii) Has your business taken precautions to protect the confidentiality of the disclosed information? If yes, please explain and identify the specific measures, including but not limited to internal controls, that your business has taken to protect the information claimed as confidential. If the same or similar information was previously reported to EPA as non-confidential (such as in an earlier version of this submission), please explain the circumstances of that prior submission and reasons for believing the information is nonetheless still confidential.
(iii)(A) Is any of the information claimed as confidential required to be publicly disclosed under any other Federal law? If yes, please explain.
(B) Does any of the information claimed as confidential otherwise appear in any public documents, including (but not limited to) safety data sheets; advertising or promotional material; professional or trade publications; State, local, or Federal agency files; or any other media or publications available to the general public? If yes, please explain why the information should be treated as confidential. If this chemical is patented and the patent reveals the information you are claiming confidential, please explain your reasons for believing the information is nonetheless still confidential.
(iv) Is the claim of confidentiality intended to last less than 10 years (see TSCA section 14(e)(1)(B))? If yes, please indicate the number of years (between 1 and 10 years) or the specific date after which the claim is withdrawn.
(v) Has EPA, another Federal agency, or court made any confidentiality determination regarding information associated with this chemical substance?
If yes, please provide the circumstances associated with the prior determination, whether or not the information was found to be entitled to confidential treatment, the entity that made the decision, and the date of the determination.
(4) Additional substantiation questions for chemical identity-related claims only. Unless otherwise specified in the relevant electronic reporting form, answers to the following questions must be provided for each chemical identity-related confidentiality claim in a TSCA submission:
(i) Is this chemical substance publicly known (including by your competitors) to be in U.S. commerce? If yes, please explain why the specific chemical identity should still be afforded confidential status (e.g., the chemical substance is publicly known only as being distributed in commerce for research and development purposes, but no other information about the current commercial distribution of the chemical substance in the United States is publicly available). If no, please complete the certification statement:
I certify that on the date referenced I searched the internet for the chemical substance identity (
i.e.,
by both chemical substance name and CASRN). I did not find a reference to this chemical substance and have no knowledge of public information that would indicate that the chemical is being manufactured or imported by anyone for a commercial purpose in the United States. [provide date].
(ii) Does this specific chemical substance leave the site of manufacture (including import) in any form, e.g., as a product, effluent, emission? If yes, please explain what measures have been taken to guard against the discovery of its identity.
(iii) If the chemical substance leaves the site in a form that is available to the public or your competitors, can the chemical identity be readily discovered by analysis of the substance (e.g., product, effluent, emission), in light of existing technologies and any costs, difficulties, or limitations associated with such technologies? Please explain why or why not.
(iv) Would disclosure of the specific chemical identity release confidential process information? If yes, please explain.
(5) Information described in paragraphs (b)(5)(i) and (ii) of this section is exempt from the requirement to substantiate the claim at the time of submission. EPA may identify on a reporting form certain information as exempt from substantiation. Additional assertions of exemption from substantiation may be asserted by the submitter. Each such assertion must include a detailed explanation for why the information falls within the claimed exemption. If the explanation is missing or inadequate, and the claim is not otherwise substantiated, EPA will place a hold on the submission, as described in paragraph (e) of this section.
(i) The following information types are exempt from the substantiation requirement at the time of information submission:
(A) Specific information describing the processes used in manufacture or processing of a chemical substance, mixture, or article;
(B) Marketing and sales information;
(C) Information identifying a supplier or customer;
(D) Details of the full composition of a mixture and the respective percentages of constituents;
(E) Specific information regarding the use, function, or application of a chemical substance or mixture in a process, mixture, or article; and
(F) Specific production or import volumes.
(ii) Exemption for chemical substances not yet offered for commercial distribution.
(A) A confidentiality claim for specific identity of a chemical substance, where the submission is made prior to the date on which the chemical substance whose identity is claimed as confidential is first offered for commercial distribution, is exempt from the requirement to substantiate confidentiality claims at the time of submission.
(B) A specific chemical identity claim includes specific chemical names, CAS numbers, molecular formulas, reactants (if required to be reported as part of the identification of
the chemical, such as for Class 2 substances in § 720.45(a) of this subchapter), and structural diagrams; or in the case of microorganisms, genus and species name and genetic construct.
(C) This exemption applies where the submitter lacks information to reasonably conclude that the chemical substance has been offered for commercial distribution, where both:
(
1
) The chemical substance is not on the TSCA Inventory; and
(
2
) The substance is otherwise not publicly known to have been offered for commercial distribution.
(c)
Public copies.
All TSCA submissions and their accompanying attachments that include a confidentiality claim must be accompanied, at the time of submission, by a public version of the submission and any attachments, with all information that is claimed as confidential removed. In the case of documents collected by EPA or on behalf of EPA in person at the site of a TSCA inspection under section 11 of the Act, the affected company must provide such public copies at the same time and in the same manner as it provides substantiation of its confidentiality claims in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section, within ten working days after the inspection ends. Only information that is claimed as confidential may be redacted or removed. Generally, a public copy that removes all or substantially all of the information would not meet the requirements of this paragraph (c) so will likely be treated as deficient under paragraph (e) of this section.
(1) Where the applicable reporting form or electronic reporting tool contains a checkbox or other means of designating with specificity what information is claimed as confidential, no further action by the submitter is required to satisfy this requirement.
(2) For all other information claimed as confidential, including but not limited to information in attachments and in substantiations required under paragraph (b) of this section, the submitter must prepare and attach a public copy. EPA may treat as deficient submissions with public copies that are entirely blank or that are substantially reduced in length as compared to the CBI version (
see
paragraph (e) of this section).
(d)
Generic name.
Each confidentiality claim for specific chemical identity must be accompanied by a structurally descriptive generic name for that substance. This generic name must be consistent with guidance on the determination of structurally descriptive generic names developed in accordance with, and made binding by, section 14(c)(4)(A) of the Act (e.g.,
Guidance for Creating Generic Names for Confidential Chemical Substance Identity Reporting under TSCA;
available at
https://www.epa.gov/tsca-inventory/guidance-creating-generic-names-confidential-chemical-substance-identity-reporting
), and 15 U.S.C. 2613(c)(1)(C)(ii).
(1) At a minimum, the generic name must either:
(i) Be identical to the generic name for the same substance included on the non-confidential portion of the TSCA Inventory (if the substance is listed on the TSCA Inventory), or
(ii) For substances that are not listed on the TSCA Inventory, mask only the confidential portions of the specific chemical name. In most cases, only one structural element of a specific chemical name may be masked to protect a confidential chemical identity—if the submitter of a proposed generic name wishes to mask more than one such element, the submission must include an explanation of why masking only one element is insufficient to protect the confidential identity.
(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, EPA may conclude that a generic name provided with the submission and listed on the current non-confidential version of the TSCA Inventory does not comply with 15 U.S.C. 2613(c)(1)(C). In such cases, EPA will notify the submitting company and proceed as described in paragraph (c)(4) of this section.
(3) A generic name that meets the requirements of section 14(c)(1)(C) of the Act prior to the date on which the chemical substance is first offered for commercial distribution for the purposes of a pre-market submission (e.g., a PMN) may not be sufficient for the purposes of subsequent listing on the TSCA Inventory, as identified upon review under section 14(g)(1)(C)(i) of the
Act of a confidentiality claim for specific chemical identity made in a Notice of Commencement required under § 720.102 or § 725.190(f) of this subchapter. In such cases, EPA will notify the submitting company and proceed as described in § 720.102(f) or § 725.190(f) of this subchapter.
(4) If EPA concludes that the proposed generic name does not comply with 15 U.S.C. 2613(c)(1)(C), EPA will notify the submitter, and provide 10 business days for the submitter to provide a revised generic name. If EPA concludes that the revised generic name is still not acceptable, EPA will hold the submission for an additional period of up to 10 business days, proceeding as set out in paragraph (e) of this section.
(e)
Deficient confidentiality claims.
(1) A confidentiality claim under TSCA is deficient if it meets one or more of the following criteria:
(i) The confidentiality claim is not accompanied by the supporting statement and certification required by paragraph (a) of this section.
(ii) The confidentiality claim is not accompanied by the substantiation required by paragraph (b) of this section. If the submitter claims an exemption from substantiation under paragraph (b)(5) of this section and the exemption does not apply or an explanation is not provided for the exemption pursuant to paragraph (b)(5) of this section, the confidentiality claim is deficient.
(iii) The confidentiality claim is not accompanied by a public copy that meets the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section.
(iv) The confidentiality claim is for a specific chemical identity and is not accompanied by a generic name that meets the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section.
(2) A submission that is identified as deficient under paragraph (e)(1) of this section will be held for a period of up to 10 business days, and the submitter will be notified via CDX as described in paragraph (h) of this section. During the hold, which commences on the day the CDX notice is sent, any applicable review period for the underlying submission will be suspended until either the deficiency is corrected or the 10 business days elapse without such correction. Upon the occurrence of the first of either of these events, the applicable review period for the underlying submission commences or comes out of suspension. If the deficiency is not remedied during the suspension, EPA will proceed with review of the submission and may deny the CBI claim(s).
(f)
Electronic reporting required.
(1) TSCA submissions bearing confidentiality claims must be submitted via CDX, except where EPA directs that information subpoenaed under section 11(c) of the Act or materials collected or requested by EPA as part of an inspection under section 11(a) of the Act, not be submitted via CDX. Any required TSCA submission asserting a CBI claim that does not meet the requirements of this paragraph will be deemed incomplete. EPA reserves the ability to waive the requirements of this paragraph, at its discretion, where compliance is infeasible.
(2) You must use CISS to complete and submit TSCA submissions via CDX. To access CISS go to
https://cdx.epa.gov/
and follow the appropriate links.
(3) On receipt by EPA, each electronic TSCA submission will be assigned a case number or document identifier, which will be available to the submitter in their CDX account. This identifier may be used as a reference in future communications that concern the substance and may be used by EPA in public communications (e.g.,
Federal Register
notices) that concern the submission, such as notices of receipt, final confidentiality determination, pending confidentiality claim expiration, or in other regulatory actions that concern the TSCA submission.
(g)
Requirement to report health and safety studies using templates.
Submitters of health and safety studies or information from such studies must provide such data in templated form, using an appropriate OECD harmonized template, if such template is available for the data type (
https://www.oecd.org/ehs/templates/
). Individual test or data submission rules or orders may specify an appropriate template or templates. Submission of templated data is not a substitute for submitting a full study
report where a specific TSCA rule or order requires submission of the full study report (e.g., § 720.50(a) of this subchapter, or according to the terms of a specific order under section 5(e) of the Act).
(h)
Requirement to maintain company contact information; electronic notices concerning confidentiality claims.
(1) To facilitate ongoing or future communication concerning TSCA submissions, current contact information for all of the individuals associated with a particular TSCA submission must be maintained. Contact information for all the individuals associated with a particular TSCA submission must be updated by amending the submission via CDX, except that submissions that are either no longer accessible to the submitting company or that were not submitted via CDX (e.g., submissions that were originally provided on paper or other physical media), updated company contact must be provided via CDX using the appropriate EPA-provided electronic reporting application in CISS. In circumstances where ownership of the company or unit of a company has changed, such that contact information for one or more prior TSCA submissions that include confidentiality claims is affected, a notice of transfer of ownership must be directed to EPA via CDX. Instructions for providing this notice and for requesting access to copies of a prior TSCA submission are available at
https://cdx.epa.gov/.
(2) When EPA contacts a TSCA submitter concerning confidentiality claims (e.g., related to a pending or concluded confidentiality claim review, a deficient submission, or in relation to the 10-year expiration of a confidentiality claim (described in section 14(e) of the Act)), EPA may provide notices and other correspondence to the submitter via CDX, using the contact information provided in the most recent version of the submission, or using the contact information provided in a more recent notice of transfer of ownership relating to that submission. The fact and date of delivery of such notice is verified automatically by CDX.
(3) In addition to individual notice described in paragraph (h)(2) of this section, EPA will publish on its website, or other appropriate platform, a list of TSCA submissions with confidentiality claims that are approaching the end of the ten-year period of protection described in section 14(e) of the Act. Such TSCA submissions will be referred to by the TSCA case or document identifier (as described in paragraph (f)(3) of this section) that was assigned to the submission by EPA when it was originally submitted. TSCA submissions will be added to this list at least 60 days prior to the end of the ten-year period of protection, along with instructions for reasserting and substantiating expiring claims.
(4) When a confidentiality claim is being reviewed pursuant to section 14(f) of the Act, EPA will provide, when necessary, notice of such review and an opportunity to substantiate or resubstantiate the affected confidentiality claim to the submitter using the contact information for the authorized official or technical contact provided in the most recent version of the submission or in a more recent notice of transfer of ownership relating to that submission.
(5) Where the submission with the relevant CBI claim was not originally made via CDX, EPA will send the notice via courier or US Mail to the company address provided in the most recent TSCA submission made by that company, or via other means that allows verification of the fact and date of receipt. The notice will provide instructions for substantiating claims that were exempt from substantiation when the confidentiality claim was asserted or for which the submitter was otherwise not required to provide substantiation at the time of initial submission, and for updating or re-substantiating as necessary any claims that were previously substantiated.
(i)
Withdrawing confidentiality claims.
TSCA confidentiality claims may be voluntarily withdrawn by the submitter at any time.
(1) Confidentiality claims in TSCA submissions that were originally made via electronic submission may be withdrawn. To withdraw a claim, a person must reopen the submission in CDX, remove confidentiality markings (e.g., confidential checkmarks or bracketing), revise public copies including
any attachments to unredact the information no longer claimed confidential, and then resubmit the submission.
(2) For submissions that were not originally made via CDX, or that are no longer accessible to the submitting company via CDX, confidentiality claims may also be withdrawn via CDX using the “TSCA Communications” application or successor system. The withdrawal correspondence must indicate the case or document number (or other applicable document identifier or document identifying details) from which CBI claims are being withdrawn, identify the submitting company, and include a list or description of the information for which CBI claims are being withdrawn, including page numbers where relevant. Current contact information for the person withdrawing the claim must also be provided, in the event EPA needs clarification concerning which claim or claims are being withdrawn.
(j)
Amending public copy following confidentiality claim denial or expiration.
(1) Following the expiration or EPA's denial of a TSCA confidentiality claim, the person who asserted the denied or expired claim should prepare and submit a revised public copy of the submission to EPA, following the procedures for voluntarily withdrawing claims described in paragraph (i) of this section.
(2) If the person who asserted the denied or expired claim declines or fails to provide within 30 days a revised public copy of the submission that includes the information for which the confidentiality claim(s) were denied or expired, EPA may prepare an addendum to the original public copy, as needed, disclosing the information to the public.
§ 703.7
EPA review of confidentiality claims under TSCA section 14(g).
(a)
Representative subset and selection of submissions for review.
(1) A representative subset consists of at least 25 percent of confidentiality claims asserted under TSCA, not including claims for specific chemical identity or for the categories of information listed in section 14(c)(2) of the Act. Excluded from the representative subset are:
(i) Inquiries with respect to potential submission to EPA of a notification under 40 CFR part 720, 721, 723, or 725 by a person who has not submitted the notification at the time of the inquiry, including inquiries under § 720.25(b) or § 721.11 of this subchapter;
(ii) Submissions or other communication not submitted to EPA via CDX; and
(iii) Amendments to previous TSCA submissions.
(2) To satisfy its confidentiality claim review obligations under section 14(g)(1)(C)(ii) of the Act, EPA will generally review all claims (except those exempt from substantiation under section 14(c)(2) of the Act) in every fourth TSCA submission submitted via CDX that is part of the representative subset, in chronological order of receipt by EPA. For each submission selected for review as part of the representative subset, EPA reviews and approves or denies every individual confidentiality claim in that submission (except claims that are exempt under sections 14(c)(2) and 14(g) of the Act), including claims made in attachments and amendments available to EPA at the time of the review.
(b)
Review of new and expiring confidentiality claims under TSCA Section 14(g).
(1)(i) Under section 14(g) of the Act, EPA will review:
(A) All chemical identity claims asserted in TSCA submissions except those that are exempt from substantiation according to section 14(c)(2)(G) of the Act; and
(B) a representative subset of other confidentiality claims as provided in paragraph (a) of this section.
(ii) Final determinations will be issued by the General Counsel or their designee, which may include personnel outside of the Office of General Counsel.
(2) EPA will review all timely requests for extension of claims under section 14(e) of the Act within 30 days of receipt.
(3) EPA will also review or re-review confidentiality claims under certain other circumstances, as set out in section 14(f) of the Act. Review under section 14(f) of the Act are conducted in accordance with procedures set out in § 703.8.
(c)
Commencement of the review period and effect of amendments.
Subject to § 703.5(e), the 90-day review period described in section 14(g) of the Act begins on the day that EPA accepts a new TSCA submission that includes confidentiality claims. For new information, other than specific chemical identity, added to a submission after EPA first accepts the submission, the review will take into account such amendments to that submission that are made either up to 60 days from the original submission date, or until the Agency issues a final confidentiality determination for the submission, whichever comes first. If a submission is amended to report an additional or different chemical substance that includes a new specific chemical identity claim, the TSCA section 14(g) review period for the added chemical identity begins on the day EPA accepts the amendment including the new claim.
(d)
Publication of final determinations.
Final confidentiality determinations will be published on EPA's website, or other platform, periodically, in accordance with the requirements of section 26(j) of the Act.
(e)
Claim denials and notice period.
In the case that EPA determines that a claim or part of a claim is not entitled to confidential treatment, EPA will provide notice of the denial to the person who made the claim and provide reasons for the denial or denial in part. The notice will be provided, as described in § 703.5(h). The 30-day notice period described in section 14(g)(2)(B) of the Act begins on the next business day following the date the notice is made available to the submitter in their CDX account.
(f)
Substantive criteria for use in confidentiality determinations.
Information claimed as confidential under section 14 of the Act will be approved if all of the following apply:
(1) The business has asserted a business confidentiality claim which has not expired by its terms, nor been waived nor withdrawn;
(2) The business has satisfactorily shown that it has taken reasonable measures to protect the confidentiality of the information, and that it intends to continue to take such measures for as long as the claim is maintained;
(3) The information is not, and has not been, reasonably obtainable without the business's consent by other persons (other than governmental bodies) by use of legitimate means (other than discovery based on a showing of special need in a judicial or quasi-judicial proceeding; e.g., the business has demonstrated a reasonable basis to believe the information is not readily discoverable through reverse engineering);
(4) The business has demonstrated a reasonable basis to conclude that disclosure of the information is likely to cause substantial harm to the competitive position of the business; and
(5) No statute denies confidential protection to the information. Information from health and safety studies respecting any chemical that has been offered for commercial distribution or for which testing is required under section 4 of the Act or notice is required under section 5 of the Act is not entitled to confidential treatment, except that the following information may be entitled to confidential treatment if it otherwise meets the remainder of criteria in this paragraph (f):
(i) Any information, including formulas (including molecular structures) of a chemical substance or mixture, that discloses processes used in the manufacturing or processing of a chemical substance or mixture; or
(ii) In the case of a mixture, the portion of the mixture comprised by any of the chemical substances in the mixture.
(6) The business adequately demonstrates that the information is commercial or financial information obtained from a person and is confidential within the meaning of FOIA Exemption 4 (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4)).
(g)
Criteria to use in consideration of requests for extension under TSCA section 14(e).
Requests to extend the period of confidentiality protection under TSCA section 14(e) will be evaluated using the same criteria as described in paragraph (f) of this section. Requests for extension may rely on a substantiation previously provided to EPA, but the submitter must recertify that the substantiation is still true and correct.
§ 703.8
EPA review of confidentiality claims under TSCA section 14(f).
(a)
Review of confidentiality claims initiated under TSCA Section 14(f).
In accordance with the procedures described in this section, EPA may review confidentiality claims where authorized by TSCA section 14(f)(1), and will review confidentiality claims subject to TSCA section 14(f)(2) in the following situations:
(1) In response to a request under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) for TSCA information claimed confidential;
(2) If EPA has reason to believe that information claimed confidential does not qualify for protection from disclosure; or
(3) For any chemical substance which EPA determines under TSCA section 6(b)(4)(A) presents an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment.
(b)
Substantiation exemptions not applicable.
The exemptions from substantiation requirements contained in section 14(c)(2) of TSCA do not apply to confidentiality claims reviewed under this section 703.8, even if such exemptions applied when the information was originally submitted to EPA.
(c)
Additional substantiation.
If necessary, such as where substantiation has not previously been provided for confidentiality claims under review, or where EPA has reason to believe the substantiation is incomplete or out of date, EPA will request additional substantiation from the person(s) that claimed the information as confidential.
(d)
Additional substantiation notice.
If additional substantiation is necessary, EPA will provide notice to the person that claimed the information as confidential in the manner specified in § 703.5(h)(4). The notice will provide the time allowed for additional substantiation from the business and the method for requesting a time extension if necessary. If the person does not make a timely response or extension request, EPA will consider any existing substantiations in its review of the claims or, in the case of any unsubstantiated claim, EPA will construe this as a waiver of the claim and may make the information public without any further notice to the submitter.
(e)
Substantive criteria for use in confidentiality determinations.
The criteria in § 703.7(f) apply to confidentiality determinations initiated under TSCA section 14(f).
(f)
Adverse determinations and notice period.
Final determinations will be issued by the General Counsel or their designee, including personnel outside of the Office of General Counsel. Except for instances where claims were waived, if EPA determines that information claimed confidential does not qualify for protection from disclosure, EPA will provide written notice to the person who asserted the claim. The notice will be provided electronically, as described in § 703.5(h)(2). The 30-day notice period described in TSCA section 14(g)(2)(B) begins on the next business day following the date the notice is made available to the submitter in their CDX account.
(g)
Disclosure of Information.
After a final determination has been made by EPA to release some or all of the information claimed as confidential, the Agency shall make the information available to the public (in the absence of a court order prohibiting disclosure) whenever:
(1) The period provided for commencement by a business of an action to obtain judicial review of the determination has expired without notice to EPA of commencement of such an action; or
(2) The court, in a timely-commenced action, has denied the person's motion for a preliminary injunction, or has otherwise upheld the EPA determination.
(h)
Notice relating to public requests for records.
Any person whose request for release of the information under 5 U.S.C. 552 is pending at the time notice is given under paragraph (f) of this section shall be furnished notice under 5 U.S.C. 552 either stating the circumstances under which the some or all of the information will be released or denying the request if all requested information was found to be entitled to confidential treatment.

Article
means a manufactured item (1) which is formed to a specific shape or design during manufacture, (2) which has end use function(s) dependent in whole or in part upon its shape or design during end use, and (3) which has either no change of chemical composition during its end use or only those changes of composition which have no commercial purpose separate from that of the article, and that result from a chemical reaction that occurs upon end use of other chemical substances, mixtures, or articles; except that fluids and particles are not considered articles regardless of shape or design.
Byproduct
means a chemical substance produced without a separate commercial intent during the manufacture, processing, use, or disposal of another chemical substance(s) or mixture(s).
CAS Number
means Chemical Abstracts Service Registry Number.
Coproduct
means a chemical substance produced for a commercial purpose during the manufacture, processing, use, or disposal of another chemical substance or mixture.
Customer
means any person to whom a manufacturer, importer, or processor directly distributes any quantity of a chemical substance, mixture, mixture containing the substance or mixture, or article containing the substance or mixture, whether or not a sale is involved.
Domestic
means within the geographical boundaries of the 50 United States, including the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands, and any other territory or possession of the United States.
Enclosed process
means a manufacturing or processing operation that is designed and operated so that there is no intentional release into the environment of any substance present in the operation. An operation with fugitive, inadvertent, or emergency pressure relief releases remains an enclosed process so long as measures are taken to prevent worker exposure to and environmental contamination from the releases.
EPA
means the United States Environmental Protection Agency.
Import
means to import for commercial purposes.
Import for commercial purposes
means to import with the purpose of obtaining an immediate or eventual commercial advantage for the importer, and includes the importation of any amount of a chemical substance or mixture. If a chemical substance or mixture containing impurities is imported for commercial purposes, then those impurities also are imported for commercial purposes.
Import in bulk form
means to import a chemical substance (other than as part of a mixture or article) in any quantity, in cans, bottles, drums, barrels, packages, tanks, bags, or other containers, if the chemical substance is intended to be removed from the container and the substance has an end use or commercial purpose separate from the container.
Importer
means (1) any person who imports any chemical substance or any chemical substance as part of a mixture or article into the customs territory of the United States, and includes:
(i) The person primarily liable for the payment of any duties on the merchandise, or
(ii) An authorized agent acting on his behalf.
(2) Importer also includes, as appropriate:
(i) The consignee.
(ii) The importer of record.
(iii) The actual owner if an actual owner's declaration and superseding bond have been filed in accordance with 19 CFR 141.20.
(iv) The transferee, if the right to draw merchandise in a bonded warehouse has been transferred in accordance with subpart C of 19 CFR part 144.
(3) For the purposes of this definition, the customs territory of the United States consists of the 50 States, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia.
Impurity
means a chemical substance which is unintentionally present with another chemical substance.
Intermediate
means any chemical substance that is consumed, in whole or in part, in chemical reactions used for the intentional manufacture of other chemical substances or mixtures, or that is intentionally present for the purpose of altering the rates of such chemical reactions.
Known to or reasonably ascertainable by
means all information in a person's possession or control, plus all information that a reasonable person similarly situated might be expected to possess, control, or know.
Manufacture
means to manufacture for commercial purposes.
Manufacture for commercial purposes
means: (1) To import, produce, or manufacture with the purpose of obtaining an immediate or eventual commercial advantage for the manufacturer, and includes among other things, such “manufacture” of any amount of a chemical substance or mixture:
(i) For commercial distribution, including for test marketing.
(ii) For use by the manufacturer, including use for product research and development, or as an intermediate.
(2) Manufacture for commercial purposes also applies to substances that are produced coincidentally during the manufacture, processing, use, or disposal of another substance or mixture, including both byproducts that are separated from that other substance or mixture and impurities that remain in that substance or mixture. Such byproducts and impurities may, or may not, in themselves have commercial value. They are nonetheless produced for the purpose of obtaining a commercial advantage since they are part of the manufacture of a chemical product for a commercial purpose.
Manufacturer
means a person who imports, produces, or manufactures a chemical substance. A person who extracts a component chemical substance from a previously existing chemical substance or a complex combination of
substances is a manufacturer of that component chemical substance.

Information is in the possession or control of a person if it is:
(1) In the person's own files including files maintained by employees of the person in the course of their employment.
(2) In commercially available data bases to which the person has purchased access.
(3) Maintained in the files in the course of employment by other agents of the person who are associated with research, development, test marketing, or commercial marketing of the chemical substance in question.
Process
means to process for commercial purposes.
Process for commercial purposes
means the preparation of a chemical substance or mixture after its manufacture for distribution in commerce with the purpose of obtaining an immediate or eventual commercial advantage for the processor. Processing of any amount of a chemical substance or mixture is included in this definition. If a chemical substance or mixture containing impurities is processed for commercial purposes, then the impurities also are processed for commercial purposes.
Processor
means any person who processes a chemical substance or mixture.
Production volume
means the quantity of a substance which is produced by a manufacturer, as measured in kilograms or pounds.
Propose to manufacture, import, or process
means that a person has made a firm management decision to commit financial resources for the manufacture, import, or processing of a specified chemical substance or mixture.
Site
means a contiguous property unit. Property divided only by a public right-of-way shall be considered one site. There may be more than one plant on a single site. The site for a person who imports a substance is the site of the operating unit within the person's organization which is directly responsible for importing the substance and which controls the import transaction and may in some cases be the organization's headquarters office in the United States.
Small government
means the government of a city, county, town, township, village, school district, or special district with a population of less than 50,000.

3
), (v)(B)(
1
), (vi)(B)(
1
), and (vii)(B)(
2
);
(C) Any data element that is left blank or designated as “not known or reasonably ascertainable;” or
(D) Health and safety data required by § 704.180(e)(5)(iii), except that the following information may be claimed as confidential:
(
1
) Information that would reveal processes used in the manufacturing, importing, or processing of the substance or mixture, or the portion of a mixture comprised by any of the substances in the mixture, provided that the information is expressly identified
as revealing processing information or portion of a mixture;
(

Substantiation questions for all claims.
Answers to the following questions must be provided for each confidentiality claim in a TSCA submission:
(A) Please specifically explain what harm to the competitive position of your business would be likely to result from the release of the information claimed as confidential. How would that harm be
substantial?
Why is the substantial harm to your competitive position
likely
(
i.e.,
probable) to be caused by release of the information rather than just
possible
? If you claimed multiple types of information to be confidential (
e.g.,
site information, exposure information, environmental release information), explain how disclosure of each type of information would be likely to cause substantial harm to the competitive position of your business.
(B) Has your business taken precautions to protect the confidentiality of the disclosed information? If yes, please explain and identify the specific measures, including but not limited to internal controls, that your business has taken to protect the information claimed as confidential. If the same or similar information was previously reported to EPA as non-confidential (such as in an earlier version of this submission), please explain the circumstances of that prior submission and reasons for believing the information is nonetheless still confidential.
(C)(
1
) Is any of the information claimed as confidential required to be publicly disclosed under any other Federal law? If yes, please explain.
(
2
) Does any of the information claimed as confidential otherwise appear in any public documents, including (but not limited to) safety data sheets; advertising or promotional material; professional or trade publications; state, local, or Federal agency files; or any other media or publications available to the general public? If yes, please explain why the information should be treated as confidential.
(
3
) Does any of the information claimed as confidential appear in one or more patents or patent applications? If yes, please provide the associated patent number or patent application number (or numbers) and explain why the information should be treated as confidential.
(D) Is the claim of confidentiality intended to last less than 10 (ten) years (see TSCA section 14(e)(1)(B))? If yes, please indicate the number of years (between 1 (one) and 10 (ten) years) or
the specific date after which the claim is withdrawn.
(E) Has EPA, another federal agency, or court made any confidentiality determination regarding information associated with this chemical substance? If yes, please provide the circumstances associated with the prior determination, whether the information was found to be entitled to confidential treatment, the entity that made the decision, and the date of the determination.
(iv)
Exemptions from the substantiation requirement.
Confidentiality claims are exempt from the requirement to substantiate the claim at the time of submission for the data elements required pursuant to paragraphs (e)(4)(iii)(B)(
1
), (iv)(B)(
1
), (v)(A), (v)(B)(
2
), (vi)(A), (vi)(B)(
2
), (vii)(A), and (vii)(B)(
3
) of this section.
(v)
No claim of confidentiality.
Information not claimed as confidential in accordance with the requirements of this section may be made public without further notice.
(vi)
Public copies.
Submissions and their accompanying attachments that include a confidentiality claim must be accompanied, at the time of submission, by a public version of the submission and any attachments, with all information that is claimed as confidential removed. Only information that is claimed as confidential may be redacted or removed. Generally, a public copy that removes all or substantially all of the information would not meet the requirements of this paragraph.
(A) Where the electronic reporting tool contains a checkbox or other means of designating with specificity what information is claimed as confidential, no further action by the submitter is required to satisfy this requirement.
(B) For all other information claimed as confidential, including but not limited to information in attachments and in substantiations required under paragraph (h) of this section, the submitter must prepare and attach a public copy. Submissions with public or sanitized copies that are entirely blank or that are substantially reduced in length as compared to the CBI version will not meet the requirements of this paragraph (h)(2)(vi) of this section.
(i)

§ 705.1
Scope, compliance, and enforcement.
(a) This part specifies reporting and recordkeeping procedures for manufacturers (including importers) of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (hereafter referred to as PFAS) under section 8(a)(7) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA).
(b) TSCA section 15(3) makes it unlawful for any person to fail or refuse to submit information required under this part. In addition, TSCA section 15(3) makes it unlawful for any person to fail to keep, and permit access to, records required by this part. TSCA section 16 provides that any person who violates a provision of TSCA section 15 is liable to the United States for a civil penalty and may be criminally prosecuted. Pursuant to TSCA section 17, the Federal Government may seek judicial relief to compel submission of TSCA section 8(a) information and to otherwise restrain any violation of TSCA section 15. TSCA section 11 allows for inspections to assure compliance, and the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Administrator may by subpoena require the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of reports, papers, documents, answers to questions, and other information that the Administrator deems necessary.
(c) Each person who reports under this part must maintain records that document information reported under this part and, in accordance with TSCA, permit access to, and the copying of, such records by EPA officials.

code names for the test substance used internally by the submitting company or to identify the test substance to the test laboratory);
(3) Names and contact details for testing laboratory personnel and names and other private information for health and safety study participants or persons involved in chemical incidents such as would typically be withheld under 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(6) or under other privacy laws; and
(4) Information pertaining to test substance product development, advertising, or marketing plans, or to cost and other financial data.
Highest-level U.S. parent company
means the highest-level company of the site's ownership hierarchy as of the start of the submission period during which data are being reported according to the following instructions. The highest-level U.S. parent company is located within the United States. The following rules govern how to identify the highest-level U.S. parent company:
(1) If the site is entirely owned by a single U.S. company that is not owned by another company, that single company is the U.S. parent company.
(2) If the site is entirely owned by a single U.S. company that is, itself, owned by another U.S.-based company (
e.g.,
it is a division or subsidiary of a higher-level company), the highest-level domestic company in the ownership hierarchy is the U.S. parent company.
(3) If the site is owned by more than one company (
e.g.,
company A owns 40 percent, company B owns 35 percent, and company C owns 25 percent), the company with the largest ownership interest in the site is the U.S. parent company. If a higher-level company in the ownership hierarchy owns more than one ownership company, then determine the entity with the largest ownership by considering the lower-level ownerships in combination (
e.g.,
corporation X owns companies B and C, for a total ownership of 60 percent for the site).
(4) If the site is owned by a 50:50 joint venture or a cooperative, the joint venture or cooperative is its own parent company. If the site is owned by a U.S. joint venture or cooperative, the highest level of the joint venture or cooperative is the U.S. parent company.
(5) If the site is federally owned, the highest-level Federal agency or department is the U.S. parent company.
(6) If the site is owned by a non-Federal public entity, that entity (such as a municipality, State, or tribe) is the U.S. parent company.
Industrial function
means the intended physical or chemical characteristic for which a chemical substance or mixture is consumed as a
reactant; incorporated into a formulation, mixture, reaction product or article; repackaged; or used.
Industrial use
means use at a site at which one or more chemical substances or mixtures are manufactured (including imported) or processed.
Intended for use by children
means the chemical substance or mixture is used in or on a product that is specifically intended for use by children aged 14 or younger. A chemical substance or mixture containing a chemical substance is intended for use by children when the submitter answers “yes” to at least one of the following questions for the product into which the submitter's chemical substance or mixture containing a chemical substance is incorporated:
(1) Is the product commonly recognized (
i.e.,
by a reasonable person) as being intended for children aged 14 or younger?
(2) Does the manufacturer of the product state through product labeling or other written materials that the product is intended for or will be used by children aged 14 or younger?
(3) Is the advertising, promotion, or marketing of the product aimed at children aged 14 or younger?

means all information in a person's possession or control, plus all information that a reasonable person similarly situated might be expected to possess, control, or know.
Manufacture
means to import into the customs territory of the United States (as defined in general note 2 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (19 U.S.C. 1202)), produce, or manufacture for commercial purposes.
Manufacture for commercial purposes
means:
(1) To import, produce, or manufacture with the purpose of obtaining an immediate or eventual commercial advantage for the manufacturer, and includes among other things, such “manufacture” of any amount of a chemical substance or mixture containing a chemical substance:
(i) For commercial distribution, including for test marketing; and/or
(ii) For use by the manufacturer, including use for product research and development, or as an intermediate.
(2) Manufacture for commercial purposes also applies to substances that are produced coincidentally during the manufacture, processing, use, or disposal of another substance or mixture containing a chemical substance, including both byproducts that are separated from that other substance or mixture containing a chemical substance and impurities that remain in that substance or mixture containing a chemical substance. Such byproducts and impurities may, or may not, in themselves have commercial value. They are nonetheless produced for the purpose of obtaining a commercial advantage since they are part of the manufacture of a chemical product for a commercial purpose.
Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances
or
PFAS
means, for the purpose of this part, any chemical substance or mixture containing a chemical substance that structurally contains at least one of the following three sub-structures:

Possession or control
means in possession or control of the submitter, or of any subsidiary, partnership in which the submitter is a general partner, parent company, or any company or partnership which the parent company owns or controls, if the subsidiary, parent company, or other company or partnership is associated with the submitter in the research, development, test marketing, or commercial marketing of the chemical substance in question. (A parent company owns or controls another company if the parent owns or controls 50 percent or more of the other company's voting stock. A parent company owns or controls any partnership in which it is a general partner.) Information is included within this definition if it is:
(1) In files maintained by submitter's employees who are:
(i) Associated with research, development, test marketing, or commercial
marketing of the chemical substance in question; and/or
(ii) Reasonably likely to have such data.
(2) Maintained in the files of other agents of the submitter who are associated with research, development, test marketing, or commercial marketing of the chemical substance in question in the course of their employment as such agents.
Research and development (R
D)
means activities intended solely as scientific experimentation, research, or analysis. R
D focuses on the analysis of the chemical or physical characteristics, the performance, or the production characteristics of a chemical substance, a mixture containing the substance, or an article. R
D encompasses a wide range of activities which may occur in a laboratory, pilot plant, commercial plant outside the research facility, or at other sites appropriate for R
D. General distribution of chemical substances to consumers does not constitute R
D.
Site-limited
means a chemical substance is manufactured and processed only within a site and is not distributed as a chemical substance or as part of a mixture or article containing a chemical substance outside the site. Imported chemical substances are never site-limited.
Worker
means someone at a site of manufacture, import, or processing who performs work activities near sources of a chemical substance or mixture or directly handles the chemical substance or mixture during the performance of work activities.
§ 705.5

§ 705.12
Activities for which reporting is not required.
Reporting under this part is not required for the import of municipal solid waste streams for the purpose of disposal or destruction of the waste. Additionally, reporting is not required for a Federal agency which imports PFAS when it is not for any immediate or eventual commercial advantage.
§ 705.15
What information to report.
For the one-time submission, persons identified in § 705.10 must report to EPA, for each site of each of the chemical substances identified in § 705.5, the following information to the extent known to or reasonably ascertainable by them, except as allowed under § 705.18. In the event that actual data is not known to or reasonably ascertainable by the submitter, then reasonable estimates may be submitted:
(a)
Company and plant site information.
The following currently correct company and plant site information must be reported for each site at which a reportable chemical substance is manufactured (see 40 CFR 711.3 for the “site” for importers):
(1) The highest-level U.S. parent company name, address, and Dun and Bradstreet D-U-N-S® (D
B) number, if one exists.
(2) The name of a person who will serve as Authorized Official for the submitter company, and who will be able to sign the certification statement as described in § 705.30(d), the Authorized Official's full mailing address, telephone number, and email address.
(3) The name of a person who will serve as technical contact for the submitter company, and who will be able to answer questions about the information submitted by the company to EPA, the contact person's full mailing address, telephone number, and email address.
(4) The name, full street address, and six-digit North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code(s) of the site. A submitter under this part must include the appropriate D
B number for each plant site reported,
and the county or parish (or other jurisdictional indicator) in which the plant site is located. A submitter under this part must obtain a D
B number for the site reported if none exists. A submitter under this part must also provide other site identification numbers, including the Facility Registry Service (FRS) identification number, if they exist.
(b)
Chemical-specific information.
The following chemical-specific information must be reported for each chemical substance that is a PFAS manufactured for each year since January 1, 2011, except as allowed under § 705.18. This includes each chemical substance that is a PFAS and incorporated into mixtures:
(1) The common or trade name, the chemical identity, and, except for chemical substances that are Class 1 substances on the TSCA Inventory, the representative molecular structure of each PFAS for which such a report is required.
(i) The specific, currently correct Chemical Abstracts (CA) Index name as used to list the chemical substance on the TSCA Inventory and the correct corresponding Chemical Abstracts Service Registry Number (CASRN) for each reportable PFAS at each site. Submitters who wish to report chemical substances listed on the confidential portion of the TSCA Inventory will need to report the chemical substance using a TSCA Accession Number. If a submitter has a low-volume exemption (LVE) case number for the chemical substance, that number may also be used if a CASRN is not known to or reasonably ascertainable by the submitter.
(ii) In addition to reporting the number itself, submitters must specify the type of number they are reporting by selecting from among the codes in table 1 to this paragraph (b)(1)(ii).
Table 1 to Paragraph (
b
)(1)(
ii
)—Codes To Specify Type of Chemical Identifying Number
Code
Number type
A
TSCA Accession Number.
C
Chemical Abstracts Service Registry Number (CASRN).
L
Low-volume exemption (LVE) case number.
(iii) If the CASRN or specific identifier (
i.e.,
Accession Number or LVE number) of the PFAS is not known to or reasonably ascertainable (NKRA) to the submitter (
e.g.,
if the chemical identity is claimed as confidential business information by the submitter's supplier, or if the submitter knows they have a PFAS but are unable to ascertain its specific identifier and/or specific chemical identity), the submitter may provide a generic name or description of the PFAS and also initiate a joint submission if the secondary submitter is known. The submitter may only initiate a joint submission if the CASRN or the specific identifier (
i.e.,
Accession Number or LVE number) is not known or reasonably ascertainable, and a secondary submitter (who would provide such information) is known. The manufacturer (including importer) must use the reporting tool described under § 705.35 to ask the supplier or other entity to provide the chemical identity directly to EPA in a joint submission. Such request must include instructions for submitting chemical identity information electronically, using e-CDRweb and CDX (see 40 CFR 711.35), and for clearly referencing the manufacturer's (including importer) submission. Contact information for the supplier or other entity, a trade name or other designation for the chemical substance, and a copy of the request to the supplier or other entity must be included with the manufacturer's (including importer) submission. If, after conducting due diligence and reviewing known or reasonably ascertainable information, a secondary submitter to complete the joint submission is not known, the reporter may indicate that the secondary submitter is NKRA. However, the PFAS manufacturer would be required to provide as much identifying detail as they have regarding the PFAS identity, and would be able to report to EPA without initiating a joint submission even if they do not know the underlying identity of the chemical substance.
(2) The physical form(s) of the PFAS as it is sent off-site from each site. If the PFAS is site-limited, you must report the physical form(s) of the PFAS at the time it is reacted on-site to
produce a different chemical substance. For each PFAS at each site, the submitter must report as many physical forms as applicable from among the physical forms listed in this unit:
(i) Dry powder.
(ii) Pellets or large crystals.
(iii) Water- or solvent-wet solid.
(iv) Other solid.
(v) Gas or vapor.
(vi) Liquid.
(c)

If any of the information contained in the answers to the questions listed in paragraph (e) of this section is asserted to contain information that itself is considered to be confidential, you must clearly identify the information that is claimed confidential.
(d)
Certification statement for claims.
An authorized official representing a person asserting a claim of confidentiality must certify that the submission complies with the requirements of this part by signing and dating the following certification statement:
“I certify that all claims for confidentiality asserted with this submission are true and correct, and all information submitted herein to substantiate such claims is true and correct. Any knowing and willful misrepresentation is subject to criminal penalty pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 1001. I further certify that: (1) I have taken reasonable measures to protect the confidentiality of the information; (2) I have determined that the information is not required to be disclosed or otherwise made available to the public under any other Federal law; (3) I have a reasonable basis to conclude that disclosure of the information is likely to cause substantial harm to the competitive position of my company; and (4) I have a reasonable basis to believe that the information is not readily discoverable through reverse engineering.”
(e)
Substantiation requirements for all types of confidentiality claims.
For each data element that is claimed as confidential business information, you must submit with your report detailed written answers to the following questions:
(1)
Substantial harm due to release.
Please specifically explain what harm to the competitive position of your business would be likely to result from the release of the information claimed as confidential business information. How would that harm be
substantial?
Why is the substantial harm to your competitive position
likely
(
i.e.,
probable) to be caused by release of the information rather than just
possible
? If you claimed multiple types of information to be confidential (
e.g.,
site information, exposure information, environmental release information, etc.), explain how disclosure of each type of information would be likely to cause substantial harm to the competitive position of your business. (40 CFR 703.5(b)(3))
(2)
Precautions to protect confidentiality.
Has your business taken precautions to protect the confidentiality of the disclosed information? If yes, please explain and identify the specific measures, including but not limited to internal controls, that your business has taken to protect the information claimed as confidential business information. If the same or similar information was previously reported to EPA as non-confidential (such as in an earlier version of this submission), please explain the circumstances of that prior submission and reasons for believing the information is nonetheless still confidential.
(3)
Disclosure under Federal law or publicly available information.
(i) Is any of the information claimed as confidential business information required to be publicly disclosed under any other Federal law? If yes, please explain.
(ii) Does any of the information claimed as confidential business information otherwise appear in any public documents, including (but not limited to) safety data sheets; advertising or promotional material; professional or trade publications; state, local, or Federal agency files; or any other media or publications available to the general public? If yes, please explain why the information should be treated as confidential. If this chemical is patented and the patent reveals the information you are claiming to be confidential business information, please explain your reasons for believing the information is nonetheless still confidential.
(4)
Duration of claims.
Is the claim of confidentiality intended to last less than 10 years (see TSCA section 14(e)(1)(B))? If yes, please indicate the number of years (between 1-10 years) or
the specific date after which the claim is withdrawn.
(5)
Previously disclosed information.
Has EPA, another Federal agency, or court made any confidentiality determination regarding information associated with this chemical substance? If yes, please provide the circumstances associated with the prior determination, whether the information was found to be entitled to confidential treatment, the entity that made the decision, and the date of the determination.
(f)
Additional requirements for specific chemical identity.
A person may assert a claim of confidentiality for the specific chemical identity of a chemical substance as described in §§ 705.15(b)(1)(i) and 705.18(b)(2)(i) only if the identity of that chemical substance is treated as confidential in the Master Inventory File (or as a confidential LVE) as of the time the report is submitted for that chemical substance, if that substance is currently on the Inventory or is an LVE. Any person who asserts a claim of confidentiality for the specific chemical identity under this paragraph must provide a generic chemical name. To assert a claim of confidentiality for the identity of a reportable chemical substance, you must submit with the report detailed written answers to the questions from paragraph (b) of this section and to the following questions.
(1)
Chemical substance in U.S. commerce.
Is this chemical substance publicly known (including by your competitors) to be in U.S. commerce? If yes, please explain why the specific chemical identity should still be afforded confidential status (
e.g.,
the chemical substance is publicly known only as being distributed in commerce for research and development purposes, but no other information about the current commercial distribution of the chemical substance in the United States is publicly available) (40 CFR 703.5(b)(4)). If no, please complete the certification statement:
“I certify that on the date referenced, I searched the internet for the chemical substance identity (
i.e.,
by both chemical substance name and CASRN). I did not find a reference to this chemical substance and have no knowledge of public information that would indicate that the chemical is being manufactured or imported by anyone for a commercial purpose in the United States. [provide date].”
(2)
Leave manufacturing site.
Does this particular chemical substance leave the site of manufacture (including import) in any form,
e.g.,
as a product, effluent, emission? If yes, please explain what measures have been taken to guard against the discovery of its identity.
(3)
Chemical identity.
If the chemical substance leaves the site in a form that is available to the public or your competitors, can the chemical identity be readily discovered by analysis of the substance (
e.g.,
product, effluent, emission), in light of existing technologies and any costs, difficulties, or limitations associated with such technologies? Please explain why or why not.
(4)
Chemical name.
Would disclosure of the specific chemical name release confidential process information? If yes, please explain.
(g)
Joint submissions.
If a primary submitter asks a secondary submitter to provide information directly to EPA in a joint submission under §§ 705.15(b)(1)(i) and 705.18(b)(2)(i), only the primary submitter may assert a confidentiality claim for the data elements that it directly submits to EPA. The primary submitter must substantiate those claims that are not exempt under paragraph (b)(2) of this section. The secondary submitter is responsible for asserting all confidentiality claims for the data elements that it submits directly to EPA and for substantiating those claims that are not exempt under paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
(h)
No claim of confidentiality.
Except for the chemical identity on article importer forms submitted under § 705.18(a), information not claimed as confidential business information in accordance with the requirements of this section may be made public (
e.g.,
by publication of specific chemical name and CASRN on the public portion of the TSCA Inventory). EPA will provide advance public notice of specific chemical identities to be added to the public portion of the TSCA Inventory.

§ 707.20
Chemical substances import policy.
(a)
Scope.
(1) This statement addresses the policy of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on importation of chemical substances, mixtures, and articles under section 13 of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA; 15 U.S.C. 2601
et seq.
). In particular, it addresses aspects of the regulation promulgated by the United States Customs Service (Customs), Department of the Treasury (19 CFR 12.118 through 12.127, and 127.28 [amended]) to implement section 13 of TSCA, 15 U.S.C. 2612. Section 13 requires the Secretary of the Treasury to refuse entry into the Customs territory of the United States of a chemical substance, mixture, or article if it does not comply with rules in effect under TSCA, or if it is offered for entry in violation of TSCA or rules or orders under TSCA.
(2) In addition to this statement of policy, EPA will continue, as necessary, to address problems associated with imports in rulemaking and other actions under individual sections of TSCA, i.e., sections 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 12. Sections 5, 6, and 7 apply directly to imports subject to the section 13 requirements. Section 12 may apply to export of a shipment that is refused entry under section 13. Importers may have obligations under sections 4 and 8; section 4 and 8 requirements for importers would not apply to individual chemical shipments and thus are not included under section 13 requirements. Interested persons should refer to the records of these individual rulemaking actions for specific information and guidance.
(b)
Objectives.
(1) TSCA is intended to be comprehensive, and assure protection of health and the environment from unreasonable risks associated with chemicals whether the chemicals are imported or produced domestically. This intent is manifested by the inclusion of importation in the Act's definition of the term “manufacture”: “[M]anufacture means to import * * *, produce, or manufacture” (15 U.S.C. 2602(7)). Thus, importers are responsible for insuring that chemical importation complies with TSCA just as domestic manufacturers are responsible for insuring that chemical manufacture complies with TSCA.
(2)(i) The section 13 rule requires importers to sign the following statement for each import of chemical substances subject to TSCA: “I certify that all chemical substances in this shipment comply with all applicable rules or orders under TSCA and that I am not offering a chemical substance for entry
in violation of TSCA or any applicable rule or order under TSCA.” The certification will document that, in accordance with TSCA, the importer has taken the necessary steps to insure compliance.
(ii) The section 13 rule requires importers of chemicals not subject to TSCA (e.g., pesticides) to certify that compliance with TSCA is not required. Importers must certify this by signing the statement: “I certify that all chemicals in this shipment are not subject to TSCA.” This is appropriate when a chemical import is not clearly identified as a pesticide or other chemical not subject to TSCA.
(3) The United States is involved in a major effort toward international harmonization in the control of chemicals. At such time as international agreement is reached on this issue, EPA would be prepared to modify its policy if necessary. EPA believes that its international harmonization efforts in the control of chemicals will protect health and the environment while fulfilling its obligations under the Trade Agreements Act of 1979.
(c)
The section 13 rule
—(1)
General certification.
(i) The rule promulgated under section 13 of TSCA by Customs, in consultation with EPA, implements the requirement of section 13 that chemical substances, mixtures, or articles not in compliance with TSCA, or whose importation is not in compliance with TSCA, shall be denied entry into the customs territory of the United States. The rule requires that importers certify by a statement, on the entry document or invoice, that any shipment of a chemical substance subject to TSCA, imported in bulk or as part of a mixture, complies with TSCA, and that it is not offered for entry in violation of TSCA or any rule or order under TSCA, or that the chemicals imported are not subject to TSCA.
(ii) The certification applies to TSCA sections 5, 6, and 7.
(iii) EPA expects that this certification will be based upon actual knowledge of the importer in most cases. However, EPA realizes that sometimes importers may not have actual knowledge of the chemical composition of imported mixtures. In these cases, the importer should attempt to discover the chemical constituents of the shipment by contacting another party to the transaction (e.g., his principal or the foreign manufacturer). This person may be able to identify the components of the mixture, or at least state that the substances comply with TSCA. The greater the effort an importer makes to learn the identities of the imported substances and their compliance with TSCA, the smaller his chance of committing a violation by importing a noncomplying shipment. If a shipment is ultimately determined to have violated TSCA, the good faith efforts of the importer to verify compliance, as evidenced by documents contained in his files, may obviate or mitigate the assessment of a civil penalty under section 16 of TSCA.
(2)
EPA enforcement.
(i) EPA and Customs will monitor chemical imports to determine if shipments and their import comply with the certification requirements and the substantive mandates of TSCA. Customs will refuse entry to any shipment until such time as the certification is properly submitted. Customs will also detain a shipment if there are reasonable grounds to believe that such shipment or its import violates TSCA or regulations or orders thereunder. A violative shipment must either be brought into compliance, exported, destroyed, or voluntarily abandoned within the time periods prescribed in 19 CFR 12.124 of the section 13 rule.
(ii) When EPA determines that a shipment should be detained, EPA will identify the reasons for the detention and the necessary actions for an importer to bring the shipment into compliance with TSCA. If EPA has given this information to Customs before the district director issues the detention notice, the information will become part of the detention notice. The importer should contact one of the following EPA regional offices for guidance as to the proper procedures to correct any deficiencies in the shipment.

(iii) If Customs detains or refuses entry of a shipment (other than for failure to make the general certification) and the importer takes measures necessary to bring the shipment into conformity with the requirements of TSCA, EPA officials will reassess the shipment to determine its current compliance status. When a shipment is no longer in violation, EPA will notify the district director and the importer. The district director will then release the shipment. This notice will also serve as a determination to permit entry under 19 CFR 12.123(c) if a shipment is brought into compliance before the 19 CFR 12.123(c) decisionmaking process has been completed. If compliance is achieved after a 19 CFR 12.123(c) determination (adverse to the importer) has been made, the EPA notice to the district director will serve as a reversal of the decision to refuse entry.

# Subpart D—Notices of Export Under Section 12(b)
§ 707.60
Applicability and compliance.
(a) Section 12(b) of the Toxic Substances Control Act requires any person who exports or intends to export a chemical substance or mixture to notify the Environmental Protection Agency of such exportation to a particular country if any of the following actions have been taken under the Act with respect to that chemical substance or mixture:
(1) Data are required under section 4 or 5(b),
(2) An order has been issued under section 5,
(3) A rule has been proposed or promulgated under section 5 or 6, or
(4) An action is pending, or relief has been granted under section 5 or 7.
(b) No notice of export will be required for articles, except PCB articles, unless the Agency so requires in the context of individual section 5, 6, or 7 actions.
(c)(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (c)(2) and (3) of this section no notice of export is required for the export of a chemical substance or mixture for which export notification is otherwise required, where such chemical substance or mixture is present in a concentration of less than 1% (by weight or volume).
(2) No notice of export is required for the export of a chemical substance or mixture that is a known or potential human carcinogen where such chemical substance or mixture is present in a concentration of less than 0.1% (by weight or volume). A chemical is considered to be a known or potential human carcinogen, for purposes of
TSCA section 12(b) export notification, if that chemical is:
(i) A chemical substance or mixture listed as a “known to be human carcinogen” or “reasonably anticipated to be human carcinogen” in the Report on Carcinogens (latest edition) issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Public Heath Service, National Toxicology Program,
(ii) A chemical substance or mixture is classified as “carcinogenic to humans” (Group 1), “probably carcinogenic to humans” (Group 2A), or “probably carcinogenic to humans” (Group 2B) in the Monographs and Supplements on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans issued by the World Health Organization International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), Lyons, France (latest editions), or
(iii) Alpha-naphthylamine (Chemical Abstract Service Registry Number (CAS No.) 134-32-7) or 4-nitrobiphenyl (CAS No. 92-93-3).

# Subpart A—General Provisions
§ 710.1
Scope and compliance.
(a) This part establishes regulations governing reporting and recordkeeping by certain persons who manufacture, import, or process chemical substances for commercial purposes under section 8(a) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (15 U.S.C. 2607(a)) (TSCA). Section 8(a) authorizes the Administrator to require reporting of information necessary for administration of the Act and requires EPA to issue regulations for the purpose of compiling and keeping current an inventory of chemical substances manufactured or processed for a commercial purpose, as required by section 8(b) of the Act. Following an initial reporting period, EPA published an initial inventory of chemical substances manufactured, processed, or imported for commercial purposes. In accordance with section 8(b), EPA periodically amends the inventory to include new chemical substances which are manufactured or imported for a commercial purpose and reported under
section 5(a)(1) of the Act. EPA also revises the categories of chemical substances and makes other amendments as appropriate.
(b) This part applies to the activities associated with the compilation of the TSCA Chemical Substance Inventory (Inventory) and the designation of chemical substances on the TSCA Inventory as active or inactive in U.S. commerce.
(c) Section 15(3) of TSCA makes it unlawful for any person to fail or refuse to submit information required under these reporting regulations. In addition, section 15(3) makes it unlawful for any person to fail to keep, and permit access to, records required by these regulations. Section 16 provides that any person who violates a provision of section 15 is liable to the United States for a civil penalty and may be criminally prosecuted. Pursuant to section 17, the Government may seek judicial relief to compel submission of section 8(a) information and to otherwise restrain any violation of section 15. (EPA does not intend to concentrate its enforcement efforts on insignificant clerical errors in reporting.)
(d) Each person who reports under these regulations must maintain records that document information reported under these regulations and, in accordance with the Act, permit access to, and the copying of, such records by EPA officials.

(1) For chemical substances manufactured under contract,
i.e.,
by a toll manufacturer, the site is the location where the chemical substance is physically manufactured.
(2) The site for an importer who imports a chemical substance described in § 710.25 is the U.S. site of the operating unit within the person's organization that is directly responsible for importing the chemical substance. The import site, in some cases, may be the organization's headquarters in the United States. If there is no such operating unit or headquarters in the United States, the site address for the importer is the U.S. address of an agent acting on behalf of the importer who is authorized to accept service of process for the importer.
Small quantities solely for research and development (or
“
small quantities solely for purposes of scientific experimentation or analysis or chemical research on, or analysis of, such substance or another substance, including such research or analysis for the development of a product”)
means quantities of a chemical substance manufactured, imported, or processed or proposed to be manufactured, imported, or processed solely for research and development that are not greater than reasonably necessary for such purposes.

For confidential substances on the Inventory, the list will include the TSCA Accession Number and generic name.
(i) If an importer submitting a notice cannot provide the information specified in § 710.29(d)(4) because it is unknown to the importer and claimed as confidential by the supplier of the chemical substance or mixture, the importer must ask the supplier to provide the specific chemical identity information directly to EPA in a joint submission using the same e-NOA software module used for commercial activity reporting. Such request must refer the supplier to EPA's instructions for submitting chemical identity information electronically, using e-NOA, CISS, and CDX (see § 710.39), and for clearly referencing the importer's submission. Contact information for the supplier, a trade name or other name for the chemical substance or mixture, and a copy of the request to the supplier must be included with the importer's submission.
(ii) If a manufacturer or processor submitting a notice cannot provide the information specified in § 710.29(d)(4) because the reportable chemical substance is manufactured or processed using a reactant having a specific chemical identity that is unknown to the manufacturer or processor and claimed as confidential by its supplier, the manufacturer or processor must ask the supplier of the confidential reactant to provide the specific chemical identity of the confidential reactant directly to EPA in a joint submission using the same e-NOA software module used for commercial activity reporting. Such request must refer the supplier to EPA's instructions for submitting chemical identity information electronically using e-NOA, CISS, and CDX (see § 710.39), and for clearly referencing the manufacturer's or processor's submission. Contact information for the supplier, a trade name or other name for the chemical substance, and a copy of the request to the supplier must be included with the manufacturer's or processor's submission with respect to the chemical substance.
(iii) Joint submissions must be submitted electronically using e-NOA, CISS, and CDX (see § 710.39).
(5)
Certification statements.
The authorized official must certify that the submitted information has been completed in compliance with the requirements of this part as described in this paragraph.
(i) The certification must be signed and dated by the authorized official for the submitting company.
(ii) The following is required certification language for an authorized official submitting a Notice of Activity Form A under § 710.25(a) or § 710.25(b): “I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision and the information contained therein, to the best of my knowledge, is true, accurate, and complete.

§ 710.30
When to submit notifications.
(a)
When must a Notice of Activity Form A be submitted?
The Notice of Activity Form A required to be submitted under § 710.25(a) must be submitted during the applicable submission period.
(1)
Manufacturers.
The submission period for manufacturers under §§ 710.25(a) and 710.25(b) begins on August 11, 2017 and ends on February 7, 2018.
(2)
Processors.
The submission period for processors under § 710.25(b) begins on August 11, 2017 and ends on October 5, 2018.
(3)
Withdrawal of a Notice of Activity Form A.
A Notice of Activity Form A submitted under § 710.30(a)(1) or § 710.30(a)(2) may be withdrawn by the submitter no later than October 5, 2018. If EPA receives a timely request to withdraw a previously submitted Notice of Activity Form A for a chemical substance subject to commercial activity designation, and EPA has not received a Notice of Activity Form A from another submitter for the same chemical substance, EPA will not designate the chemical substance as active. A Form A withdrawn under this paragraph will not satisfy the obligation under this rule to submit a Form A.
(b)
When must a Notice of Activity Form B be submitted?—
(1)
Manufacturers and processors.
The Notice of Activity Form B required to be submitted under § 710.25(c) must be submitted before a person manufactures or processes the inactive substance, but not more than 90 days prior to the anticipated date of manufacturing or processing.
(2)
When else may a Notice of Activity Form B be submitted?
A Notice of Activity Form B that will later be required to be submitted under § 710.25(c) may be submitted during the 90-day period between EPA's identification of a chemical substance for inactive designation and the effective date for such designation, by a person who is currently manufacturing or processing such chemical substance or who anticipates manufacturing or processing such chemical substance within 90 days following submission.
(3)
When may EPA execute a request to withdraw a Notice of Activity Form B?
If EPA receives a request to withdraw a previously submitted Notice of Activity Form B from the submitter of the Notice of Activity Form B and EPA has neither yet moved the subject chemical substance from the inactive to the active Inventory nor yet moved the subject chemical substance from the confidential portion of the Inventory to the public portion of the Inventory as a result of the original submission, then EPA may execute the request.
§ 710.33
Co-manufacturers and co-processors.
(a)
Notice of Activity submitted by co-manufacturers.
When, in a single instance of manufacturing or importing a particular volume of a chemical substance during the lookback period, two or more persons qualify as the manufacturer or importer of that volume, they may determine among themselves who should make the required submission under § 710.25(a). If no notice is submitted as required under this subpart, EPA will hold each such person liable for failure to submit a notice.
(b)
Notice of Activity by prospective co-manufacturers or co-processors.
If two or more persons intend to manufacture, import, or process a particular volume of an inactive substance, such that multiple persons would qualify as the manufacturer, importer, or processor of that volume, they may determine among themselves who will submit the required notice under § 710.25(c). If no notice is submitted as required under
this subpart, all of the persons remain subject to the reporting requirements, and EPA will hold each such person liable for a failure to submit a notice prior to the date of manufacturing, importing, or processing.
§ 710.35
Recordkeeping requirements.
Each person who is subject to the notification requirements of this part must retain records that document any information reported to EPA. Records relevant to a Notice of Activity under §§ 710.25(a) and 710.25(b) must be retained for a period of 5 years beginning on the last day of the submission period. Records relevant to a Notice of Activity under § 710.25(c) must be retained for a period of 5 years beginning on the day that the notice was submitted.
§ 710.37
Confidentiality claims.
(a)
Chemical identity.
A person submitting information under this part may request to maintain an existing claim of confidentiality for the specific chemical identity of a reportable chemical substance, but may do so only if the identity of the chemical substance is listed on the confidential portion of the Inventory as of the time the notice is submitted for that chemical substance under this part. A request to maintain an existing claim of confidentiality must be made at the time the information is submitted. If no person submitting the information specified in § 710.29(d)(4) for a particular chemical substance requests that the claim be maintained, EPA will treat the specific chemical identity of that chemical substance as not subject to a confidentiality claim and will move the chemical substance to the public portion of the Inventory. Except as set forth in this subsection, information claimed as confidential in accordance with this section will be treated and disclosed in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR part 2, subpart B.
(1)
Notice of Activity Form A.
A person requesting to maintain an existing claim of confidentiality for specific chemical identity may submit with the notice answers to the questions in paragraphs (c)(1) and(c)(2) of this section, signed and dated by an authorized official. If these answers are submitted less than five years before the date on which substantiation is due pursuant to TSCA section 8(b)(4)(D)(i), the answers will be deemed to be substantiations made under TSCA section (8)(b)(4)(D)(i) and the person will be exempt from further substantiation requirements under TSCA section (8)(b)(4)(D)(i). Answers that do not include the answers to all applicable questions in paragraph (c) of this section will not be deemed to be substantiations made under the TSCA section (8)(b)(4)(D)(i) requirement.
(2)
Notice of Activity Form B.
A person requesting to maintain an existing claim of confidentiality for specific chemical identity must submit answers to the questions in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section within 30 days of submitting the notice, signed and dated by an authorized official. If this information is not submitted within 30 days of submitting the notice, EPA will consider the confidentiality claim as deficient, so that the specific chemical identity is not subject to a confidentiality claim, and may make the information public without further notice.
(i) Persons who submitted the information described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section before May 5, 2020 must submit answers to the questions in paragraphs (c)(2)(ii) and (iii) of this section not later than June 4, 2020.
(ii) [Reserved]
(b)
Information other than specific chemical identity.
A person submitting information under this part may assert a claim of confidentiality for information other than specific chemical identity. Any such confidentiality claim must be made at the time the information is submitted. Except as set forth in this section, information claimed as confidential in accordance with this subsection will be treated and disclosed in accordance with 40 CFR part 2, subpart B. A person asserting a claim of confidentiality under this subsection must submit with the notice answers to the questions in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, signed and dated by an authorized official. If no claim is asserted at the time the information is submitted, or if the answers to the questions in paragraph (c)(1) of this section are not provided, EPA will consider the
information as not subject to a confidentiality claim and may make the information public without further notice.
(c)
Substantiation questions.
Persons asserting that information is exempt from substantiation pursuant to TSCA section 14(c)(2) must answer only the question in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section.
(1)
Substantiation questions for any confidentiality claim.
For any information with a confidentiality claim that you assert is exempt from substantiation pursuant to TSCA section 14(c)(2), answer only the question in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section. For all other information with a confidentiality claim, answer the questions in paragraphs (c)(1)(ii) through (vi) of this section. If more than one data element on Form A or Form B is claimed as confidential, you must answer the applicable questions individually for each data element. If the answer to a question applies for all confidentiality claims on the form, indicate this in your substantiation response.
(i) Do you believe that the information is exempt from substantiation pursuant to TSCA section 14(c)(2)? If you answered yes, you must individually identify the specific information claimed as confidential and specify the applicable exemption(s).
(ii) Will disclosure of the information likely result in substantial harm to your business's competitive position? If you answered yes, describe with specificity the substantial harmful effects that would likely result to your competitive position if the information is made available to the public.
(iii) To the extent your business has disclosed the information to others (both internally and externally), what precautions has your business taken? Identify the measures or internal controls your business has taken to protect the information claimed as confidential: Non-disclosure agreement required prior to access; access is limited to individuals with a need-to-know; information is physically secured; other internal control measure(s). If yes, explain.
(iv) Does the information appear in any public documents, including (but not limited to) safety data sheets, advertising or promotional material, professional or trade publication, or any other media or publications available to the general public? If you answered yes, explain why the information should be treated as confidential.
(v) Is the claim of confidentiality intended to last less than 10 years? If so, indicate the number of years (between 1-10 years) or the specific date/occurrence after which the claim is withdrawn.
(vi) Has EPA, another federal agency, or court made any confidentiality determination regarding information associated with this chemical substance? If you answered yes, explain the outcome of that determination and provide a copy of the previous confidentiality determination or any other information that will assist in identifying the prior determination.
(2)
Substantiation for confidentiality claims for specific chemical identity.
(i) Is the confidential chemical substance publicly known to have ever been offered for commercial distribution in the United States? If you answered yes, explain why the information should be treated as confidential.
(ii) Does this particular chemical substance leave the site of manufacture (including import) or processing in any form,
e.g.,
as a product, effluent, or emission? If yes, please explain what measures have been taken, if any, to guard against the discovery of its identity.
(iii) If the chemical substance leaves the site in a form that is available to the public or your competitors, can the chemical identity be readily discovered by analysis of the substance (
e.g.,
product, effluent, or emission), in light of existing technologies and any costs, difficulties, or limitations associated with such technologies? Please explain why or why not.
(d)
Confidentiality of substantiation.
If any of the information contained in the answers to the questions listed in paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section is claimed as confidential business information, the submitter must clearly indicate such by marking the substantiation as confidential business information as provided in a Notice of Activity Form A or Form B.
(e)
Certification statement for claims.
An authorized official of a person submitting or substantiating a claim of confidentiality or a request to maintain an existing claim of confidentiality for specific chemical identity must certify that the submission complies with the requirements of this part by signing and dating the following certification statement: “I certify that all claims for confidentiality made or sought to be maintained with this submission are true and correct, and all information submitted herein to substantiate such claims is true and correct. Any knowing and willful misrepresentation is subject to criminal penalty pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 1001.” I further certify that it is true and correct that:
(1) My company has taken reasonable measures to protect the confidentiality of the information;
(2) I have determined that the information is not required to be disclosed or otherwise made available to the public under any other Federal law;
(3) I have a reasonable basis to conclude that disclosure of the information is likely to cause substantial harm to the competitive position of my company; and
(4) I have a reasonable basis to believe that the information is not readily discoverable through reverse engineering.

§ 711.1
Scope, compliance, and enforcement.
(a) This subpart specifies reporting and recordkeeping procedures under section 8(a) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) (15 U.S.C. 2607(a)) for certain manufacturers (including importers) of chemical substances. TSCA section 8(a) authorizes the EPA Administrator to require reporting of information necessary for the administration of TSCA.
(b) This part applies to the activities associated with the periodic update of information on a subset of the chemical substances included on the TSCA Inventory.
(c) TSCA section 15(3) makes it unlawful for any person to fail or refuse to submit information required under this part. In addition, TSCA section 15(3) makes it unlawful for any person to fail to keep, and permit access to, records required by this part. Section 16 of TSCA provides that any person who violates a provision of TSCA section 15 is liable to the United States for a civil penalty and may be criminally prosecuted. Pursuant to TSCA section 17, the Federal Government may seek judicial relief to compel submission of TSCA section 8(a) information and to otherwise restrain any violation of TSCA section 15. (EPA does not intend to concentrate its enforcement efforts on insignificant clerical errors in reporting.) TSCA section 11 allows for inspections to assure compliance, and the Administrator may by subpoena require the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of reports, papers, documents, answers to questions, and other information that the Administrator deems necessary.
(d) Each person who reports under this part must maintain records that document information reported under this part and, in accordance with TSCA, permit access to, and the copying of, such records by EPA officials.

Definitions.
The definitions in this section and the definitions in TSCA section 3 apply to this part. In addition, the definitions in 40 CFR 704.3 also apply to this part, except the definitions
manufacture
and
manufacturer
in 40 CFR 704.3.
CDX
or
Central Data Exchange
means EPA's centralized electronic document receiving system, or its successors.
Commercial use
means the use of a chemical substance or a mixture containing a chemical substance (including as part of an article) in a commercial enterprise providing saleable goods or services.
Consumer use
means the use of a chemical substance or a mixture containing a chemical substance (including as part of an article) when sold to or made available to consumers for their use.
e-CDRweb
means the electronic, web-based tool provided by EPA for the completion of Form U and submission of the CDR data.
Highest-level parent company
means the highest-level company of the site's ownership hierarchy as of the start of the submission period during which data are being reported according to the following instructions. The highest-level U.S. parent company is located within the United States while the highest-level foreign parent company is located outside the United States. The following rules govern how to identify the highest-level U.S. parent company and highest-level foreign parent company (if applicable):
(1) If the site is entirely owned by a single U.S. company that is not owned by another company, that single company is the U.S. parent company.
(2) If the site is entirely owned by a single U.S. company that is, itself, owned by another U.S.-based company (
e.g.,
it is a division or subsidiary of a higher-level company), the highest-level domestic company in the ownership hierarchy is the United States parent company. If there is a higher-level parent company that is outside of the United States, the highest-level foreign company in the ownership hierarchy is the foreign parent company.
(3) If the site is owned by more than one company (
e.g.,
company A owns 40 percent, company B owns 35 percent, and company C owns 25 percent), the company with the largest ownership interest in the site is the parent company. If a higher-level company in the ownership hierarchy owns more than one ownership company, then determine the entity with the largest ownership by considering the lower-level ownerships in combination (
e.g.,
corporation x owns companies B and C, for a total ownership of 60 percent for the site).
(i) If the parent company is a U.S. company owned by another U.S. company, then the highest-level domestic company in the ownership hierarchy is the U.S. parent company. If the U.S. parent company has a higher-level foreign company in the ownership hierarchy, then the highest-level foreign company in the ownership hierarchy is the foreign parent company.
(ii) If the parent company is a foreign company, then the site is its own U.S. parent company and the foreign parent company is the highest-level foreign company in the ownership hierarchy.
(4) If the site is owned by a 50:50 joint venture or a cooperative, the joint venture or cooperative is its own parent company. If the site is owned by a U.S. joint venture or cooperative, the highest level of the joint venture or cooperative is the U.S. parent company. If the site is owned by a joint venture or cooperative outside the United States, the highest level of the joint venture or cooperative outside the United States is the foreign parent company.
(5) If the site is entirely owned by a foreign company (
i.e.,
without a U.S.-based subsidiary within the site's ownership hierarchy), the highest-level foreign company in the ownership hierarchy is the site's foreign parent company.
(6) If the site is federally owned, the highest-level federal agency or department is the U.S. parent company.
(7) If the site is owned by a non-federal public entity, that entity (such as a municipality, State, or tribe) is the U.S. parent company.
Industrial function
means the intended physical or chemical characteristic for which a chemical substance or mixture is consumed as a reactant; incorporated into a formulation, mixture, reaction product, or article; repackaged; or used.

Intended for use by children
means the chemical substance or mixture is used in or on a product that is specifically intended for use by children age 14 or younger. A chemical substance or mixture is intended for use by children when the submitter answers “yes” to at least one of the following questions for the product into which the submitter's chemical substance or mixture is incorporated:
(1) Is the product commonly recognized (i.e., by a reasonable person) as being intended for children age 14 or younger?
(2) Does the manufacturer of the product state through product labeling or other written materials that the product is intended for or will be used by children age 14 or younger?
(3) Is the advertising, promotion, or marketing of the product aimed at children age 14 or younger?
Manufacture
means to manufacture, produce, or import, for commercial purposes. Manufacture includes the extraction, for commercial purposes, of a component chemical substance from a previously existing chemical substance or complex combination of chemical substances. A chemical substance is co-manufactured by the person who physically performs the manufacturing and
the person contracting for such production when that chemical substance, manufactured other than by import, is:
(1) Produced exclusively for another person who contracts for such production, and
(2) That other person dictates the specific chemical identity of the chemical substance and controls the total amount produced and the basic technology for the manufacturing process.
Manufacturer
means a person who manufactures a chemical substance.
Master Inventory File
means EPA's comprehensive list of chemical substances which constitutes the TSCA Inventory compiled under TSCA section 8(b). It includes chemical substances reported under 40 CFR part 710 and substances reported under 40 CFR part 720 for which a Notice of Commencement of Manufacture or Import has been received under 40 CFR 720.120.
Principal reporting year
means the latest complete calendar year preceding the submission period.
Reasonably likely to be exposed
means an exposure to a chemical substance which, under foreseeable conditions of manufacture (including import), processing, distribution in commerce, or use of the chemical substance, is more likely to occur than not to occur. Such exposures would normally include, but would not be limited to, activities such as charging reactor vessels, drumming, bulk loading, cleaning equipment, maintenance operations, materials handling and transfers, and analytical operations. Covered exposures include exposures through any route of entry (inhalation, ingestion, skin contact, absorption, etc.), but excludes accidental or theoretical exposures.
Repackaging
means the physical transfer of a chemical substance or mixture, as is, from one container to another container or containers in preparation for distribution of the chemical substance or mixture in commerce.
Reportable chemical substance
means a chemical substance described in § 711.5.
Site
means a contiguous property unit. Property divided only by a public right-of-way shall be considered one site. More than one manufacturing plant may be located on a single site.
(1) For chemical substances manufactured under contract,
i.e.,
by a co-manufacturer, the site is the location where the chemical substance is physically manufactured.
(2) The site for an importer who imports a chemical substance described in § 711.5 is the U.S. site of the operating unit within the person's organization that is directly responsible for importing the chemical substance. The import site, in some cases, may be the organization's headquarters in the United States. If there is no such operating unit or headquarters in the United States, the site address for the importer is the U.S. address of an agent acting on behalf of the importer who is authorized to accept service of process for the importer.
(3) For portable manufacturing units sent to different locations from a single distribution center, the distribution center shall be considered the site.
Site-limited
means a chemical substance is manufactured and processed only within a site and is not distributed for commercial purposes as a chemical substance or as part of a mixture or article outside the site. Imported chemical substances are never site-limited. Although a site-limited chemical substance is not distributed for commercial purposes outside the site at which it is manufactured and processed, the chemical substance is considered to have been manufactured and processed for commercial purposes.
Submission period
means the period in which the manufacturing, processing, and use data are submitted to EPA.
Use
means any utilization of a chemical substance or mixture that is not otherwise covered by the terms manufacture or process. Relabeling or redistributing a container holding a chemical substance or mixture where no repackaging of the chemical substance or mixture occurs does not constitute use or processing of the chemical substance or mixture.

§ 711.5
Chemical substances for which information must be reported.
Any chemical substance that is in the Master Inventory File at the beginning of a submission period described
in § 711.20, unless the chemical substance is specifically excluded by § 711.6.
§ 711.6
Chemical substances for which information is not required.
The following groups or categories of chemical substances are exempted from some or all of the reporting requirements of this part, with the following exception: A chemical substance described in paragraph (a)(1), (2), or (4), or (b) of this section is not exempted from any of the reporting requirements of this part if that chemical substance is the subject of a rule proposed or promulgated under TSCA sections 4, 5(a)(2), 5(b)(4), or 6, or is the subject of an enforceable consent agreement (ECA) developed under the procedures of 40 CFR part 790, or is the subject of an order issued under TSCA sections 4, 5(e), or 5(f), or is the subject of relief that has been granted under a civil action under TSCA sections 5 or 7.
(a)
Full exemptions.
The following categories of chemical substances are exempted from the reporting requirements of this part.
(1)
Polymers.
(i) Any chemical substance described with the word fragments “*polym,” “*alkyd,” or “*oxylated” in the Chemical Abstracts (CA) Index Name in the Master Inventory File, where the asterisk (*) in the listed word fragments indicates that any sets of characters may precede, or follow, the character string defined.
(ii) Any chemical substance that is identified in the Master Inventory File as an enzyme, lignin, a polysaccharide (cellulose, gum, starch), a protein (albumin, casein, gelatin, gluten, hemoglobin), rubber, siloxane and silicone, or silsesquioxane.
(iii) This exclusion does not apply to a polymeric substance that has been depolymerized, hydrolyzed, or otherwise chemically modified, except in cases where the intended product of this reaction is totally polymeric in structure.
(2)
Microorganisms.
Any combination of chemical substances that is a living organism, and that meets the definition of
microorganism
at 40 CFR 725.3. Any chemical substance produced from a living microorganism is reportable under this part unless otherwise excluded.
(3)
Naturally occurring chemical substances.
Any naturally occurring chemical substance, as described in 40 CFR 710.4(b). The applicability of this exclusion is determined in each case by the specific activities of the person who manufactures the chemical substance in question. Some chemical substances can be manufactured both as described in 40 CFR 710.4(b) and by means other than those described in 40 CFR 710.4(b). If a person described in § 711.8 manufactures a chemical substance by means other than those described in 40 CFR 710.4(b), the person must report regardless of whether the chemical substance also could have been produced as described in 40 CFR 710.4(b). Any chemical substance that is produced from such a naturally occurring chemical substance described in 40 CFR 710.4(b) is reportable unless otherwise excluded.
(4)
Water and certain forms of natural gas.
Chemical substances with the following Chemical Abstracts Service Registry Number (CASRN): CASRN 7732-18-5, water; CASRN 8006-14-2, natural gas; CASRN 8006-61-9, gasoline, natural; CASRN 64741-48-6, natural gas (petroleum), raw liq. mix; CASRN 68410-63-9, natural gas, dried; CASRN 68425-31-0, gasoline (natural gas), natural; and CASRN 68919-39-1, natural gas condensates.

(B) Kraft Pulping Process (
i.e.,
CASRN 66071-92-9, Sulfite liquors and Cooking liquors, spent; CASRN 68514-09-0, Sulfite liquors and Cooking liquors, spent, oxidized; and CASRN 471-34-1, Carbonic acid calcium salt (1:1)).
(ii)
Amendments.
EPA may amend the exemptions list in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section on its own initiative or in response to a request from the public based on EPA's determination of whether the byproduct substance and process described meet the criteria explained in this paragraph (d)(1), based on the requirements and considerations listed in paragraphs (d)(1)(ii)(B) and (C) of this section.
(A) Any person may request that EPA amend the chemical substance list in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section. Your request must be in writing and must be submitted to the address provided in 40 CFR 700.17(a). Please label your request as follows: Attention: TSCA Chemical Data Reporting—Byproduct Exemption Request. Requests must identify the manufacturing process and byproduct chemical substance in question, as well as its CASRN or other chemical identification number as identified in 40 CFR 711.15(b)(3)(i), and must contain a written rationale for the request that provides sufficient specific information, addressing the requirements and considerations listed in paragraphs (d)(1)(ii)(B) and (C) of this section, including citations and relevant documents, to demonstrate to EPA that the byproduct substance and process in question either does or does not meet the criteria explained in this paragraph (d)(1). If a request related to a particular byproduct substance and process is resubmitted, any subsequent request must clearly identify new information contained in the request. EPA may request other information that it believes necessary to evaluate the request. EPA will issue a written response to each request within 120 days of receipt of the request and will maintain copies of these responses in a docket that will be established for each reporting cycle.
(B) In making its determination whether this exemption should apply to a particular manufacturing process and related byproduct substance, the following two requirements must be met:
(
1
) The byproduct substance is recycled or otherwise used to manufacture another chemical substance within an enclosed system, within the same overall manufacturing process, and on the same site as that byproduct was originally manufactured.
(
2
) The site is reporting under CDR other chemical substances, in particular a chemical substance other than the byproduct substance that was manufactured from the byproduct or manufactured in the same overall manufacturing process.
(C) In addition to the requirements in paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, EPA will consider the totality of information available for the process and related byproduct substance in question, including but not limited to, one or both of the following considerations:
(
1
) Whether EPA has a current interest in the byproduct substance.
(
2
) Whether the byproduct substance must have already been reported under CDR, or would be expected to be reported if not exempted by this exemption.

For the 2020 submission period: (1) Use column A for chemical substances designated in 2019 as high priority for risk evaluation (those chemicals listed in Table 7 to paragraph (b)(4)(i)(C) and (2) use either column A or B for chemical substances not listed in Table 7 to paragraph (b)(4)(i)(C).
For the 2024 and future submission periods, use only column A.
(B) For each consumer and commercial product category reported under paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(A) of this section, the applicable code(s) described in paragraph (b)(4)(i)(C) of this section must be selected to designate the function category(ies) that best represents the specific manner in which the chemical substance is used. For the 2020 submission period:
(
1
) Use column A in Table 6 to paragraph (b)(4)(i)(C) for chemical substances designated in 2019 as high priority for risk evaluation (those chemicals listed in Table 7 to paragraph (b)(4)(i)(C); and
(
2
) Use either column A or B in Table 6 to paragraph (b)(4)(i)(C) for chemical substances not listed in Table 7 to paragraph (b)(4)(i)(C). For the 2024 and future submission periods, use only column A in Table 6 to paragraph (b)(4)(i)(C). A particular function category may need to be reported more than once, to the extent that a submitter reports more than one consumer or commercial product category (under paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(A) of this section) that applies to a given function category under this paragraph. If none of the listed function categories accurately describes a use of a chemical substance, the category “Other” may be used, and must include a description of the use.
(C) An indication, within each consumer and commercial product category reported under paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(A) of this section, whether the use is a consumer or a commercial use.
(D) Submitters must determine, within each consumer and commercial product category reported under paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(A) of this section, whether any amount of each reportable chemical substance manufactured (including imported) by the submitter is present in (for example, a plasticizer chemical substance used to make pacifiers) or on (for example, as a component in the paint on a toy) any consumer products intended for use by children age 14 or younger, regardless of the concentration of the chemical substance remaining in or on the product. Submitters must select from the following options: The chemical substance is used in or on any consumer products intended for use by children; the chemical substance is not used in or on any consumer products intended for use by children; or information as to whether the chemical substance is used in or on any consumer products intended for use by children is not known to or reasonably ascertainable by the submitter.
(E) The estimated percentage, rounded off to the closest 10 percent, of the submitter's site's total production volume of the reportable chemical substance associated with each consumer and commercial product category. Where a particular consumer and commercial product category accounts for less than 5 percent of the total production volume of a reportable chemical substance, the percentage must not be rounded off to 0 percent if the production volume attributable to that commercial and consumer product category is 25,000 lb (11,340 kg) or more during the reporting year. Instead, in such a case, submitters must report the percentage, rounded off to the closest 1 percent, of the submitter's site's total production volume of the reportable chemical substance associated with the particular consumer and commercial product category.
(F) Where the reportable chemical substance is used in consumer or commercial products, the estimated typical maximum concentration, measured by weight, of the chemical substance in each consumer and commercial product category reported under paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(A) of this section. For each chemical substance in each commercial and consumer product category reported under paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(A) of this section, submitters must select from among the ranges of concentrations listed in Table 3 to paragraph (b)(3)(viii) of this section and report the corresponding code (
i.e.,
M1 through M5).
(G) Where the reportable chemical substance is used in a commercial product, the submitter must estimate the number of commercial workers reasonably likely to be exposed to each reportable chemical substance. For each combination associated with each substance, the submitter must select from among the worker ranges listed in
Table 2 to paragraph (b)(3)(vii) of this section and report the corresponding code (
i.e.,
W1 though W8).

§ 711.20
When to report.
All information reported to EPA in response to the requirements of this part must be submitted during an applicable submission period. The 2024 CDR submission period is from June 1, 2024, to November 22, 2024. Subsequent recurring submission periods are from June 1 to September 30 at 4-year intervals, beginning in 2028. In each submission period, any person described in § 711.8 must report as described in this part.
[85 FR 75238, Nov. 25, 2020, as amended at 89 FR 79152, Sept. 27, 2024]
§ 711.22
Duplicative reporting.
(a)
With regard to TSCA section 8(a) rules.
Any person subject to the requirements of this part who previously has complied with reporting requirements of a rule under TSCA section 8(a) by submitting the information described in § 711.15 for a chemical substance described in § 711.5 to EPA, and has done so within 1 year of the start of a submission period described in § 711.20, is not required to report again on the manufacture of that chemical substance at that site during that submission period.
(b)
With regard to importers.
This part requires that only one report be submitted on each import transaction involving a chemical substance described in § 711.5. When two or more persons are involved in a particular import transaction and each person meets the Agency's definition of “importer” as set forth in 40 CFR 704.3, they may determine among themselves who should submit the required report; if no report is submitted as required under this part, EPA will hold each such person liable for failure to report.
(c)
Co-manufactured chemicals.
This part requires that only one report per site be submitted on each chemical substance described in § 711.5. However, both the contracting company and producing company are liable if no report is made. When a company contracts with a producing company to manufacture a chemical substance, and each party meets the definition of “manufacturer” as set forth in § 711.3, reporting of the co-manufactured chemical can be performed by one of the following methods:
(1) The contracting company initiates the required report for that site as the primary submitter. The contracting company must indicate on the report that this is a co-manufacturing situation, notify the producing company, and record the production volume domestically co-manufactured as set forth in § 711.15(b)(3) and processing and use information set forth in § 711.15(b)(4). Upon notification by the contracting company, the producing company must also record the production volume domestically co-manufactured and complete the rest of the report as prompted by e-CDRweb.
(2) Upon written agreement between the contracting company and the producing company, the producing company completes the full report for the co-manufactured chemical. The contracting company supplies the information not otherwise known to or reasonably ascertainable by the producing company.
[76 FR 54933, Sept. 6, 2011, as amended at 85 FR 20148, Apr. 9, 2020]
§ 711.25
Recordkeeping requirements.
Each person who is subject to the reporting requirements of this part must retain records that document any information reported to EPA. Records relevant to reporting during a submission period must be retained for a period of 5 years beginning on the last day of the submission period. Submitters are encouraged to retain their records longer than 5 years to ensure that past records are available as a reference when new submissions are being generated.
§ 711.30
Confidentiality claims.
(a)
Making confidentiality claims
—(1)
Generally.
Any person submitting information under this part may assert a confidentiality claim for that information at the time it is submitted, except for information described in paragraph (a)(2). Any such confidentiality claims must be asserted at the time the information is submitted. These claims will
apply only to the information submitted with the claim. Instructions for asserting confidentiality claims are provided in the document identified in § 711.35.

Marking information claimed as confidential in confidentiality substantiation documentation.
If any of the information contained in the answers to the questions listed in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section is asserted to contain information that itself is considered to be confidential, you must clearly identify the information that is claimed confidential.
(5)
Certification statement for claims.
An authorized official representing a person asserting a claim of confidentiality must certify that the submission complies with the requirements of this part by signing and dating the following certification statement:
“I certify that all claims for confidentiality asserted with this submission are true and correct, and all information submitted herein to substantiate such claims is true and correct. Any knowing and willful misrepresentation is subject to criminal penalty pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 1001. I further certify that: (1) I have taken reasonable measures to protect the confidentiality of the information; (2) I have determined that the information is not required to be disclosed or otherwise made available to the public under any other Federal law; (3) I have a reasonable basis to conclude that disclosure of the information is likely to cause substantial harm to the competitive position of my company; and (4) I have a reasonable basis to believe that the information is not readily discoverable through reverse engineering.”
(6)
Company, site, and technical contact identity information.
A submitter may assert a claim of confidentiality for a site, company, or technical contact identity to protect the link between that information and the reported chemical substance. Such claim may be asserted only when the linkage of that information to a reportable chemical substance is confidential and not publicly available.
(7)
Processing and use information.
A submitter may assert a claim of confidentiality for each data element required by § 711.15(b)(4)(i)(D), (E) and (F) and § 711.15(b)(4)(ii)(E), (F), and (G) to protect the link between that information and the reported chemical substance. Such claim may be asserted only when the linkage of that information to a reportable chemical substance is confidential and not publicly available.
(b)
All confidentiality claims requiring substantiation at time of submission.

(1) Will disclosure of the information claimed as confidential likely cause substantial harm to your business's competitive position? If you answered
yes, describe the substantial harmful effects that would likely result to your competitive position if the information is disclosed, including but not limited to how a competitor could use such information, and the causal relationship between the disclosure and the harmful effects.
(2) To the extent your business has disclosed the information to others (both internally and externally), has your business taken precautions to protect the confidentiality of the disclosed information? If yes, please explain and identify the specific measures, including but not limited to internal controls, that your business has taken to protect the information claimed as confidential.
(3)(i) Is any of the information claimed as confidential required to be publicly disclosed under any other Federal law? If yes, please explain.
(ii) Does any of the information claimed as confidential otherwise appear in any public documents, including (but not limited to) safety data sheets; advertising or promotional material; professional or trade publications; state, local, or Federal agency files; or any other media or publications available to the general public? If yes, please explain why the information should be treated as confidential.
(iii) Does any of the information claimed as confidential appear in one or more patents or patent applications? If yes, please provide the associated patent number or patent application number (or numbers) and explain why the information should be treated as confidential.
(4) Does any of the information that you are claiming as confidential constitute a trade secret? If yes, please explain how the information you are claiming as confidential constitutes a trade secret.
(5) Is the claim of confidentiality intended to last less than 10 years (see TSCA section 14(e)(1)(B))? If yes, please indicate the number of years (between 1-10 years) or the specific date after which the claim is withdrawn.
(6) Has EPA, another federal agency, or court made any confidentiality determination regarding information associated with this chemical substance? If yes, please provide the circumstances associated with the prior determination, whether the information was found to be entitled to confidential treatment, the entity that made the decision, and the date of the determination.
(c)
Additional requirements for specific chemical identity.
A person may assert a claim of confidentiality for the specific chemical identity of a chemical substance as described in § 711.15(b)(3) of this part only if the identity of that chemical substance is treated as confidential in the Master Inventory File as of the time the report is submitted for that chemical substance. Generic chemical identities and accession numbers may not be claimed as confidential. To assert a claim of confidentiality for the identity of a reportable chemical substance, you must submit with the report detailed written answers to the questions from paragraph (b) of this section and to the following questions.
(1) Is this chemical substance publicly known (including by your competitors) to be in U.S. commerce? If yes, please explain why the specific chemical identity should still be afforded confidential status (
e.g.,
the chemical substance is publicly known only as being distributed in commerce for research and development purposes, but no other information about the current commercial distribution of the chemical substance in the United States is publicly available). If no, please complete the certification statement:
I certify that on the date referenced, I searched the internet for the chemical substance identity (
i.e.,
by both chemical substance name and CASRN). I did not find a reference to this chemical substance that would indicate that the chemical is being manufactured or imported by anyone for a commercial purpose in the United States. [provide date].
(2) Does this particular chemical substance leave the site of manufacture (including import) in any form,
e.g.,
as a product, effluent, emission? If yes, please explain what measures have been taken to guard against the discovery of its identity.
(3) If the chemical substance leaves the site in a form that is available to the public or your competitors, can the
chemical identity be readily discovered by analysis of the substance (
e.g.,
product, effluent, emission), in light of existing technologies and any costs, difficulties, or limitations associated with such technologies? Please explain why or why not.
(4) Would disclosure of the specific chemical name release confidential process information? If yes, please explain.
(d)
Special situations
—(1)
Joint submissions.
If a primary submitter asks a secondary submitter to provide information directly to EPA in a joint submission under § 711.15(b)(3)(i)(A) and (B), only the primary submitter may assert a confidentiality claim for the data elements that it directly submits to EPA. The primary submitter must substantiate those claims that are not exempt under paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section. The secondary submitter is responsible for asserting all confidentiality claims for the data elements that it submits directly to EPA and for substantiating those claims that are not exempt under paragraph (a)(3)(iii) of this section.
(2)
Petitions.
If a petition submitted under § 711.6(b)(2)(iii)(A) or § 711.10(d)(1)(ii)(A) includes any information claimed as confidential, the petitioner must provide a version of the petition that redacts the information claimed as confidential.
(e)
No claim of confidentiality.
Information not claimed as confidential in accordance with the requirements of this section may be made public without further notice to the submitter.

§ 712.3
Definitions.
The definitions in section 3 of TSCA, 15 U.S.C. 2602, apply for this part. In addition, the following definitions apply:
(a)
Byproduct
means any chemical substance or mixture produced without a separate commercial intent during the manufacture, processing, use, or disposal of another chemical substance or mixture.
(b)
EPA
means the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
(c)
Import in bulk form
means to import a chemical substance (other than as part of a mixture or article) in any quantity, in cans, bottles, drums, barrels, packages, tanks, bags, or other containers used for purposes of transportation or containment, if the chemical substance has an end use or commercial purpose separate from the container.
(d)
Importer
means anyone who imports a chemical substance, including a chemical substance as part of a mixture or article, into the customs territory of the U.S. and includes the person liable for the payment of any duties on the merchandise, or an authorized agent on his behalf. Importer also includes, as appropriate:
(1) The consignee.
(2) The importer of record.
(3) The actual owner if an actual owner's declaration and superseding bond has been filed in accordance with 19 CFR 141.20.
(4) The transferee, if the right to withdraw merchandise in a bonded warehouse has been transferred in accordance with subpart C of 19 CFR part 144. For the purposes of this definition, the customs territory of the U.S. consists of the 50 states, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia.
(e)
Impurity
means a chemical substance unintentionally present with another chemical substance or mixture.
(f)
Intermediate
means any chemical substance that is consumed, in whole or in part, in chemical reactions used for the intentional manufacture of other chemical substances or mixtures, or that is intentionally present for the purpose of altering the rates of such chemical reactions. (See also paragraph (j) of this section.)
(g)
Known to or reasonably ascertainable by
means all information in a person's possession or control, plus all information that a reasonable person similarly situated might be expected to possess, control, or know, or could obtain without unreasonable burden.
(h)
Manufacture for commercial purposes
means to import, produce, or manufacture with the purpose of obtaining an immediate or eventual commercial advantage for the manufacturer and includes, among other things, such “manufacture” of any amount of a chemical substance or mixture:
(1) For commercial distribution, including for test marketing.
(2) For use by the manufacturer, including use for product research and development, or as an intermediate. Manufacture for commercial purposes also applies to substances that are produced coincidentally during the manufacture, processing, use, or disposal of another substance or mixture, including byproducts and coproducts that are separated from that other substance or mixture, and impurities that remain in that substance or mixture. Byproducts and impurities may not in themselves have commercial value. They are nonetheless produced for the purpose of obtaining a commercial advantage since they are part of the manufacture of a chemical produced for a commercial purpose.
(i)
Mixture
means any combination of two or more chemical substances if the combination does not occur in nature and is not, in whole or in part, the result of a chemical reaction; except that

§ 712.5
Method of identification of substances for reporting purposes.
(a)
Report on TSCA-regulable quantities.
Unless specifically otherwise required, respondents must report only about quantities of a chemical that is defined as a chemical substance under TSCA section 3(2).
(b)
Chemicals from natural sources.
A manufacturer of a chemical substance which is extracted from an ore, from oil, or from any other natural source must report only about the manufacturing steps for, and the uses of, that chemical, not about production of the natural source material or other crude precursors derived from the natural source material.
For example, persons who manufacture a chemical substance such as “sweetened naphtha, 64741-87-3,” but do not refine the naphtha to produce “hexane, 110-54-3” would not report on hexane. Only the production of “hexane” as an isolated product must be reported—not previous production of more crude, complex substances such as naphtha from which hexane is extracted. Thus, persons who produce crude oil, ores, and other crude natural materials, but do not carry them through further manufacturing steps that produce a listed chemical have no reporting responsibilities under this Part. Note, however, that any method of extraction, refinement, or purification of a listed chemical substance is considered to be manufacturing for the purposes of this rule.
(c)
Chemical substances as marketed.
This part requires reporting about chemical substances as they are marketed or used in practice. The following preparations of a chemical substance must be reported as the substance itself, not as a mixture, since these preparations are regarded as the substance in practice.
(1) The chemical substance in aqueous solution.
(2) The chemical substance containing an additive (such as a stabilizer or other chemical) to maintain the integrity or physical form of the substance.
(3) The chemical substance in any grade of purity.
§ 712.7
Report of readily obtainable information for subparts B and C.
TSCA section 8(a) authorizes EPA to require persons to report information that is known to or reasonably ascertainable by them. For purposes of subpart B, however, a lesser standard applies. Companies must report information that is readily obtainable by management and supervisory employees responsible for manufacturing, processing, distributing, technical services, and marketing. Extensive file searches are not required.
[47 FR 26998, June 22, 1982, as amended at 60 FR 31921, June 19, 1995]
§ 712.15
Confidentiality.
(a) Any person submitting information under this part may assert business confidentiality claims for the information as described in the pertinent reporting form and its instructions. Any information covered by a claim will be disclosed by EPA only as provided in the procedures set forth at 40 CFR part 2.
(b) Persons must certify to the validity of a claim of confidentiality they make for information reported under this part, as specified on the reporting form.
(c) If no claim accompanies the information at the time it is submitted to EPA or if certification as to the claim is not made on the reporting form, EPA may place the information in an open file available to the public without further notice to the submitter.

# Subpart B—Manufacturers Reporting—Preliminary Assessment Information
§ 712.20
Manufacturers and importers who must report.
Except as described in § 712.25, at the time a chemical substance is listed in § 712.3, the following persons must submit the “Manufacturer's Report—Preliminary Assessment Information” (as described in § 712.28) for each plant site at which they manufactured or imported the chemical substance during the reporting period specified in § 712.30:
(a) Persons who manufactured one or more of the chemical substances listed in § 712.30 for commercial purposes.
(b) Persons who imported in bulk form one or more of the chemical substances listed in § 712.30 for commercial purposes.
§ 712.25
Exempt manufacturers and importers.
(a) Persons who manufactured or imported the chemical substance during the reporting period, solely for purposes of scientific experimentation, analysis, or research, including research or analysis for product development, are not subject to reporting under § 712.20.
(b) Persons who, during the reporting period, manufactured or imported fewer than 500 kilograms (1100 pounds) of the chemical substance at a single plant site are not subject to reporting for that site under § 712.20.
(c) Persons who qualify as small manufacturers (including importers) in respect to a specific chemical substance listed in § 712.30 are exempt. However, the exemption in this paragraph (c) does not apply with respect to any chemical in § 712.30 designated by an asterisk. A manufacturer is qualified as small and is exempt from submitting a report under this subpart for a chemical substance manufactured at a particular plant site if it meets the definition for small manufacturer in § 704.3 of this chapter.
(d) Persons are not subject to reporting under § 712.20 if they manufactured or imported the chemical substance during the reporting period only in the following forms:
(1) As a byproduct that was not used or sold or that was formed as described in 40 CFR 710.4(d) (3) through (7).
(2) As a non-isolated intermediate.
(3) As an impurity.
[47 FR 26998, June 22, 1982; 47 FR 28382, June 30, 1982, as amended at 85 FR 31995, May 28, 2020]
§ 712.28
Form and instructions.
(a) Manufacturers and importers subject to this subpart must submit a single EPA Form No. 7710-35, “Manufacturer's Report—Preliminary Assessment Information,” for each plant site manufacturing or importing a chemical substance listed in § 712.30.
(b) Reporting companies may submit their reports through individual plant sites or company headquarters as they choose. A separate form must be submitted for each plant site manufacturing the chemical substance.

§ 713.1
Purpose, scope, and compliance.
(a) This part specifies reporting and recordkeeping procedures under section 8(b)(10) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) (15 U.S.C. 2607(b)(10)) for certain manufacturers (including importers) and processers of mercury as defined in section 8(b)(10)(A) to include elemental mercury and mercury compounds. Hereinafter “mercury” will refer to both elemental mercury and mercury compounds collectively, except where separately identified. Section 8(b)(10)(D) of TSCA authorizes the EPA Administrator to require reporting from any person who manufactures mercury or mercury-added products or otherwise intentionally uses mercury in a manufacturing process to carry out and publish in the
Federal Register
an inventory of mercury supply, use, and trade in the United States. In administering this mercury inventory, EPA is directed to identify any manufacturing processes or products that intentionally add mercury and to recommend actions, including proposed revisions of Federal law or regulations, to achieve further reductions in mercury use. EPA intends to use the collected information to implement TSCA and shape the Agency's efforts to recommend actions, both voluntary and regulatory, to reduce the use of mercury in commerce. In so doing, the Agency will conduct timely evaluation and refinement of these reporting requirements so that they are efficient and non-duplicative for reporters.
(b) This part applies to the activities associated with the periodic publication of information on mercury supply, use, and trade in the United States. Except as described at § 713.7, the reporting requirements for mercury supply, use, and trade apply to the following activities:
(1) Activities undertaken with the purpose of obtaining an immediate or eventual commercial advantage:
(i) Import of mercury;
(ii) Manufacture (other than import) of mercury;
(iii) Import of a mercury-added product;
(iv) Manufacture (other than import) of a mercury-added product; and
(v) Intentional use of mercury in a manufacturing process.
(2) Activities undertaken in relationship to those activities described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section:
(i) Distribution in commerce, including domestic sale or transfer, of mercury;
(ii) Distribution in commerce, including domestic sale or transfer, of a mercury-added product;
(iii) Storage of mercury (including import);
(iv) Export of a mercury compound (unless specifically prohibited); and
(v) Export of a mercury-added product.
(c) Section 15(3) of TSCA makes it unlawful for any person to fail or
refuse to submit information required under this part. In addition, TSCA section 15(3) makes it unlawful for any person to fail to: Establish or maintain records, or permit access to records required by this part. Section 16 of TSCA provides that any person who violates a provision of TSCA section 15 is liable to the United States for a civil penalty and may be criminally prosecuted. Pursuant to TSCA section 17, the Federal Government may seek judicial relief to compel submission of TSCA section 8 information and to otherwise restrain any violation of TSCA section 15.
(d) Each person who reports under this part must certify the accuracy and maintain records of the information reported under this part and, in accordance with TSCA, permit access to, and the copying of, such records by EPA officials.

Such byproducts and impurities may, or may not, in themselves have commercial value. They are nonetheless produced for the purpose of obtaining a commercial advantage since they are part of the manufacture of a chemical product for a commercial purpose.
Manufacturer
means a person who produces or manufactures a chemical substance. A person who extracts a component chemical substance from a previously existing chemical substance or a complex combination of substances is a manufacturer of that component chemical substance.
Person
includes any individual, firm, company, corporation, joint-venture, partnership, sole proprietorship, association, or any other business entity,
any State or political subdivision thereof, any municipality, any interstate body, and any department, agency, or instrumentality of the Federal government.

[48 FR 38187, Aug. 22, 1983, as amended at 50 FR 46769, Nov. 13, 1985]
§ 717.7
Persons not subject to this part.
(a)
Manufacturers.
(1) Persons or site activities are exempt from this part if the means by which they manufacture a chemical substance solely involves mining or other solely extractive functions, e.g., those companies or sites within a company whose sole function is to mine mineral ores, extract petroleum or natural gas, quarry non-metallic minerals (including extraction of salts from seawater or brines), mine or otherwise extract coal, or separate gases from the atmosphere. This exemption may include, but is not necessarily limited to, firms engaged in activities as described in SIC Division B—Mining and SIC Code 2813—Industrial Gases.
(2) A person is not subject to this part if the chemical substances that person causes to be produced are limited to:
(i) Chemical substances that result from chemical reactions that occur incidental to exposure of another chemical substance, mixture, or article to environmental factors such as air, moisture, microbial organisms, or sunlight.
(ii) Chemical substances that result from chemical reactions that occur incidental to storage or disposal of other chemical substances, mixtures, or articles.
(iii) Chemical substances that result from chemical reactions that occur upon end use of other chemical substances, mixtures, or articles such as adhesives, paints, miscellaneous cleaners or other housekeeping products, fuel additives, water softening and treatment agents, photographic films, batteries, matches, or safety flares, and that are not themselves manufactured or imported for distribution in commerce for use as chemical intermediates.

# Subpart B—Applicability
§ 720.22
Persons who must report.
(a)(1) Any person who intends to manufacture a new chemical substance in the United States for commercial purposes must submit a notice unless the substance is excluded under § 720.30.
(2) If a person contracts with a manufacturer to manufacture or produce a new chemical substance, and (i) the manufacturer manufactures or produces the substance exclusively for that person, and (ii) that person specifies the identity of the substance, and controls the total amount produced and the basic technology for the plant process, that person must submit the notice. If it is unclear who must report, EPA should be contacted to determine who must submit the notice.
(3) Only manufacturers that are incorporated, licensed, or doing business in the United States may submit a notice.
(b)(1) Any person who intends to import a new chemical substance into the United States for commercial purposes must submit a notice, unless the substance is excluded under § 720.30 or unless the substance is imported as part of an article.
(2) When several persons are involved in an import transaction, the notice must be submitted by the principal importer. If no one person fits the principal importer definition in a particular transaction, the importer should contact EPA to determine who must submit the notice for that transaction.
§ 720.25
Determining whether a chemical substance is on the Inventory.
(a) A new chemical substance is any chemical substance that is not currently listed on the Inventory.
(b)(1) A chemical substance is listed in the public portion of the Inventory by a specific chemical name (either a Chemical Abstracts (CA) Index Name or a CA Preferred Name) and a Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) Registry Number if its identity is not confidential. If its identity is confidential, it is listed in the public portion of the Inventory by a TSCA Accession Number and a generic chemical name that masks the specific substance identity. The confidential substance is listed by its specific chemical name only in the confidential portion of the Inventory, which is not available to the public. A person who intends to manufacture (including import) a chemical substance not listed by specific chemical name in the public portion of the Inventory may ask EPA whether the substance is included in the confidential Inventory. EPA will answer such an inquiry only if EPA determines that the person has a
bona fide
intent to manufacture (including import) the chemical substance for commercial purposes.
(2) To establish a
bona fide
intent to manufacture (including import) a chemical substance, the person who proposes to manufacture the substance must submit the request to EPA via CDX. Prior to submission to EPA via CDX, such
bona fide
intents to manufacture (including import) must be generated and completed using e-PMN software. See § 720.40(a)(2)(ii) for information on how to access the e-PMN software. A
bona fide
intent to manufacture (including import) must contain:
(i) Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section, the specific chemical identity of the substance that the person intends to manufacture (including import), using the currently correct CA Index name for the substance and the other correct chemical identity information in accordance with § 720.45(a) (1), (2), and (3).
(ii) A signed statement that the person intends to manufacture (including import) that chemical substance for commercial purposes.
(iii)(A) A brief description of the research and development activities conducted to date related to the substance, including the year in which the person first started to conduct research
or development activity on the substance, and the general types of research and development activities conducted thus far (e.g., synthesis, substance isolation/purification, formulating, product development, process development, end-use application, toxicity testing, etc.). The person must also indicate whether any pilot plant or production-scale plant evaluations have been conducted involving the manufacture or processing of the substance.
(B) If an importer is unable to provide the information requested in paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(A) of this section from the foreign manufacturer or supplier, the following information shall be submitted:
(
1
) A brief statement indicating how long the substance has been in commercial use outside of the United States.
(
2
) The name of a country in which it has been commercially used.
(
3
) Whether the importer believes that the substance has already been used commercially, in any country, for the same purpose or application that the importer is intending.
(iv) A specific description of the major intended application or use of the substance.
(v) An infrared spectrum of the substance, or alternative spectra or other data which identify the substance if infrared analysis is not suitable for the substance or does not yield a reasonable amount of structural information. When using alternative spectra or instrumental analysis, the person must submit a spectrum or instrumental readout for the substance.
(vi) The estimated date (month/year) in which the person intends to submit a Premanufacture Notice (PMN) for this substance if EPA informs the notice submitter that the substance is not on the Inventory.
(vii) The address of the facility under the control of the submitter at which the manufacture or processing of the substance would most likely occur. For an imported substance, the facility under the control of the importer at which processing of the substance would likely occur, if any.
(viii)(A) For substances intended to be manufactured in the United States, a description of the most probable manufacturing process that would be used by the submitter to produce the substance for non-exempt commercial purposes.
(B) For substances intended to be imported, a brief description of how the submitter is most likely to process or use the substance for a commercial purpose. If the substance is not expected to be processed or used at any facility under the importer's control, a statement to this effect must be included along with a description of how the substance will be processed or used at sites controlled by others, if this information is known or reasonably ascertainable.
(3)(i) If an importer cannot provide the chemical identity information required by paragraph (b)(2) (i) and (v) of this section because it is claimed confidential by its foreign manufacturer or supplier, the foreign manufacturer or supplier must supply the required information directly to EPA in accordance with § 720.45(a) (1), (2), and (3) and reference the importer's notice. If the appropriate supporting document from the foreign party is not received within 30 days after EPA receives the importer's notice, the notice will be considered incomplete.
(ii) If a manufacturer cannot provide all of the required information in accordance with § 720.45(a) (1), (2), and (3) because the new chemical substance is manufactured using a reactant that has a specific chemical identity claimed as confidential by its supplier, the notice must contain chemical identity information that is as complete as known by the manufacturer. In addition, a letter of support for the notice must then be sent to EPA by the chemical supplier of the confidential reactant, providing the specific chemical identity of the proprietary reactant. The letter of support must reference the manufacturer's notice. If the appropriate supporting document from the supplier is not received within 30 days after EPA receives the manufacturer's notice, the notice will be considered incomplete.
(4) EPA will review the information submitted by the proposed manufacturer (including importer) under this paragraph to determine whether it has
a
bona fide
intent to manufacture (including import) the chemical substance. If necessary, EPA will compare this information to the information requested for the confidential chemical substance under § 720.85(b)(3)(iii).
(5) If the proposed manufacturer (including importer) has shown a
bona fide
intent to manufacture (including import) the substance, and has provided sufficient unambiguous chemical identity information so EPA can make a conclusive determination of the chemical substance's Inventory status, EPA will search the confidential Inventory and inform the proposed manufacturer (including importer) whether the chemical substance is on the confidential Inventory.
(6) If the chemical substance is found on the confidential Inventory, EPA will notify the person(s) who originally reported the chemical substance that another person has demonstrated a
bona fide
intent to manufacture (including import) the substance and therefore was told that the chemical substance is on the Inventory.
(7) A disclosure of a confidential chemical identity to a person with a
bona fide
intent to manufacture (including import) the particular chemical substance will not be considered a public disclosure of confidential business information under section 14 of the Act.
(8) EPA will answer an inquiry on whether a particular chemical substance is on the confidential Inventory within 30 days after receipt of a complete submission under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
(9) If the required chemical identity information has not been reported correctly or completely in the notice (except as provided under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section) or if any other required data or information has been omitted or is incomplete, EPA will consider the whole notice to be incomplete. As soon as an incomplete notice is identified as such by EPA, the Agency will immediately return the notice directly to the submitter. The submitter must then resubmit the whole, completed
bona fide
notice to EPA in order to have the Agency perform the desired Inventory search and respond to the notice.

§ 720.65
Acknowledgement of receipt of a notice; errors in the notice; incomplete submissions; and false and misleading statements.
(a)
Notification to the submitter.
(1) EPA will acknowledge receipt of each notice by sending a letter via CDX or U.S. mail to the submitter that identifies the premanufacture notice number assigned to the new chemical substance and date on which the applicable review period begins as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
(2) Before EPA sends an acknowledgement of receipt of a notice pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section, EPA will conduct a pre-screen of the notice, typically taking 2-3 days and according to the criteria under paragraphs (b)(1) and (c)(1) of this section.
(i) If EPA concludes that the notice contains errors warranting remedy or is incomplete, EPA will notify the submitter according to paragraph (d)(3) of this section. The applicable review period will not begin. Once the submitter corrects the errors or incomplete submission according to the requirements provided by EPA and re-submits the notice to EPA, EPA will follow the procedures of paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
(ii) If EPA does not identify errors or determine the notice to be incomplete during screening, EPA will notify the submitter according to paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The applicable review period will begin on the date EPA received the complete notice.
(b)
Errors in the notice.
(1) Within 30 days of receipt of the notice, EPA may request that the submitter remedy errors in the notice. The following are examples of such errors:
(i) Typographical errors that cause data to be misleading or answers to any questions to be unclear.
(ii) Contradictory information.
(iii) Ambiguous statements or information.
(2) The applicable review period does not begin for notices containing errors that EPA asks the submitter to remedy until corrections are made following the procedures of paragraph (d) of this section.
(c)

(iii) In the absence of sufficient information to permit EPA to make such an evaluation, the chemical substance may present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment, as set forth in section 5(a)(3)(B)(ii)(I) of the Act.
(iv) The chemical substance is or will be produced in substantial quantities,
and such substance either enters or may reasonably be anticipated to enter the environment in substantial quantities or there is or may be significant or substantial human exposure to the substance, as set forth in section 5(a)(3)(B)(ii)(II) of the Act.
(v) The chemical substance is not likely to present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment, as set forth in section 5(a)(3)(C) of the Act.
(2) EPA will take the following actions required in association with the determination:
(i) For determinations described in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section, EPA will issue the submitter an order to prohibit or limit the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, use, or disposal of the chemical substance, or any combination of such activities, to the extent necessary to protect against an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment, as set forth in section 5(f) of the Act, or will issue a proposed rule under section 6(a) of the Act, as set forth in section 5(f) of the Act.
(ii) For determinations described in paragraphs (d)(1)(ii), (iii), or (iv) of this section, EPA will issue the submitter an order to prohibit or limit the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, use, or disposal of the chemical substance, or any combination of such activities, to the extent necessary to protect against an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment, as set forth in section 5(e) of the Act. EPA may issue an order under section 5(e) of the Act that requires certain testing to be conducted and presented to EPA after the applicable review period has concluded.
(iii) For determinations described in paragraph (d)(1)(v) of this section, EPA will issue the submitter a document containing EPA's final determination and will submit for publication in the
Federal Register
a statement of the finding, as set forth in section 5(g) of the Act. Upon EPA's issuance of the determination document, the submitter may commence the manufacture of the chemical substance without waiting for the end of the applicable review period.
(3) EPA may modify or revoke the prohibitions and limitations in an order issued under paragraph (d)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section after the applicable review period has ended if EPA receives additional testing, studies, reports, or other information that EPA determines, upon review, demonstrate that such prohibitions or limitations are no longer necessary to protect against an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment. Where such information demonstrates that the prohibitions or limitations of the order are not sufficient to protect against an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment, EPA may modify the order or take other action, as appropriate, to the extent necessary to protect against such risk.
(4) No person submitting a notice in response to the requirements of this part may manufacture a chemical substance subject to this part until EPA has issued a determination in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section and taken the associated action required under paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
(e)
Withdrawal of a notice by the submitter.

(2) If manufacture for commercial purposes began or will begin before the effective date of this rule, the submitter must submit the notice by the effective date of this rule.
(c)
Information to be reported on form.
(1) The notice must be submitted on EPA Form 7710-56, which is available as part of EPA's e-PMN software. See § 720.40(a)(2)(iv) for information on how to obtain e-PMN software. The form must be signed and dated by an Authorized Official (AO). All information specified on the form must be provided. The notice must contain the following information:
(i) The specific chemical identity of the PMN substance.
(ii) A generic chemical name (if the chemical identity is claimed as confidential by the submitter).
(iii) The premanufacture notice (PMN) number assigned by EPA.
(iv) The date of commencement for the submitter's manufacture for a non-exempt commercial purpose (indicating whether the substance was initially manufactured in the United States or imported). The date of commencement is the date of completion of non-exempt manufacture of the first amount (batch, drum, etc.) of new chemical substance identified in the submitter's PMN. For importers, the date of commencement is the date the new chemical substance clears United States customs.
(v) The name and address of the submitter.
(vi) The name of the authorized official.
(vii) The name and telephone number of a technical contact in the United States.
(viii) The address of the site where commencement of manufacture occurred.
(ix) Clear indications of whether the chemical identity, submitter identity, and/or other information are claimed as confidential by the submitter.
(2) If the submitter claims any information on the form as confidential, the claim must be asserted and substantiated in accordance with the requirements described in 40 CFR part 703 and must be submitted via EPA Form 7710-56. If the submitter wants the chemical identity to be listed on the confidential portion of the TSCA Inventory, the chemical identity must be claimed as confidential and the submitter must also follow the certification, substantiation, and generic name requirements described 40 CFR part 703 and paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section. Otherwise, EPA will list the specific chemical identity on the public TSCA Inventory. Submitters who did not claim the chemical identity, submitter identity, or other information to be confidential in the PMN cannot claim this information as confidential in the notice of commencement.
(d)(1)
Where to submit.
All notices of commencement must be submitted to EPA on EPA Form 7710-56. Notices may only be submitted in a manner set forth in this paragraph.
(2)
Submission of notice of commencement.
EPA will accept notices of commencement only if submitted in accordance with this paragraph. All notices of commencement must be submitted electronically to EPA via CDX. Prior to submission to EPA via CDX, such notices of commencement must be generated and completed using e-PMN software. See § 720.40(a)(2)(ii) for information on how to obtain e-PMN software.
(e)
Confidentiality.
(1) Any person who asserts a confidentiality claim for chemical identity in a Notice of Commencement submitted under this section must:
(i) Comply with generic name requirements described in 40 CFR part 703 and as specified in paragraph (f) of this section.
(ii) Agree that EPA may disclose to a person with a
bona fide
intent to manufacture or import the chemical substance the fact that the particular chemical substance is included on the confidential TSCA Inventory for purposes of notification under section 5(a)(1)(A) of the Act.
(iii) Have available for the particular chemical substance, and agree to furnish to EPA upon request:
(A) An elemental analysis.
(B) Either an X-ray diffraction pattern (for inorganic substances), a mass spectrum (for most other substances), or an infrared spectrum of the particular chemical substance, or if such data do not resolve uncertainties with respect to the identity of the chemical substance, additional or alternative spectra or other data to identify the chemical substance.
(2) Claims of confidentiality must be made in accordance with the procedures described in 40 CFR part 703.
(f)
Generic name.
If a submitter asserts a claim of confidentiality for chemical identity in a notice of commencement, they must provide a structurally descriptive generic name.
(1) Generic names must:
(i) Be structurally descriptive (e.g., not a trade name);
(ii) Describe the chemical structure of the chemical substance as specifically as practicable while protecting only those features of the chemical structure that are claimed as confidential and disclosure of which would likely cause substantial harm to the competitive position of the person—the generic name should generally only obscure one structural feature, but in any case, should conceal only the feature(s) necessary to avoid a likelihood of substantial competitive harm to the submitter; and
(iii) Be consistent with guidance on the determination of structurally descriptive generic names, developed in accordance with TSCA section 14(c)(4)(A) (e.g., Guidance for Creating Generic Names for Confidential Chemical Substance Identity Reporting under TSCA; available at
https://www.epa.gov/tsca-inventory/guidance-creating-generic-names-confidential-chemical-substance-identity-reporting
).
(2) Generic names will be reviewed by EPA at the time of submission.
(i) If EPA concludes that a proposed generic name meets the criteria in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, EPA will include that generic name in the public TSCA Inventory listing for that substance.
(ii) If the proposed generic name does not meet the criteria in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, EPA will notify the submitter concerning the deficiency via CDX, as described in 40 CFR 703.5(f). EPA will provide 10 business days to correct the deficiency and provide an alternative generic name that would be acceptable to EPA. If the alternative generic name proposed by EPA is acceptable to the submitter (or if the submitter does not respond within the 10-day period), EPA will place that alternative generic name on the public TSCA Inventory. If the alternative generic name proposed by EPA is not acceptable to the submitter, the submitter must submit a revised generic name that meets the criteria in paragraph (f)(1) of this section and an explanation of how EPA's proposed generic name reveals confidential information. If EPA concludes that the submitter's revised generic name also does not meet the criteria in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, EPA will hold the notice of commencement for a period of up to 10 business days. Reporting requirements will not be considered to have been met and the substance will not be added to the TSCA Inventory during this period. If the submission remains deficient after this 10-day period, EPA will proceed with CBI review of the chemical identity claim and will likely deny the claim.
