§ 21.4146
Assignments of benefits prohibited.
(a)
General.
Section 5301(a), Title 38 U.S.C., provides that payments of benefits due or to become due under the laws administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs shall not be assigned, except to the extent specifically authorized by law. No law specifically authorizes assignments of educational assistance allowances payable under 38 U.S.C. chapters 30, 32, 33, 35, or 36, or 10 U.S.C. chapter 1606, and therefore none shall be made.
(b)
Designating an attorney-in-fact.
In any case where a payee of an educational assistance allowance has designated the address of an attorney-in-fact as the payee's address for the purpose of receiving his or her benefit check and has executed a power of attorney giving the attorney-in-fact authority to negotiate such benefit check, such action shall be deemed to be an assignment and is prohibited.
(c)
Arrangements amounting to an assignment.
Payments may be made to a post office box address or a bank address only if the educational institution (other than an organization or entity offering a licensing or certification test) attests that it has not entered into an assignment agreement with the student, and is not the attorney-in-fact of the student with power to negotiate an educational assistance
check on behalf of the student and is not otherwise able to control the proceeds of the benefits check. Such statements shall be subject to review and when determined to be false, may be cause for creation of an overpayment to the account of the veteran or other eligible person, for which the educational institution (other than an organization or entity offering a licensing or certification test) may be liable under the provisions of § 21.4009.
(d)
Correspondence school addresses.
A request by a veteran or other eligible person to send the benefit check payable to him or her at an address which is an educational institution primarily engaged in correspondence course instruction will be presumed not to be the actual address of the veteran or other eligible person and will not be honored. Benefits checks will not be sent to the veteran or other eligible person in that event until a new address is provided designating the individual's mailing address.
(e)
Referral to Committee on Educational Allowances.
When the evidence of record indicates that an educational institution has violated the terms of this section, the matter will be referred to the facility Committee on Educational Allowances as provided in §§ 21.4210(g) and 21.4212.

Computations will not be made for unit subjects, unless only one unit subject is approved by the State approving agency to be offered at a separate branch or extension of a school. Courses or curricula which are offered at separately approved branches or extensions, as well as courses or curricula leading to a secondary school diploma or equivalency certificate offered at any branch or extension, must have an 85-15 percent ratio computed separately from the same course offered at the parent institution. The count of students attending the branch may not be added to those attending the parent institution even for the same courses or curricula. However, the count of those attending courses or curricula offered at an additional facility, as opposed to a branch or extension, must be added to those attending the same course at the parent institution. Pursuit of a course or curriculum that varies in any way from a similar course, although it may have the same designation as the other similar course or curriculum, will require a separate 85-15 percent computation. A course or curriculum will be considered to vary from another if there are different attendance requirements, required unit subjects are different, required completion length is different, etc.
(i) Separate courses for computation purposes in institutions of higher learning will be determined by general curriculum only until the point at which it is reasonable to assume a major field would be declared and after that point by specific curriculum.
(A) General 2-year curricula at 2-year institutions of higher learning, general curricula such as AA (Associate of Arts) or AS (Associate of Science) degrees with no major specified, will require separate computations for each curriculum. Terminal 2-year courses (
i.e.
, AAS (Associate of Applied Science), dental technology or auto mechanics certificate) and other associate degree courses where a field is specified must be computed separately for each objective.
(B) Students attending 4-year institutions of higher learning and graduate schools may be counted in general curricula such as BA (Bachelor of Art) and BS (Bachelor of Science) only until the normal point at which the school requires the student to declare a major subject. Then the 85-15 percent computation must be made for each specific curriculum,
i.e.
, BS (Bachelor of Science) in electrical engineering, MA (Master of Arts) in English, etc.
(ii) NCD (noncollege degree) courses must be computed separately by approved vocational objective. If several curricula lead to the same coded vocational objective, each must meet the 85-15 percent requirement separately, unless it can be shown that two or more courses are identical in all respects (scheduling, hours devoted to each unit subject, etc.). Branch or extension courses will be computed separately from courses at the parent facility. Courses offered on a full- and part-time basis which are identical in length and content will be combined for computing the ratio.
(2)
Assigning students to each part of the ratio.
In accordance with the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section,
non-supported students
are those students enrolled in the course who are having none of their tuition, fees or
other charges paid for them by the educational institution, or by VA under title 38, U.S.C., or under title 10, U.S.C., while
supported students
are those students enrolled in the course who are in receipt of institutional aid or VA educational assistance benefits (
i.e.,
having all or part of their tuition, fees or other charges paid for them by the educational institution, or by VA under chapter 36, title 38, United States Code, or under title 10, United States Code.).
Institutional aid
does not include Federal, state, or municipal grant funding, nor does it include matching funds provided by the educational institution through participation in such Federal, state, or municipal grant programs. Recipients of these funds are to be counted as non-supported students barring receipt of other institutional aid or VA educational assistance benefits.
(3)
Calculation.
(i) To determine if the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section has been met for all courses except flight courses the full-time equivalent, nonsupported students as defined by paragraph (e)(2) of this section will be compared to the full-time equivalent students enrolled in the course. If the full-time equivalent, nonsupported students do not equal at least 15 percent of the total full-time enrollment, the 85-15 percent requirement has not been met for the course. If a non-Department of Veterans Affairs student in a correspondence course has not completed a lesson nor made a payment toward the cost of the course during the 6-month period immediately prior to the computation, the student will not be counted in computing the 85-15 percent ratio.
(ii) The 85-15 percent ratio for flight courses shall be computed by comparing the number of hours of training received by or tuition charged to nonsupported students in the preceding 30 days to the total number of hours of training received by or tuition charged to all students in the same period. All approved courses offered under 14 CFR parts 141 and 142 at a flight school will be considered to be one course for the purpose of making this computation. Similarly, all other approved courses offered at a flight school will be considered to be one course for the purpose of making this computation. In this computation hours of training or tuition charges for students enrolled—
(A) In the recreational pilot certification course and the private pilot certification course will be excluded;
(B) In a ground instructor certification course will be included;
(C) In courses approved under 14 CFR part 141, other than a ground instructor certification course, will be actual hours of logged instructional flight time or the charges for those hours; and
(D) In courses not approved under 14 CFR part 141, such as courses offered by flight simulator or courses for navigator or flight engineer, shall include ground training time or charges; actual logged instructional flight time or charges; and instructional time in a flight simulator or charges for that training.

(f)
Reports.
(1) Schools must submit to VA all calculations (those needed to support the exemption found in paragraph (c)(4) of this section as well as those made under paragraph (e)(3) of this section). If the school is organized on a term, quarter, or semester basis, it shall make that submission no later than 30 days after the beginning of the first term for which the school wants the exemption to apply. If the school is organized on a non-standard term basis, it shall make its submission no later than 30 days after the beginning of the first non-standard term for which the school wishes the exemption to apply. A school having received an exemption found in paragraph (c)(4) of this section shall not be required to certify that 85 percent or less of the total student enrollment in any course is receiving Department of Veterans Affairs assistance:
(i) Unless the Director of the VA facility of jurisdiction has reason to believe that the enrollment of eligible veterans and eligible persons in a specific course may exceed 85 percent of the total enrollment in a specific course, or
(ii) Until such time as the total number of veterans, eligible persons and reservists receiving assistance under 38
U.S.C. chapters 30, 31, 32, 33, 35 and 36, and 10 U.S.C. chapter 1606, who are enrolled in the educational institution offering the course, equals more than 35 percent of the total student enrollment at the educational institution (computed separately for the main campus and any branch or extension of the institution). At that time the procedures contained in paragraph (f)(2) of this section shall apply.
(Authority: 10 U.S.C. 16136(b); 38 U.S.C. 3034(a), 3241(a), 3323(a), 3680A(d))
(2) The school must submit all calculations made under paragraph (e)(3) of this section to the Department of Veterans Affairs according to these time limits.
(i) If the school is organized on a term, quarter or semester basis, the calculations must be submitted no later than 30 days after the beginning of each regular school term (excluding summer sessions), or before the beginning date of the next term, whichever occurs first.
(ii) If a school is organized on a non-standard term basis, reports must be received by the Department of Veterans Affairs no later than 30 days after the beginning of each non-standard term.
(g)
Effect of the 85-15 percent ratio on processing new enrollments.
(1) The Department of Veterans Affairs will process new enrollments of eligible veterans (and servicepersons where this provision applies to them), in a course on the basis of the school's submission of the most recent computation showing that:
(i) The 85-15 percent ratio is satisfactory, or
(ii) The course is exempt under paragraph (c)(4) of this section.
(2) Except for those enrollments with a beginning date before or the same as the date the school completed the most recent computation, no benefits will be paid under 10 U.S.C. chapter 1606 or under 38 U.S.C. chapter 30, 32, 33, or 36, when that computation establishes that the course:
(Authority: 10 U.S.C. 16136(b); 38 U.S.C. 3034(a), 3241(a), 3323(a), 3680A(d))
(i) Neither has a satisfactory 85-15 percent ratio, nor
(ii) Is exempt under paragraph (c)(4) of this section.
(Authority: 10 U.S.C. 16136(b); 38 U.S.C. 3034(a), 3241(a), 3323(a), 3680A(d))
(3) If a school fails to submit a timely computation, no benefits will be paid for:
(i) The enrollment of a serviceperson in a course leading to a secondary school diploma or an equivalency certificate if the enrollment has beginning dates beyond the expiration of the allowable computation period, or
(ii) The enrollment of a veteran in any course to which the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section apply if the enrollment has beginning dates beyond the expiration of the allowable computation period.
(4) Enrollments with later beginning dates may be processed only after the school certifies that:
(i) The proper ratio has been reestablished for the course, or
(ii) The course is exempt from the requirement under paragraph (c)(4) of this section.
(5) When a school shows a reestablished 85-15 percent ratio, each new veteran enrollment or enrollment of a serviceperson in a course leading to a secondary school diploma or an equivalency certificate which is submitted after reestablishment must be individually computed into the ratio to ensure that the 85 percent limitation is not again immediately exceeded. The Department of Veterans Affairs will require individual computations until:
(i) The end of the term for which the ratio was reestablished, or
(ii) The end of the calendar quarter during which the ratio was reestablished if the school is not operated on a term, quarter or semester basis.
(Authority: 10 U.S.C. 16136(b); 38 U.S.C. 3034(a), 3241(a), 3323(a), 3680A(d))
(6) Once a student is properly enrolled in a course which either meets the 85-15 percent requirement or which is exempt pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, such a student may not have benefits for that course terminated because the 85-15 percent requirement subsequently is not met or because the course loses its exemption,
as long as the student's enrollment remains continuous. A student enrolled in an institution organized on a term basis need not attend summer sessions in order to maintain continuous enrollment. An enrollment may also be considered continuous if a “break” in enrollment is wholly due to circumstances beyond the student's control such as serious illness.
(h)
Waivers.
Schools which desire a waiver of the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section for a course where the number of full-time equivalent supported students receiving VA education benefits equals or exceeds 85 percent of the total full-time equivalent enrollment in the course may apply for a waiver to the Director, Education Service. When applying, a school must submit sufficient information to allow the Director, Education Service, to judge the merits of the request against the criteria shown in this paragraph. This information and any other pertinent information available to VA shall be considered in relation to these criteria:
(1) Availability of comparable alternative educational facilities effectively open to veterans in the vicinity of the school requesting a waiver.
(2) General effectiveness of the school's program in providing educational and employment opportunities to the particular veteran population it serves. Factors to be considered should include, but are not limited to: percentage of veteran-students completing the entire course, graduate employment statistics, graduate salary statistics, satisfaction of Department of Education requirements regarding gainful employment (where applicable), other Department of Education metrics (such as student loan default rate), student complaints, industry endorsements, participation in and compliance with the Principles of Excellence program, established by Executive Order 13607 (where applicable), etc.
(3) Whether the educational institution's aid program appears to be consistent with or appears to undermine the 85/15 rule's tuition and fee costs market validation mechanism.

(v) Where a veteran or an eligible person, who is pursuing a course leading to a standard college degree, transfers between consecutive school terms from one approved institution to another approved institution, for the purpose of enrolling in, and pursuing, a similar course at the second institution, the veteran or eligible person shall, for the purpose of entitlement to the payment of educational assistance allowance be considered to be enrolled at the first institution during the interval, if the interval does not exceed 30 days, following the termination date of the school term of the first institution.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3680)
(c)
Nonpunitive grade.
A school may assign a nonpunitive grade for a course
or subject in which the veteran or eligible person is enrolled even though the veteran or eligible person does not withdraw from the course or subject. When this occurs, the school must report the assignment of the nonpunitive grade in a form specified by the Secretary in time for VA to receive it before the earlier of the following dates is reached:
(1) Thirty days from the date on which the school assigns the grade, or
(2) Sixty days from the last day of the enrollment period for which the nonpunitive grade is assigned.

If the course in which the veteran or eligible person is enrolled does not lead to a standard college degree, and attendance must be certified for the course, the school may include the information on the monthly certification of attendance.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3684(a), 1788(a); Pub. L. 99-576)
(2) If the enrollment of the veteran or eligible person has been certified by the school for more than one term, quarter or semester and the veteran or eligible person interrupts or terminates his or her training at the end of a term, quarter or semester within the certified period of enrollment, the school shall report the change in status to the Department of Veterans Affairs in time for the Department of Veterans Affairs to receive the report within 30 days of the last officially scheduled registration date for the next term, quarter or semester.
(3) If the change in status or change in the number of hours of credit or attendance occurs during the 30 days of a drop-add period, the school must report the change in status or change in the number of hours of credit or attendance to the Department of Veterans Affairs in time for the Department of Veterans Affairs to receive the report within 30 days from the last date of drop-add period or 60 days from the first day of the enrollment period, whichever occurs first.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3684(a))
(e)
Correspondence courses.
Where the course in which a veteran is enrolled under 38 U.S.C. chapter 34 or a spouse or surviving spouse is enrolled under 38 U.S.C. chapter 35 is pursued exclusively by correspondence, the school will report by an endorsement on the veteran's or eligible spouse's or surviving spouse's certification the number of lessons completed by the veteran, spouse or surviving spouse and serviced by the school. Such reports will be submitted quarterly in a form specified by the Secretary.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3680)
(f)
Certification.
All reports required by this paragraph must be in a form specified by the Secretary.
(1)
Courses not leading to a standard college degree.
(i) Except as provided in this paragraph VA requires that a certification of attendance be submitted monthly for each veteran or eligible person enrolled in a course not leading to a standard college degree. The fact that the course may be pursued on a quarter, semester or term basis will not relieve the veteran or eligible person and the school of this requirement. Unless exempted by this paragraph this requirement also applies to courses measured on a credit-hour basis. This requirement does not apply to—
(A) Courses measured on a credit-hour basis pursuant to footnote 6 of § 21.4270(a),
(B) A course pursued on a less than one-half-time basis,
(C) A course pursued by a serviceperson while on active duty, or

(h)
Unsatisfactory progress, conduct or attendance.
At times the unsatisfactory progress, conduct or attendance of a veteran or eligible person is caused by or results in his or her interruption or termination of training. If this occurs, the interruption or termination shall be reported in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section. If the veteran or eligible person continues in training despite unsatisfactory progress, conduct, or despite having failed to meet the regularly prescribed standards of attendance at the school, the school must report the fact of his or her unsatisfactory progress, conduct or attendance to VA within the time limit allowed by paragraph (h) (1) and (2) of this section.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3474, 3524)
(1) A veteran's or eligible person's progress may become unsatisfactory according to the regularly prescribed standards and practices of the school as a result of the grades he or she receives The school shall report such unsatisfactory progress to VA in time for VA to receive it before the earlier of the following dates is reached:
(i) Thirty days from the date on which the school official, who is responsible for determining whether a student is making progress, first received the final grade report which establishes that the veteran either is not progressing satisfactorily, or
(ii) Sixty days from the last day of the enrollment period during which the veteran or eligible person earned the grades that caused him or her not to meet the satisfactory progress standards.
(2) If the unsatisfactory progress, conduct or attendance of the veteran or eligible person is caused by any factors other than the grades which he or she receives, the school shall report the unsatisfactory progress, conduct or attendance to VA in time for VA to receive it within 30 days of the date on which the progress, conduct or attendance of the veteran or eligible person becomes unsatisfactory.

§ 21.4206
Reporting fee.
VA will pay annually to each educational institution furnishing education or to each joint apprenticeship training committee acting as a training facility under 10 U.S.C. 510, chapter 1606, or chapter 1607 or 38 U.S.C. 30, 32, 33, 35, or 36 a reporting fee for required reports or certifications. The reporting fee will be paid as soon as feasible after the end of the calendar year.
(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section the reporting fee will be computed for each calendar year by multiplying $7.00 by the number of eligible veterans and eligible persons enrolled under 10 U.S.C. chapter 1606, or 38 U.S.C. chapter 30, 32, 33, 35 or 36 during that calendar year.
(b) In computing the reporting fee, VA will not count an eligible individual whose only receipt of educational assistance during a calendar year was tuition assistance Top-Up under 38 U.S.C. chapter 30, a rural relocation payment, or reimbursement for a national test for admission, national test for credit, or a licensing or certification test.
(c) An additional $4 will be paid to those institutions which have delivered to the veteran or eligible person at registration the educational assistance check representing an advance payment, or which have delivered educational loan checks in accordance with the provisions of subpart F. If an institution delivers both an advance payment check and educational loan check(s) to the same veteran or eligible person within 1 calendar year, it shall receive only one additional $4 fee. In order to receive this fee, the institution shall submit to the Department of Veterans Affairs a certification of delivery of each check. If an advance payment check is not delivered within 30 days after commencement of the student's program, the check is to be returned to the Department of Veterans Affairs. If an education loan check is not delivered within 30 days of the date the educational institution received it, the check shall be returned to the Department of Veterans Affairs.

§ 21.4211
Composition, jurisdiction, and duties of Committee on Educational Allowances.
(a)
Authority.
(1) 38 U.S.C. 3690 authorizes VA to discontinue educational benefits to veterans, servicemembers, reservists, or eligible persons when VA finds that:
(i) The program of education or course in which such individuals are enrolled fails to meet a requirement of 38 U.S.C. chapter 30, 32, 33, 35, or 36, or 10 U.S.C. chapter 1606, or the regulations in this part; or
(ii) An educational institution has violated any such statute or regulation, or fails to meet such a statutory or regulatory requirement.
(2) This authority does not extend to enrollments and reenrollments of individuals seeking to be paid tuition assistance top-up benefits to meet all or a portion of an educational institution's charges for education or training that the military department concerned has not covered under tuition assistance.
(3) 38 U.S.C. 3689 and 3690 further authorize VA to deny payment to servicemembers or veterans for licensing or certification tests when VA finds that either the test or the organization or entity offering the test fails to meet a requirement of 38 U.S.C. 3689 or the applicable regulations of this part.
(4) Sections 21.4210 through 21.4216 implement the authority discussed in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(3) of this section.
(5) Each VA Regional Processing Office shall have a Committee on Educational Allowances. For the purposes of this section, the Manila Regional Office is considered the VA Regional Processing Office of jurisdiction for educational institutions located in the Philippines. The Committee's findings of fact and recommendations will be provided to the Director of the VA Regional Processing Office.
(6) The Secretary of Veterans Affairs delegates to each Director of a VA Regional Processing Office the authority to suspend or discontinue payment of educational benefits, to disapprove enrollments or reenrollments, or to deny payment of benefits for tests.
(Authority: 10 U.S.C. 16136(b); 38 U.S.C. 512(a), 3034(a), 3323(a), 3241(a), 3689(d), 3690)
(b)
Purpose.
(1) The Committee on Educational Allowances is established to assist the Director of the VA Regional Processing Office of jurisdiction in deciding in a specific case whether—
(i) Educational assistance should be discontinued to all individuals enrolled in any course or courses an educational institution offers; and
(ii) If appropriate, whether approval of all further enrollments or reenrollments in the course or courses an educational institution offers should be denied to veterans, servicemembers, reservists, or other eligible persons pursuing those courses under programs VA administers; or
(iii) Payment should be denied to all servicemembers and veterans for taking a specific licensing or certification test.
(2) A Director's decision described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section must be based on a finding that the educational institution is not meeting, or has violated, a requirement of 38 U.S.C. chapter 30, 32, 33, 35, or 36, or 10 U.S.C. chapter 1606, or the regulations in this part.
(3) The function of the Committee on Educational Allowances is to develop facts and recommend action to be taken on the basis of the facts found. A hearing before the Committee is not in the nature of a trial in a court of law. Instead, it is an administrative inquiry designed to create a full and complete record upon which a recommendation can be made as to whether the Director should discontinue payment of educational benefits and/or deny approval of new enrollments or reenrollments. Both the interested educational institution and VA Regional Counsel, or designee, representing VA, will be afforded the opportunity to present to the Committee any evidence, argument, or other material considered pertinent.
(Authority: 10 U.S.C. 16136(b); 38 U.S.C. 3034(a), 3323(a), 3241(a), 3689(d), 3690)
(c)

(d)
Committee members.
The Committee on Educational Allowances will consist of three employees of the VA Regional Processing Office of jurisdiction, at least one of whom is familiar with the adjudication of claims for benefits administered by the Veterans Benefits Administration. The Director of the VA Regional Processing Office of jurisdiction will designate a Chairperson. In the event that any member becomes unable to serve for any reason, the Director may appoint a replacement member. Before the Committee resumes its proceedings, the new member will be given an opportunity to apprise himself or herself of the actions and testimony already taken by the Committee.
(Authority: 10 U.S.C. 16136(b); 38 U.S.C. 3034(a), 3323(a), 3241(a), 3689(d), 3690)
(e)
Duties and responsibilities of the Committee.
(1) The function of the Committee on Educational Allowances is to make recommendations to the Director of the VA Regional Processing Office of jurisdiction in connection with specific cases referred for consideration as provided in §§ 21.4210(g) and 21.4212.

§ 21.4214
Hearing rules and procedures for Committee on Educational Allowances.
(a)
Rule 1.
The Chairperson of the Committee on Educational Allowances will be in charge of the proceedings, will administer oaths or affirmations to witnesses, and will be responsible for the official conduct of the hearing. A majority of the members of the Committee will constitute a quorum. No party to the proceedings may conduct a
voir dire
of the Committee members.

(b)
Rule 2.
At the opening of the hearing, the Chairperson of the Committee on Educational Allowances will inform the educational institution of the purpose of the hearing, the nature of the evidence of record relating to the asserted failures or violations, and the applicable provisions of law and VA regulations. The Chairperson will advise the VA Regional Counsel, or designee, representing VA, that the Committee on Educational Allowances will entertain any relevant evidence or witnesses which VA Counsel presents to the Committee and which would substantiate a decision by the Committee to recommend that the Director of the VA Regional Processing Office of jurisdiction take an adverse action on the issues submitted for its review. The educational institution will be advised of its right to present any evidence, relevant to the issues submitted for the Committee's review, by oral or documentary evidence; to submit rebuttal evidence; to present and cross-examine witnesses; and to make such statements as may be appropriate on its behalf for a true and full disclosure of the facts. VA Counsel will be allowed to cross-examine any witnesses offered by the educational institution and to reply to any written briefs or arguments submitted to the Committee.
(Authority: 10 U.S.C. 16136(b); 38 U.S.C. 3034(a), 3241(a), 3323(a), 3689(d), 3690)
(c)
Rule 3.
Any testimony or evidence, either oral or written, which the Committee on Educational Allowances deems to be of probative value in deciding the question at issue will be admitted in evidence. While irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence, testimony, or arguments should be excluded, reasonable latitude will be permitted with respect to the relevancy, materiality, and competency of evidence. In most instances the evidence will consist of official records of the educational institution and VA, and these documents may be attested to and introduced by affidavit; but the introduction of oral testimony by the educational institution or by VA will be allowed, as appropriate, in any instance where the educational institution or VA Counsel desires. VA, however, will neither subpoena any witness on behalf of the educational institution for such purposes nor bear any expenses in connection with the appearance of such witness. In instances where the evidence reasonably available consists of signed written statements, secondary or hearsay evidence, etc., such evidence may be introduced into the record and will be given the weight and consideration which the circumstances warrant.
(Authority: 10 U.S.C. 16136(b); 38 U.S.C. 3034(a), 3241(a), 3323(a), 3689(d), 3690)

The original transcript will accompany the Committee's recommendation to the Director of the VA Regional Processing Office of jurisdiction along with all exhibits, briefs, or written statements received by the Committee during the course of the proceedings. Such documents should be clearly marked to indicate which were received into evidence and relied upon by the Committee in making its recommendations.

(g)
Rule 7.
Any person who is presented to testify will be required to be duly placed under oath or affirmation by the Chairperson of the Committee on Educational Allowances. If an official of the educational institution desires to present a statement personally, the individual will be required to be placed under oath or affirmation. The Chairperson will advise each witness that the Committee understands that he or she is voluntarily appearing before the Committee; that any testimony or statement given will be considered as being completely voluntary; and that no one has authority to require the individual to make any statement or answer any question against his or her will before the Committee, except that a person called as a witness on behalf of either VA or the educational institution must be willing to submit to cross-examination with respect to testimony given. Each witness will also be advised that his or her testimony or statement, if false, even though voluntary, may subject him or her to prosecution under Federal statutes.

(j)
Rule 10.
Any objection by an authorized representative of the educational institution or the VA Counsel on a ruling by the Chairperson of the Committee on Educational Allowances regarding the admissibility of testimony or other evidence submitted will be made a matter of record, together with the substance in brief of the testimony intended or other evidence concerned. If the other evidence concerned is in the form of an affidavit or other document, it may be accepted for filing as a future reference if it is later ruled
admissible as part of the record of the hearing.

(k)
Rule 11.
Objections relating to the jurisdiction or membership of the Committee on Educational Allowances or the constitutionality of statutes or the constitutionality of, or statutory authority for, VA regulations, are not before the Committee for decision. The time of the Committee will not be used to hear arguments in this regard. However, any such matters outside the province of the Committee may be the subject of a brief or a letter for consideration by the VA Office of General Counsel upon completion of the hearing. The ruling of such authority upon such issues will be obtained and included in the record before the Committee's recommendations are submitted to the Director of the VA Regional Processing Office of jurisdiction. If the VA General Counsel's ruling on such legal issues necessitates reopening the proceeding, that shall be done before the Committee makes its recommendations to the Director of the VA Regional Processing Office of jurisdiction.

The hearing will be conducted in an orderly manner with dignity and decorum. The conduct of members of the Committee on Educational Allowances, the VA Counsel, and any representatives of the educational institution shall be characterized by appropriate impartiality, fairness, and cooperation. The Chairperson of the Committee shall take such action as may be necessary, including suspension of the hearing or the removal of the offending person from the hearing room for misbehavior, disorderly conduct, or the persistent disregard of the Chairperson's ruling. Where this occurs, the Chairperson will point out that the Committee is entitled to every possible consideration in order that the case may be presented clearly and fully, which may be accomplished only through observance of orderly procedures.

(n)
Rule 14.
The Chairperson of the Committee on Educational Allowances will conduct the hearing proceedings in such a manner that will protect from disclosure information which tends to disclose or compromise investigative sources or methods or which would violate the privacy of any individual. The salient facts, which form the basis of charges, may be disclosed and discussed without revealing the source.

§ 21.4233
Combination.
An approved program may consist of a combination of courses with instruction offered by a school alternating with instruction in a business or industrial establishment (a cooperative course); courses offered by two schools concurrently; or courses offered through class attendance and by television concurrently. A farm cooperative program may be approved which
consists of a combination of institutional agricultural courses and concurrent agricultural employment (see § 21.4264). A school may contract the actual training to another school or entity, provided the course is approved by the State approving agency having approval jurisdiction of the school or entity which actually provides the training.
(a)
Cooperative courses.
A full-time program of education consisting of phases of school instruction alternated with training in a business or industrial establishment with such training being strictly supplemental to the school instruction may be approved. Alternating periods may be a part-day in school and a part-day on job or may be such periods which alternate on a daily, weekly, monthly or on a term basis. For purposes of approval the school offering the course must submit to the State approving agency, with its application, statements of fact showing at least the following:
(1) That the alternate in-school periods of the course are at least as long as the alternate periods in the business or industrial establishment; in determining this relationship between the two components of the course, training received in a business or industrial establishment during a vacation or officially scheduled school break period shall be excluded from the calculation; where the course is approved as continuous part-time work and part-time study in combination, it shall be measured on the basis of the ratio which each portion of the training bears to full time as defined in § 21.4270(c) of this part. The institutional portion must be at least equivalent to one-half time training and must be combined with a job training portion sufficient for the combined training to equal full time.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3482(a)(2) and 3532(b))
(2) That the course is set up as a cooperative course in the school catalog or other literature of the school;
(3) That the school itself arranges with the employer's establishment for providing the alternate on-job periods of training on such basis that the on-job portion of the course will be training in a real and substantial sense and will supplement the in-school portion of the course;
(4) That the school arranges directly with the employer's establishment for placing the individual student in that establishment and exercises supervision and control over the student's activities at the establishment to an extent that assures training in a true sense to the student; and
(5) That the school grants credit for the on-job portion of the course for completion of a part of the work required for granting a degree or diploma.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3482(a)(2) and 3532(b))
(b)
Concurrent enrollment.
Where a veteran or eligible person cannot successfully schedule his or her complete program at one school, a program of concurrent enrollment may be approved. When requesting such a program the veteran or eligible person must show that his or her complete program of education or training is not available at the school in which he or she will pursue the major portion of his or her program (the primary school), or that it cannot be scheduled successfully within the period in which he or she plans to complete his or her program.
(1) If VA measures the courses pursued at both institutions on either a clock-hour basis or a credit-hour basis, VA will measure the veteran's or eligible person's enrollment by adding together the units of measurement in the second school to the units of measurement for the courses in the primary institution. The standard for full time will be the full-time standard for the courses at the primary institution.
(2) Where the standards for measurement of the courses pursued concurrently in the two schools are different, VA will measure the veteran's or eligible person's enrollment by converting the units of measurement for courses in the second school to the equivalent in value expressed in units of measurement required for the courses in the program of education which the veteran or eligible person is pursuing at the primary institution.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3688)
(3) If the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) of this section require VA to convert clock hours to credit hours, it will do so by—
(i) Dividing the number of credit hours which VA considers to be full-time at the educational institution whose courses are measured on a credit-hour basis by the number of clock hours which are full-time at the educational institution whose courses are measured on a clock-hour basis; and
(ii) Multiplying each clock hour of attendance by the decimal determined in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section. VA will drop all fractional hours.
(4) If the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) of this section require VA to convert credit hours to clock hours, it will do so by—
(i) Dividing the number of clock hours which VA considers to be full-time at the educational institution whose courses are measured on a clock-hour basis by the number of credit hours which are full-time at the educational institution whose courses are measured on a credit-hour basis; and
(ii) Multiplying each credit hour by the number determined in paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section. VA will drop all fractional hours.
(5) Periodic certifications of training will be required from the veteran and each of the schools where concurrent enrollment is approved in a course which does not lead to a standard college degree and to which the measurement provisions of § 21.4270(b), of this part do not apply. (See §§ 21.4203 and 21.4204.)
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3688)
(c)
Television.
(1) A course offered by open-circuit television is an independent study course. In order for an eligible person to receive educational assistance while pursuing such a course, the course must meet all the requirements for independent study found in § 21.4267.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3523, 3680A)

(i) A change in the type of courses needed to attain a vocational objective;
(ii) A change in the individual's educational, professional or vocational objective following the successful completion of the immediately preceding program of education;
(iii) A return to the individual's prior program of education following a
change of program if the individual resumes training in the program without any loss of credit or standing in that program;
(iv) An enrollment in a new program of education when that program leads to a vocational, educational or professional objective in the same general field as the immediately preceding program of education; or
(Authority: 10 U.S.C. 16136(b); 38 U.S.C. 3034(a), 3241, 3323(a), 3691)
(v) An enrollment or reenrollment of a servicemember seeking to be paid tuition assistance top-up benefits to meet all or a portion of an educational institution's charges for education or training that the military department concerned has not covered under tuition assistance.

(b)
Application.
A veteran, reservist, or eligible person may request a change of program by any form of communication.

(Authority: 10 U.S.C. 16136(b); 38 U.S.C. 3034(a), 3241, 3323(a), 3691)
(d)
Other changes of program.
(1) The following changes of program may not be made solely at the option of the veteran, reservist, or eligible person. The Department of Veterans Affairs must approve them before paying educational assistance allowance:
(i) A second or subsequent change of program made by a veteran or eligible person other than a child receiving educational assistance under 38 U.S.C. chapter 35,
(ii) An initial change of program made by a veteran or eligible spouse or surviving spouse if the first program was interrupted or discontinued due to his or her own misconduct, neglect or lack of application, or

(ii) In any instance where the veteran, reservist, or eligible person has interrupted, or failed to progress in his or her program due to his or her own misconduct, neglect or lack of application, there is a reasonable likelihood with respect to the program the veteran, reservist, or eligible person proposes to pursue that there will not be a recurrence of such an interruption or failure to progress, and
(iii) In the case of an eligible child receiving educational assistance under 38 U.S.C. chapter 35 the new program meets the criteria applicable to final approval of an original application. See § 21.4230.

Circumstances beyond the control of the veteran, reservist, or eligible person include, but are not limited to:
(i) The course being discontinued by the school when no other similar course leading to the same objective is available within normal commuting distance.

(Authority: 10 U.S.C. 16136(b); 38 U.S.C. 3034(a), 3241, 3323(a), 3691)
(4) Notwithstanding any provision of any other paragraph of this section, if a third or subsequent change of program occurs after May 31, 1991, VA will apply only the applicable provisions of paragraph (d)(2) of this section.

(e)
Adjustments; transfers.
A change in courses or places of training will not be considered a change of objective in the following instances:
(1) The pursuit of the first program is a prerequisite for entrance into and pursuit of a second program.
(2) A transfer from one school to another when the program at the second school leads to the same educational, professional or vocational objective, and does not involve a material loss of credit, or increase training time.
(3) Revision of a program which does not involve a change of objective or material loss of credit nor loss of time originally planned for completion of the veteran's or eligible person's program. For example, an eligible person enrolled for a bachelor of science degree may show a professional objective such as chemist, teacher or engineer. His or her objective for purposes of this paragraph shall be considered to be “bachelor degree” and any change of courses will be considered only an adjustment in the program, not a change, so long as the subjects he or she pursues lead to the bachelor degree and there is no extension of time in the attaining of that degree.

§ 21.4235
Programs of education that include flight training.
VA will use the provisions of this section to determine whether an individual may be paid educational assistance for pursuit of flight training. See § 21.4263 for approval of flight courses for VA training.
(a)
Eligibility.
An individual who is otherwise eligible to receive educational assistance under 38 U.S.C. chapters 30, 32, or 33, or a reservist eligible for educational assistance under 10 U.S.C. chapters 1606 or 1607, may receive educational assistance for flight training in an approved program of education provided that the individual meets the requirements of this paragraph (a). Except when enrolled in a ground instructor certification course or when pursuing flight training under paragraph (e) of this section, the individual must—
(1) Possess a valid private pilot certificate or higher pilot certificate such as a commercial pilot certificate;
(2) If enrolled in a course other than an Airline Transport Pilot (ATP) course, hold a second-class medical certificate on the first day of training and, if that course began before October 1, 1998, hold that certificate continuously during training; and
(3) If enrolled in an ATP certification course, hold a first-class medical certificate on the first day of training and, if that course began before October 1, 1998, hold that certificate continuously during training.
(b)
Pursuit of flight courses.
(1) VA will pay educational assistance to an eligible individual for an enrollment in a commercial pilot certification course leading to Federal Aviation Administration certification for a particular category even if the individual has a commercial pilot certificate issued by the Federal Aviation Administration for a different category, since each category represents a different vocational objective.
(2) VA will pay educational assistance to an eligible individual for an enrollment in an instrument rating course only if the individual simultaneously enrolls in a course required for a commercial pilot certificate for the category for which the instrument rating course is pursued or if, at the time of enrollment in the instrument rating course, the individual has a commercial pilot certificate issued by the Federal Aviation Administration for such category. The enrollment in an instrument rating course alone does not establish that the individual is pursuing a vocational objective, as required for VA purposes, since that rating equally may be applied to an individual's private pilot certificate, only evidencing an intent to pursue a non-vocational objective.
(3) VA will pay educational assistance to an eligible individual for an enrollment in a flight course other than an instrument rating course or a ground instructor course, including courses leading to an aircraft type rating, only if the individual has a commercial pilot certificate issued by the Federal Aviation Administration for the category to which the particular course applies.
(4) VA will pay educational assistance to an eligible individual for an enrollment in a ground instructor certificate course, even though the individual does not have any other flight certificate issued by the Federal Aviation Administration, since the Federal Aviation Administration does not require a flight certificate as a prerequisite to ground instructor certification and ground instructor is a recognized vocational objective.
(5) VA will not pay an eligible individual for simultaneous enrollment in more than one flight course, except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
(c)
Some individuals are already qualified for a flight course objective.
(1) The provisions of §§ 21.5230(a)(4), 21.7110(b)(4), and 21.7610(b)(4), prohibiting payment of educational assistance for enrollment in a course for whose objective the individual is already qualified, apply to enrollments in flight courses.
(2) A former military pilot with the equivalent of a commercial pilot certificate and an instrument rating may obtain a commercial pilot certificate and instrument rating from the Federal Aviation Administration without a flight exam within 12 months of release from active duty. Therefore, VA will consider such a veteran to be already qualified for the objectives of a commercial pilot certification course and an instrument rating course if begun within 12 months of the individual's release from active duty.
(d)
Some flight courses are refresher training.
The provisions of §§ 21.5230(c), 21.7020(b)(26), 21.7122(b), 21.7520(b)(20), and 21.7610(b)(4) that provide limitations on payment for refresher training that is needed to update an individual's knowledge and skill in order to cope with technological advances while he or she was on active duty service apply to flight training.
(1) An individual who held a Federal Aviation Administration certificate before or during active duty service may have surrendered that certificate or the Federal Aviation Administration may have canceled it. The individual may receive the equivalent of the number of months of educational assistance necessary to complete the course that will qualify him or her for the same grade certificate.
(2) A reservist is not eligible for refresher training unless he or she has had prior active duty.
(e)
Flight training at an institution of higher learning.
(1) An individual who is eligible for educational assistance under 10 U.S.C. chapter 1606 or 1607 or 38 U.S.C. chapter 30, 32, 33, or 35 is exempt from the provisions of paragraphs (a)(2) through (c) of this section when
his or her courses include flight training that is part of a program of education that leads to a standard college degree.
(2) An individual described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section may pursue courses that may result in the individual eventually receiving recreational pilot certification or private pilot certification, provided that the courses also lead to a standard college degree.
(f)
Authority.
(1) Paragraph (a) of this section issued under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 16136(c); 38 U.S.C. 3034(d), 3241(b);

(1) Is pursuing a post-secondary educational program on a half-time or more basis at an educational institution, and
(2) Has a deficiency in a subject which is indispensable to the satisfactory pursuit of an approved program of education.

§ 21.4250
Course and licensing and certification test approval; jurisdiction and notices.
(a)
General.
The statements made in this paragraph are subject to exceptions found in paragraph (c) of this section.
(1) If an educational institution offers a resident course in a State, only the State approving agency for the State where the course is being offered may approve the course for VA training. If the State approving agency chooses to approve a resident course (other than a flight course) not leading to a standard college degree, it must also approve the class schedules of that course.
(2) If an educational institution with a main campus in a State offers a resident course not located in a State, only the State approving agency for the
State where the educational institution's main campus is located may approve the course for VA training. If the State approving agency chooses to approve a resident course (other than a flight course) not leading to a standard college degree, it must also approve the class schedules of that course.

This approval will be valid wherever the test is given.
(ii) If the organization or entity offering a licensing or certification test does not apply for approval, and a State or political subdivision of a State requires that an individual take the test in order to obtain a license, the State approving agency for the State where the license will be valid may approve the test for VA payment. This approval will be valid for the purpose of VA payment only if the veteran takes the test in the State or political subdivision of the State where the license is valid.
(7) A course approved under 38 U.S.C. chapter 36 will be deemed to be approved for purposes of 38 U.S.C. chapter 35.
(8) Any course that was approved under 38 U.S.C. chapter 33 (as in effect before February 1, 1965), or under 38 U.S.C. chapter 35 before March 3, 1966, and was not or is not disapproved for failure to meet any of the requirements of the applicable chapters, will be deemed to be approved for purposes of 38 U.S.C. chapter 36.

(1) VA will consider that the faculty remains substantially the same in an educational institution when faculty members who teach a majority of the courses after the move or change in ownership, were so employed by the
educational institution before the move or change in ownership.
(2) VA will consider that the courses remain substantially the same at an educational institution when:
(i) Faculty use the same instructional methods during the term, quarter, or semester after the move or change in ownership as were used before the move or change in ownership; and
(ii) The courses offered after the move or change in ownership lead to the same educational objectives as did the courses offered before the move or change in ownership.
(3) VA considers that the student body remains substantially the same at an educational institution when, except for those students who have graduated, all, or a majority of the students enrolled in the educational institution on the last day of classes before the move or change in ownership are also enrolled in the educational institution after the move or change in ownership.

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3680(a))
(k)
Courses with suspended approval.
When a State approving agency has suspended the approval of a course for new enrollments, new enrollments in the course shall not be approved until the suspense is lifted.

See § 21.4259.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3672(a))
(l)
Courses taken by a nonmatriculated student who is pursuing a degree.
The provisions of this paragraph apply to veterans and eligible persons who are pursuing a degree, but who have not matriculated. The Department of Veterans Affairs considers a student to have matriculated when he or she has been formally admitted to a college or university as a degree-seeking student.
(1) Some colleges or universities admit students provisionally, pending receipt of test results or transcripts. The Department of Veterans Affairs may approve such a veteran's or eligible person's enrollment in a course or subject only if the veteran or eligible person matriculates during the first two terms, quarters or semesters following his or her admission.
(2) The first portion of the courses leading to a single degree may be offered at one college or university. The remaining courses are not offered at the college or university, but are offered at a second college or university which grants the degree based upon the combined credits earned by the student. If the student is not required to matriculate during the portion of the program offered at the first college or university, VA may approve an enrollment in a course or subject that is part of that portion of the program only when the certifications described in either paragraph (l)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section are made.
(i) The college or university granting the degree certifies concurrently with the student's enrollment in the first portion of the program, that
(A) Full credit will be granted for the subjects taken in the portion of the curriculum offered at the first college or university;
(B) In the last 5 years at least three students who have completed the first part of the program have been accepted into the second part of the program;
(C) At least 90 percent of those who have applied for admission to the second part of the program, after successfully completing the first part, have been admitted;
(D) The student will be required to matriculate during the first two terms, quarters or semesters following his or her admission to the second part of the program.
(ii) The college or university offering the first part of the program:
(A) Certifies to the appropriate State approving agency that as a result of an agreement between that college or university and the college or university offering the second part of the program, all of the courses taken by the veteran or eligible person in the first part of the program, will be accepted by the college or university offering the second part of the program without any loss of credit in partial fulfillment of the requirements for an associate or higher degree. This certification may be made once for each program for which an agreement exists.
(B) Certifies to VA that the veteran or eligible person has stated to an appropriate official of the college or university offering the first part of the program that he or she is pursuing the program.
(3) The first portion of the subjects or courses in a baccalaureate program beyond those necessary for an associate degree may be given at a 2-year college, while the remainder may be offered at a 4-year college or university. When the college or university does not require the student to matriculate while pursuing the additional study at the 2-year college, VA may approve an enrollment in a course offered in the program at the 2-year college only if the certifications described in either paragraph (l)(3)(i) or (ii) of this section are made.
(i) The college or university granting the baccalaureate degree certifies that:
(A) Full credit is granted for the course upon the student's transfer to the college or university granting the baccalaureate degree,
(B) The courses taken at the 2-year college will be acceptable in partial fulfillment for the baccalaureate degree, and
(C) The student will be required to matriculate during the first two terms, quarters or semesters following his or her admission to the college or university granting the baccalaureate degree.
(ii) Either the 2-year college or the college or university granting the baccalaureate degree:
(A) Certifies to the appropriate State approving agency that as a result of agreement between the 2-year college and the college or university offering the baccalaureate degree all of the courses pursued beyond the associate degree will be accepted without any loss of credit in partial fulfillment of the requirements for a baccalaureate degree. This certification may be made once for each program for which an agreement exists.
(B) Certifies to VA that the veteran or eligible person is enrolled in courses covered by the agreement.
(4) Except as provided in paragraphs (l)(1), (2), and (3) of this section, the Department of Veterans Affairs will not approve a veteran's or eligible person's enrollment in a course or subject if the veteran or eligible person:
(i) Is pursuing a degree, and
(ii) Is not matriculated.
(5) Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent a State approving agency from including more restrictive matriculation requirements in its approval criteria.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3452)
(m)
Courses offered under contract.
VA may not approve the enrollment of a veteran, servicemember, reservist, or eligible person in a course as a part of a program of education offered by any educational institution if the educational institution or entity providing the course under contract has not obtained a separate approval for the course in the same manner as for any other course as required by § 21.4253, § 21.4254, § 21.4256, § 21.4257, § 21.4260, § 21.4261, § 21.4263, § 21.4264, § 21.4265, § 21.4266, or § 21.4267, as appropriate.

§ 21.4253
Accredited courses.
(a)
General.
All standard college degree courses offered at proprietary for-profit institutions and non-college degree courses offered at proprietary for-profit institutions and public or proprietary not-for-profit institutions may be approved as accredited courses if they meet one of the following criteria:
(1) The course has been accredited and approved by a nationally recognized accrediting agency or association. “Candidate for accreditation” status is not a basis for approval of a course as accredited.
(2) Credit for such course is approved by the State department of education for credit toward a high school diploma.
(3) The course is conducted under the Act of February 23, 1917 (20 U.S.C. 11
et seq.
).
(4) The course is accepted by the State department of education for credit for a teacher's certificate or teacher's degree.
(5) The course is approved by the State as meeting the requirement of regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services under sections 1819(f)(2)(A)(i) and 1919(f)(2)(A)(i) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C.1395i-3(f)(2)(A)(i) and 1396r(f)(2)(A)(i)).
(b)
Course objective.
Any curriculum offered by an educational institution which is a member of one of the nationally recognized accrediting agencies or associations and which leads to a degree, diploma, or certificate will be accepted as an accredited course when approved as such by the State approving agency. Any curriculum accredited by one of the specialized nationally recognized accrediting agencies or associations and which leads to a degree, diploma, or certificate will also be accepted as an accredited course when approved as such by the State approving agency. Approval of the individual subjects, required or elective, which are designated as a part of a degree curriculum will not be necessary. Such approval may include noncredit subjects that are prescribed as a required part of the curriculum. The course objective may be educational (high school diploma or a standard college degree) or it may be vocational or professional (an occupation).
(c)
Accrediting agencies.
A nationally recognized accrediting agency or association is one that appears on the list published by the Secretary of Education as required by 38 U.S.C. 3675(a). The State approving agencies may use the accreditation of these accrediting agencies or associations for approval of the course specifically accredited and approved by the agency or association.
(d)
School qualification.
A school desiring to enroll veterans or eligible persons in accredited courses will make application for approval of such courses to the State approving agency. The State approving agency may approve the application of the school when the school and its accredited courses are found to have met the following criteria and additional reasonable criteria established by the State approving agency if the Secretary or designee, in consultation with the State approving agency, approves the additional criteria as necessary and equitable in its treatment of public, private, and proprietary for-profit educational institutions:
(1) The institution (other than an elementary or secondary school) has submitted to the State approving agency copies of its catalog or bulletin which are certified as true and correct in content and policy by an authorized representative, and the publication shall:
(i) State with specificity the requirements of the institution with respect to graduation;
(ii) Include institution policy and regulations relative to standards of progress required of the student by the institution (this policy will define the grading system of the institution, the minimum grades considered satisfactory, conditions for interruption for unsatisfactory grades or progress, a description of the probationary period, if any, allowed by the institution, conditions of reentrance for those students dismissed for unsatisfactory progress, and a statement regarding progress records kept by the institution and furnished the student);
(iii) Include institution policy and regulations relating to student conduct and conditions for dismissal for unsatisfactory conduct; and
(iv) Include any attendance standards of the institution if the institution has and enforces such standards.
(2) Adequate records are kept by the school to show the progress of each veteran or eligible person. The records must be sufficient to show continued pursuit at the rate for which enrolled and the progress being made. They must include final grade in each subject for each term, quarter, or semester; record of withdrawal from any subject to include the last date of attendance for a resident course; and record of reenrollment in subjects from which there was a withdrawal; and may include such records as attendance for resident courses, periodic grades and examination results.
(3) The school maintains a written record of previous education and training of the veteran or eligible person which clearly indicates that appropriate credit has been given by the school for previous education and training, with the training period shortened proportionately. The record
must be cumulative in that the results of each enrollment period (term, quarter or semester) must be included so that it shows each subject undertaken and the final result,
i.e.
, passed, failed, incomplete or withdrawn.
(4) The school enforces a policy relative to standards of conduct and progress required of the student. The school policy relative to standards of progress must be specific enough to determine the point in time when educational benefits should be discontinued, pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 3474 when the veteran or eligible person ceases to make satisfactory progress. The policy must include the grade or grade point average that will be maintained if the student is to graduate. For example, a 4-year college may require a 1.5 grade point average the first year, a 1.75 average at mid-year the second year, and a cumulative average of 2.0 thereafter on the basis of 4.0 for an A.
(5) If the school has a standard of attendance, it maintains records of attendance for veterans and eligible persons enrolled in resident courses which are adequate to show the student meets the school's standard of attendance.
(6) The accredited courses, the curriculum of which they form a part, and the instruction connected with those courses are consistent in quality, content, and length with similar courses in public educational institutions and other private educational institutions in the State with recognized accepted standards.
(7) There is in the educational institution offering the course adequate space, equipment, instructional material, and instructor personnel to provide training of good quality.
(8) The educational and experience qualifications of directors, and administrators of the educational institution offering the courses, and instructors teaching the courses for which approval is sought, are adequate.
(9)(i) For a course designed to prepare an individual for licensure or certification in a State, the course meets all instructional curriculum licensure or certification requirements of such State.
(ii) For a course designed to prepare an individual for licensure to practice law in a State, the course is accredited by a specialized accrediting agency for programs of legal education or association recognized by the Secretary of Education under subpart 2 of part H of title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1099b), from which recipients of law degrees from such accredited programs are eligible to sit for a bar examination in any State.
(iii) For a course designed to prepare an individual for employment pursuant to standards developed by a board or agency of a State in an occupation that requires approval, licensure, or certification, the course meets such standards.
(iv) An educational institution may apply, through their State approving agency of jurisdiction, to the Secretary or designee for a waiver of the requirements of this paragraph (d)(9). The State approving agency will forward an application for waiver, together with its recommendation for granting or denying the application, to the Secretary or designee. The Secretary or designee may grant a waiver upon a finding that all of the following criteria have been met:
(A) The educational institution is not accredited by an agency or association recognized by the Department of Education.
(B) The course did not meet the requirements of this paragraph (d)(9) at any time during the 2-year period preceding the date of the waiver.
(C) The waiver furthers the purposes of the educational assistance programs administered by VA or would further the education interests of individuals eligible for assistance under such programs.
(D) The educational institution does not provide any commission, bonus, or other incentive payment based directly or indirectly on success in securing enrollments or financial aid to any persons or entities engaged in any student recruiting or admission activities or in making decisions regarding the award of student financial assistance, except for the recruitment of foreign students residing in foreign countries who are not eligible to receive Federal student assistance.
(10) Before requiring a school and its accredited courses to meet any additional criteria, the State approving agency must present a written proposal to the Secretary or designee justifying the need for the additional criteria and containing an attestation that the criteria will treat all schools equitably, regardless of whether they are public, private, or for-profit institutions. The Secretary or designee will determine whether the additional criteria are necessary and treat schools equitably based on the proposal and any additional information submitted. The Secretary or designee may change the determination at any time if, after implementation, it becomes apparent that the criteria are unnecessary or schools are treated inequitably under the criteria.
(i) The written proposal must contain a description of the need for the additional criteria and an explanation of how the imposition of the additional criteria would remedy the problem. The proposal must also contain a statement concerning whether State or Federal laws, regulations, or policies require the imposition of the additional criteria and an explanation of the consideration of any alternative means to achieve the same goal as the additional criteria.
(ii) The Secretary or designee may request such additional information from the State approving agency as the Secretary or designee deems appropriate before determining whether the criteria are necessary and treat schools equitably.
(e)
College level.
Under the provisions of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, any course at college level approved by the State approving agency as an accredited course will be accepted by the Department of Veterans Affairs as an accredited course when all of the following conditions are met:
(1) The college or university is accredited by a nationally recognized regional accrediting agency listed by the Secretary of Education or the course is accredited at the college level by a specialized accrediting agency or association recognized by the Secretary of Education; and
(2) The course has entrance requirements of not less than the requirements applicable to the college level program of the school; and
(3) Credit for the course is awarded in terms of standard semester or quarter hours or by recognition at completion by the granting of a standard college degree.
(f)
Courses not leading to a standard college degree.
Any course in a school approved by the State approving agency will be accepted as an accredited course when all of the following conditions are met:
(1) The course or the school offering such course is accredited by the appropriate accrediting agency; and
(2) The course offers training in the field for which the accrediting agency is recognized and at a level for which it is recognized; and
(3) The course leads to a high school diploma or a vocational objective.

(i) Before requiring a school and its nonaccredited courses to meet any additional criteria, the State approving agency must present a written proposal to the Secretary or designee justifying the need for the additional criteria and containing an attestation that the criteria will treat all schools equitably, regardless of whether they are public, private or for-profit institutions. The written proposal must contain a description of the need for the additional criteria and an explanation of how the imposition of the additional criteria would remedy the problem. The proposal must also contain a statement concerning whether State or Federal laws, regulations, or policies require the imposition of the additional criteria and an explanation of the consideration of any alternative means to achieve the same goal as the additional criteria.
(ii) The Secretary or designee may request such additional information from the State approving agency as the Secretary or designee deems appropriate before determining whether the criteria are necessary and treat schools equitably.

§ 21.4255
Refund policy; nonaccredited courses.
(a)
Acceptable refund policy.
A refund policy meets the requirements of § 21.4254(c)(13), if it provides that the amount charged for tuition, fees, and other charges for a portion of the course does not exceed the approximate pro rata portion of the total charges for tuition, fees, and other charges that the length of the completed portion of the course bears to the total length. The school may make provision for refund within the following limitations:
(1)
Registration fee.
An established registration fee in an amount not to exceed $10 need not be subject to proration. Where the established registration fee is more than $10, the amount in excess of $10 will be subject to proration.
(2)
Breakage fee.
Where the school has a breakage fee, it may provide for the retention of only the exact amount of the breakage, with the remaining part, if any, to be refunded.
(3)
Consumable instructional supplies.
Where the school makes a separate charge for consumable instructional supplies, as distinguished from laboratory fees, the exact amount of the charges for supplies consumed may be retained but any remaining part must be refunded.
(4)
Books, supplies and equipment.
(i) A veteran or eligible person may retain or dispose of books, supplies and equipment at his or her discretion when:
(A) He or she purchased them from a bookstore or other source, and
(B) Their cost is separate and independent from the charge made by the school for tuition and fees.
(ii) The school will make a refund in full for the amount of the charge for unissued books, supplies and equipment when:
(A) The school furnishes the books, supplies and equipment.
(B) The school includes their cost in the total charge payable to the school for the course.
(C) The veteran or eligible person withdraws or is discontinued before completing the course.
(iii) The veteran or eligible person may dispose of issued items at his or her discretion even if they were included in the total charges payable to the school for the course.
(5)
Tuition and other charges.
Where the school either has or adopts an established policy for the refund of the unused portion of tuition, fees, and other charges subject to proration, which is more favorable to the veteran or eligible person than the approximate pro rata basis as provided in this paragraph, such established policy will be applicable. Otherwise, the school may charge a sum which does not vary more than 10 percent from the exact pro rata portion of such tuition, fees, and other charges that the length of the completed portion of the course bears to its total length. The exact proration will be determined on the ratio of the number of days of instruction completed by the student to the total number of instructional days in the course.
(6)
Prompt refund.
In the event that the veteran, spouse, surviving spouse or child fails to enter the course or withdraws or is discontinued therefrom at any time prior to completion of the course, the unused portion of the tuition, fees and other charges paid by the individual shall be refunded promptly. Any institution which fails to forward any refund due within 40 days after such a change in status, shall be deemed, prima facie, to have failed to make a prompt refund, as required by this paragraph.
(b)
Waiver.
(1) An educational institution may apply through the appropriate State approving agency to the Director of the VA facility of jurisdiction for a waiver of the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section as they apply to a veteran or eligible person. The State approving agency shall forward the application to the Director along with its recommendations. The Director shall consider the recommendations and shall grant a waiver only when he or she finds that the educational institution:
(i) Is a college, university, or similar institution offering post-secondary level academic instruction leading to an associate or higher degree;
(ii) Is operated by an agency of a State or a unit of local government;
(iii) If operated by an agency of a State, is located within that State;
(iv) If operated by a unit of local government, is located within the boundaries of the area over which that unit has taxing jurisdiction;
(v) Is a candidate for accreditation by a regional accrediting agency; and
(vi) Charges the veteran or eligible person no more than $120 per quarter, $180 per semester or $360 per school year in tuition, fees and other charges for the course.
(2) If an educational institution disagrees with a decision of a Director of a VA facility, it may ask that the Director, Education Service review the decision. In reviewing the decision the Director must consider the evidence of record. He or she may not grant a waiver unless all the criteria of paragraph (b)(1) of this section are met.

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3672(e))
(3) State approving agencies have the authority to review periodically the length of time needed to complete each approved correspondence program or approved correspondence-residence course in order to determine whether the program or course should continue to be approved.

(2) Upon termination of enrollment under an affirmed enrollment agreement for training in the accredited course by the veteran, spouse, surviving spouse, or reservist, without having completed any lessons, a registration fee not in excess of 10 percent of the tuition for the course or $50, whichever is less, may be charged him or her. When the individual terminates the agreement after completion of less than 25 percent of the lessons of the course, the institution may retain the registration fee plus 25 percent of the tuition. When the individual terminates the agreement after completing 25 percent but less than 50 percent of the lessons, the institution may retain the registration fee plus 50 percent of the tuition for the course. If 50 percent or more of the lessons are completed, no refund of tuition is required.
(Authority: 10 U.S.C. 16136(b); 38 U.S.C. 3686(c))
(3) Where the school either has or adopts an established policy for the refund of the unused portion of tuition, fees, and other charges subject to proration, which is more favorable to the veteran, spouse, surviving spouse, or reservist than the pro rata basis as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, such established policy will be applicable.
(Authority: 10 U.S.C. 16136(b); 38 U.S.C. 3686(c))

§ 21.4263
Approval of flight training courses.
(a)(1) A flight program may be approved if—
(i)(A) For 38 U.S.C. chapters 32 and 35 and 10 U.S.C. chapters 1606 and 1607, the flight courses that constitute the program of education meet Federal Aviation Administration standards for such courses and the Federal Aviation Administration and the State approving agency approve them; or
(B) For 38 U.S.C. chapters 30 and 33, effective August 1, 2011, the flight program is deemed approved (A flight program will be deemed approved if it is approved by the Federal Aviation Administration and is offered by a certified pilot school that possesses a valid Federal Aviation Administration pilot school certificate or provisional pilot school certificate under 14 CFR part 141. Flight programs offered at flight schools listed in paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section will not be approved for VA training under 38 U.S.C. chapters 30 and 33); and
(ii)(A) The flight training offered by a flight school is generally accepted as necessary for the attainment of a recognized vocational objective in the field of aviation; or
(B) The flight training is offered by an institution of higher learning for credit towards a standard college degree program.
(2) A State approving agency may approve a flight course only if a flight school or an institution of higher learning offers the course. A State approving agency may not approve a flight course if an individual instructor offers it.
(3) This paragraph (a) issued under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 16136(c), 16166(c), 38 U.S.C. 3032(e), 3241(b), 3672, 3676, 3680A.
(b)
Definition of flight school.
A
flight school
is a school, other than an institution of higher learning, or is an entity, such as an aero club; is located in a State; and meets one of the following sets of requirements:
(1) The Federal Aviation Administration has issued the school or entity either a pilot school certificate or a provisional pilot school certificate specifying each course the school is approved to offer under 14 CFR part 141;
(2) The entity is either a flight training center or an air carrier that does not have a pilot school certificate or provisional pilot school certificate issued by the Federal Aviation Administration under 14 CFR part 141, but
pursuant to a grant of exemption letter issued by the Federal Aviation Administration under 14 CFR part 61 is permitted to offer pilot training by a flight simulator instead of an actual aircraft; or
(3) The Federal Aviation Administration has issued the school or entity a training center certificate under 14 CFR part 142.
(Authority: 10 U.S.C. 16136(b); 38 U.S.C. 3034(a), 3241(a), 3452(c))
(c)
Aero club courses.
An aero club, established, formed, and operated under authority of service department regulations as a nonappropriated sundry fund activity, is an instrumentality of the Federal government. Consequently, VA has exclusive jurisdiction over approval of flight courses offered by such aero clubs.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3671, 3672)
(d)
Approval of flight training as part of a degree program.
A State approving agency may approve a flight training course that is part of a program of education leading to a standard college degree provided the course and program meet the requirements of § 21.4253 or § 21.4254, as appropriate. The institution of higher learning offering the course need not be a flight school.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3675, 3676)
(e)
Approval of flight training courses that are not part of a degree program.
A flight course is subject to the same approval requirements as any other course. In addition, the State approving agency must apply the following provisions to the approval of flight courses:
(1) The Federal Aviation Administration must approve the course; and
(2)(i) The course must meet the requirements of 14 CFR part 63 or 141, and a flight school described in paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(3) of this section must offer it; or
(ii) The course must meet the requirements of 14 CFR part 61, and either be offered—
(A) By a flight school described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section; or
(B) In whole or in part by a flight simulator pursuant to a grant of exemption letter issued by the Federal Aviation Administration to the flight school offering the course.
(Authority: 10 U.S.C. 16136(c); 38 U.S.C. 3034(d), 3241(b), 3676, 3680A)
(f)
Application of 38 U.S.C. 3680A(e)(2) to flight training.
Notwithstanding the fact that the Federal Aviation Administration will permit flight schools to conduct training at a base other than the main base of operations if the requirements of either 14 CFR 141.91 or 14 CFR 142.17 are met, the satellite base is considered under 38 U.S.C. 3680A(e)(2) to be a branch of the principal school, and must meet the requirements of 38 U.S.C. 3680A(e)(2).
(Authority: 10 U.S.C. 16136(b); 38 U.S.C. 3034(a), 3241(a), 3241(b), 3680A))
(g)
Providing a flight course under contract between schools or entities.
When a school or entity offers all or part of a flight course under a contract with another school or entity, the State approving agency must apply § 21.4233 in the following manner:
(1) The requirements of § 21.4233(e) must be met for all contracted flight instruction, instruction by flight training device, flight simulator instruction, and ground school training. Ground school training may be given through a ground school facility operated jointly by two or more flight schools in the same locality; and
(2) The responsibility for providing the instruction lies with the flight school. The degree of affiliation between the flight school and the entity or other school that actually does the instructing must be such that all charges for instruction are made by, and paid to, one entity having jurisdiction and control over both the flight and ground portions of the program.
(Authority: 10 U.S.C. 16136(c); 38 U.S.C. 3032(d), 3241(b))
(h)
Nonaccredited courses
—(1)
Application of § 21.4254 to flight training.
The provisions of § 21.4254 are applicable to approval of flight training courses.
(2)
Additional instruction requirements.
The State approving agency will apply the following additional requirements to a flight course:
(i) All flight instruction, instruction by flight training device, flight simulator instruction, preflight briefings and postflight critiques, and ground school training in a course must be given by the flight school or under suitable arrangements between the school and another school or entity such as a local community college.
(ii) All ground school training connected with the course must be in residence under the direction and supervision of a qualified instructor providing an opportunity for interaction between the students and the instructor. Simply making provision for having an instructor available to answer questions does not satisfy this requirement.
(3) A flight school must keep at a minimum the following records for each eligible veteran, servicemember, or reservist pursuing flight training:
(i) A copy of his or her private pilot certificate;
(ii) Evidence of completion of any prior training that may be a prerequisite for the course;
(iii) A copy of the medical certificate required by paragraph (a)(2) of this section for the courses being pursued and copies of all medical certificates (expired or otherwise) needed to support all periods of prior instruction received at the current school;
(iv) A daily flight log or copy thereof;
(v) A permanent ground school record;
(vi) A progress log;
(vii) An invoice of flight changes for individual flights or flight lessons for training conducted on a flight simulator or advanced flight training device;
(viii) Daily flight sheets identifying records upon which the 85-15 percent ratio may be computed;
(ix) A continuous meter record for each aircraft;
(x) An invoice or flight tickets signed by the student and instructor showing hour meter reading, type of aircraft, and aircraft identification number;
(xi) An accounts receivable ledger;
(xii) Individual instructor records;
(xiii) Engine log books;
(xiv) A record for each student above the private pilot level stating the name of the course in which the student is currently enrolled and indicating whether the student is enrolled under 14 CFR part 61, part 63, part 141, or part 142;
(xv) Records of tuition and accounts which are evidence of tuition charged and received from all students; and
(xvi) If training is provided under 14 CFR part 141, the records required by that part, or if training is provided under 14 CFR part 142, the records required by that part.

(i)
Hourly limitations.
A flight course approved pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section shall be approved only for those hours of instruction generally considered necessary for a student to obtain an identified vocational objective. This requirement is met only if the number of hours approved does not exceed the maximum set forth in paragraph (i)(1) through (3) of this section. Flight instruction may never be substituted for ground training.
(Authority: 10 U.S.C. 16136(c); 38 U.S.C. 3002(3), 3202(2), 3452(b))
(1)
Flight or flight simulator instruction.
Except as provided in paragraph (i)(4) of this section, the maximum number of hours of flight instruction or flight simulator instruction which may be approved for a flight course shall not exceed the number determined by this paragraph.
(i) The maximum number of hours of solo flight instruction shall not exceed the minimum number of hours required for the course provided by FAA regulations.
(ii) The maximum number of hours of dual flight instruction shall not exceed the lesser of—
(A) The number of hours of dual flight instruction in the course outline approved by the FAA, or
(B) 120% of the minimum number of hours of dual flight instruction required for the course by FAA regulations.
(iii) The maximum number of hours of instruction by flight simulator or flight training device that a State approving agency may approve is the
maximum number of hours of instruction by flight simulator or flight training device permitted by 14 CFR part 61 for that course when:
(A) A course is offered in whole or in part by flight simulator or flight training device conducted by a training center certificated under 14 CFR part 142; and
(B) 14 CFR part 61 contains a maximum number of hours of instruction by flight simulator or flight training device that may be credited toward the requirements of the rating or certificate that is the objective of the course.
(iv) If a course is offered in whole or in part by flight simulator or flight training device, and the course is not described in paragraph (i)(1)(iii) of this section, either because the course is offered by a flight training center with a grant of exemption letter, or because 14 CFR part 61 does not contain a maximum number of hours of instruction by flight simulator or flight training device, the maximum number of hours of instruction by flight simulator or flight training device that may be approved may not exceed the number of hours in the Federal Aviation Administration-approved outline.
(Authority: 10 U.S.C. 16131(g); 38 U.S.C. 3032(f), 3231(f))
(2)
Ground school.
The ground training portion of a flight course may include two forms of ground training instruction, ground school and preflight briefings and postflight critiques. The minimum hours for ground training, as specified in 14 CFR part 141, appendixes C through J refer only to ground school and not to preflight briefings and postflight critiques. If the ground school training consists of units using kits containing audiovisual equipment, quizzes and examinations, the maximum number of units approved shall not exceed the number on the course outline approved by the FAA. For all other ground school training, the number of hours of training shall not exceed the number of hours on the course outline approved by the FAA.
(Authority: 10 U.S.C. 16136(c); 38 U.S.C. 3002(3), 3202(2), 3452(b))
(3)
Preflight briefings and postflight critiques.
Hours spent in preflight briefings and postflight critiques need not be approved by the FAA.
(i) If these hours are on the FAA-approved outline, the maximum number of hours of preflight briefings and postflight critiques shall not exceed the number of hours on the outline exclusive of the preflight briefings and post-flight critiques which are attributable to solo flying hours that exceed the minimum number of solo flying hours for the course in 14 CFR part 141.
(ii) If these hours are not on the FAA-approved outline, they may not be approved unless the State approving agency finds that the briefings and critiques are an integral part of the course and do not precede or follow solo flying hours which exceed the minimum number of solo flying hours for the course in 14 CFR part 141. The maximum number of hours of preflight briefings and postflight critiques which may be approved for these courses may not, when added together, exceed 25 percent of the approved hours of flight instruction.
(Authority: 10 U.S.C. 16131(f)(4); 16136(c), 38 U.S.C. 3002(3), 3032(f)(4), 3202(2), 3231(f)(4), 3452(b))
(4)
Waiver of limitation in approvable course hours.
(i) Flight schools that wish to have a greater number of hours of dual flight instruction approved than are permitted by paragraph (i)(1)(ii) of this section, may seek an administrative review of their approval by the Director, Education Service. Requests for such a review should be made in writing to the Director of the VA facility having jurisdiction over the flight school. The request should—
(A) State the reasons why the flight school believes that the approval should extend to a greater number of hours, and
(B) Include any evidence tending to show that the greater number of hours should be approved.
(ii) The Director, Education Service shall base her or his decision upon the evidence submitted, the recommendation of the Director of the VA facility, and, if appropriate, the recommendation of the State approving agency having jurisdiction over the flight school.
(iii) The limit on the number of hours of solo flight instruction found in paragraph (i)(1)(i) of this section may not be waived.
(Authority: 10 U.S.C. 16131(f)(4); 38 U.S.C. 3032(f)(4), 3231(f)(4))
(j)
Charges.
The appropriate State approving agency shall approve charges for tuition and fees for each flight course exclusive of charges for tuition and fees for solo flying hours which exceed the maximum permitted under paragraph (i)(1)(i) of this section and for preflight briefings and postflight critiques which precede or follow the excess solo hours.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3672)
(1) The approved charges for tuition and fees shall be based upon the charges for tuition and fees which similarly circumstanced nonveterans enrolled in the same flight course are required to pay. Charges for books, supplies and lodging may not be reimbursed.
(Authority: 10 U.S.C. 16136(b); 38 U.S.C. 3034(d), 3241(c), 3690(a)(1))
(2) For the ground school portion of ground training, the State approving agency should approve group charges or unit prices if audio-visual equipment is used. For the preflight briefings and postflight critiques, the State approving agency should approve individual instructor rates for individual training flights. An average charge per hour based upon total hours and cost of all training given on the ground may not be approved.
(Authority: 10 U.S.C. 16136(b); 38 U.S.C. 3034(d), 3241(c), 3690(a)(1))
(3) A veteran, servicemember or reservist or group (all or part of whom are veterans, servicemembers or reservists) owning an airplane may lease it to an approved flight school and have exclusive use of the aircraft for flight training. The aircraft should meet the requirements prescribed for all airplanes to be used in the course, and should be shown in the approval by the State approving agency. The leasing arrangement should not result in charges for flight instruction for those owning the airplane greater than charges made to others not leasing an aircraft to the school.
(Authority: 10 U.S.C. 16136(b); 38 U.S.C. 3034(d), 3241(c), 3690(a)(1))
(4) If membership in a flight club entitles a veteran, servicemember or reservist to flight training at less than the standard rate, his or her educational allowance will be based on the reduced rate. No payments will be made for the cost of joining the flight club, since it is not a charge for the flight course.
(Authority: 10 U.S.C. 16136(b); 38 U.S.C. 3034(d), 3241(c), 3690(a)(1))
(k)
Substitute aircraft.
Except for minor substitutions a veteran, servicemember or reservist enrolled in a flight course may train only in the aircraft approved for that course. If a particular aircraft is not available for some compelling reason, the veteran, servicemember or reservist may be permitted to train in an aircraft different from that approved for the particular course, provided the aircraft substituted will adequately meet the training requirements for this particular phase of the course. Substitutions should be explained on the monthly certifications of flight training. If this shows that the charge for the substituted aircraft is different from the charge approved for the regular aircraft, the reimbursement will be based on the lesser charge. When substitution becomes the practice rather than the exception, VA will suspend payments and notify the veterans, servicemembers, reservists and the school. VA will refer the matter to the State approving agency for appropriate action.
(Authority: 10 U.S.C. 16136(b), 16136(c); 38 U.S.C. 3034(d), 3672(a))

(3) Clinical training included in a school course given in a physician's office or a dentist's office, also called externship, will be recognized as part of the institutional training if the course is accredited by a nationally recognized accrediting agency and meets the other requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section. If the course is not so accredited such practical or on-the-job training or experience in a physician's office may not be included unless the program is approved as a cooperative course.
(4) Nonaccredited courses offered in hospitals, clinics, laboratories, or medical centers will be considered on-the-job training when the courses meet the requirements of § 21.4262.
(d)
Medical and dental assistants courses for the Department of Veterans Affairs.
A course prescribed by the Secretary for full-time physicians' assistants or for full-time expanded-function auxiliaries (formerly referred to as dentists' assistants) may be approved as institutional training, if the course is conducted at Department of Veterans Affairs facilities or in facilities operated by hospitals, medical schools, or medical installations pursuant to a contract with the Department of Veterans Affairs.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 7407)
(e)
Professional training courses.
(1) Any non-medically related professional internship program, such as a clinical pastoral course, will be recognized as an institutional course when it is accredited as an institutional course by a nationally recognized accrediting agency, and
(2) The approved facility for such a course must be the institution or other facility where the training is given.
(f)
Other practical training courses.
(1) Other off-campus job experience included in a school course, variously described by schools as internship, residency, practicum, externship, et cetera, may be included as a part of a cooperative program when the course meets the requirements of § 21.4233(a).
(2) However, such off-campus courses may be considered as resident institutional training only if all of the following conditions are met. The course is:
(i) Accredited by a nationally recognized accrediting agency or is offered by a school that is accredited by one of the regional accrediting associations;
(ii) A part of the approved curriculum of the school;
(iii) Directly supervised by the school;
(iv) Measured in the same unit as other courses;
(v) Required for graduation; and

§ 21.4266
Approval of courses at a branch campus or extension.
(a)
Definitions.
The following definitions apply to the terms used in this section.

(3)
Main campus
means the location where the primary teaching facilities of an educational institution are located. If an educational institution has only one teaching location, that location is its main campus. If it is unclear which of the educational institution's teaching facilities is primary, the main campus is the location of the primary office of its Chief Executive Officer.
(4)
Branch campus
means a location of an educational institution that—
(i) Is geographically apart from and operationally independent of the main campus of the educational institution;
(ii) Has its own faculty, administration and supervisory organization; and
(iii) Offers courses in education programs leading to a degree, certificate, or other recognized education credential.
(5)
Extension
means a location of an educational institution that is geographically apart from and is operationally dependent on the main campus or a branch campus of the educational institution.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3675, 3676, 3684)
(b)
State approving agency jurisdiction.
(1) The State approving agency for the State where a residence course is being taught has jurisdiction over approval of that course for VA education benefit purposes.
(2) The fact that the location where the educational institution is offering the course may be temporary will not serve to change jurisdictional authority.
(3) The fact that the main campus of the educational institution may be located in another State from that in which the course is being taught will not serve to change jurisdictional authority.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3672)
(c)
Approving a course offered by a branch campus or an extension of an educational institution.
Before approving a course or a program of education offered at a branch campus or an extension of an educational institution, the State approving agency must ensure that—
(1) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, each location where the course or program is offered has administrative capability; and
(2) Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, each location where the course or program is offered has a certifying official on site.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3672)
(d)
Exceptions to the requirement that administrative capability exist at each location.
(1) A State approving agency may approve a course or program offered by a branch campus that does not have its own administrative capability if—
(i) The main campus of the educational institution within the same State maintains a centralized recordkeeping system that includes all records and accounts that § 21.4209 requires for each student attending the branch campus without administrative capability. These records may be originals, certified copies, or in an electronically formatted record keeping system; and
(ii) The main campus can identify the records of students at the branch campus for which it maintains centralized records.
(2) The State approving agency may approve a course or program offered by an extension that does not have its own administrative capability if—
(i) The extension and the main campus or branch campus it is dependent on are located within the same State;
(ii) The main campus or branch campus the extension is dependent on has administrative capability for the extension; and
(iii) The State approving agency combines the approval of the course(s) offered by the extension with the approval of the courses offered by the main campus or branch campus the extension is dependent on.
(e)
Combined approval.
The State approving agency may combine the approval of courses offered by an extension of an educational institution with the approval of the main campus or the branch campus that the extension is dependent on, if the extension is within the same State as the campus it is dependent on. Combining the approval of courses offered by an extension, with the approval of courses offered by the main campus or branch campus the extension is dependent on, does not negate the minimum period of operation requirements in § 21.4251 for courses that do not lead to a standard college degree offered by an extension of a proprietary educational institution. The State approving agency will list the extension and courses approved on the notice of approval sent to the educational institution pursuant to § 21.4258 of this part.
(f)
Exceptions to the requirement that each location where the course or program is offered must have a certifying official on site.
Exceptions to the requirement in paragraph (c) of this section, that each location with an approved course or program of education must have a certifying official on site, will be permitted for—
(1) Extensions of an educational institution when the State approving agency combines the approval of the courses offered by the extension with a branch campus or main campus. (See paragraph (e) of this section.)

(i) Maintains a centralized recordkeeping system. (See paragraph (d)(1) of this section.);
(ii) Has administrative capability for the branch campus (or branch campuses) within the same State; and
(iii) Centralizes its certifying official function at the main campus.
(3) Educational institutions with multi-state campuses when an educational institution wants to centralize its certifying official function into one or more locations if:
(i) The educational institution submits all required reports and certifications that §§ 21.4203, 21.4204, 21.5810, 21.5812, 21.7152, and 21.7652 require via electronic submission through VA's Internet-based education certification application;
(ii) The educational institution designates an employee, at each teaching location of the educational institution that does not have a certifying official present, to serve as a point-of-contact for veterans, servicemembers, reservists, or other eligible persons; the certifying official(s); the State approving agency of jurisdiction; and VA. The designated employee must have access (other than to transmit certifications) to VA's Internet-based education certification application to provide certification information to veterans, servicemembers, reservists, or other eligible persons, State approving agency representatives, and VA representatives;
(iii) Each certifying official uses the VA facility code for the location that has administrative capability for the teaching location where the student is training when submitting required reports and certifications to VA; and
(iv) Each certifying official has full access to the administrative records and accounts that § 21.4209 requires for each student attending the teaching location(s) for which the certifying official has been designated responsibility. These records may be originals, certified copies, or in an electronically formatted record keeping system.

Authority to approve licensing and certification tests
—(1)
Tests deemed approved.
Effective August 1, 2011, a licensure test offered by a Federal, State, or local government is deemed approved in accordance with § 21.4150(f).
(2)
VA approval.
The Secretary of Veterans Affairs delegates to the Under Secretary for Benefits, and to personnel the Under Secretary for Benefits may designate within the Education Service of the Veterans Benefits Administration, the authority to approve licensing and certification tests and the organizations and entities offering the tests as provided in § 21.4250(c)(2)(vi).
(3)
State approving agency approval.
Except for the licensing and certification tests and organizations or entities offering these tests that are approved under paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs delegates to each State approving agency the authority to approve licensing and certification tests and the organizations and entities offering these tests located within the State approving agency's jurisdiction as provided in § 21.4250(a).

Approval of tests.
(1) If an organization or entity wants a licensing or certification test that it offers to be approved for payment of educational assistance, it must apply for approval to the State approving agency having jurisdiction over the locality where the organization or entity has its headquarters. The application must be in the form the State approving agency requires.
(2) In order to be approved for payment of educational assistance to veterans and eligible persons, a licensing or certification test must meet the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, and the organization or entity offering the test must meet the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section and, if appropriate, the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section.
(i) The State approving agency may approve a licensing or certification test only if—
(A) The test is required under Federal, State, or local law or regulation for an individual to enter into, maintain, or advance in employment in a predetermined and identified vocation or profession; or
(B) The State approving agency decides that the test is generally accepted, in accordance with relevant government, business, or industry standards, employment policies, or hiring practices, as attesting to a level of knowledge or skill required to qualify to enter into, maintain, or advance in employment in a predetermined and identified vocation or profession.
(ii) If a State or political subdivision of a State offers a licensing or certification test, the State approving agency will deem the test to have met the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section.
(3) In considering whether the test is generally accepted, a State approving agency may consider the following:
(i) The nature and number of the entities that recognize the certificate awarded to candidates who pass the test;
(ii) The degree to which employers in the relevant industry accept the certification test;
(iii) Whether major employers in an industry require that their employees obtain the certificate awarded to candidates who pass the test;
(iv) The percentage of people employed in the vocation or profession who have taken the test and obtained the certificate; or
(v) Any other reasonable criterion that the State approving agency believes will clarify whether the test is generally accepted.
(4) Generally, if a State approving agency approves a certification test, VA will consider that the test is approved for any veteran or eligible person even if he or she takes the test at a location outside the State where the organization or entity offering the test has its headquarters. However, a certification test approval is valid only in
the State where the State approving agency has jurisdiction if—
(i) A State licensing agency recognizes the certification test as meeting a requirement for a license and has sought approval for that test; and
(ii) The State approving agency for the State where the licensing agency is located approves that test.
(c)
Approval of organizations or entities offering licensing or certification tests.
An organization or entity must meet the requirements of this paragraph and, if a nongovernmental organization, of paragraph (d) of this section, in order for the State approving agency to approve a licensing or certification test that the organization or entity offers for payment of educational assistance to veterans and eligible persons who take the test.

(ii) The requirements to take the test, including the amount of the fee charged for the test and any prerequisite education, training, skills, or other certification; and
(iii) The period for which the license or certificate is awarded is valid, and the requirements for maintaining or renewing the license or certificate; and
(5) Agree to give the following information to VA at VA's request:
(i) The amount of the fee a candidate pays to take a test;
(ii) The results of any test a candidate takes; and
(iii) Personal identifying information of any candidate who applies for reimbursement from VA for a test.
(d)
Approval of nongovernmental organizations or entities offering certification tests.
(1) In addition to complying with the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section, a nongovernmental organization or entity must meet the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section before a certification test it offers can be approved for payment of educational assistance to veterans and eligible persons who take the test. Except as provided in paragraphs (d)(3) and (d)(4) of this section, the organization or entity—
(i) Certifies to the State approving agency that the licensing or certification test offered by the organization or entity is generally accepted, in accordance with relevant government, business, or industry standards, employment policies, or hiring practices, as attesting to a level of knowledge or skill required to qualify to enter into, maintain, or advance in employment in a predetermined and identified vocation or profession;

is necessary to perform an assessment of—
(i) The test the organization or entity conducts as compared to the level of knowledge or skills that a license or certificate attests; and
(ii) The applicability of the test over such periods of time as the State approving agency decides is appropriate.
(3) The provisions of paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section will not prevent the approval of a test if the organization or entity has offered a reasonably related test for at least two years.
(4) The provisions of paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section will not prevent the approval of a test if the organization or entity—
(i) Offers a sample test or preparatory materials to a candidate for the test but does not otherwise provide preparatory education or training to the candidate; or
(ii) Has a financial interest in an organization that provides preparatory education or training of a candidate for a test, but that test is advantageous in but not required for practicing a vocation or profession.

Notice of approval and withdrawal of approval.
The State approving agency must provide notice of an approval of a test as required in § 21.4250(b). If the State approving agency wishes to withdraw approval of a test, it must follow the provisions of § 21.4259.
(f)
A decision to disapprove a test or an organization or entity offering a test may be reviewed.
(1) If an organization or entity offering a test disagrees with a State approving agency's decision to disapprove a test or to disapprove the organization or entity offering the test, it may seek a review of the decision from the Director, Education Service. If the Director, Education Service has acted as the State approving agency, the organization or entity may seek a review of the decision from the Under Secretary for Benefits.
(2) The organization or entity must make its request for a review in writing to the State approving agency. The State approving agency must receive the request within 90 days of the date of the notice to the organization or entity that the test or the organization or entity is disapproved.
(3) The review will be based on the evidence of record at the time the State approving agency made its initial decision. It will not be
de novo
in character.
(4) The Director, Education Service or the Under Secretary for Benefits may seek the advice of the Professional Certification and Licensure Advisory Committee, established under 38 U.S.C. 3689(e), as to whether the State approving agency's decision should be reversed.
(5) The decision of the Director, Education Service or the Under Secretary for Benefits is the final administrative decision. It will not be subject to further administrative review.

§ 21.4269
Bar to approval.
(a) Beginning on August 1, 2019, a State approving agency, or the Secretary when acting in the role of the State approving agency, shall disapprove a program of education provided by an educational institution that has in effect a policy that is inconsistent with any of the following:
(1) A policy that permits any covered individual to attend or participate in the program of education during the period beginning on the date on which the individual provides to the educational institution any verifiable and
authoritative VA document demonstrating entitlement to educational assistance under 38 U.S.C. chapter 31, chapter 33, or chapter 35 (such as a decision or notice of decision on entitlement, letter from VA, updated award letter from VA, or print-out of eligibility (statement of benefits) from a web-based VA system or beneficiary portal to include verification through VA's secure information technology system in accordance with 38 U.S.C. 3699A if an individual has provided authorization to obtain remaining entitlement information), and ending on the earlier of the following dates:
(i) The date on which payment from VA is made to the institution.
(ii) The date that is 90 days after the date on which the educational institution certifies tuition and fees following receipt of the verifiable and authoritative VA document proving entitlement to educational assistance under 38 U.S.C. chapter 31, chapter 33, or chapter 35.
(2) A policy that ensures an educational institution will not impose any penalty, including the assessment of late fees, the denial of access to classes, libraries, or other institutional facilities, or the requirement that a covered individual borrow additional funds, on any covered individual because of the individual's inability to meet his or her financial obligations to the institution due to the delayed disbursement of a payment to be provided by VA under 38 U.S.C. chapter 31, chapter 33, or chapter 35.
(b) For purposes of this section, a covered individual is any individual who is entitled to educational assistance under 38 U.S.C. chapter 31, chapter 33, or chapter 35.
(c) The Secretary (or designee) may waive such requirements of paragraph (a) of this section as the Secretary (or designee) considers appropriate. An educational institution must apply for a waiver within 60 days of the SAA determination that an educational institution is not in compliance with paragraph (a).
(d) It shall not be inconsistent with a policy described in paragraph (a) of this section for an educational institution:
(1) To require a covered individual to take the following additional actions:
(i) Submit any verifiable and authoritative VA document to prove entitlement to educational assistance under 38 U.S.C. chapter 31, chapter 33, or chapter 35 (as described in paragraph (a)(1)) not later than the first day of a program of education for which the individual has indicated the individual wishes to use the individual's entitlement to educational assistance.
(ii) Submit a written request to use such entitlement.
(iii) Provide additional information necessary to the proper certification of enrollment by the educational institution. If an educational institution intends to require additional information necessary for proper certification of enrollment, any such requirement must be included in the school's published catalog and also must be approved by the State approving agency, or the Secretary when acting in the role of the State approving agency, as being necessary for proper certification and not overly burdensome to submit.
(2) In a case in which a covered individual is unable to meet a financial obligation to an educational institution due to the delayed disbursement of a payment to be provided by VA under 38 U.S.C. chapter 31, chapter 33, or chapter 35 and the amount of such disbursement is less than the educational institution anticipated, to require additional payment of or impose a fee for the amount that is the difference between the amount of the financial obligation and the amount of the disbursement.
(i) Such additional payment may include the amount of a financial obligation associated with charges for which VA does not pay benefits (
e.g.,
room and board, any portion of tuition for which a claimant does not qualify).
(ii) An educational institution may utilize its standard debt collection policies for these amounts, including the assessment of late fees.

When the institution certifies that all undergraduate students enrolled for a minimum of 12 or 13 semester hours or the equivalent are charged full-time tuition, or considered full time for other administrative purposes, such minimum hours will establish the criteria for full-time measurement. When 12 hours is properly certified as full time, VA will measure 9 through 11 hours as

1/2
time, 4 through 5 hours as less than
1/2
time and more than

time or less. VA will measure all other undergraduate courses as indicated in the table for undergraduate or professional courses, as appropriate, but when 13 credit hours or the equivalent is certified as full time,
3/4
time will be 10 through 12 hours. When, in accordance with § 21.4273(a), a responsible official of a school certifies that a lesser number of hours constitute full time,

time,
1/2
time, less than
1/2

To meet criteria for full-time measurement in standard collegiate courses which include required noncredit deficiency courses, in the absence of a certification under § 21.4272(k), VA will convert the noncredit deficiency courses on the basis of the applicable measurement criteria, as follows: 18 or 22 clock hours, 4 “Carnegie Units,” or 12, 13, or 14 (as appropriate) semester hours equal full time. The credit-hour equivalent of such noncredit courses may constitute any portion of the required hours for full-time measurement.
3
Class sessions measured on basis of not less than 50 minutes of classroom instruction. Supervised study periods, class breaks and rest periods are excluded.
4
Supervised study must be excluded.
5
Full-time training will consist of the number of hours which constitute the standard workweek of the training establishment, but not less than 30 hours unless a lesser number of hours is established as the standard workweek for the particular establishment through bona fide collective bargaining between employers and employees.
6
In measuring net instruction there will be included customary intervals not to exceed 10 minutes between classes. Shop practice and rest periods are excluded. Supervised instruction periods in school's shops in farm cooperative programs and the time involved in field trips and individual and group instruction may be included in computing the clock hour requirements.
7
For full-time training the 440 clock hours a year may be prescheduled to provide not less than 80 clock hours in any 3-month period.

# Eligibility
§ 21.5040
Basic eligibility.
(a)
Individuals not on active duty.
Whether an individual has basic eligibility under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 32 for educational assistance depends upon when he or she entered the military service, the length of that service, and the character of that service.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3202).
(b)
Service requirements for all individuals not on active duty.
(1) An individual not on active duty:
(i) Must have entered the military service after December 31, 1976, and before July 1, 1985;

(iii) Must have received an unconditional discharge or release under conditions other than dishonorable from any period of service upon which eligibility is based;
(iv) Must either have:
(A) Served on active duty for a least 181 continuous days, or
(B) Been discharged or released from active duty for a service-connected disability.
(2) The Department of Veterans Affairs will consider that the veteran has an unconditional discharge or release if:
(i) The individual was eligible for complete separation from active duty on the date a discharge or release was issued to him or her, or
(ii) The provisions of § 3.13(c) of this chapter are met.
(3) The provisions of § 3.12 of this chapter as to character of discharge and § 3.13 of this chapter as to conditional discharges are applicable.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3202)
(c)
Additional active duty service requirements for some individuals not on active duty—Chapter 32.
(1) Unless exempted by paragraph (d) of this section, persons who originally enlist in a regular component of the Armed Forces after September 7, 1980, or who enter on active duty after October 16, 1981 (either as an enlisted member or an officer) to be eligible under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 32, must first complete the shorter of:
(i) 24 continuous months of active duty, or
(ii) The full period for which the individual was called or ordered to active duty.
(2) For the purpose of paragraph (c)(1) of this section the Department of Veterans Affairs considers that an enlisted person originally enlisted in a regular component of the Armed Forces on the date he or she entered on active duty even though he or she may have signed a delayed-entry contract on an earlier date.
(3) In computing time served for the purpose of this paragraph, the Department of Veterans Affairs will exclude any period during which the individual is not entitled to credit for service as specified in § 3.15 of this chapter. However, those periods will be included in determining if the service was continuous.
(d)
Individuals exempt from additional active duty requirements.
(1) An individual who originally enlists in a regular component of the Armed Forces after September 7, 1980, or who enters on active duty after October 16, 1981 (either as an enlisted member or officer), will be eligible to receive benefits under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 32 based upon the ensuing period of active duty, and is exempt from the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section if he or she subsequently:
(i) Is discharged or released from active duty:
(A) Under 10 U.S.C. 1173 (hardship discharge), or
(B) Under 10 U.S.C. 1171 (early-out discharge), or
(C) For a disability incurred in or aggravated in line of duty; or
(ii) Is found by Department of Veterans Affairs to have a service-connected disability which gives the individual basic entitlement to disability compensation as described in § 3.4(b) of this chapter. Once the Department of Veterans Affairs makes this finding, the exemption will continue to apply even if the disability subsequently improves and becomes noncompensable.
(2) An individual who enters on a period of active duty after October 16, 1981, is also exempt from the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section if he or she:
(i) Previously completed a continuous period of active duty of at least 24 months, or
(ii) Was discharged or released from a previous period of active duty under 10 U.S.C. 1171 (early-out discharge).
(3) In computing time served for the purpose of this paragraph, the Department of Veterans Affairs will exclude any period during which the individual is not entitled to credit for service as specified in § 3.15 of this chapter. However, those periods will be included in determining if the service was continuous.
(e)
Savings provision.
An individual may become a participant and establish basic eligibility under the provisions of this section based upon a period of active duty service which began before October 16, 1981. He or she would not lose the basic eligibility based upon that period of service if, following a release from active duty, the individual reenters on active duty after October 16, 1981, and fails to meet the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section or qualify for an exemption under paragraph (d) of this section. He or she will receive a refund of any contributions he or she may make to the fund during the second period of active duty. See § 21.5065.

(g)
Election to receive educational assistance allowance under 38 U.S.C. chapter 32 instead of 10 U.S.C. chapter 1606.
An individual who serves in the Selected Reserves may not receive credit for that service under both 38 U.S.C. Chapter 32 and 10 U.S.C. Chapter 1606. If he or she wishes to receive educational assistance based upon this service, the veteran must elect the chapter under which he or she will receive benefits.
(1) This election must be in writing and submitted to VA.
(2) If a veteran elects to receive educational assistance under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 32, and negotiates an educational assistance check which is based upon the period of service for which the election was made, the election is irrevocable. Negotiation of an educational assistance check provided under either 38 U.S.C. chapter 32 or 10 U.S.C. chapter 1606, but based upon a period of service which preceded the period for which an election was made, will not serve to make the election irrevocable.

(1) The veteran applies for an extension.
(2) The veteran was prevented from initiating or completing the chosen program of education within the otherwise applicable delimiting period because of a physical or mental disability that did not result from the willful misconduct of the veteran. VA will not consider the disabling effects of chronic alcoholism to be the result of willful misconduct. See § 21.5021(v).
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 105, 3232, 3462; Pub. L. 99-576, Pub. L. 100-689)
(b)
Application.

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3232, Pub. L. 99-576)

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 105; Pub. L. 100-689)
(3) Evidence must be presented which clearly establishes that the veteran's disability made pursuit of his or her program medically infeasible during the veteran's original period of eligibility as determined by § 21.5041 of this part.

(4) VA will not consider a veteran who is disabled for a period of 30 days or less as having been prevented from enrolling or reenrolling in the chosen program of education or was forced to discontinue attendance, because of the short disability.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3232, Pub. L. 99-576)

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 105, 3232; Pub. 99-576, Pub. L. 100-689)
(e)
Determining the length of extended periods of eligibility.
A veteran's extended period of eligibility shall be based upon the qualifying period of disability, and determined as follows:
(1) If the veteran is in training in a course organized on a term, quarter or semester basis, his or her extended period of eligibility shall contain the same number of days as the number of days from the date during the veteran's original delimiting period that his or her training became medically infeasible to the earliest of the following dates:

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3231)
(b)

§ 21.5072
Entitlement charge.
The Department of Veterans Affairs shall determine the entitlement charge for each payment in the same manner for all individuals regardless of whether they are on active duty. Unless the circumstances described in paragraph (i) of this section apply to a servicemember or veteran, VA will use paragraphs (a) through (h) of this section to determine an entitlement charge.
(a)
General.
(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) through (i) of this section, VA will make a charge against entitlement as follows:
(i) The Department of Veterans Affairs will charge an individual who is a full-time student 1 month's entitlement for each monthly benefit paid to him or her.
(ii) The Department of Veterans Affairs will charge an individual who is other than a full-time student 1 month's entitlement for each sum of money paid equivalent to what the individual would have been paid had he or she been a full-time student for 1 month.
(2) When the computation results in a period of time other than a full month, the entitlement charge will be prorated.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3231)
(b)
Secondary school program.
(1) The Department of Veterans Affairs will make no charge against the entitlement of an individual:
(i) Who is pursuing a course, courses or a program of education leading to a secondary school diploma or an equivalency certificate, and
(ii) Whose educational assistance allowance is the monthly rate of the tuition and fees being charged to him or her for the course.
(2) The Department of Veterans Affairs will make a charge (in the same manner as for any other residence training) against the entitlement of an individual who:
(i) Is pursuing a course, courses or a program of education leading to a secondary school diploma or an equivalency certificate, and
(ii) Elects to receive educational assistance allowance calculated according to § 21.5136.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3241, 3491)
(c)
Correspondence training courses.
(1) A charge against the period of entitlement for a program consisting exclusively of correspondence training will be made on the basis of 1 month for each sum of money paid equivalent to the dollar value of a month of entitlement as determined under § 21.5138(a)(2)(viii), which is paid to the individual as an educational assistance allowance for this training. When computation results in a period of time other than a full month, the charge will be prorated.
(2) If the individual is contributing to the fund at the same time that benefits are being used or subsequently contributes a sum or sums, the entitlement charges will not be recomputed. Thus, if the monthly rate arrived at by applying the formula is determined to be $150 at the time a benefit program for correspondence training is computed, the individual will be charged 1 month of entitlement for each $150 paid. If a different monthly rate is computed at the time of a subsequent payment for such training, no adjustment will be made in the entitlement charged for the previous payment(s) even though the value of each month's entitlement may vary from payment to payment.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3231(c))
(d)
Apprenticeship or other on-job training.
(1) The VA will determine the entitlement charge for a veteran in apprenticeship or other on-job training as stated in this paragraph.
(2) The entitlement charge will be—
(i) 75 percent of a month for those months for which the veteran's monthly payment is based upon 75 percent of the monthly benefit otherwise payable to him or her;
(ii) 55 percent of a month for those months for which the veteran's monthly payment is based upon 55 percent of the monthly benefit otherwise payable to him or her; and
(iii) 35 percent of a month for those months for which the veteran's monthly payment is based upon 35 percent of the monthly benefit otherwise payable to him or her.
(3) The charge against the veteran's entitlement will be prorated if—
(i) The veteran's enrollment period ends in the middle of a month,
(ii) The veteran's monthly rate is reduced in the middle of a month, or
(iii) The veteran's monthly payment is reduced because he or she worked less than 120 hours during the month. In this instance the number of hours worked will be rounded to the nearest multiple of eight, and the entitlement charge will be reduced proportionately.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3233(c); Pub. L. 99-576)
(e)
Cooperative training.
VA will make a charge against entitlement of 80 percent of a month for each month for which a veteran is paid educational assistance allowance at the cooperative training rate as provided in § 21.5138(a). If the veteran is paid for a partial month of training, the entitlement charge will be prorated.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3231(d); Pub. L. 100-689)
(f)
Training while the veteran is incarcerated.
If the veteran must be paid educational assistance allowance at a reduced rate because he or she is incarcerated as provided in § 21.5139 of this part, VA will make a charge against entitlement of one month for each
amount of educational assistance allowance paid to the veteran which is the equivalent of one month's benefits as provided in § 21.5138 of this part for the appropriate type of training pursued.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3231(e); Pub. L. 100-689)
(g)
Tutorial assistance.
If an individual is paid tutorial assistance as provided in § 21.5141 of this part, the following provisions will apply.
(1) There will be no charge to entitlement for the first $600 of tutorial assistance paid to an individual.
(2) VA will make a charge against the period of entitlement for each amount of tutorial assistance paid to the individual in excess of $600 that is equal to the amount of monthly educational assistance the individual is otherwise eligible to receive for full-time pursuit of a residence course as provided in § 21.5138(c) of this part. When the amount of tutorial assistance paid to the individual in excess of $600 is less than the amount of monthly educational assistance the individual is otherwise eligible to receive, the entitlement charge will be prorated.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3234; Pub. L. 100-689)
(h)
Flight training courses.
(1) A charge against the period of entitlement for pursuit of a flight training course will be one month for each sum of money paid equivalent to the dollar value of a month of entitlement as determined under § 21.5138(a)(5)(viii). When this computation results in a period of time other than a full month, the charge will be prorated.
(2) If the individual is contributing to the fund at the same time that benefits are being used or subsequently contributes a sum or sums, the entitlement charges will not be recomputed. Thus, if the monthly rate arrived at under § 21.5138(a)(5)(viii) is $150 at the time educational assistance allowance is paid for a period of flight training, the individual will be charged one month of entitlement for each $150 paid. If a different monthly rate is computed at the time of a subsequent payment for such training, no adjustment will be made in the entitlement charged for the previous payment(s) even though the value of each month's entitlement may vary from payment to payment.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3231(f); Pub. L. 102-16)(Apr. 1, 1991)
(i)
Entitlement charge may be omitted for course discontinuance due to orders to, or changing, active duty in certain instances.
VA will make no charge against the entitlement of a servicemember or veteran for a payment of educational assistance when—
(1)(i) A veteran not serving on active duty had to discontinue course pursuit as a result of being ordered, in connection with the Persian Gulf War by orders dated before September 11, 2001, to serve on active duty under 10 U.S.C. 688, 12301(a), 12301(d), 12301(g), 12302, or 12304, or former 10 U.S.C. 672(a), 672(d), 672(g), 673, or 673b (redesignated effective December 1, 1994, as 10 U.S.C. 12301(a), 12301(d), 12301(g), 12302, and 12304, respectively); or

§ 21.5296
Extended period of eligibility.
(a)
General.
A veteran shall be granted an extension of the applicable delimiting period, as otherwise determined by § 21.5041 provided—
(1) The veteran applies for an extension.
(2) The veteran was prevented from initiating or completing the chosen program of education within the otherwise applicable delimiting period because of a physical or mental disability that did not result from the willful misconduct of the veteran. VA will not consider the disabling effects of chronic alcoholism to be the result of willful misconduct.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 105, 3232; Pub. L. 99-576, Pub. L. 100-689)
(b)
Application.
(1) Only the veteran may apply for an extended period of eligibility pursuant to this section. A spouse or child to whom entitlement may be or has been transferred may not apply for, nor receive, an extension based upon disability of either the veteran or the spouse or child.
(2) The veteran must apply for the extended period of eligibility in time for VA to receive the application by the later of the following dates:
(i) One year from the last date of the delimiting period otherwise applicable to the veteran under § 21.5041, or
(ii) One year from the termination date of the period of the veteran's mental or physical disability.
(3) No application for an extended period of eligibility should be submitted and none will be processed during any period when the veteran has transferred entitlement to a spouse or child, since eligibility cannot be fully determined as provided in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3232; Pub. L. 99-576)
(c)
Qualifying period of disability.
A veteran's extended period of eligibility shall be based on the period of time that the veteran himself or herself was prevented by reason of physical or mental disability, not the result of the veteran's willful misconduct, from initiating or completing his or her chosen
program of education. VA will not consider the disabling effects of chronic alcoholism to be the result of willful misconduct.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 105, 3232; Pub. L. 99-576, Pub. L. 100-689)
(1) Evidence must be presented which clearly establishes that the veteran's disability made pursuant of his or her program medically infeasible during the veteran's original period of eligibility as determined by § 21.5041. A period of disability following the end of the original disability period will not be a basis for extension.
(2) VA will not consider a veteran who is disabled for a period of 30 days or less as having been prevented from enrolling or reenrolling in the chosen program of education or was forced to discontinue attendance, because of the short disability.
(3) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, a veteran's transfer of entitlement to a spouse or child during a period for which the veteran's disability prevented his or her pursuit of a program of education will not affect the veteran's entitlement to an extension of eligibility under this section.
(4) Since the act of entitlement transfer to a spouse or child indicates that the veteran did not intend to personally use his or her educational assistance during the specified transfer period, a veteran who becomes disabled after transferring entitlement will not be entitled to an extended period of eligibility based on any period of the disability which coincides with the specified transfer period unless—
(i) The transferee or transferees did not use any entitlement during this period, and
(ii) The veteran can clearly demonstrate that, notwithstanding his or her decision to transfer entitlement, the veteran would have used the entitlement during all or part of the transfer period and was prevented from doing so solely by reason of his or her disability.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3232; Pub. L. 99-576)
(d)
Commencing date.
The veteran shall elect the commencing date of an extended period of eligibility. The date chosen—
(1) Must be on or after the original date of expiration of eligibility as determined by § 21.5041 of this part, and
(2) Must be on or before the 90th day following the date on which the veteran's application for an extension was approved by VA, if the veteran is training during the extended period of eligibility in a course not organized on a term, quarter or semester basis, or
(3) Must be on or before the first day of the first ordinary term, quarter or semester following the 90th day after the veteran's application for an extension was approved by VA if the veteran is training during the extended period of eligibility in a course organized on a term, quarter or semester basis.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3232; Pub. L. 99-576)
(e)
Determining the length of extended periods of eligibility.
A veteran's extended period of eligibility shall be based on the qualifying period of disability, and determined as follows:
(1) If the veteran is in training in a course organized on a term, quarter or semester basis, his or her extended period of eligibility shall contain the same number of days as the number of days from the date during the veteran's original delimiting period that his or her training became medically infeasible to the earliest of the following dates:
(i) The commencing date of the ordinary term, quarter or semester following the day the veteran's training became medically feasible,
(ii) The veteran's delimiting date as determined by § 21.5041 of this part, or

# Measurement of Courses
§ 21.5870
Measurement of courses.
(a)
Credit hour measurement: undergraduate, standard term.
An individual who enrolls in a standard quarter or semester for 12 undergraduate credit hours is a full-time student. An individual who enrolls in a standard quarter or semester for less than 12 undergraduate credit hours is a part-time student.
(Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2144(c))
(b)
Credit hour measurement: Undergraduate, nonstandard term.
(1) If an individual enrolls in a nonstandard term, quarter or semester, and the school measures the course on a credit-hour basis, VA will determine whether that individual is a full-time student by—
(i) Multiplying the credits earned in the term by 18 if credit is granted in semester hours, or by 12 if credit is granted in quarter hours, and
(ii) Dividing the product by the number of whole weeks in the term.
(2) In determining whole weeks VA will—
(i) Divide the number of days in the term by 7;
(ii) Disregard a remainder of 3 days or less, and
(iii) Consider 4 days or more to be a whole week.
(3) If the number obtained by using the formula in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section is 12 or more, the individual is a full-time student. If that number is less than 12, the individual is a part-time student.
(c)
Credit hour measurement: graduate.
(1) If it is the established policy of a school to consider less than 12 credit hours to be full-time for graduate students, VA will accept the statement of a responsible school offical as to whether the student is a full-time or part-time student. If the school does not have such a policy, VA will measure the student's enrollment according to the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
(2) VA will measure undergraduate courses required by the school according to the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, even though the individual is enrolled as a graduate student. If the individual is taking both graduate and undergraduate courses, the school will report the credit-hour equivalent of the graduate work. VA will first measure the undergraduate courses according to the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section and combine the result with the credit-hour equivalent of the graduate work in order to determine the extent of training.
(d)
Clock hour measurement.
(1) If an individual enrolls in a course measured in clock hours and shop practice is an integral part of the course, he or she is a full-time student when enrolled in 22 clock hours or more per week with not more than a 2
1/2
hour rest period allowance per week. For all other enrollments the individual is a part-time student. VA will exclude supervised study in determining the number of clock hours in which the individual is enrolled.
(2) If an individual enrolls in a course measured in clock hours and theory and class instruction predominate in the course, he or she is a full-time student enrolled in 18 clock hours or more per week. He or she is a part-time student when enrolled in less than 18 clock hours per week. Customary intervals not to exceed 10 minutes between classes will be included in measuring net instruction. Shop practice, rest periods, and supervised study are excluded. Supervised instruction periods in schools' shops and the time involved in field trips and individual and group instruction may be included in computing the clock hour requirements.

§ 21.6054
Criteria for determining good employment potential.
(a)
Determining good employment potential.
Before scheduling an evaluation of feasibility to pursue a vocational goal for a qualified veteran under § 21.6005(c)(2), VA will first determine whether the veteran has good potential for achieving employment if provided a vocational training or employment program.

Estimating the duration of the training period needed.
The CP or VRC, in estimating duration of the training period needed, must determine that:
(1) The proposed vocational training program must be one which, when pursued full-time by a nondisabled person, would not normally require more than 24 calendar months of pursuit for successful completion;
(2) The program of training and other services needed by the veteran, based upon VA's evaluation, will not exceed 24 calendar months, if training is pursued on a full-time basis, or 36 calendar months if pursued on a less than full-time basis. In making this determination the following criteria will be applied:
(i) The number of actual months and days of the period during which the veteran will pursue the training program will be counted;
(ii) Days of authorized leave and other periods during which the veteran will not be pursuing training, such as periods between terms will also be counted;
(iii) The period of evaluation prior to determination of reasonable feasibility will be excluded but the actual number of months and days needed to evaluate and improve rehabilitation potential during the training program will be included;
(iv) The time required, as determined in months and days under paragraph (e)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section, will be the total period that would be required for the veteran to accomplish the vocational program under consideration;
(v) If the total period the veteran requires exceeds 24 calendar months, when pursued on a full-time basis, and an extension of the basic training period may not be approved under § 21.6072 of this part, another suitable vocational goal must be selected for which training can be completed within that period.
(3) If the veteran's vocational training program would require more than 36 calendar months when pursued on a less than full-time basis, the program must be reevaluated to select a vocational goal for which a suitable vocational training program can be completed within that period.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1524(b)(2))
(f)
Effect of change in the vocational goal on duration of training period.
The
veteran's vocational goal may be changed during the program in accordance with § 21.94 (a) through (d) of this part. The extent to which such changes may be made is limited by the following considerations:
(1) A change of the vocational goal from one field or occupational family to another field or occupational family may only be approved before the end of the first 24 months of training, whether training is pursued on a full-time or a less than full-time basis; and
(2) A change from one occupational objective to another within the same field or occupational family shall not be considered a change in the vocational goal identified in the veteran's IWRP.

§ 21.7042
Basic eligibility requirements.
An individual must meet the requirements of this section, § 21.7044, or § 21.7045 in order to be eligible for basic educational assistance. This section requires an individual to complete certain academic requirements before applying for educational assistance. If the individual applies before completing those requirements, VA will disallow the application. However, the individual's premature application will not prevent the individual from establishing eligibility at a later time by applying for educational assistance again after having completed those academic requirements. In determining whether an individual has met the service requirements of this section, VA will exclude any period during which the individual is not entitled to credit for service for the periods of time specified in § 3.15.

(a)(6), (b)(1) through (b)(9), (c), or (d) of this section is not reduced as provided in paragraph (g)(1) or (g)(2) of this section, the failure to make the reduction will have no effect on his or her eligibility, but will negate or reduce the individual's entitlement to educational assistance under 38 U.S.C. chapter 30 determined as provided in § 21.7073 for an individual described in paragraph (c) of this section;
(ii) The basic pay of an individual, described in paragraph (a)(7) or (b)(10) of this section, is not reduced as described in paragraph (g)(4) of this section and/or VA does not collect from the individual an amount equal to the difference between $1,200 and the total amount of the pay reductions described in paragraph (g)(4) of this section, that individual is ineligible for educational assistance. If the failure to reduce the individual's basic pay and/or the failure to collect from the individual was due to administrative error on the part of the Federal government or any of its employees, the individual may be considered for equitable relief depending on the facts and circumstances of the case. See § 2.7 of this chapter.

VA shall grant an extension of the applicable delimiting period, as otherwise determined by § 21.7050 of this part provided:
(1) The veteran applies for an extension within the time specified in § 21.1033(c).
(2) The veteran was prevented from initiating or completing the chosen program of education within the otherwise applicable eligibility period because of a physical or mental disability that did not result from the veteran's willful misconduct. VA will not consider the disabling effects of chronic alcoholism to be the result of willful misconduct. (See § 21.7020(b)(38)) It must be clearly established by medical evidence that such a program of education was medically infeasible. VA will not consider a veteran who is disabled for a period of 30 days or less as having been prevented from initiating or completing a chosen program, unless the evidence establishes that the veteran was prevented from enrolling or reenrolling in the chosen program or was forced to discontinue attendance, because of the short disability.

(ii) On or before the commencing date of the first ordinary term, quarter or semester following the 90th day after the veteran's application for an extension was approved by VA, if the veteran is training during the extended period of eligibility in a course organized on a term, quarter or semester basis.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3031(d); Pub. L. 98-525)
(c)
Length of extended periods of eligibility.
A veteran's extended period of eligibility shall be for the length of time that the individual was prevented from initiating or completing his or
her chosen program of education. This shall be determined as follows:
(1) If the veteran is in training in a course organized on a term, quarter or semester basis, his or her extended period of eligibility shall contain the same number of days as the number of days from the date during the veteran's original eligibility period that his or her training became medically infeasible to the earliest of the following date.
(i) The commencing date of the ordinary term, quarter or semester following the day the veteran's training became medically infeasible,
(ii) The last date of the veteran's delimiting date as determined by § 21.7050 of this part, or

An individual is entitled to one month of basic educational assistance (or the equivalent thereof in part-time basic educational assistance) for each four months served by the individual in the Selected Reserve after June 30, 1985 (other than a month in which the individual serves on active duty). Except as provided in § 21.7073, VA will apply the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section when the individual—
(i) Establishes eligibility through meeting the eligibility requirements of § 21.7042 or § 21.7044, and
(ii) Bases his or her eligibility upon a combination of service on active duty and service in the Selected Reserve as described in § 21.7042(b) and § 21.7044(b).
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3013(b))

(ii) Is attempting to establish eligibility through service in the Selected Reserve;
(iii) Has completed the active duty service required in § 21.7042 of this part; and

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3011, 3012; Pub. L. 98-525)
(e)
Repayment of an education loan affects entitlement.
A period of service counted for the purpose of repayment under section 902 of the Department of Defense Authorization Act, 1981, of an education loan may not also be counted for the purposes of determining the number of months of the veteran's or servicemember's entitlement to basic educational assistance. Therefore, in determining a veteran's or servicemember's entitlement, VA will—
(1) Determine his or her entitlement as provided in paragraph (a), (b), (c) or (d) of this section, as appropriate, and
(2) Subtract from the figure determined in paragraph (e)(1) of this section the number of months of service counted for the purposes of repayment of an educational loan under section 902 of the Department of Defense Authorization Act, 1981.

§ 21.7076
Entitlement charges.
(a)
Overview.
VA will make charges against entitlement as stated in this section.
(1) Charges will be made against the entitlement the veteran or servicemember has to educational assistance under 38 U.S.C. chapter 30 as the assistance is paid.
(2) There will be a charge (for record purposes only) against the remaining entitlement, under 38 U.S.C. chapter 34, of an individual who is receiving the educational assistance under § 21.7137 of this part. The record-purpose charges against entitlement under 38 U.S.C. chapter 34 will not count against the 48 months of total entitlement under both 38 U.S.C. chapters 30 and 34 to which the veteran or servicemember may be entitled. (
See
§ 21.4020(a) of this part).
(3) Generally, VA will base those entitlement charges on the principle that a veteran or servicemember who trains full time for one day should be charged one day of entitlement. However, this general principle does not apply to a veteran or servicemember who:
(i) Is pursuing correspondence training;
(ii) Is pursuing flight training;
(iii) Is pursuing an apprenticeship or other on-job training;
(iv) Is paid an accelerated payment;
(v) Is receiving educational assistance for taking an approved licensing or certification test; or
(vi) Is receiving tuition assistance top-up.
(4) The provisions of this section apply to:
(i) Veterans and servicemembers training under 38 U.S.C. chapter 30; and
(ii) Veterans training under 38 U.S.C. chapter 31 who make a valid election under § 21.21 of this part to receive educational assistance equivalent to that paid to veterans under 38 U.S.C. chapter 30.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3013, 3014(b), 3014A, 3689)
(b)
Determining entitlement charge.
This paragraph states how VA generally will determine the charge against the entitlement of a servicemember or veteran who is receiving educational assistance. However, when the circumstances described in paragraph (e) apply to a servicemember or veteran, VA will use that paragraph to determine an entitlement charge instead of this paragraph.
(1) Except for those pursuing correspondence training, flight training, apprenticeship or other on-job training; those receiving tuition assistance top-up; those receiving educational assistance for taking an approved licensing or certification test; those receiving tutorial assistance; and those receiving an accelerated payment, VA will make a charge against entitlement:
(i) On the basis of total elapsed time (one day for each day of pursuit) if the servicemember or veteran is pursuing the program of education on a full-time basis,
(ii) On the basis of a proportionate rate of elapsed time, if the veteran or servicemember is pursuing the program of education on a three-quarter, one-half or less than one-half time basis. For the purpose of this computation, training time which is less than one-half, but more than one-quarter time, will be treated as though it were one-quarter time training.
(2) VA will compute elapsed time from the commencing date of the award to date of discontinuance. If the veteran or servicemember changes his or her training time after the commencing date of the award, VA will—
(i) Divide the enrollment period into separate periods of time during which the veteran's or servicemember's training time remains constant, and.
(ii) Compute the elapsed time separately for each time period.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3013)
(3) For each month that a veteran is paid a monthly educational assistance allowance while undergoing apprenticeship or other on-job training, VA will make a charge against 38 U.S.C. chapter 30 entitlement of—
(i) .75 of a month in the case of payments made during the first six months of the veteran's pursuit of the program of apprenticeship or other on-job training,
(ii) .55 of a month in the case of payments made during the second six months of the veteran's pursuit of the program of apprenticeship or other on-job training, and
(iii) .35 of a month in the case of payments made following the first twelve months of the veteran's pursuit of apprenticeship or other on-job training.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3032(c))
(4) For each month that a veteran is paid a monthly educational assistance allowance while undergoing apprenticeship or other on-job training, including any month in which the veteran fails to complete 120 hours of training, VA will make a record-purpose charge against 38 U.S.C. chapter 34 entitlement, if any, as follows:
(i) For training that occurs before October 1, 2005, VA will reduce 38 U.S.C. chapter 34 entitlement by one month for each month of benefits paid.
(ii) For training that occurs on or after October 1, 2005, VA will reduce 38 U.S.C. chapter 34 entitlement proportionately based on the percentage rate (rounded to the nearest percentage) determined by dividing the amount of the training assistance paid for the month by the monthly educational assistance payable for full-time enrollment in an educational institution.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3015(e), 3032(c), 3687; sec. 102, Pub. L. 108-454, 118 Stat. 3600)
(5) When a veteran or servicemember is pursuing a program of education by correspondence, VA will make a charge against entitlement for each payment made to him or her. The charge—
(i) Will be made in months and decimal fractions of a month, and
(ii) Will be determined by dividing the amount of the payment by an amount equal to the rate of educational assistance otherwise applicable to him or her for full-time training (disregarding in the case of a servicemember the cost of course comparison).
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3032(d))
(6) When a veteran or servicemember is pursuing a program of education partly in residence and partly by correspondence, VA will make a charge against entitlement—
(i) For the residence portion of the program as provided in paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) of this section, and
(ii) For the correspondence portion of the program as provided in paragraph (b)(5) of this section.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3032(c), 3032(d))
(7) When a veteran or servicemember is paid an accelerated payment, VA will make a charge against entitlement for each accelerated payment made to him or her. The charge—
(i) Will be made in months and decimal fractions of a month; and
(ii) Will be determined by dividing the amount of the accelerated payment by an amount equal to the rate of basic educational assistance otherwise applicable to him or her for full-time institutional training. If the rate of basic educational assistance increases during the enrollment period, VA will charge entitlement for the periods covered by the initial rate and the increased rate, respectively.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3014A)
(8) If an individual is paid tutorial assistance as provided in § 21.7141, the following provisions will apply.
(i) There will be no charge to entitlement for the first $600 of tutorial assistance paid to an individual under 38 U.S.C. ch. 30.
(ii) VA will make a charge against the period of entitlement of one month for each amount of tutorial assistance paid under 38 U.S.C. ch. 30, to the individual in excess of $600 that is equal to the amount of monthly educational assistance the individual is otherwise eligible to receive for full-time pursuit of a residence course as provided in §§ 21.7136, 21.7137 and 21.7138, as appropriate. When the amount of tutorial assistance paid to the individual in excess of $600 is less than the amount of monthly educational assistance the individual is otherwise eligible to receive, the entitlement charge will be prorated.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3019; Pub. L. 100-689) (Nov. 18, 1988)
(9) When a veteran or servicemember is pursuing a program of education through flight training, VA will make a charge against entitlement for each payment made to him or her. The charge—
(i) Will be made in months and decimal fractions of a month, and
(ii) Will be determined by dividing the amount of the payment by an amount equal to the rate of basic educational assistance otherwise applicable to him or her for full-time institutional training.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3031(f))
(10) When a servicemember receives tuition assistance top-up, VA will make a charge against his or her entitlement as established under § 21.7072 equal to the number of months and days determined by dividing the total amount paid by an amount equal to the servicemember's monthly rate of basic educational assistance as calculated under § 21.7136. VA will make a charge against his or her tuition assistance top-up entitlement as established under § 21.7075 by subtracting from that entitlement the total number of months and days in the term, quarter, or semester for which the servicemember received tuition assistance.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3014(b))
(11) When a veteran or servicemember receives educational assistance for taking an approved licensing or certification test, VA will make a charge against his or her entitlement equal to the number of months and days determined by dividing the total amount paid by an amount equal to the servicemember's monthly rate of basic educational assistance as calculated under § 21.7136, excluding any additional “kicker” that may be paid under § 21.7136(g).
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3032(f)(2))
(c)
Overpayment cases.
VA will make a charge against entitlement for an overpayment only if the overpayment is
discharged in bankruptcy; is waived, and is not recovered; or is compromised.
(1) If the overpayment is discharged in bankruptcy or is waived and is not recovered, the charge against entitlement will be at the appropriate rate for the elapsed period covered by the overpayment (exclusive of interest, administrative costs of collection, court costs and marshal fees).
(2) If the overpayment is compromised and the compromise offer is less than the amount of interest, administrative costs of collection, court costs and marshal fees, the charge against entitlement will be at the appropriate rate for the elapsed period covered by the overpayment (exclusive of interest, administrative costs of collection, court costs and marshal fees).
(3) If the overpayment is compromised and the compromise offer is equal to or greater than the amount of interest, administrative costs of collection, court costs and marshal fees, the charge against entitlement will be determined by—
(i) Subtracting the portion of the debt attributable to interest, administrative costs of collection, court costs and marshal fees from the compromise offer,
(ii) Subtracting the amount determined in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section from the amount of the original debt (exclusive of interest, administrative costs of collection, court costs and marshal fees),
(iii) Dividing the result obtained in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section by the amount of the original debt (exclusive of interest, administrative costs of collection, court costs and marshal fees), and
(iv) Multiplying the percentage obtained in paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section by the amount of the entitlement which represents the whole overpaid period.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3013; Pub. L. 98-525)
(d)
Interruption to conserve entitlement.
A veteran may not interrupt a certified period of enrollment for the purpose of conserving entitlement. An educational institution may not certify a period of enrollment for a fractional part of the normal term, quarter or semester, if the veteran or servicemember is enrolled for the entire term, quarter or semester. VA will make a charge against entitlement for the entire period of certified enrollment, if the veteran or servicemember is otherwise eligible for educational assistance, except when educational assistance is interrupted under any of the following conditions:
(1) Enrollment is terminated;
(2) The veteran or servicemember cancels his or her enrollment, and does not negotiate an educational assistance check for any part of the certified period of enrollment;
(3) The veteran or servicemember interrupts his or her enrollment at the end of any term, quarter or semester within the certified period of enrollment, and does not negotiate a check for educational assistance for the succeeding term, quarter or semester;
(4) The veteran or servicemember requests interruption or cancellation for any break when a school was closed during a certified period of enrollment, and VA continued payments under an established policy based upon an Executive Order of the President or an emergency situation. Whether the veteran or servicemember negotiated a check for educational assistance for the certified period is immaterial.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3013; Pub. L. 98-525)
(e)
No entitlement charge for some individuals.
When the criteria described in this paragraph are met, VA will make no charges against entitlement as described in paragraph (b) of this section.
(1) VA will make no charge against an individual's entitlement when the individual—
(i) Either—
(A) While not serving on active duty, had to discontinue pursuit of a course or courses as a result of being ordered, in connection with the Persian Gulf War, to serve on active duty under section 672 (a), (d), or (g), 673, 673b, or 688 of title 10, U.S. Code; or
(B) While serving on active duty, had to discontinue pursuit of a course or courses as a result of being ordered, in connection with the Persian Gulf War, to a new duty location or assignment or to perform an increased amount of work.
(ii) Failed to receive credit or lost training time toward completion of the individual's approved educational, professional or vocational objective as a result of having to discontinue his or her course pursuit.
(2) The period for which receipt of educational assistance allowance is not charged against the entitlement of an individual described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall not exceed the portion of the period of enrollment in the course or courses for which the individual failed to receive credit or with respect to which the individual lost training time.

(i) For a veteran or servicemember who does not complete the full course, courses, or program for which the accelerated payment was made, and who does not substantiate mitigating circumstances for not completing, VA will establish an overpayment equal to the amount of the accelerated payment.
(ii) For a veteran or servicemember who does not complete the full course, courses, or program for which the accelerated payment was made, but who substantiates mitigating circumstances for not completing, VA will prorate the amount of the accelerated payment to which he or she is entitled based on the number of days from the beginning date of the enrollment period through the date of last attendance. VA will determine the prorated amount by dividing the accelerated payment amount by the number of days in the enrollment period, and multiplying the result by the number of days from the beginning date of the enrollment period through the date of last attendance. The result of this calculation will equal the amount the individual is due. The difference between the accelerated payment and the amount the individual is due will be established as an overpayment.

§ 21.7172
Measurement of concurrent enrollments.
(a)
Conversion of units of measurement required.
Where a veteran enrolls concurrently in courses offered by two schools and the standards for the measurement of the courses pursued concurrently in the two schools are different, VA will measure the veteran's enrollment by converting the units of measurement for courses in the second school to their equivalent in units of measurement required for the courses in the program of education which the
veteran is pursuing at the primary institution. This conversion will be accomplished as follows:
(1) If VA measures the courses at the primary institution on a credit-hour basis (including a course which does not lead to a standard college degree, which is being measured on a credit-hour basis), and VA measures the courses at the second school on a clock-hour basis, the clock hours will be converted to credit hours.
(2) If VA measures the courses pursued at the primary institution on a clock-hour basis, and VA measures the courses pursued at the second school on a credit-hour basis, VA will convert the credit hours to clock hours to determine the veteran's training time.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3034, 3688)
(3) If VA measures the courses pursued at the primary institution on a clock-hour basis, and
(i) VA measures the courses pursued at the second school on a mixed basis, the courses pursued at the second school which VA can measure on credit-hour basis for at least one program at the second school will be converted to clock hours and the resulting clock hours added to determine the veteran's training time; or
(ii) VA measures the courses pursued at the second school on a credit-hour basis, VA will convert the credit hours to clock hours to determine the veteran's training time.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3034, 3688)
(b)
Conversion of clock hours to credit hours.
If the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section require VA to convert clock hours to credit hours, it will do so by—
(1) Dividing the number of credit hours which VA considers to be full-time at the educational institution whose courses are measured on a credit-hour basis by the number of clock hours which are full-time at the educational institution whose courses are measured on a clock-hour basis; and
(2) Multiplying each clock hour of attendance by the decimal determined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. VA will drop all fractional hours.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3034, 3688)
(c)
Conversion of credit hours to clock hours.
If the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section require VA to convert credit hours to clock hours, it will do so by—
(1) Dividing the number of clock hours which VA considers to be full-time at the educational institution whose courses are measured on a clock-hour basis by the number of credit hours which are full-time at the educational institution whose courses are measured on a credit-hour basis; and
(2) Multiplying each credit hour by the number determined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. VA will drop all fractional hours.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3034, 3688)
(d)
Both courses measured on a credit hour basis or both courses measured on a clock hour basis.
If VA measures the courses pursued at both institutions on a credit hour basis or on a clock hour basis, VA will measure the veteran's enrollment by adding together the units of measurement for the courses at the second school and the units of measurement for the courses at the primary institution. The standard for full time will be the full-time standard for the courses at the primary institution.

A reservist's extended period of eligibility shall be for the length of time that the reservist was prevented from initiating or completing his or her chosen program of education, except that it must end when the reservist is separated from the Selected Reserve. VA shall determine the length of time the reservist was prevented from initiating or completing his or her chosen program of education as follows:
(1) If the reservist is in training in a course organized on a term, quarter or semester basis, his or her extended period of eligibility shall contain the same number of days as the number of days from the date during the reservist's original eligibility period that his
or her training became medically infeasible to the earliest of the following dates:
(i) The commencing date of the ordinary term, quarter or semester following the day the reservist's training became medically infeasible,
(ii) The last date of the reservist's delimiting date as determined by § 21.7550(a) of this part, or
(iii) The date the reservist resumed training.
(2) If the reservist is training in a course not organized on a term, quarter or semester basis, his or her extended period of eligibility shall contain the same number of days as the number of days from the date during the reservist's original delimiting period that his or her training became medically infeasible to the earlier of the following dates:
(i) The date the reservist's training became medically feasible, or
(ii) The reservist's delimiting date as determined by § 21.7550(a)(1) of this part.

# Entitlement
§ 21.7570
Entitlement.
Except as provided in § 21.7576(e) each reservist is entitled to a maximum of 36 months of educational assistance (or its equivalent in part-time educational assistance) under this program, but is also subject to the provisions of § 21.4020 (a) and (b).
(Authority: 10 U.S.C. 16131(c); Pub. L. 98-525, Pub. L. 102-127) (Oct. 10, 1991)
[58 FR 51783, Oct. 5, 1993]
§ 21.7576
Entitlement charges.
(a)
Overview.
VA will make charges against entitlement as stated in this section. Charges are based upon the principle that a reservist who trains full time for one day should be charged one day of entitlement, except for those pursuing:
(1) Flight training;
(2) Correspondence training;
(3) Cooperative training; or
(4) Apprenticeship or other on-job training.
(Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2131(c); sec. 705(a)(1), Pub. L. 98-525, 98 Stat. 2565; sec. 642(a), (b), (d), Pub. L. 101-189, 103 Stat. 1456-1458)
(b)
Determining entitlement charge.
This paragraph states how VA will generally determine the charge against the entitlement of a reservist who is receiving educational assistance. However, when the circumstances described in paragraph (e) of this section apply to a reservist, VA will use that paragraph to determine an entitlement charge instead of this paragraph.
(1) Except for those pursuing flight training, correspondence training, cooperative training, apprenticeship or other on-job training, VA will make a charge against entitlement—
(i) On the basis of total elapsed time (one day for each day of pursuit for which the reservist is paid educational assistance) if the reservist is pursuing the program of education on a full-time basis; or
(ii) On the basis of a proportionate rate of elapsed time, if the reservist is pursuing the program of education on a three-quarter, one-half, or one-quarter-time basis.
(2) VA will compute elapsed time from the commencing date of the award of educational assistance to the date of discontinuance. If the reservist changes his or her training time after the commencing date of the award, VA will—
(i) Divide the enrollment period into separate periods of time during which the reservist's training time remains constant; and
(ii) Compute the elapsed time separately for each time period.
(3) For each month that a reservist is paid a monthly educational assistance allowance while undergoing apprenticeship or other on-job training, VA will make a charge against entitlement of—
(i) .75 of a month in the case of payments made during the first six months of the reservist's pursuit of the program of apprenticeship or other on-job training;
(ii) .55 of a month in the case of payments made during the second six months of the reservist's pursuit of the
program of apprenticeship or other on-job training; and
(iii) .35 of a month in the case of payments made following the first twelve months of the reservist's pursuit of the program of apprenticeship or other on-job training.
(4) When a reservist is pursuing a program of education by correspondence, VA will make a charge against entitlement for each payment made to him or her. The charge will be made in months and decimal fractions of a month, as determined by dividing the amount of the payment by an amount equal to the rate stated in § 21.7636(a)(1) as the rate otherwise applicable to the reservist for full-time training.
(5) When a reservist is pursuing a program of education partly in residence and partly by correspondence, VA will make a charge against entitlement—
(i) For the residence portion of the program as provided in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section; and
(ii) For the correspondence portion of the program as provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.
(6) When a reservist is pursuing a program of education through cooperative training, VA will make a charge against entitlement of .8 of a month for each month in which the reservist is receiving payment at the rate for cooperative training. If the reservist is pursuing cooperative training for a portion of a month, VA will make a charge against entitlement on the basis of total elapsed time (.8 of a day for each day of pursuit).
(Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2131(c), (d); sec. 705(a)(1), Pub. L. 98-525, 98 Stat. 2565; sec. 642(b), (d), Pub. L. 101-189, 103 Stat. 1456-1458)
(7) When a reservist is pursuing a program of education through flight training, VA will make a charge against entitlement at the rate of one month for each amount equal to the monthly rate stated in § 21.7636(a)(1) as applicable for the month in which the training occurred.
(Authority: 10 U.S.C. 16136(c))
(c)
Overpayment cases.
VA will make a charge against entitlement for an overpayment only if the overpayment is discharged in bankruptcy; is waived and is not recovered; or is compromised.
(1) If the overpayment is discharged in bankruptcy or is waived and is not recovered, the charge against entitlement will be at the appropriate rate for the elapsed period covered by the overpayment (exclusive of interest, administrative costs of collection, court costs and marshal fees).
(2) If the overpayment is compromised and the compromise offer is less than the amount of interest, administrative costs of collection, court costs and marshal fees, the charge against entitlement will be at the appropriate rate for the elapsed period covered by the overpayment (exclusive of interest, administrative costs of collection, court costs and marshal fees).
(3) If the overpayment is compromised and the compromise offer is equal to or greater than the amount of interest administrative costs of collection, court costs and marshal fees, the charge against entitlement will be determined by—
(i) Subtracting from the sum paid in the compromise offer the amount attributable to interest, administrative costs of collection, court costs and marshal fees,
(ii) Subtracting the remaining amount of the overpayment balance determined in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section from the amount of the original overpayment (exclusive of interest, administrative costs of collection, court costs and marshal fees),
(iii) Dividing the result obtained in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section by the amount of the original overpayment (exclusive of interest, administrative costs of collection, court costs and marshal fees), and
(iv) Multiplying the percentage obtained in paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section by the amount of the entitlement otherwise chargeable for the period of the original overpayment.
(Authority: 10 U.S.C. 16133(c); Pub. L. 98-525)
(d)
Interruption to conserve entitlement.
A reservist may not interrupt a certified period of enrollment for the purpose of conserving entitlement. An institution of higher learning may not certify a period of enrollment for a fractional part of the normal term,
quarter or semester if the reservist is enrolled for the entire term, quarter or semester. VA will make a charge for the entire period of certified enrollment, if the reservist is otherwise eligible for educational assistance, except when educational assistance is interrupted under any of the following conditions:
(1) Enrollment is terminated;
(2) The reservist cancels his or her enrollment, and does not negotiate an educational assistance check for any part of the certified period of enrollment;
(3) The reservist interrupts his or her enrollment at the end of any term, quarter or semester within the certified period of enrollment, and does not negotiate a check for educational assistance for the succeeding term, quarter or semester; and
(4) The reservist requests interruption or cancellation for any break when an institution of higher learning was closed during a certified period of enrollment, and VA continued payments under an established policy based upon an Executive Order of the President or an emergency situation. In such a case entitlement will be restored unless the reservist negotiated a check for educational assistance for the certified period and does not repay the amount received.
(Authority: 10 U.S.C. 16133(c); Pub. L. 98-525)
(e)
No entitlement charge for some reservists.
When the criteria described in this paragraph are met, there is an exception to the charges against entitlement described in paragraph (b) of this section.
(1) VA will make no charge against a reservist's entitlement when the reservist—
(i) While not serving on active duty, had to discontinue pursuit of a course or courses as a result of being ordered to serve on active duty under sections 12301(a),(d),(g), 12302, or 12304 of title 10, U. S. Code; and
(ii) Failed to receive credit or lost training time toward completion of the reservist's approved educational, professional or vocational objective as a result of having to discontinue his or her course pursuit.
(2) The period for which receipt of educational assistance allowance is not charged against a reservist's entitlement shall not exceed the portion of the period of enrollment in the course or courses for which the reservist failed to receive credit or with respect to which the reservist lost training time.

§ 21.7612
Programs of education combining two or more types of courses.
An approved program may consist of courses offered by two educational institutions concurrently, or courses offered through class attendance and by television concurrently. An educational institution may contract the actual training to another educational institution, provided the course is approved by the State approving agency having approval jurisdiction over the educational institution actually providing the training.
(a)
Concurrent enrollment.
When a reservist cannot schedule his or her complete program at one educational institution, VA may approve a program of concurrent enrollment. When requesting such a program, the reservist must
show that his or her complete program of education is not available at the educational institution in which he or she will pursue the major portion of his or her program (the primary educational institution), or that it cannot be scheduled within the period in which he or she plans to complete his or her program. A reservist who is limited in the types of courses he or she may pursue, as provided in § 21.7540 (b)(2) and (b)(3), may pursue courses only at an institution of higher learning.

Withdrawals and nonpunitive grades.
(1) Withdrawal from a course or receipt of a nonpunitive grade affects payments to a reservist.

(i) The reservist withdraws because he or she is ordered to active duty; or
(ii) Both of the following exist.
(A) There are mitigating circumstances, and
(B) The reservist submits a description of the circumstances in writing to VA either within one year from the date VA notifies the reservist that he or she must submit the mitigating circumstances, or at a later date if the reservist is able to show good cause why the one-year time limit should be extended to the date on which he or she submitted the description of the mitigating circumstances.

(1) The reservist's subsequent reentrance into a program of education may be for the same program, for a revised program, or for an entirely different program, depending on the cause of the discontinuance and removal of that cause.
(2) A reservist may reenter following discontinuance because of unsatisfactory attendance, conduct, or progress when either of the following sets of conditions exists:
(i) The reservist resumes enrollment at the same educational institution in the same program of education and the educational institution has both approved the reservist's reenrollment and certified it to VA; or
(ii) In all other cases, VA determines that—
(A) The cause of the unsatisfactory attendance, conduct, or progress in the previous program has been removed and is not likely to recur; and

§ 21.7672
Measurement of courses not leading to a standard college degree.
(a)
Overview.
(1) Courses not leading to a standard college degree may be measured on either a clock-hour basis, or a credit-hour basis or a combination of both. Factors which the Department of Veterans Affairs must include in determining the proper basis for measurement include whether the courses are accredited; whether the course could be credited toward a standard college degree; and whether the course is offered on a standard quarter or semester-hour basis.
(2) In determining which is the correct basis for measuring a reservist's enrollment, VA will first examine whether credit-hour measurement is appropriate, as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.
(3) If it is not appropriate to measure a reservist's enrollment on a credit-hour basis, VA will measure the enrollment on a clock-hour basis as described in paragraph (c) of this section.
(Authority: 10 U.S.C. 16136(b); 38 U.S.C. 3688(b))
(b)
Credit-hour measurement—standard method.
(1) When all the conditions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section are met, the Department of Veterans Affairs will—
(i) Measure the reservist's enrollment in the same manner as collegiate undergraduate courses are measured in § 21.7670 (a), (b), and (c).
(ii) Apply the provisions of § 21.4272(g) if one or more of the reservist's courses are offered during a nonstandard term.
(Authority: 10 U.S.C. 16136(b); 38 U.S.C. 3688)
(2) For new enrollments beginning on or after July 1, 1993, when a course is offered by an institution of higher learning in residence on a standard quarter- or semester-hour basis, VA will measure a reservist's enrollment in a course not leading to a standard college degree on the same credit-hour basis as courses leading to a standard undergraduate degree, as provided in § 21.7670.
