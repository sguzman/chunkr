A, a U.S. citizen, is a member of partnership ABC, which has not previously made an election under section 754 to adjust the basis of partnership property. The partnership and the partners use the calendar year as the taxable year. A sells his interest in the partnership to D on January 1, 1971. The partnership may elect under section 754 and this section to adjust the basis of partnership property under sections 734(b) and 743(b). Unless an extension of time to make the election is obtained under the provisions of § 1.9100-1, the election must be made in a written statement filed with the partnership return for 1971 and must contain the information specified in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph. Such return must be filed by April 17, 1972 (unless an extension of time for filing the return is obtained). The election will apply to all distributions of property to a partner and transfers of an interest in the partnership occurring in 1971 and subsequent years, unless revoked pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section.
(c)
Revocation of election
—(1)
In general.
A partnership having an election in effect under this section may revoke such election with the approval of the district director for the internal revenue district in which the partnership return is required to be filed. A partnership which wishes to revoke such an election shall file with the district director for the internal revenue district in which the partnership return is required to be filed an application setting forth the grounds on which the revocation is desired. The application shall be filed not later than 30 days after the close of the partnership taxable year with respect to which revocation is intended to take effect and shall be signed by any one of the partners. Examples of situations which may be considered sufficient reason for approving an application for revocation include a change in the nature of the partnership business, a substantial increase in the assets of the partnership, a change in the character of partnership assets, or an increased frequency of retirements or shifts of partnership
interests, so that an increased administrative burden would result to the partnership from the election. However, no application for revocation of an election shall be approved when the purpose of the revocation is primarily to avoid stepping down the basis of partnership assets upon a transfer or distribution.
(2)
Revocations effective on December 15, 1999.
Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1) of this section, any partnership having an election in effect under this section for its taxable year that includes December 15, 1999, may revoke such election effective for transfers or distributions occurring on or after December 15, 1999, by attaching a statement to the partnership's return for such year. For the revocation to be valid, the statement must be filed not later than the time prescribed by § 1.6031(a)-1(e) (including extensions thereof) for filing the return for such taxable year, and must set forth the name and address of the partnership revoking the election, be signed by any one of the partners who is authorized to sign the partnership's federal income tax return, and contain a declaration that the partnership revokes its election under section 754 to apply the provisions of section 734(b) and 743(b). In addition, the following statement must be prominently displayed in capital letters on the first page of the partnership's return for such year: “RETURN FILED PURSUANT TO § 1.754-1(c)(2).”
(d)
Applicability date.
The fourth sentence of paragraph (b)(1) of this section applies to taxable years ending on or after August 5, 2022. Taxpayers may, however, apply the fourth sentence of paragraph (b)(1) of this section to taxable years ending before August 5, 2022.

§ 1.755-1
Rules for allocation of basis.
(a)
In general
—(1)
Scope.
This section provides rules for allocating basis adjustments under sections 743(b) and 734(b) among partnership property. If there is a basis adjustment to which this section applies, the basis adjustment is allocated among the partnership's assets as follows. First, the partnership must determine the value of each of its assets under paragraphs (a)(2) through (5) of this section. Second, the basis adjustment is allocated between the two classes of property described in section 755(b). These classes of property consist of capital assets and section 1231(b) property (capital gain property), and any other property of the partnership (ordinary income property). For purposes of this section, properties and potential gain treated as unrealized receivables under section 751(c) and the regulations thereunder shall be treated as separate assets that are ordinary income property. Third, the portion of the basis adjustment allocated to each class is allocated among the items within the class. Basis adjustments under section 743(b) are allocated among partnership assets under paragraph (b) of this section. Basis adjustments under section 734(b) are allocated among partnership assets under paragraph (c) of this section.
(2)
Coordination of sections 755 and 1060.
If there is a basis adjustment to which this section applies, and the assets of the partnership constitute a trade or business (as described in § 1.1060-1(b)(2)), then the partnership is required to use the residual method to assign values to the partnership's section 197 intangibles. To do so, the partnership must, first, determine the value of partnership assets other than section 197 intangibles under paragraph (a)(3) of this section. The partnership then must determine partnership gross value under paragraph (a)(4) of this section. Last, the partnership must assign values to the partnership's section 197 intangibles under paragraph (a)(5) of this section. For purposes of this section, the term
section 197 intangibles
includes all section 197 intangibles (as defined in section 197), as well as any goodwill or going concern value that would not qualify as a section 197 intangible under section 197.
(3)
Values of properties other than section 197 intangibles.
For purposes of this section, the fair market value of each item of partnership property other than section 197 intangibles shall be determined on the basis of all the facts
and circumstances, taking into account section 7701(g).
(4)
Partnership gross value
—(i)
Basis adjustments under section 743(b)
—(A)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section, in the case of a basis adjustment under section 743(b), partnership gross value generally is equal to the amount that, if assigned to all partnership property, would result in a liquidating distribution to the partner equal to the transferee's basis in the transferred partnership interest immediately following the relevant transfer (reduced by the amount, if any, of such basis that is attributable to partnership liabilities).
(B)
Special situations.
In certain circumstances, such as where income or loss with respect to particular section 197 intangibles are allocated differently among partners, partnership gross value may vary depending on the values of particular section 197 intangibles held by the partnership. In these special situations, the partnership must assign value, first, among section 197 intangibles (other than goodwill and going concern value) in a reasonable manner that is consistent with the ordering rule in paragraph (a)(5) of this section and would cause the appropriate liquidating distribution under paragraph (a)(4)(i)(A) of this section. If the actual fair market values, determined on the basis of all the facts and circumstances, of all section 197 intangibles (other than goodwill and going concern value) is not sufficient to cause the appropriate liquidating distribution, then the fair market value of goodwill and going concern value shall be presumed to equal an amount that if assigned to goodwill and going concern value would cause the appropriate liquidating distribution.
(C)
Income in respect of a decedent.
Solely for the purpose of determining partnership gross value under this paragraph (a)(4)(i), where a partnership interest is transferred as a result of the death of a partner, the transferee's basis in its partnership interest is determined without regard to section 1014(c) or section 1022(f), and is deemed to be adjusted for that portion of the interest, if any, that is attributable to items representing income in respect of a decedent under section 691.
(ii)
Basis adjustments under section 743(b) resulting from substituted basis transactions.
This paragraph (a)(4)(ii) applies to basis adjustments under section 743(b) that result from exchanges in which the transferee's basis in the partnership interest is determined in whole or in part by reference to the transferor's basis in the interest or to the basis of other property held at any time by the transferee (substituted basis transactions). In the case of a substituted basis transaction, partnership gross value equals the value of the entire partnership as a going concern, increased by the amount of partnership liabilities at the time of the exchange giving rise to the basis adjustment.
(iii)
Basis adjustments under section 734(b).
In the case of a basis adjustment under section 734(b), partnership gross value equals the value of the entire partnership as a going concern immediately following the distribution causing the adjustment, increased by the amount of partnership liabilities immediately following the distribution.
(5)
Determining the values of section 197 intangibles
—(i)
Two classes.
If the aggregate value of partnership property other than section 197 intangibles (as determined in paragraph (a)(3) of this section) is equal to or greater than partnership gross value (as determined in paragraph (a)(4) of this section), then all section 197 intangibles are deemed to have a value of zero for purposes of this section. In all other cases, the aggregate value of the partnership's section 197 intangibles (the residual section 197 intangibles value) is deemed to equal the excess of partnership gross value over the aggregate value of partnership property other than section 197 intangibles. The residual section 197 intangibles value must be allocated between two asset classes in the following order—
(A) Among section 197 intangibles other than goodwill and going concern value; and
(B) To goodwill and going concern value.
(ii)
Values assigned to section 197 intangibles other than goodwill and going concern value.
The fair market value assigned to a section 197 intangible (other than goodwill and going concern value) shall not exceed the actual fair
market value (determined on the basis of all the facts and circumstances) of that asset on the date of the relevant transfer. If the residual section 197 intangibles value is less than the sum of the actual fair market values (determined on the basis of all the facts and circumstances) of all section 197 intangibles (other than goodwill and going concern value) held by the partnership, then the residual section 197 intangibles value must be allocated among the individual section 197 intangibles (other than goodwill and going concern value) as follows. The residual section 197 intangibles value is assigned first to any section 197 intangibles (other than goodwill and going concern value) having potential gain that would be treated as unrealized receivables under the flush language of section 751(c) (flush language receivables) to the extent of the basis of those section 197 intangibles and the amount of income arising from the flush language receivables that the partnership would recognize if the section 197 intangibles were sold for their actual fair market values (determined based on all the facts and circumstances) (collectively, the flush language receivables value). If the value assigned to section 197 intangibles (other than goodwill and going concern value) is less than the flush language receivables value, then the assigned value is allocated among the properties giving rise to the flush language receivables in proportion to the flush language receivables value in those properties. Any remaining residual section 197 intangibles value is allocated among the remaining portions of the section 197 intangibles (other than goodwill and going concern value) in proportion to the actual fair market values of such portions (determined based on all the facts and circumstances).
(iii)
Value assigned to goodwill and going concern value.
The fair market value of goodwill and going concern value is the amount, if any, by which the residual section 197 intangibles value exceeds the aggregate value of the partnership's section 197 intangibles (other than goodwill and going concern value).
(6)
Examples.
The provisions of paragraphs (a)(2) through (5) are illustrated by the following examples, which assume that the partnerships have an election in effect under section 754 at the time of the transfer and that the assets of each partnership constitute a trade or business (as described in § 1.1060-1(b)(2)). Except as provided, no partnership asset (other than inventory) is property described in section 751(a), and partnership liabilities are secured by all partnership assets. The examples are as follows:

# Example 1.
(i) A is the sole general partner in PRS, a limited partnership having three equal partners. PRS has goodwill and going concern value, two section 197 intangibles other than goodwill and going concern value (Intangible 1 and Intangible 2), and two other assets with fair market values (determined using all the facts and circumstances) as follows: inventory worth $1,000,000 and a building (a capital asset) worth $2,000,000. The fair market value of each of Intangible 1 and Intangible 2 is $50,000. PRS has one liability of $1,000,000, for which A bears the entire risk of loss under section 752 and the regulations thereunder. D purchases A's partnership interest for $650,000, resulting in a basis adjustment under section 743(b). After the purchase, D bears the entire risk of loss for PRS's liability under section 752 and the regulations thereunder. Therefore, D's basis in its interest in PRS is $1,650,000.
(ii) D's basis in the transferred partnership interest (reduced by the amount of such basis that is attributable to partnership liabilities) is $650,000 ($1,650,000—$1,000,000). Under paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section, partnership gross value is $2,950,000 (the amount that, if assigned to all partnership property, would result in a liquidating distribution to D equal to $650,000).
(iii) Under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the inventory has a fair market value of $1,000,000, and the building has a fair market value of $2,000,000. Thus, the aggregate value of partnership property other than section 197 intangibles, $3,000,000, is equal to or greater than partnership gross value, $2,950,000. Accordingly, under paragraphs (a)(3) and (5) of this section, the value assigned to each of the partnership's assets is as follows: inventory, $1,000,000; building, $2,000,000; Intangibles 1 and 2, $0; and goodwill and going concern value, $0. D's section 743(b) adjustment must be allocated under paragraph (b) of this section using these assigned fair market values.

# Example 2.
(i) Assume the same facts as in
Example 1,
except that the fair market values of Intangible 1 and Intangible 2 are each $300,000, and that D purchases A's interest in PRS for $1,000,000. After the purchase, D's basis in its interest in PRS is $2,000,000.
(ii) D's basis in the transferred partnership interest (reduced by the amount of such basis that is attributable to partnership liabilities) is $1,000,000 ($2,000,000—$1,000,000). Under paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section, partnership gross value is $4,000,000 (the amount that, if assigned to all partnership property, would result in a liquidating distribution to D equal to $1,000,000).
(iii) Under paragraph (a)(5) of this section, the residual section 197 intangibles value is $1,000,000 (the excess of partnership gross value, $4,000,000, over the aggregate value of assets other than section 197 intangibles, $3,000,000 (the sum of the value of the inventory, $1,000,000, and the value of the building, $2,000,000)). The partnership must determine the values of section 197 assets by allocating the residual section 197 intangibles value among the partnership's assets. The residual section 197 intangibles value is assigned first to section 197 intangibles other than goodwill and going concern value, and then to goodwill and going concern value. Thus, $300,000 is assigned to each of Intangible 1 and Intangible 2, and $400,000 is assigned to goodwill and going concern value (the amount by which the residual section 197 intangibles value, $1,000,000, exceeds the fair market value of section 197 intangibles other than goodwill and going concern value, $600,000). D's section 743(b) adjustment must be allocated under paragraph (b) of this section using these assigned fair market values.

# Example 3.
(i) Assume the same facts as in
Example 1,
except that the fair market values of Intangible 1 and Intangible 2 are each $300,000, and that D purchases A's interest in PRS for $750,000. After the purchase, D's basis in its interest in PRS is $1,750,000. Also assume that Intangible 1 was originally purchased for $300,000, and that its adjusted basis has been decreased to $50,000 as a result of amortization. Assume that, if PRS were to sell Intangible 1 for $300,000, it would recognize $250,000 of gain that would be treated as an unrealized receivable under the flush language in section 751(c).
(ii) D's basis in the transferred partnership interest (reduced by the amount of such basis that is attributable to partnership liabilities) is $750,000 ($1,750,000—$1,000,000). Under paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section, partnership gross value is $3,250,000 (the amount that, if assigned to all partnership property, would result in a liquidating distribution to D equal to $750,000).
(iii) Under paragraph (a)(5) of this section, the residual section 197 intangibles value is $250,000 (the amount by which partnership gross value, $3,250,000, exceeds the aggregate value of partnership property other than section 197 intangibles, $3,000,000). Intangible 1 has potential gain that would be treated as unrealized receivables under the flush language of section 751(c). The flush language receivables value in Intangible 1 is $300,000 (the sum of PRS's basis in Intangible 1, $50,000, and the amount of ordinary income, $250,000, that the partnership would recognize if Intangible 1 were sold for its actual fair market value). Because the residual section 197 intangibles value, $250,000, is less than the flush language receivables value of Intangible 1, Intangible 1 is assigned a value of $250,000, and Intangible 2 and goodwill and going concern value are assigned a value of zero. D's section 743(b) adjustment must be allocated under paragraph (b) of this section using these assigned fair market values.

# Example 4.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1,
except that the fair market values of Intangible 1 and Intangible 2 are each $300,000, and that A does not sell its interest in PRS. Instead, A contributes its interest in PRS to E, a newly formed corporation wholly-owned by A, in a transaction described in section 351. Assume that the contribution results in a basis adjustment under section 743(b) (other than zero). PRS determines that its value as a going concern immediately following the contribution is $3,000,000. Under paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section, partnership gross value is $4,000,000 (the value of PRS as a going concern, $3,000,000, increased by the partnership's liability, $1,000,000, immediately after the contribution). Under paragraph (a)(5) of this section, the residual section 197 intangibles value is $1,000,000 (the amount by which partnership gross value, $4,000,000, exceeds the aggregate value of partnership property other than section 197 intangibles, $3,000,000). Of the residual section 197 intangibles value, $300,000 is assigned to each of Intangible 1 and Intangible 2, and $400,000 is assigned to goodwill and going concern value (the amount by which the residual section 197 intangibles value, $1,000,000, exceeds the fair market value of section 197 intangibles other than goodwill and going concern value, $600,000). E's section 743(b) adjustment must be allocated under paragraph (b)(5) of this section using these assigned fair market values.

# Example 5.
G is the sole general partner in PRS, a limited partnership having three equal partners (G, H, and I). PRS has goodwill and going concern value, two section 197 intangibles other than goodwill and going concern value (Intangible 1 and Intangible 2), and two capital assets with fair market values (determined using all the facts and circumstances) as follows: Vacant land worth $1,000,000, and a building worth $2,000,000. The fair market value of each of Intangible 1 and Intangible 2 is $300,000. PRS has one liability of $1,000,000, for which G bears the entire risk of loss under section 752 and the regulations thereunder. PRS distributes the land to H in liquidation of H's interest in PRS. Immediately prior to the distribution, PRS's basis in the land is $800,000, and H's basis in its interest in PRS is $750,000. The distribution causes the partnership to increase the basis
of its remaining property by $50,000 under section 734(b)(1)(B). PRS determines that its value as a going concern immediately following the distribution is $2,000,000. Under paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section, partnership gross value is $3,000,000 (the value of PRS as a going concern, $2,000,000, increased by the partnership's liability, $1,000,000, immediately after the distribution). Under paragraph (a)(5) of this section, the residual section 197 intangibles value of PRS's section 197 intangibles is $1,000,000 (the amount by which partnership gross value, $3,000,000, exceeds the aggregate value of partnership property other than section 197 intangibles, $2,000,000). Of the residual section 197 intangibles value, $300,000 is assigned to each of Intangible 1 and Intangible 2, and $400,000 is assigned to goodwill and going concern value (the amount by which the residual section 197 intangibles value, $1,000,000, exceeds the fair market value of section 197 intangibles other than goodwill and going concern value, $600,000). PRS's section 734(b) adjustment must be allocated under paragraph (c) of this section using these assigned fair market values.
(b)
Adjustments under section 743(b)
—(1)
Generally.
(i)
Application.
For basis adjustments under section 743(b) resulting from substituted basis transactions, paragraph (b)(5) of this section shall apply. For basis adjustments under section 743(b) resulting from all other transfers, paragraphs (b)(2) through (4) of this section shall apply. For transfers subject to section 334(b)(1)(B), see § 1.334-1(b)(3)(iii)(C)(
1
) (treating a determination of basis under § 1.334-1(b)(3) as a determination not by reference to the transferor's basis solely for purposes of applying section 755); for transfers subject to section 362(e)(1), see § 1.362-3(b)(4)(i) (treating a determination of basis under § 1.362-3 as a determination not by reference to the transferor's basis solely for purposes of applying section 755); for transfers subject to section 362(e)(2), see § 1.362-4(c)(3)(i) (treating a determination of basis under § 1.362-4 as a determination by reference to the transferor's basis for all purposes). Except as provided in paragraph (b)(5) of this section, the portion of the basis adjustment allocated to one class of property may be an increase while the portion allocated to the other class is a decrease. This would be the case even though the total amount of the basis adjustment is zero. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(5) of this section, the portion of the basis adjustment allocated to one item of property within a class may be an increase while the portion allocated to another is a decrease. This would be the case even though the basis adjustment allocated to the class is zero.
(ii)
Hypothetical transaction.
For purposes of paragraphs (b)(2) through (b)(4) of this section, the allocation of the basis adjustment under section 743(b) between the classes of property and among the items of property within each class are made based on the allocations of income, gain, or loss (including remedial allocations under § 1.704-3(d)) that the transferee partner would receive (to the extent attributable to the acquired partnership interest) if, immediately after the transfer of the partnership interest, all of the partnership's property were disposed of in a fully taxable transaction for cash in an amount equal to the fair market value of such property (the hypothetical transaction). See § 1.460-4(k)(3)(v)(B) for a rule relating to the computation of income or loss that would be allocated to the transferee from a contract accounted for under a long-term contract method of accounting as a result of the hypothetical transaction.
(2)
Allocations between classes of property
—(i)
In general.
The amount of the basis adjustment allocated to the class of ordinary income property is equal to the total amount of income, gain, or loss (including any remedial allocations under § 1.704-3(d)) that would be allocated to the transferee (to the extent attributable to the acquired partnership interest) from the sale of all ordinary income property in the hypothetical transaction. The amount of the basis adjustment to capital gain property is equal to—
(A) The total amount of the basis adjustment under section 743(b); less
(B) The amount of the basis adjustment allocated to ordinary income property under the preceding sentence; provided, however, that in no event may the amount of any decrease in basis allocated to capital gain property exceed the partnership's basis (or in the case of property subject to the remedial allocation method, the transferee's share of any remedial loss under
§ 1.704-3(d) from the hypothetical transaction) in capital gain property. In the event that a decrease in basis allocated to capital gain property would otherwise exceed the partnership's basis in capital gain property, the excess must be applied to reduce the basis of ordinary income property.
(ii)
Examples.
The provisions of this paragraph (b)(2) are illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
(i) A and B form equal partnership PRS. A contributes $50,000 and Asset 1, a nondepreciable capital asset with a fair market value of $50,000 and an adjusted tax basis of $25,000. B contributes $100,000. PRS uses the cash to purchase Assets 2, 3, and 4. After a year, A sells its interest in PRS to T for $120,000. At the time of the transfer, A's share of the partnership's basis in partnership assets is $75,000. Therefore, T receives a $45,000 basis adjustment.
(ii) Immediately after the transfer of the partnership interest to T, the adjusted basis and fair market value of PRS's assets are as follows:
Assets
Adjusted basis
Fair market value
Capital Gain Property:
Asset 1
$25,000
$75,000
Asset 2
100,000
117,500
Ordinary Income Property:
Asset 3
40,000
45,000
Asset 4
10,000
2,500
Total
175,000
240,000
(iii) If PRS sold all of its assets in a fully taxable transaction at fair market value immediately after the transfer of the partnership interest to T, the total amount of capital gain that would be allocated to T is equal to $46,250 ($25,000 section 704(c) built-in gain from Asset 1, plus fifty percent of the $42,500 appreciation in capital gain property). T would also be allocated a $1,250 ordinary loss from the sale of the ordinary income property.
(iv) The amount of the basis adjustment that is allocated to ordinary income property is equal to ($1,250) (the amount of the loss allocated to T from the hypothetical sale of the ordinary income property).
(v) The amount of the basis adjustment that is allocated to capital gain property is equal to $46,250 (the amount of the basis adjustment, $45,000, less ($1,250), the amount of loss allocated to T from the hypothetical sale of the ordinary income property).

# Example 2.
(i) A and B form equal partnership PRS. A and B each contribute $1,000 cash which the partnership uses to purchase Assets 1, 2, 3, and 4. After a year, A sells its partnership interest to T for $1,000. T's basis adjustment under section 743(b) is zero.
(ii) Immediately after the transfer of the partnership interest to T, the adjusted basis and fair market value of PRS's assets are as follows:
Assets
Adjusted basis
Fair market value
Capital Gain Property:
Asset 1
$500
$750
Asset 2
500
500
Ordinary Income Property:
Asset 3
500
250
Asset 4
500
500
Total
2,000
2,000
(iii) If, immediately after the transfer of the partnership interest to T, PRS sold all of its assets in a fully taxable transaction at fair market value, T would be allocated a loss of $125 from the sale of the ordinary income property. Thus, the amount of the basis adjustment to ordinary income property is ($125). The amount of the basis adjustment to capital gain property is $125 (zero, the amount of the basis adjustment under section 743(b), less ($125), the amount of the basis adjustment allocated to ordinary income property).
(3)
Allocation within the class
—(i)
Ordinary income property.
The amount of the basis adjustment to each item of property within the class of ordinary income property is equal to—
(A) The amount of income, gain, or loss (including any remedial allocations under § 1.704-3(d)) that would be allocated to the transferee (to the extent attributable to the acquired partnership interest) from the hypothetical sale of the item; reduced by
(B) The product of—
(
1
) Any decrease to the amount of the basis adjustment to ordinary income property required pursuant to the last sentence of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section; multiplied by
(

) A fraction, the numerator of which is the fair market value of the item of property to the partnership and the denominator of which is the total fair market value of all of the partnership's items of ordinary income property.
(ii)
Capital gain property.
The amount of the basis adjustment to each item of property within the class of capital gain property is equal to—
(A) The amount of income, gain, or loss (including any remedial allocations under § 1.704-3(d)) that would be allocated to the transferee (to the extent attributable to the acquired partnership interest) from the hypothetical sale of the item; minus
(B) The product of—
(

) The total amount of gain or loss (including any remedial allocations under § 1.704-3(d)) that would be allocated to the transferee (to the extent attributable to the acquired partnership interest) from the hypothetical sale of all items of capital gain property, minus the amount of the positive basis adjustment to all items of capital gain property or plus the amount of the negative basis adjustment to capital gain property; multiplied by
(
2
) A fraction, the numerator of which is the fair market value of the item of property to the partnership, and the denominator of which is the fair market value of all of the partnership's items of capital gain property.
(iii)
Special rules
—(A)
Assets in which partner has no interest.
An asset with respect to which the transferee partner has no interest in income, gain, losses, or deductions shall not be taken into account in applying paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(B) of this section.
(B)
Limitation in decrease of basis.
In no event may the amount of any decrease in basis allocated to an item of capital gain property under paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(B) of this section exceed the partnership's adjusted basis in that item (or in the case of property subject to the remedial allocation method, the transferee's share of any remedial loss under § 1.704-3(d) from the hypothetical transaction). In the event that a decrease in basis allocated under paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(B) of this section to an item of capital gain property would otherwise exceed the partnership's adjusted basis in that item, the excess must be applied to reduce the remaining basis, if any, of other capital gain assets pro rata in proportion to the bases of such assets (as adjusted under this paragraph (b)(3)).
(iv)
Examples.
The provisions of this paragraph (b)(3) are illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
(i) Assume the same facts as Example 1 in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section. Of the $45,000 basis adjustment, $46,250 was allocated to capital gain property. The amount allocated to ordinary income property was ($1,250).
(ii) Asset 1 is a capital gain asset, and T would be allocated $37,500 from the sale of Asset 1 in the hypothetical transaction. Therefore, the amount of the adjustment to Asset 1 is $37,500.
(iii) Asset 2 is a capital gain asset, and T would be allocated $8,750 from the sale of Asset 2 in the hypothetical transaction. Therefore, the amount of the adjustment to Asset 2 is $8,750.
(iv) Asset 3 is ordinary income property, and T would be allocated $2,500 from the sale of Asset 3 in the hypothetical transaction. Therefore, the amount of the adjustment to Asset 3 is $2,500.
(v) Asset 4 is ordinary income property, and T would be allocated ($3,750) from the sale of Asset 4 in the hypothetical transaction. Therefore, the amount of the adjustment to Asset 4 is ($3,750).

# Example 2.
(i) Assume the same facts as Example 1 in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, except that A sold its interest in PRS to T for $110,000 rather than $120,000. T, therefore, receives a basis adjustment under section 743(b) of $35,000. Of the $35,000 basis adjustment, ($1,250) is allocated to ordinary income property, and $36,250 is allocated to capital gain property.
(ii) Asset 3 is ordinary income property, and T would be allocated $2,500 from the sale of Asset 3 in the hypothetical transaction. Therefore, the amount of the adjustment to Asset 3 is $2,500.
(iii) Asset 4 is ordinary income property, and T would be allocated ($3,750) from the sale of Asset 4 in the hypothetical transaction. Therefore, the amount of the adjustment to Asset 4 is ($3,750).
(iv) Asset 1 is a capital gain asset, and T would be allocated $37,500 from the sale of Asset 1 in the hypothetical transaction. Asset 2 is a capital gain asset, and T would be allocated $8,750 from the sale of Asset 2 in the hypothetical transaction. The total amount of gain that would be allocated to T from the sale of the capital gain assets in the hypothetical transaction is $46,250, which exceeds the amount of the basis adjustment allocated to capital gain property by $10,000. The amount of the adjustment to Asset 1 is $33,604 ($37,500 minus $3,896 ($10,000 × $75,000/$192,500)). The amount of the basis adjustment to Asset 2 is $2,646 ($8,750 minus $6,104 ($10,000 × $117,500/$192,500)).
(4)
Income in respect of a decedent
—(i)
In general.
Where a partnership interest is transferred as a result of the death of a partner, under section 1014(c) or section 1022(f), the transferee's basis in its partnership interest is not adjusted
for that portion of the interest, if any, that is attributable to items representing income in respect of a decedent under section 691. See § 1.742-1. Accordingly, if a partnership interest is transferred as a result of the death of a partner, and the partnership holds assets representing income in respect of a decedent, no part of the basis adjustment under section 743(b) is allocated to these assets. See § 1.743-1(b).
(ii) The provisions of this paragraph (b)(4) are illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
(i) A and B are equal partners in personal service partnership PRS. In 2004, as a result of B's death, B's partnership interest is transferred to T when PRS's balance sheet (reflecting a cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting) is as follows (based on all the facts and circumstances):
Assets
Adjusted basis
Fair
market

Section 197 Intangible
$2,000
$5,000
Unrealized Receivables

Total

$20,000
Liabilities and Capital

Capital:
A
1,000
10,000
B
1,000
10,000
Total
$2,000
$20,000
(ii) None of the assets owned by PRS is section 704(c) property, and the section 197 intangible is not amortizable. The fair market value of T's partnership interest on the applicable date of valuation set forth in section 1014 is $10,000. Of this amount, $2,500 is attributable to T's 50% share of the partnership's section 197 intangible, and $7,500 is attributable to T's 50% share of the partnership's unrealized receivables. The partnership's unrealized receivables represent income in respect of a decedent. Accordingly, under section 1014(c), T's basis in its partnership interest is not adjusted for that portion of the interest which is attributable to the unrealized receivables. Therefore, T's basis in its partnership interest is $2,500.
(iii) Under paragraph (a)(4)(i)(C) of this section, solely for purposes of determining partnership gross value, T's basis in its partnership interest is deemed to be $10,000. Under paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section, partnership gross value is $20,000 (the amount that, if assigned to all partnership property, would result in a liquidating distribution to T equal to $10,000).
(iv) Under paragraph (a)(5) of this section, the residual section 197 intangibles value is $5,000 (the excess of partnership gross value, $20,000, over the aggregate value of assets other than section 197 intangibles, $15,000). The residual section 197 intangibles value is assigned first to section 197 intangibles other than goodwill and going concern value, and then to goodwill and going concern value. Thus, $5,000 is assigned to the section 197 intangible, and $0 is assigned to goodwill and going concern value. T's section 743(b) adjustment must be allocated using these assigned fair market values.
(v) At the time of the transfer, B's share of the partnership's basis in partnership assets is $1,000. Accordingly, T receives a $1,500 basis adjustment under section 743(b). Under this paragraph (b)(4), the entire basis adjustment is allocated to the partnership's section 197 intangible.
(5)
Substituted basis transactions
—(i)
In general.
This paragraph (b)(5) applies to basis adjustments under section 743(b) that result from exchanges in which the transferee's basis in the partnership interest is determined in whole or in part by reference to the transferor's basis in that interest. For exchanges on or after June 9, 2003, this paragraph (b)(5) also applies to basis adjustments under section 743(b) that result from exchanges in which the transferee's basis in the partnership interest is determined by reference to other property held at any time by the transferee. For example, this paragraph (b)(5) applies if a partnership interest is contributed to a corporation in a transaction to which section 351 applies, if a partnership interest is contributed to a partnership in a transaction to which section 721(a) applies, or if a partnership interest is distributed by a partnership in a transaction to which section 731(a) applies.
(ii)
Allocations between classes of property.
If the total amount of the basis adjustment under section 743(b) is zero, then no adjustment to the basis of partnership property will be made under this paragraph (b)(5). If there is an increase in basis to be allocated to partnership assets, such increase must be allocated to capital gain property or ordinary income property, respectively, only if the total amount of gain
or loss (including any remedial allocations under § 1.704-3(d)) that would be allocated to the transferee (to the extent attributable to the acquired partnership interest) from the hypothetical sale of all such property would result in a net gain or net income, as the case may be, to the transferee. Where, under the preceding sentence, an increase in basis may be allocated to both capital gain assets and ordinary income assets, the increase shall be allocated to each class in proportion to the net gain or net income, respectively, which would be allocated to the transferee from the sale of all assets in each class. If there is a decrease in basis to be allocated to partnership assets, such decrease must be allocated to capital gain property or ordinary income property, respectively, only if the total amount of gain or loss (including any remedial allocations under § 1.704-3(d)) that would be allocated to the transferee (to the extent attributable to the acquired partnership interest) from the hypothetical sale of all such property would result in a net loss to the transferee. Where, under the preceding sentence, a decrease in basis may be allocated to both capital gain assets and ordinary income assets, the decrease shall be allocated to each class in proportion to the net loss which would be allocated to the transferee from the sale of all assets in each class.
(iii)
Allocations within the classes
—(A)
Increases.
If there is an increase in basis to be allocated within a class, the increase must be allocated first to properties with unrealized appreciation in proportion to the transferee's share of the respective amounts of unrealized appreciation before such increase (but only to the extent of the transferee's share of each property's unrealized appreciation). Any remaining increase must be allocated among the properties within the class in proportion to the transferee's share of the amount that would be realized by the partnership upon the hypothetical sale of each asset in the class.
(B)
Decreases.
If there is a decrease in basis to be allocated within a class, the decrease must be allocated first to properties with unrealized depreciation in proportion to the transferee's shares of the respective amounts of unrealized depreciation before such decrease (but only to the extent of the transferee's share of each property's unrealized depreciation). Any remaining decrease must be allocated among the properties within the class in proportion to the transferee's shares of their adjusted bases (as adjusted under the preceding sentence).
(C)
Limitation in decrease of basis.
Where, as the result of a transaction to which this paragraph (b)(5) applies, a decrease in basis must be allocated to capital gain assets, ordinary income assets, or both, and the amount of the decrease otherwise allocable to a particular class exceeds the transferee's share of the adjusted basis to the partnership of all depreciated assets in that class, the transferee's negative basis adjustment is limited to the transferee's share of the partnership's adjusted basis in all depreciated assets in that class.
(D)
Carryover adjustment.
Where a transferee's negative basis adjustment under section 743(b) cannot be allocated to any asset, because the adjustment exceeds the transferee's share of the adjusted basis to the partnership of all depreciated assets in a particular class, the adjustment is made when the partnership subsequently acquires property of a like character to which an adjustment can be made.
(iv)
Examples.
The provisions of this paragraph (b)(5) are illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
A is a member of partnership LTP, which has made an election under section 754. The three partners in LTP have equal interests in capital and profits. Solely in exchange for a partnership interest in UTP, A contributes its interest in LTP to UTP in a transaction described in section 721. At the time of the transfer, A's basis in its partnership interest ($5,000) equals its share of inside basis (also $5,000). Under section 723, UTP's basis in its interest in LTP is $5,000. LTP's only two assets on the date of contribution are inventory with a basis of $5,000 and a fair market value of $7,500, and a nondepreciable capital asset with a basis of $10,000 and a fair market value of $7,500. The amount of the basis adjustment under section 743(b) to partnership property is $0 ($5,000, UTP's basis in its interest in LTP, minus $5,000, UTP's share of LTP's basis in partnership assets). Because UTP acquired its interest in LTP in a substituted basis transaction, and the total amount of the
basis adjustment under section 743(b) is zero, UTP receives no special basis adjustments under section 743(b) with respect to the partnership property of LTP.

# Example 2.
(i) A purchases a partnership interest in LTP at a time when an election under section 754 is not in effect. The three partners in LTP have equal interests in capital and profits. During a later year for which LTP has an election under section 754 in effect, and in a transaction that is unrelated to A's purchase of the LTP interest, A contributes its interest in LTP to UTP in a transaction described in section 721 (solely in exchange for a partnership interest in UTP). At the time of the transfer, A's adjusted basis in its interest in LTP is $20,433. Under section 721, A recognizes no gain or loss as a result of the contribution of its partnership interest to UTP. Under section 723, UTP's basis in its partnership interest in LTP is $20,433. The balance sheet of LTP on the date of the contribution shows the following:
Assets

C

22,000
Total
55,000
76,000
(ii) The amount of the basis adjustment under section 743(b) is the difference between the basis of UTP's interest in LTP and UTP's share of the adjusted basis to LTP of partnership property. UTP's interest in the previously taxed capital of LTP is $15,000 ($22,000, the amount of cash UTP would receive if LTP liquidated immediately after the hypothetical transaction, decreased by $7,000, the amount of tax gain allocated to UTP from the hypothetical transaction). UTP's share of the adjusted basis to LTP of partnership property is $18,333 ($15,000 share of previously taxed capital, plus $3,333 share of LTP's liabilities). The amount of the basis adjustment under section 743(b) to partnership property therefore, is $2,100 ($20,433 minus $18,333).
(iii) The total amount of gain that would be allocated to UTP from the hypothetical sale of capital gain property is $6,666.67 (one-third of the excess of the fair market value of LTP's nondepreciable capital asset, $40,000, over its basis, $20,000). The total amount of gain that would be allocated to UTP from the hypothetical sale of ordinary income property is $333.33 (one-third of the excess of the fair market value of LTP's inventory, $21,000, over its basis, $20,000). Under this paragraph (b)(5), LTP must allocate $2,000 ($6,666.67 divided by $7,000 times $2,100) of UTP's basis adjustment to the nondepreciable capital asset. LTP must allocate $100 ($333.33 divided by $7,000 times $2,100) of UTP's basis adjustment to the inventory.
(c)
Adjustments under section 734(b)
—(1)
Allocations between classes of property
—(i)
General rule.
Where there is a distribution of partnership property resulting in an adjustment to the basis of undistributed partnership property under section 734(b)(1)(B) or (b)(2)(B), the adjustment must be allocated to remaining partnership property of a character similar to that of the distributed property with respect to which the adjustment arose. Thus, when the partnership's adjusted basis of distributed capital gain property immediately prior to distribution exceeds the basis of the property to the distributee partner (as determined under section 732), the basis of the undistributed capital gain property remaining in the partnership is increased by an amount equal to the excess. Conversely, when the basis to the distributee partner (as determined under section 732) of distributed capital gain property exceeds the partnership's adjusted basis of such property immediately prior to the distribution, the basis of the undistributed capital gain property remaining in the partnership is decreased by an amount equal to such excess. Similarly, where there is a distribution of ordinary income property, and the basis of the property to the distributee partner (as determined under section 732) is not the same as the partnership's adjusted basis of the property immediately prior to distribution, the adjustment is made only to undistributed property of the same class remaining in the partnership.
(ii)
Special rule.
Where there is a distribution resulting in an adjustment under section 734(b)(1)(A) or (b)(2)(A) to the basis of undistributed partnership property, the adjustment is allocated only to capital gain property.
(2)
Allocations within the classes
—(i)
Increases.
If there is an increase in basis to be allocated within a class, the increase must be allocated first to properties with unrealized appreciation in proportion to their respective amounts of unrealized appreciation before such increase (but only to the extent of each property's unrealized appreciation). Any remaining increase must be allocated among the properties within the class in proportion to their fair market values.
(ii)
Decreases.
If there is a decrease in basis to be allocated within a class, the decrease must be allocated first to properties with unrealized depreciation in proportion to their respective amounts of unrealized depreciation before such decrease (but only to the extent of each property's unrealized depreciation). Any remaining decrease must be allocated among the properties within the class in proportion to their adjusted bases (as adjusted under the preceding sentence).
(3)
Limitation in decrease of basis.
Where a decrease in the basis of partnership assets is required under section 734(b)(2) and the amount of the decrease exceeds the adjusted basis to the partnership of property of the required character, the basis of such property is reduced to zero (but not below zero).
(4)
Carryover adjustment.
Where, in the case of a distribution, an increase or a decrease in the basis of undistributed property cannot be made because the partnership owns no property of the character required to be adjusted, or because the basis of all the property of a like character has been reduced to zero, the adjustment is made when the partnership subsequently acquires property of a like character to which an adjustment can be made.
(5)
Cross reference.
See § 1.460-4(k)(3)(v)(B) for a rule relating to the computation of unrealized appreciation or depreciation in a contract accounted for under a long-term contract method of accounting.
(6)
Example.
The following example illustrates this paragraph (c):

# Example.
(i) A, B, and C form equal partnership PRS. A contributes $50,000 and Asset 1, nondepreciable capital gain property with a fair market value of $50,000 and an adjusted tax basis of $25,000. B and C each contributes $100,000. PRS uses the cash to purchase Assets 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Assets 2 and 3 are nondepreciable capital assets, and Assets 4, 5, and 6 are inventory that has not appreciated substantially in value within the meaning of section 751(b)(3). Assets 4, 5, and 6 are the only assets held by the partnership that are subject to section 751. The partnership has an election in effect under section 754. After seven years, the adjusted basis and fair market value of PRS's assets are as follows:
Assets
Adjusted basis
Fair market value
Capital Gain Property:
Asset 1
$ 25,000
$ 75,000
Asset 2
100,000
117,500
Asset 3
50,000
60,000
Ordinary Income Property:
Asset 4
40,000
45,000
Asset 5
50,000
60,000
Asset 6
10,000
2,500
Total
275,000
360,000
(ii)
Allocation between classes.
Assume that PRS distributes Assets 3 and 5 to A in complete liquidation of A's interest in the partnership. A's basis in the partnership interest was $75,000. The partnership's basis in Assets 3 and 5 was $50,000 each. A's $75,000 basis in its partnership interest is allocated between Assets 3 and 5 under sections 732(b) and (c). A will, therefore, have a basis of $25,000 in Asset 3 (capital gain property), and a basis of $50,000 in Asset 5 (section 751 property). The distribution results in a $25,000 increase in the basis of capital gain property. There is no change in the basis of ordinary income property.
(iii)
Allocation within class.
The amount of the basis increase to capital gain property is $25,000 and must be allocated among the remaining capital gain assets in proportion to the difference between the fair market value and basis of each. The fair market value of Asset 1 exceeds its basis by $50,000. The fair market value of Asset 2 exceeds its basis by $17,500. Therefore, the basis of Asset 1 will be increased by $18,519 ($25,000, multiplied by $50,000, divided by $67,500), and the basis of Asset 2 will be increased by $6,481 ($25,000 multiplied by $17,500, divided by $67,500).

# definitions
§ 1.761-1
Terms defined.
(a)
Partnership.
The term
partnership
means a partnership as determined under §§ 301.7701-1, 301.7701-2, and 301.7701-3 of this chapter.
(b)
Partner.
The term
partner
means a member of a partnership.
(c)
Partnership agreement.
For the purposes of subchapter K, a partnership agreement includes the original agreement and any modifications thereof agreed to by all the partners or adopted in any other manner provided by the partnership agreement. Such agreement or modifications can be oral or written. A partnership agreement may be modified with respect to a particular taxable year subsequent to the close of such taxable year, but not later than the date (not including any extension of time) prescribed by law for the filing of the partnership return. As to any matter on which the partnership agreement, or any modification thereof, is silent, the provisions of local law shall be considered to constitute a part of the agreement.
(d)
Liquidation of partner's interest.
The term
liquidation of a partner's interest
means the termination of a partner's entire interest in a partnership by means of a distribution, or a series of distributions, to the partner by the partnership. A series of distributions will come within the meaning of this term whether they are made in one year or in more than one year. Where a partner's interest is to be liquidated by a series of distributions, the interest will not be considered as liquidated until the final distribution has been made. For the basis of property distributed in one liquidating distribution, or in a series of distributions in liquidation, see section 732(b). A distribution which is not in liquidation of a partner's entire interest, as defined in this paragraph, is a current distribution. Current distributions, therefore, include distributions in partial liquidation of a partner's interest, and distributions of the partner's distributive share. See paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of § 1.731-1.
(e)
Distribution of partnership interest.
For purposes of section 708(b)(1)(B) and § 1.708-1(b)(1)(iv), the deemed distribution of an interest in a new partnership by a partnership that terminates under section 708(b)(1)(B) is not a sale or exchange of an interest in the new partnership. However, the deemed distribution of an interest in a new partnership by a partnership that terminates under section 708(b)(1)(B) is treated as an exchange of the interest in the new partnership for purposes of section 743. This paragraph (e) applies to terminations of partnerships under section 708(b)(1)(B) occurring on or after May 9, 1997; however, this paragraph (e) may be applied to terminations occurring on or after May 9, 1996, provided that the partnership and its partners apply this paragraph (e) to the termination in a consistent manner.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11814, Nov. 26, 1960, as amended by T.D. 7208, 37 FR 20686, Oct. 3, 1972; T.D. 8697, 61 FR 66588, Dec. 18, 1996; T.D. 8717, 62 FR 25501, May 9, 1997]
§ 1.761-2
Exclusion of certain unincorporated organizations from the application of all or part of subchapter K of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code.
(a)
Exclusion of eligible unincorporated organizations
—(1)
In general.
Under the conditions set forth in this section, an unincorporated organization described in paragraph (a)(2) or (3) of this section (taking into account paragraph (a)(4) of this section, as applicable) may be excluded from the application of all or a part of the provisions of subchapter K of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code (subchapter K). Such organization must be availed of for investment purposes only and not for the active conduct of a business, or for the joint production, extraction, or use of property, but not for the purpose of selling services or property produced or extracted. The members of such organization must be able to compute their income without the necessity of computing partnership taxable income. Any syndicate, group, pool, or joint venture which is treated as a corporation for Federal tax purposes does not fall within the provisions in this paragraph (a)(1).
(2)
Investing partnership.
Where the participants in the joint purchase, retention, sale, or exchange of investment property:
(i) Own the property as co-owners;
(ii) Reserve the right separately to take or dispose of their shares of any property acquired or retained, and
(iii) Do not actively conduct business or irrevocably authorize some person or persons acting in a representative capacity to purchase, sell, or exchange such investment property, although each separate participant may delegate authority to purchase, sell, or exchange his share of any such investment property for the time being for his account, but not for a period of more than a year, then
such group may be excluded from the application of the provisions of subchapter K under the rules set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.
(3)
Operating agreements.
Where the participants in the joint production, extraction, or use of property:
(i) Own the property as co-owners, either in fee or under lease or other form of contract granting exclusive operating rights; and
(ii) Reserve the right separately to take in kind or dispose of their shares of any property produced, extracted, or used, and
(iii) Do not jointly sell services or the property produced or extracted, although each separate participant may delegate authority to sell his share of the property produced or extracted for the time being for his account, but not for a period of time in excess of the minimum needs of the industry, and in no event for more than 1 year, then
such group may be excluded from the application of the provisions of subchapter K under the rules set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. However, the preceding sentence does not apply to any unincorporated organization one of whose principal purposes is cycling, manufacturing, or processing for persons who are not members of the organization. In addition, except as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, this paragraph (a)(3) does not apply to any unincorporated organization that produces natural gas under a joint operating agreement, unless all members of the unincorporated organization comply with paragraph (d) of this section.
(4)
Modifications for certain joint ownership arrangements of applicable credit property
—(i)
Scope.
Paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section provides certain modifications to specified rules in paragraph (a)(3) of this section in the case of an applicable unincorporated organization meeting the requirements of paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section.
(ii)
Applicable unincorporated organization.
For purposes of this section, an
applicable unincorporated organization
is an unincorporated organization:
(A) That is owned, in whole or in part, by one or more applicable entities, as defined in section 6417(d)(1)(A) and § 1.6417-1(c);
(B) The members of which enter into a joint operating agreement in which the members reserve the right separately to take in kind or dispose of their pro rata shares of any property produced, extracted, or used, and any associated renewable energy credits or similar credits;
(C) That, pursuant to the joint operating agreement, is organized exclusively to own and operate applicable credit property (as defined in § 1.6417-1(e));
(D) For which one or more of the applicable entities will make an elective payment election under section 6417(a) for the applicable credits determined with respect to its share of the applicable credit property;
(E) The members of which are able to compute their income without the necessity of computing partnership taxable income; and
(F) Which is not a syndicate, group, pool, or joint venture which is classifiable as an association, or any group operating under an agreement which creates an organization classifiable as an association.
(iii)
Specified modifications for applicable unincorporated organizations.
Solely for purposes of an election under section 761(a) by an applicable unincorporated organization that meets the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (e) of this section:
(A) The requirement in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section is modified such that the participants are permitted to own the applicable credit property through an unincorporated organization that is an entity, other than one that is treated as a corporation for Federal tax purposes; and
(B) The requirement in paragraph (a)(3)(iii) of this section is modified such that the delegation of authority to sell the participant's share of the property produced or used may allow the delegee to enter into contracts the duration of which exceeds the minimum needs of the industry and may be for more than one year, provided that the delegation of authority to act on behalf of the participant may not be for a period of time that exceeds the minimum needs of the industry, and in no event for more than one year.
(5)
Examples.
The following examples are intended to illustrate the principles of this section.
(i)
Example 1
—(A)
Facts.
G and H enter into a joint operating agreement to own and operate a facility that will produce solar energy. G, an applicable entity, is entitled under the joint operating agreement to take in kind or dispose of 40% of the energy produced by the unincorporated organization and H, which is not an applicable entity, is entitled to the remaining 60%. G and H form LLC, a limited liability company, to hold the solar energy property that G and H intend to operate pursuant to the joint operating agreement. In accordance with the joint operating agreement, G owns a 40% ownership interest in LLC and H owns the remaining 60% ownership interest. G will sell its share of energy produced by the facility in a manner designed to generate applicable credits under section 45(a) and will make an election under section 6417(a) with respect thereto. LLC makes a valid election under section 761(a) to be excluded from subchapter K.
(B)
Analysis.
G will be entitled to any credits under section 45(a) generated by its sale of energy produced by LLC that G has the right to take in kind or dispose of (which, under the joint operating agreement, is 40% of the energy produced by LLC). Assuming all other requirements are met, G will be able to make an elective payment election under section 6417 for the applicable credits determined with respect to its ownership share of the solar energy property.
(ii)
Example 2
—(A)
Facts.
T is an Indian Tribal government as defined in § 1.6417-1(k) and an applicable entity. Through a limited liability company organized under T's Tribal law (TLLC), T and Y own and operate applicable credit property that will generate electricity the sale of which will generate applicable credits under section 45(a). TLLC is not treated as an association taxable as a corporation for Federal tax purposes and no election under § 301.7701-3 of this chapter has been made to treat TLLC as such. T and Y enter into a joint operating agreement with respect to the ownership and operation of the applicable credit property in which each of T and Y reserve the right separately to take in kind or dispose of their pro rata shares of property produced, extracted, or used and any associated renewable energy credits or similar credits. TLLC is formed exclusively to own and operate an applicable credit property with respect to
which section 45(a) credits will be determined. On January 1st of year 1, T and Y enter into delegation agreements with Q that delegate T's and Y's authority to Q to sell the electricity generated by T's and Y's shares of the applicable credit property. The term of the delegation agreements is one year, which does not exceed the minimum needs of the industry. On June 1st of year 1, Q enters into a power purchase agreement with Utility on T's and Y's behalf that commits T and Y to sell the electricity produced from their shares of the applicable credit property to Utility for a term of 15 years. At the end of the day on December 31st of year 1, the delegation agreements terminate.
(B)
Analysis.
Because T and Y did not delegate authority for a period of more than one year to sell the output from their shares of the applicable credit property, the requirements of paragraph (a)(3)(iii) of this section (as modified by paragraph (a)(4)(iii)(B) of this section) are met. Assuming that TLLC otherwise qualifies as an applicable unincorporated organization, TLLC is an organization described in paragraph (a)(4)(iii)(A) of this section and can make an election under paragraphs (b) and (e) of this section to be excluded from the application of all of subchapter K under section 761(a). As such, T can make an elective payment election for the applicable credits determined with respect to its share of the applicable credit property held by TLLC, assuming the requirements of section 6417 are otherwise met. The analysis in this example would be the same whether Y is also an Indian Tribal government, another applicable entity, or some other person.
(iii)
Example 3
—(A)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (a)(5)(ii)(A) of this section (
Example 2
), except that at the end of the day on December 31, T and Y each agree, in writing, to a new agent delegation agreement with Q with substantively identical terms as the agent delegation agreement in effect during year 1.
(B)
Analysis.
Because each of T and Y have agreed, in writing, to engage Q in an agency relationship lasting no longer than one year, the results are the same as in paragraph (a)(5)(ii)(B) of this section (
Example 2
). In contrast, if the agent delegation agreement renewed automatically, T and Y have effectively entered into an agent delegation agreement lasting longer than one year and have violated the requirements of paragraph (a)(4)(iii)(B) of this section. In that case, TLLC would not be eligible to make or maintain an election under section 761(a). As such, T could not make an elective payment election for the applicable credits determined with respect to its share of the applicable credit property held through TLLC.
(b)
Complete exclusion from subchapter K
—(1)
Time for making election for exclusion.
Any unincorporated organization described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section and either paragraph (a)(2) or (3) of this section (taking into account paragraph (a)(4) of this section, as applicable) that wishes to be excluded from all of subchapter K must make the election provided in section 761(a) not later than the time prescribed by § 1.6031(a)-1(e) (including extensions thereof) for filing the partnership return for the first taxable year for which exclusion from subchapter K is desired. Notwithstanding the prior sentence, such organization may be deemed to have made the election in the manner prescribed in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section.
(2)
Method of making election
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, any unincorporated organization described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section and either paragraph (a)(2) or (3) of this section (taking into account paragraph (a)(4) of this section, as applicable) which wishes to be excluded from all of subchapter K must make the election provided in section 761(a) in a statement attached to, or incorporated in, a properly executed partnership return, Form 1065,
U.S. Return of Partnership Income,
which must contain the information required in this paragraph (b)(2)(i). Such return must be filed with the Internal Revenue Service Center where the partnership return, Form 1065, would be required to be filed if no election were made. To determine the appropriate Internal Revenue Service Center, the principal office or place of business of the person filing the return
will be considered the principal office or place of business of the organization. The partnership return must be filed not later than the time prescribed § 1.6031(a)-1(e) (including extensions thereof) for filing the partnership return with respect to the first taxable year for which exclusion from subchapter K is desired. Such partnership return must contain, in lieu of the information required by Form 1065 and by the instructions relating thereto, only the name or other identification and the address of the organization together with information on the return, or in the statement attached to the return, showing the names, addresses, and taxpayer identification numbers of all the members of the organization; a statement that the organization qualifies under paragraph (a)(1) of this section and either paragraph (a)(2) or (3) of this section (taking into account paragraph (a)(4) of this section, as applicable); a statement that all of the members of the organization elect that it be excluded from all of subchapter K; and a statement indicating where a copy of the agreement under which the organization operates is available (or if the agreement is oral, from whom the provisions of the agreement may be obtained).
(ii)
Deemed election rule.
If an unincorporated organization described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section and either paragraph (a)(2) or (3) of this section (taking into account paragraph (a)(4) of this section, as applicable) does not make the election provided in section 761(a) in the manner prescribed by paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, it will nevertheless be deemed to have made the election if it can be shown from all the surrounding facts and circumstances that it was the intention of the members of such organization at the time of its formation to secure exclusion from all of subchapter K beginning with the first taxable year of the organization. Although the following facts are not exclusive, either one of such facts may indicate the requisite intent:
(A) At the time of the formation of the organization there is an agreement among the members that the organization be excluded from subchapter K beginning with the first taxable year of the organization; or
(B) The members of the organization owning substantially all of the capital interests report their respective shares of the items of income, deductions, and credits of the organization on their respective returns (making such elections as to individual items as may be appropriate) in a manner consistent with the exclusion of the organization from subchapter K beginning with the first taxable year of the organization.
(3)
Effect of election
—(i)
In general.
An election under this section to be excluded will be effective unless within 90 days after the formation of the organization any member of the organization notifies the Commissioner that the member desires subchapter K to apply to such organization, and also advises the Commissioner that the member has so notified all other members of the organization by registered or certified mail. Such election is irrevocable as long as the organization remains qualified under paragraph (a)(1) of this section and either paragraph (a)(2) or (3) of this section (taking into account paragraph (a)(4) of this section, as applicable), or unless approval of revocation of the election is secured from the Commissioner.
(ii)
Special rule.
Notwithstanding subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, an election deemed made pursuant to subparagraph (2)(ii) of this paragraph will not be effective in the case of an organization which had a taxable year ending on or before November 30, 1972, if any member of the organization notifies the Commissioner that the member desires subchapter K to apply to such organization, and also advises the Commissioner that he has so notified all other members of the organization by registered or certified mail. Such notification to the Commissioner must be made on or before January 2, 1973 and must include the names and addresses of all of the members of the organization.
(c)
Partial exclusion from subchapter K.
An unincorporated organization which wishes to be excluded from only certain sections of subchapter K must submit to the Commissioner, no later than 90 days after the beginning of the first
taxable year for which partial exclusion is desired, a request for permission to be excluded from certain provisions of subchapter K. The request must set forth the sections of subchapter K from which exclusion is sought and must state that such organization qualifies under paragraph (a)(1) of this section and either paragraph (a)(2) or (3) of this section (taking into account paragraph (a)(4) of this section, as applicable), and that the members of the organization elect to be excluded to the extent indicated. Such exclusion will be effective only upon approval of the election by the Commissioner and subject to the conditions the Commissioner may impose.
(d)
Rules for gas producers that produce natural gas under joint operating agreements
—(1)
Joint operating agreements and gas balancing.
Co-owners of a property producing natural gas enter into a joint operating agreement (JOA) to define the rights and obligations of each co- producer of the gas in place. The JOA determines, among other things, each co-producer's proportionate share of the natural gas as it is produced from the reservoir, together with the associated production expenses. A gas imbalance arises when a co-producer does not take its proportionate share of current gas production under the JOA (underproducer) and another co-producer takes more than its proportionate share of current production (overproducer). The co-producers often enter into a gas balancing agreement (GBA) as an addendum to their JOA to establish their rights and obligations when a gas imbalance arises. A GBA typically allows the overproducer to take the amount of the gas imbalance (overproduced gas) and entitles the underproducer to recoup the overproduced gas either from the volume of the gas remaining in the reservoir or by a cash balancing payment.
(2)
Permissible gas balancing methods
—(i)
General requirement.
All co-producers of natural gas operating under the same JOA must use the cumulative gas balancing method, as described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, unless they use the annual gas balancing method described in paragraph (d)(4) of this section. A co-producer's failure to comply with the provisions of this paragraph (d)(2)(i) generally constitutes the use of an impermissible method of accounting, requiring a change to a permissible method under § 1.446-1(e)(3) with any terms and conditions as may be imposed by the Commissioner. The co-producers' election to be excluded from all or part of subchapter K will not be revoked, unless the Commissioner determines that there was willful failure to comply with the requirements of this paragraph (d)(2)(i).
(ii)
Change in method of accounting; adoption of method of accounting
—(A)
In general.
The annual gas balancing method and the cumulative gas balancing method are methods of accounting. Accordingly, a change to or from either of these methods is a change in method of accounting that requires the consent of the Commissioner. See section 446(e) and § 1.446-1(e). For purposes of this section, each JOA is treated as a separate trade or business. Paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B) of this section provides rules for adopting either permissible method of accounting. Paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(C) of this section provides rules on the timing of required changes to either permissible method during the transitional period, and paragraph (d)(5) of this section contains the procedural provisions for making a change in method of accounting required in paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(C) of this section.
(B)
Adoption of method of accounting.
A co-producer must adopt a permissible method for each JOA entered into on or after the start of the co-producer's first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1994 (or, in the case of the use of the annual gas balancing method by co-producers not having the same taxable year, the start of the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1994, of the co-producer whose taxable year begins latest in the calendar year). If a co-producer is adopting the cumulative method, the co-producer may adopt the method by using the method on its timely filed return for the taxable year of adoption. A co-producer may adopt the annual gas balancing method with the permission of the Commissioner under guidelines set forth in paragraph (d)(4)(ii) of this section.
(C)
Required change in method of accounting for certain joint operating agreements.
This paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(C) applies to certain JOAs entered into prior to 1996. Except in the case of a part-year change in method of accounting or in the case of the cessation of a JOA (both of which are described in this paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(C)), for each JOA entered into prior to a co-producer's first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1994, and in effect as of the beginning of that year, the co-producer must change its method of accounting for sales of gas and its treatment of certain related deductions and credits to a permissible method as of the start of its first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1994. In the case of a JOA of co-producers that do not all have the same taxable year and that choose the annual gas balancing method, if the JOA is entered into prior to the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1994 of the co-producer whose taxable year begins latest in the calendar year and the JOA is in effect as of January 1, 1996, a change to the annual gas balancing method by each co-producer under that JOA is made as of January 1, 1996 (part-year change in method of accounting). If the co-producers would have made a part-year change to the annual gas balancing method but for the fact that their JOA ceased to be in effect before January 1, 1996 (cessation of a JOA), the co-producers do not change their method of accounting with respect to the JOA. Rather, for their taxable years in which the JOA ceases to be in effect, the co-producers use their current method of accounting with respect to that JOA.
(3)
Cumulative gas balancing method
—(i)
In general.
The cumulative gas balancing method (cumulative method), solely for purposes of reporting income from gas sales and certain related deductions and credits, treats each co-producer under the same JOA as the sole owner of its percentage share of the total gas in the reservoir and disregards the ownership arrangement described in the JOA for gas as it is produced from the reservoir. Each co-producer is considered to be taking only its share of the total gas in the reservoir as long as the gas remaining in the reservoir is sufficient to satisfy the ownership rights of the co-producers in their percentage shares of the total gas in the reservoir. After a co-producer has taken its entire share of the total gas in the reservoir, any additional gas taken by that co-producer (taking co-producer) is treated as having been taken from its other co-producers' shares of the total gas in the reservoir. The effect of being treated as a taking co-producer under the cumulative method is that the taking co-producer generally may not claim an allowance for depletion and a production credit on its sales of its other co-producers' percentage shares of the total gas in the reservoir.
(ii)
Requirements
—(A)
Reporting of income from sales of gas.
Under the cumulative method, each co-producer must include in gross income under its overall method of accounting the amount of its sales from all gas produced from the reservoir, including sales of gas taken from another co-producer's share of the gas in the reservoir.
(B)
Reporting of deduction of taking co-producer.
A taking co-producer deducts the amount of a payment (in cash or property, other than gas produced under the JOA) made to another co-producer for sales of that co-producer's gas, but only for the taxable year in which the payment is made. Thus, an accrual method taking co-producer is not permitted a deduction for any obligation it has to pay another co-producer for sales of that co-producer's gas until a payment is made. See paragraph (d)(3)(iii)(B) of this section for a rule requiring a reduction of the amount of the deduction described in this paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(B) if the taking co-producer had mistakenly claimed a depletion deduction relating to those sales.
(C)
Reporting of income by other co-producers.
Any co-producer that is entitled to receive a payment from a taking co-producer must include the amount of the payment in gross income as proceeds from the sale of its gas only for the taxable year that the payment is actually received, regardless of its overall method of accounting.
(D)
Reporting of production expenses.
Each co-producer deducts its proportionate share of production expenses,
as provided in the JOA, under its regular method of accounting for the expenses.
(iii)
Special rules for production credits and depletion deductions under the cumulative method
—(A)
In general.
Under the cumulative method, a co-producer's depletion allowance and production credit for a taxable year are based on its income from gas sales and production of gas from its percentage share of the total gas in the reservoir, and are not based on its current proportionate share of income and production as determined under the JOA. Thus, in general, a taking co-producer is not allowed a production credit or an allowance for depletion on its sales of gas in excess of its percentage share of the total gas in the reservoir. However, the Service will not disallow depletion deductions or production credits claimed by a taking co-producer on the gas of other co-producers if the taking co-producer had a reasonable but mistaken belief that the deductions or credits were claimed with respect to the taking co-producer's percentage share of total gas in the reservoir and the taking co-producer makes the appropriate reductions and additions to tax required in paragraphs (d)(3)(iii)(B) and (d)(3)(iii)(C) of this section. The reasonableness of the mistaken belief is determined at the time of filing the return claiming the deductions or credits. A co-producer receiving a payment for sales of its gas from a taking co-producer claims a production credit and an allowance for depletion relating to those sales only for the taxable year in which the amount of the payment is included in its gross income.
(B)
Reduction of taking co-producer's payment deduction for depletion claimed on another co-producer's gas.
If a taking co-producer claims an allowance for depletion on another co-producer's gas, the taking co-producer must reduce its deduction claimed in a later year for making a payment to the other co-producer for sales of that co-producer's gas by the amount of any percentage depletion deduction allowed on the gas sales to which the payment relates. If the percentage limitation of section 613A(d)(1) applied to disallow a depletion deduction for a previous year, the taking co-producer must reduce the amount of any carried over depletion deduction allowable in the year of the payment or in a future year by the portion of the carried over depletion deduction, if any, that relates to another co-producer's gas.
(C)
Addition to tax of taking co-producer for production credit claimed on another co-producer's gas.
If a taking co-producer claims a production credit on another co-producer's gas, the taking co-producer must add to its tax for the taxable year that it makes a payment to the other co-producer for sales of that co-producer's gas any production credit allowed in an earlier taxable year on the gas sales to which the payment relates, but only to the extent the credit allowed actually reduced the taking co- producer's tax in any earlier year. The taking co-producer also must reduce the amount of its minimum tax credit allowable by reason of section 53(d)(1)(B)(iii) in the year of the payment or in a future year by the portion of the credit, if any, that relates to another co-producer's gas.
(iv)
Anti-abuse rule.
If the Commissioner determines that co-producers using the cumulative method have arranged or altered their taking of production for a taxable year with a principal purpose of shifting the income, deductions, or credits relating to that production to avoid tax, the co- producers' election to be excluded from all or part of subchapter K will be revoked for that year and for subsequent years. In determining that a principal purpose was to avoid tax, the Commissioner will examine all the facts and circumstances surrounding the use of the cumulative method by the co-producers. See
Examples 3
and
4
of paragraph (d)(6) of this section.
(4)
Annual gas balancing method
—(i)
In general.
The annual gas balancing method (annual method) takes into account each co-producer's ownership rights and obligations, as described in the JOA, with respect to the co-producer's current proportionate share of gas as it is produced from the reservoir. Under the annual method, gas imbalances relating to a JOA must be eliminated annually through a balancing payment, which may be in the form of cash, gas produced under the same JOA, or other property. If all the
co-producers under a JOA have the same taxable year, any gas imbalance remaining at the end of a taxable year must be eliminated by a balancing payment from the overproducer to the underproducer by the due date of the overproducer's tax return for that taxable year (including extensions). If all the co-producers under a JOA do not have the same taxable year, any gas imbalance remaining at the end of a calendar year must be eliminated by a balancing payment from the overproducer to the underproducer by September 15 of the following calendar year. The annual method may be used only if the Commissioner's permission is obtained. Paragraph (d)(4)(ii) of this section provides guidelines for applying for this permission. The annual method is not available for a JOA with respect to which any co-producer made an election under paragraph (d)(5)(i)(B)(
3
) of this section (to take an aggregate section 481(a) adjustment for all JOAs of a co-producer into account in the year of change).
(ii)
Obtaining the Commissioner's permission to use the annual method.
A request for the Commissioner's permission to adopt the annual method for a new JOA must be in writing and must set forth the names of all the co-producers under the JOA and the respective taxable year of adoption. See paragraphs (d)(2)(ii) and (d)(5)(ii) of this section for the rules for a change in method of accounting to the annual method. In addition, the request must contain an explanation of how the co-producers will report income from gas sales, the making or receiving of a balancing payment, production expenses, depletion deductions, and production credits. Permission will be granted under appropriate conditions, including, but not limited to, an agreement in writing by all co-producers to use the annual method and to eliminate any gas imbalances annually in accordance with paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section.
(5)
Transitional rules for making a change in method of accounting required in paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(C) of this section
—(i)
Change in method of accounting to the cumulative method
—(A)
Automatic consent to change in method of accounting to the cumulative method.
A co-producer changing to the cumulative method for any JOA entered into prior to its first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1994, and in effect as of the beginning of that year is granted the consent of the Commissioner to change its method of accounting with respect to each JOA to the cumulative method, provided the co-producer—
(
1
) Makes the change on its timely filed return for its first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1994;
(
2
) Attaches a completed and signed Form 3115 to the co-producer's tax return for the year of change, stating that, pursuant to § 1.761-2(d)(2)(ii) of the regulations, the co-producer is changing its method of accounting for sales of gas and its treatment of certain related deductions and credits under each JOA to the cumulative method;
(
3
) In the case of a co-producer making an election under paragraph (d)(5)(i)(B)(
3
) of this section to take the aggregate section 481(a) adjustment into account in the year of change, attaches the statement described in paragraph (d)(5)(i)(B)(
3
)(
ii
) of this section; and
(
4
) In the case of a co-producer not making an election under paragraph (d)(5)(i)(B)(
3
) of this section, attaches a list of each JOA with respect to which there is a section 481(a) adjustment computed in accordance with paragraph (d)(5)(i)(B)(
2
)(
i
) of this section.
(B)
Section 481(a) adjustment
—(
1
)
Application of section 481(a).
A change in method of accounting to the cumulative method under the automatic consent procedure in paragraph (d)(5)(i)(A) of this section is a change in method of accounting to which the provisions of section 481(a) apply. Thus, a section 481(a) adjustment must be taken into account in the manner provided by this paragraph (d)(5)(i)(B) to prevent the omission or duplication of income. Paragraph (d)(5)(i)(B)(
2
) of this section provides the general rules for computing the amount of the section 481(a) adjustment of a co-producer relating to a particular JOA and for taking the section 481(a) adjustment into account. Paragraph (d)(5)(i)(B)(
3
) of this section provides rules for electing to take a co-producer's section 481(a) adjustment computed on an aggregate
basis for all JOAs into account in the year of change. Paragraph (d)(5)(i)(C) of this section provides rules to coordinate the taking of a depletion deduction or a production credit with the inclusion of a section 481(a) adjustment arising from a change in method of accounting to the cumulative method under this paragraph (d)(5)(i).
(
2
)
Computation of the section 481(a) adjustment relating to a joint operating agreement
—(
i
)
In general.
The section 481(a) adjustment of a co-producer relating to a JOA is computed as of the first day of the co-producer's year of change and is equal to the difference between the amount of income reported under the co-producer's former method of accounting for all taxable years prior to the year of change and the amount of income that would have been reported if the co-producer's new method had been used in all those taxable years.
(
ii
)
Section 481(a) adjustment period.
Except to the extent that paragraph (d)(5)(i)(B)(
3
) of this section applies, a co-producer's section 481(a) adjustment relating to a JOA, whether positive or negative, is taken into account in computing taxable income ratably over the 6-taxable-year period beginning with the year of change (the section 481(a) adjustment period). If the co-producer has been in existence less than 6 taxable years, the adjustment is taken into account over the number of years the co-producer has been in existence. If the co-producer ceases to engage in the trade or business that gave rise to the section 481(a) adjustment at any time during the section 481(a) adjustment period, the entire remaining balance of the section 481(a) adjustment relating to that trade or business must be taken into account in the year of the cessation. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(5)(i)(B)(
2
)(
ii
), production under each JOA is treated as a separate trade or business. The determination as to whether the co-producer ceases to engage in its trade or business is to be made under the principles of § 1.446-1(e)(3)(ii) and its underlying administrative procedures. For example, the permanent cessation of production under a co-producer's JOA constitutes the cessation of a trade or business of the co-producer. Accordingly, for the year that production under a JOA permanently ceases, the remaining balance of the section 481(a) adjustment relating to the JOA must be taken into account.

Election to take aggregate section 481(a) adjustment for all joint operating agreements into account in the year of change
—(
i
)
In general.
A co-producer may elect to take into account its section 481(a) adjustment, computed on an aggregate basis for all of its JOAs, whether negative or positive, in the year of change, provided the co-producer uses the cumulative method for all of its JOAs entered into prior to its first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1994, and in effect as of the beginning of that year. The aggregate section 481(a) adjustment of a co-producer is equal to the difference between the amount of income reported under the co-producer's former method of accounting for all taxable years prior to the year of change and the amount of income that would have been reported if the co-producer's new method had been used in all of those taxable years for all JOAs for which the co-producer changes its method of accounting. An election made under this paragraph (d)(5)(i)(B)(
3
) is irrevocable. If any person who, together with another person, would be treated as a single taxpayer under section 41(f)(1) (A) or (B) makes an election under this paragraph (d)(5)(i)(B)(
3
), all persons within that single taxpayer group will be treated as if they had made an election under this paragraph (d)(5)(i)(B)(
3
) and, as such, will be irrevocably bound by that election. If a co-producer does not make an election under this paragraph, each JOA entered into prior to the start of its first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1994, and in effect as of the beginning of that year must be accounted for separately in computing the section 481(a) adjustment and taxable income of the co-producer for any year to which this paragraph (d) applies.
(
ii
)
Time and manner for making the election.
An election under this paragraph (d)(5)(i)(B)(
3
) is made by attaching a statement to the co-producer's timely filed return for its year of change indicating that the co- producer is electing under § 1.761-2(d)(5)(i)(B)(
3
)
to take its aggregate section 481(a) adjustment into account in the year of change.
(C)
Treatment of section 481(a) adjustment as a sale for purposes of computing a production credit and as gross income from the property for purposes of depletion deductions.
Any positive section 481(a) adjustment arising as a result of a change in method of accounting for gas imbalances under this paragraph (d)(5)(i) and taken into account in computing taxable income under paragraph (d)(5)(i)(B) of this section is considered a sale by the taxpayer for purposes of computing any production credit in the year that the adjustment is taken into account. Similarly, the positive section 481(a) adjustment is considered
gross income from the property
and
taxable income from the property
for purposes of computing depletion deductions in the year the adjustment is taken into account. Sales amounts used in computing any production credit in any year in which a negative section 481(a) adjustment is taken into account in computing taxable income under paragraph (d)(5)(i)(B) of this section must be reduced by the amount of the negative section 481(a) adjustment taken into account in that year. Similarly, gross income from the property and taxable income from the property used in computing any depletion deduction in any year in which the negative section 481(a) adjustment is taken into account must be reduced by the amount of the negative adjustment. For these purposes, any taxpayer that makes an aggregate section 481(a) adjustment election under paragraph (d)(5)(i)(B)(
3
) of this section must allocate the adjustment among its properties in any reasonable manner that prevents a duplication or omission of depletion deductions.
(ii)
Change in method of accounting to the annual method
—(A)
In general.
A co-producer changing to the annual method in accordance with paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section must request a change under § 1.446-1(e)(3) and will be subject to any terms and conditions as may be imposed by the Commissioner.
(B)
Section 481(a) adjustment.
A change in method of accounting to the annual method is a change in method of accounting to which the provisions of section 481(a) apply. Thus, a section 481(a) adjustment must be taken into account to prevent the omission or duplication of income. If all the co-producers under a JOA have the same taxable year, the section 481(a) adjustment involved in a change to the annual method by a co-producer relating to the JOA is computed as of the first day of the co-producer's year of change. If the co-producers under a JOA do not all have the same taxable year (that is, in the case of a part-year change described in paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(C) of this section), the change in method of accounting occurs on January 1, 1996, and the section 481(a) adjustment is computed on that date.
(iii)
Untimely change in method of accounting to comply with this section.
Unless a co-producer required by this section to change its method of accounting complies with the provisions of this paragraph (d)(5) for its first applicable taxable year within the time prescribed by this paragraph (d)(5), the co-producer must take the section 481(a) adjustment into account under the provisions of any applicable administrative procedure that is prescribed by the Commissioner specifically for purposes of complying with this section. Absent such an administrative procedure, a co-producer must request a change under § 1.446-1(e)(3) and will be subject to any terms and conditions as may be imposed by the Commissioner.
(6)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of the cumulative method described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.

# Example 1.
Operation of the cumulative method. (i) L, a corporation using the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting, and M, a corporation using an accrual method, file returns on a calendar year basis. On January 1, 1995, L and M enter into a JOA to produce natural gas as an unincorporated organization from a reservoir located in State Y. The JOA allocates reservoir production 60 percent to L and 40 percent to M. L and M enter into a GBA as an addendum to the JOA. L and M agree to use the cumulative method to account for gas sales from the reservoir and elect under section 761(a) and this section to exclude the organization from the application of subchapter K. Production from the reservoir is eligible for the section 29 credit for producing fuel from a nonconventional source. L and M produce and sell the following
amounts of natural gas (in mmcf) until 2000 during which year production from the reservoir ceases:
1995
1996
1997
1998
1999
2000

M

120
160
80
40
(ii) By the end of 1996, neither L nor M has fully produced its percentage share of the total gas in the reservoir. In 1997, L produces a total of 600 mmcf of gas at the rate of 50 mmcf per month. Prior to filing its return for 1997, L determines that it fully produced its percentage share of gas in the reservoir as of June 30, 1997. Pursuant to the GBA executed by L and M, L pays M at the end of 2000 for the 300 mmcf of M's gas (as determined under the cumulative method) that L sold in the last half of 1997.
(iii) For 1995, L and M must include in their gross income the amounts relating to gas sales of 720 mmcf and 240 mmcf, respectively. For 1996, L and M must include the amounts relating to gas sales of 480 mmcf and 60 mmcf, respectively. For both 1995 and 1996, L and M compute an allowance for depletion and a section 29 credit based upon gas taken and sold by each from the reservoir for each taxable year.
(iv) For 1997, L and M must include in gross income the amounts relating to their gas sales of 600 mmcf and 120 mmcf, respectively. Under paragraph (d)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, L computes an allowance for depletion and the section 29 credit based only on production from L's proportionate share of gas in the reservoir (that is, based on L's production through June 30, 1997). Accordingly, for 1997, L claims depletion and the section 29 credit only with respect to 300 mmcf of gas (50 mmcf per month × 6 months). For 1997, because M has not fully produced from its percentage share of the total gas in the reservoir as of the end of 1997, M claims depletion and the section 29 credit on the 120 mmcf that M produced in 1997.
(v) In 1998 and 1999, M must include in gross income the amounts relating to M's sales of gas, that is, 160 mmcf for 1998 and 80 mmcf for 1999. For 2000, M must include in gross income the amount relating to sales of 340 mmcf of gas, which consists of its own sales of 40 mmcf plus the payment for 300 mmcf of gas that L made to M for having sold from M's share of the total gas in the reservoir during the last half of 1997. Because M produced from its percentage share of the total gas in the reservoir during 1998, 1999, and 2000, M claims a depletion deduction and a section 29 credit on its income and production for those years, that is, 160 mmcf for 1998, 80 mmcf for 1999, and 40 mmcf for 2000. Additionally, for 2000, M claims depletion and the section 29 credit relating to the payment that M received from L for the 300 mmcf of M's gas that L sold in the last half of 1997. Under paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, L's deduction for its payment to M for the 300 mmcf of M's gas that L sold in 1997 is allowable only for 2000.

# Example 2. Adjustments under the cumulative method for depletion deductions and production credits that were claimed for sales in excess of a co-producer's percentage share of total gas in the reservoir.
(i) L, a corporation using the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting, and M, a corporation using an accrual method, file returns on a calendar year basis. On January 1, 1995, L and M enter into a JOA to produce natural gas as an unincorporated organization from a reservoir located in State Y. The JOA allocates reservoir production 60 percent to L and 40 percent to M. L and M enter into a GBA as an addendum to the JOA. L and M agree to use the cumulative method to account for gas sales from the reservoir and elect under section 761(a) and this section to exclude the organization from the application of subchapter K. Production from the reservoir is eligible for the section 29 credit for producing fuel from a nonconventional source. L and M produce and sell the following amounts of natural gas (in mmcf) until 2000 during which year production from the reservoir ceases:
1995
1996
1997

M

(ii) In addition, L does not realize until December 31, 1999, that L fully produced its percentage share of the total gas in the reservoir as of June 30, 1997. At the time of filing its returns for 1997 and 1998, L reasonably believes that during 1997 and 1998, respectively, it did not fully produce its percentage share of the total gas in the reservoir. Thus, L claims depletion and the section 29 credit for its total sales of 600 mmcf in 1997 and 60 mmcf in 1998. Pursuant to the GBA executed by L and M, L pays M at the end of 2000 for the 420 mmcf of M's gas (as determined under the cumulative method) that L sold (300 mmcf in the last half of 1997 (assuming that production was at a rate of 50 mmcf per month), 60 mmcf in 1998, and 60 mmcf in 1999).
(iii) In 1997 and 1998, L and M include in gross income the amounts relating to their respective sales of gas, that is, for L 600 mmcf for 1997 and 60 mmcf for 1998, and for M 120 mmcf for 1997 and 60 mmcf for 1998.
(iv) For 1999, L must include in gross income the amount of its sales of 60 mmcf, but may not claim depletion or the section 29 credit on those sales. For 1999, M must include in gross income the amount of its sales of 60 mmcf and claims depletion and the section 29 credit with respect to those 60 mmcf.
(v) For 2000, M must include in gross income the amount relating to gas sales of 460 mmcf, that is, the amount of M's own gas sales of 40 mmcf and the amount of the payment received from L for the 420 mmcf of M's gas that L sold (consisting of 300 mmcf in 1997, 60 mmcf in 1998, and 60 mmcf in 1999). Under paragraph (d)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, M computes a depletion deduction and a production credit relating to the amount of M's actual gas sales for 2000 and the payment received from L, that is, relating to a total of 460 mmcf of gas (M's sales of 40 mmcf for 2000, plus L's payment for 420 mmcf of gas). Under paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, L's deduction for making its payment to M for 420 mmcf of gas is allowable only for 2000. Under paragraph (d)(3)(iii)(B) of this section, L must reduce its deduction by the amount of any percentage depletion deductions allowed on its sales of M's gas, that is, relating to 360 mmcf of gas (300 mmcf for 1997 and 60 mmcf for 1998). In addition, under paragraph (d)(3)(iii)(C) of this section, L must increase its tax for 2000 by the amount of any section 29 credit L claimed on its sales of M's gas, but only to the extent that the credit claimed actually reduced L's tax in any earlier year.

# Example 3. Non-abusive altering of the taking of production for a taxable year.
(i) C and D enter into a JOA and a GBA on December 1, 1994, for gas production from a reservoir. The JOA allocates production at 50 percent to C and 50 percent to D. C and D agree in writing to use the cumulative method to account for gas sales. Additionally, C and D elect under section 761(a) and this section to exclude their organization from the application of subchapter K. C and D arrange to sell all their production under annually renewable contracts. In 1995, C and D each sell 480 mmcf of gas from the reservoir.
(ii) In November 1995, D is notified that its contract with its purchaser will not be renewed for 1996. D is unable to find a new purchaser for its gas for 1996. In December 1995, D notifies C that it will not be taking production from the reservoir in 1996. Pursuant to the GBA, C then contracts with its current gas purchaser to sell an additional 20 mmcf per month in 1996. Accordingly, C sells 720 mmcf in 1996 (60 mmcf per month × 12 months). Under the facts described in this example, a principal purpose of altering the taking of production is not to avoid tax. Accordingly, the co-producers' election under section 761(a) will not be revoked by reason of altering the taking of production.

# Example 4. Abusive altering of the taking of production for a taxable year.
The facts are the same as in
Example 3
(i). For 1996, C anticipates that C's regular tax (reduced by the credits allowable under sections 27 and 28) will not exceed C's tentative minimum tax. Accordingly, under section 29(b)(6), C's credit allowed under section 29(a) for sales of its gas will be zero. For 1997, C anticipates that its credit allowed under section 29(a) will not be limited by section 29(b)(6). On the other hand, D anticipates that any credit it may claim under section 29(a) for 1996, even including a credit based on sales of C's share of current production under the JOA, will not be limited by section 29(b)(6). However, for 1997, D anticipates that its credit under section 29(a) will be limited by section 29(b)(6). On January 1, 1996, C and D agree that D will contract with its purchaser to sell the entire 960 mmcf produced from the reservoir in 1996 and that C will contract with its purchaser to sell the entire 960 mmcf produced from the reservoir in 1997. Under these facts, a principal purpose of altering the taking of production is to avoid tax. Accordingly, the co-producers' election under section 761(a) will be revoked for 1996 and for subsequent years.
(7)
Effective date.
Except in the case of a part-year change to the annual method or the cessation of a JOA, both of which are described in paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(C) of this section, the provisions of this paragraph (d) apply to all taxable years beginning after December 31, 1994, of any producer that is a member of an unincorporated organization that produces natural gas under a JOA in effect on or after the start of the producer's first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1994. In the case of a part-year change, the provisions of this paragraph (d) apply on and after January 1, 1996. In the case of the cessation of a JOA, the co-producers use their current method of accounting with respect to that JOA until the JOA ceases to be in effect.
(e)
Cross reference.
For requirements with respect to the filing of a return on Form 1065 by a partnership, see § 1.6031(a)-1.
(f)
Applicability date.
Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, this section applies to taxable years ending on or after March 11, 2024.

§ 1.761-3
Certain option holders treated as partners.
(a)
Noncompensatory option treated as a partnership interest
—(1)
General rule.
A noncompensatory option (as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section) is treated as a partnership interest for all
Federal tax purposes if, on the date of a measurement event (as defined in paragraph (c) of this section) with respect to the option—
(i) The noncompensatory option (and any agreements associated with it) provides the option holder with rights that are substantially similar to the rights afforded a partner (as determined under paragraph (d) of this section); and
(ii) There is a strong likelihood that the failure to treat the holder of the noncompensatory option as a partner would result in a substantial reduction in the present value of the partners' and noncompensatory option holder's aggregate Federal tax liabilities (as determined under paragraph (e) of this section).
(2)
Continuing applicability of general principles of law.
The fact that an option is not treated as a partnership interest under this section does not prevent the option from being treated as a partnership interest under general principles of Federal tax law.
(3)
Timing of characterization.
If a noncompensatory option is treated under this section as a partnership interest, that treatment applies, as the case may be, upon the issuance of the option, or immediately before any other measurement event that gave rise to the characterization under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
(4)
Effect of characterization.
If a noncompensatory option is treated as a partnership interest under this section or under general principles of law, the option holder will be treated as a partner with respect to the partnership interest and will receive a distributive share of the partnership's income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit (or items thereof), as determined in accordance with that partner's interest in the partnership (taking into account all facts and circumstances) in accordance with § 1.704-1(b)(3). Once a noncompensatory option is treated as a partnership interest, in no event may it be characterized as an option thereafter.
(b)
Definitions.
For purposes of this section:
(1)
Look-through entity. Look-through entity
means an entity described in § 1.704-1(b)(2)(iii)(
d
)(
2
).
(2)
Noncompensatory option. Noncompensatory option
means an option (as defined in paragraph (b)(3) of this section) issued by a partnership, other than an option issued in connection with the performance of services. For purposes of applying this section, an option that would be a noncompensatory option under this paragraph if it had been issued by a partnership is a noncompensatory option if the option was issued by an eligible entity (as defined in § 301.7701-3(a)) that would become a partnership under § 301.7701-3(f)(2) if the noncompensatory option holder were treated as a partner. Also for purposes of applying this section, if a noncompensatory option is issued by such an eligible entity, then the eligible entity is treated as a partnership.
(3)
Option.
An
option
is a contractual right to acquire an interest in the issuing partnership, including a call option, warrant, or other similar arrangement. In addition, an option includes convertible debt (as defined in § 1.721-2(g)(2)) and convertible equity (as defined in § 1.721-2(g)(3)). To achieve the purposes of this section, the Commissioner can treat other contractual agreements, including a forward contract, a futures contract, or a notional principal contract, as an option. A contract that otherwise constitutes an option will not fail to be treated as an option for purposes of this section merely because it may or must be settled in cash or property other than a partnership interest.
(4)
Underlying partnership interest. Underlying partnership interest
means the interest in the issuing partnership that would be acquired by the noncompensatory option holder upon exercise of the noncompensatory option.
(c)
Measurement event
—(1)
General rule.
Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, a measurement event with respect to a noncompensatory option is any of the following events:
(i) Issuance of the noncompensatory option;
(ii) An adjustment of the terms (modification) of the noncompensatory option or of the underlying partnership interest (as defined in paragraph (b)(4)
of this section) (including an adjustment pursuant to the terms of the noncompensatory option or the underlying partnership interest);
(iii) Transfer of the noncompensatory option if either:
(A) The option may be exercised (or settled) more than 12 months after its issuance, or
(B) The transfer is pursuant to a plan in existence at the time of the issuance or modification of the noncompensatory option that has as a principal purpose the substantial reduction of the present value of the aggregate Federal tax liabilities of the partners and the noncompensatory option holder (under paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section);
(2)
Events not treated as measurement events.
A measurement event does not include the following events:
(i) A transfer of the noncompensatory option at death, between spouses or former spouses under section 1041, or in a transaction that is disregarded for Federal tax purposes;
(ii) A modification that neither materially increases the likelihood that the noncompensatory option will be exercised (as described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section) nor provides the noncompensatory option holder with partner attributes (as described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section);
(iii) A change in the strike price of a noncompensatory option or in the interests in the issuing partnership that may be issued or transferred pursuant to the noncompensatory option, made pursuant to a bona fide, reasonable adjustment formula that has the intended effect of preventing dilution of the interests of the noncompensatory option holder;
(iv) Any other event as provided in guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin.
(d)
Rights substantially similar to partner rights
—(1)
In general.
A noncompensatory option provides the holder with rights that are substantially similar to the rights afforded to a partner if either the option is reasonably certain to be exercised or the option holder possesses partner attributes.
(2)
Reasonable certainty of exercise
—(i)
General rule.
The determination of whether a noncompensatory option is reasonably certain to be exercised at the time of a measurement event is based on all the facts and circumstances, including—
(A) The fair market value of the partnership interest that is the subject of the noncompensatory option;
(B) The strike price of the noncompensatory option;
(C) The term of the noncompensatory option;
(D) The volatility of the value or income of the issuing partnership or the underlying partnership interest;
(E) Anticipated distributions by the partnership during the term of the noncompensatory option;
(F) Any other special option features, such as a strike price that fluctuates;
(G) The existence of related options, including reciprocal options; and
(H) Any other arrangements affecting or undertaken with a principal purpose of affecting the likelihood that the noncompensatory option will be exercised.
(ii)
Safe harbors
—(A)
General rule.
Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(C) of this section, a noncompensatory option is not considered reasonably certain to be exercised if, as of the date of a measurement event with respect to the noncompensatory option—
(
1
) The option may be exercised no more than 24 months after the date of the measurement event and the strike price is equal to or greater than 110 percent of the fair market value of the underlying partnership interest on the date of the measurement event; or
(
2
) The terms of the option provide that the strike price of the option is equal to or greater than the fair market value of the underlying partnership interest on the exercise date.
(B)
Options exercisable at fair market value.
For purposes of paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, an option whose strike price is determined by a formula is considered to have a strike price equal to or greater than the fair market value of the underlying partnership interest on the exercise date if the formula is agreed upon by the parties when the option is issued in a bona fide attempt to arrive at the fair market value on the exercise date and is to
be applied based on the facts and circumstances in existence on the exercise date.
(C)
Exception.
The safe harbors of paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(A) of this section do not apply if the parties to the noncompensatory option had a principal purpose described in paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(B) of this section with respect to a measurement event for that option (or, if multiple options were issued pursuant to a plan, a measurement event with respect to any option issued pursuant to that plan).
(D)
Failure to satisfy safe harbor.
Failure of an option to satisfy one of the safe harbors of paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(A) does not affect the determination of whether an option is treated as reasonably certain to be exercised.
(3)
Partner attributes
—(i)
General rule.
The determination of whether a holder of a noncompensatory option possesses partner attributes is based on all the facts and circumstances, including whether the option holder, directly or indirectly, through the option agreement or a related agreement, is provided with voting rights or managerial rights in the partnership.
(ii)
Certain factors that conclusively establish partner attributes.
For purposes of this section, a noncompensatory option holder has partner attributes if, based on all the facts and circumstances—
(A) The option holder is provided with rights (through the option agreement or a related agreement) that are similar to rights ordinarily afforded to a partner to participate in partnership profits through present possessory rights to share in current operating or liquidating distributions with respect to the underlying partnership interests; or
(B) The option holder, directly or indirectly, undertakes obligations (through the option agreement or a related agreement) that are similar to obligations undertaken by a partner to bear partnership losses.
(iii)
Special rules.
The following rules apply for purposes of paragraphs (d)(3)(i) and (d)(3)(ii) of this section:
(A) Rights in the issuing partnership possessed by a noncompensatory option holder solely by virtue of owning an interest in the issuing partnership are not taken into account, provided that those rights are no greater than the rights granted to other partners owning substantially similar interests in the partnership and who do not hold noncompensatory options in the partnership.
(B) If all of the partners owning substantially similar interests in the issuing partnership also hold noncompensatory options in the partnership, or if none of the other partners owns substantially similar interests in the partnership, then all facts and circumstances will be considered in determining whether the rights in the partnership possessed by the option holder are possessed solely by virtue of owning a partnership interest. If those rights are possessed solely by virtue of owning a partnership interest, they are not taken into account.
(C) A noncompensatory option holder will not ordinarily be considered to possess partner attributes solely because the noncompensatory option agreement significantly controls or restricts, or the noncompensatory option holder has the ability to significantly control or restrict, a partnership decision that could substantially affect the value of the underlying partnership interest. In particular, the following abilities of the option holder will not be treated as partner attributes:
(
1
) The ability to impose reasonable restrictions on partnership distributions or dilutive issuances of partnership equity or options while the noncompensatory option is outstanding.
(

) The ability to choose the partnership's section 704(c) method for partnership properties.
(D) When the applicable measurement event is a transfer described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the partner attributes of the transferee, not the transferor, are taken into account.
(E) The option holder will be treated as owning all partnership interests and noncompensatory options issued by the partnership that are owned by any person related to the option holder. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a person related to the option holder is defined as any person bearing a relationship to the option holder described in section 267(b) or 707(b).
(e)
Substantial tax reduction requirement
—(1)
General rule.
The determination of whether there is a strong likelihood that the failure to treat a noncompensatory option holder as a partner would result in a substantial reduction in the present value of the partners' and the noncompensatory option holder's aggregate Federal tax liabilities is based on all the facts and circumstances, including—
(i) The interaction of the allocations of the issuing partnership and the partners' and noncompensatory option holder's Federal tax attributes (taking into account tax consequences that result from the interaction of the allocations with the partners' and noncompensatory option holder's Federal tax attributes that are unrelated to the partnership);
(ii) The absolute amount of the Federal tax reduction;
(iii) The amount of the reduction relative to overall Federal tax liability; and
(iv) The timing of items of income and deductions.
(2)
Special rules.
For purposes of applying paragraph (e)(1) of this section to a partner or noncompensatory option holder that is—
(i) A look-through entity (as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section), the Federal tax consequences that result from the interaction of allocations of the partnership and the Federal tax attributes of any person that is an owner, or in the case of a trust or estate, the beneficiary, of an interest in such a partner or noncompensatory option holder, whether directly, or indirectly through one or more look-through entities, must be taken into account; or
(ii) A member of a consolidated group (within the meaning of § 1.1502-1(h)), the tax consequences that result from the interaction of the issuing partnership's allocations and the tax attributes of the consolidated group and the tax attributes of another member with respect to a separate return year must be taken into account.
(f)
Example.
The following example illustrates the provisions of this section. For purposes of the example, assume that PRS is a partnership for Federal tax purposes, none of the noncompensatory option holders or partners are related persons, and that general principles of law do not apply to treat the noncompensatory option as a partnership interest. The example reads as follows:

# Example. Active trade or business.
PRS is engaged in an active real estate business, the amount of income, gain, loss, and deductions from which cannot be predicted with any reasonable certainty. In exchange for a premium of $10x, PRS issues a noncompensatory option to A to acquire a 10 percent interest in PRS for $110x at any time during a 3-year period commencing on the date on which the option is issued. At the time of the issuance of the noncompensatory option, a 10 percent interest in PRS has a fair market value of $100x. Due to the nature of PRS's business, the value of a 10 percent PRS interest in 3 years is not reasonably predictable as of the time the noncompensatory option is issued. Assuming there are no other facts affecting the certainty of the option's exercise, it is not reasonably certain that A's option will be exercised. Therefore, assuming that A does not possess partner attributes as described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, A's noncompensatory option is not treated as a partnership interest under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
(g)
Effective/applicability date.
This section applies to noncompensatory options issued on or after February 5, 2013.

# effective date for subchapter k, chapter 1 of the code
§ 1.771-1
Effective date.
(a)
General rule.
Except as provided in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, the provisions of subchapter K, chapter 1 of the Code, shall apply to any taxable year of a partnership beginning after December 31, 1954, and to any part of a partner's taxable year falling within such partnership taxable year. The provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 relating to partnerships shall apply to any taxable year of a partnership beginning before January 1, 1955, and to any part of a partner's taxable year falling within such partnership taxable year. If a partnership and the partners are on different taxable years, subchapter K shall become effective at the same time both for the partnership and for the partners.
(b)
Special rules.
Certain provisions of section 771 apply after specific dates in 1954, as follows:
(1)
Adoption of taxable year.
Section 706(b) (relating to the adoption of taxable years by partners and partnerships), shall apply to any partnership which adopts or changes to, and any partner who changes to, a taxable year beginning on or after April 2, 1954. For the purpose of applying this subparagraph, the rules of section 708 (relating to the continuation of partnerships) shall apply. For example, if two or more partnerships merge after April 1, 1954, and the new partnership uses the taxable year of the partnership of which it is deemed to be the successor under section 708(b)(2)(A), it will not need prior approval to continue to use such taxable year even though such year may be different from the taxable years of the partners. Such a partnership is not “adopting” or “changing” its taxable year.
(2)
Property distributed by a partnership.
Section 735(a), relating to the character of gain or loss on disposition of property distributed by a partnership to a partner, shall apply only to property distributed after March 9, 1954. Although a partnership whose taxable year begins before January 1, 1955, generally will be subject to the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, any unrealized receivables or inventory items distributed by any such partnership after March 9, 1954, will be subject to the provisions of section 735(a), and the gain or loss on the subsequent disposition of such property will be ordinary gain or loss rather than capital gain or loss. In the case of property distributed before March 10, 1954, section 735(a) will not apply, even though the property is disposed of by the distributee partner after that date, unless the partnership elects under paragraph (c) of this section to apply section 735.
(3)
Unrealized receivables and inventory items.
Section 751 (providing for the realization of ordinary income on certain transfers or distributions of unrealized receivables or substantially appreciated inventory items) shall be applicable to any such transfer or distribution occurring after March 9, 1954. For the purpose of applying section 751 in the case of a taxable year beginning before January 1, 1955, a partnership or partner may elect to treat as applicable any other section of subchapter K. See paragraph (f) of § 1.751-1.
(4)
Partner receiving income in respect of a decedent.
Section 753, which provides that the amount includible in the gross income of a successor in interest of a deceased partner under section 736(a) shall be considered income in respect of a decedent under section 691, shall apply only in the case of payments made with respect to decedents whose death occurred after December 31, 1954.
(c)
Optional treatment of certain distributions.
(1) For a partnership taxable year beginning after December 31, 1953, and before January 1, 1955, a partnership may elect to apply the rules of certain sections of subchapter K with respect to current distributions made by the partnership in such year. These sections are 731, 732 (a), (c), and (e), 733, 735, and 751 (b), (c), and (d). If an election is made, it shall apply to the partnership and all its members for all current distributions made by the partnership during the taxable year. Such distributions shall also be subject to the rules of section 705 (relating to determination of basis of a partner's interest), 752 (relating to treatment of certain liabilities), and 761(d) (relating to the definition of liquidation of a partner's interest), to the extent that such sections apply to current distributions.
(2) An election under this paragraph shall be made by a statement filed with the partnership return for the taxable year to which such election applies, or before August 23, 1956, whichever date is later. The statement shall be signed by all members of the partnership and the election once made shall be binding on the partnership and on all of its members.

# INSURANCE COMPANIES

# Life Insurance Companies

# definition; tax imposed
§ 1.801-1
Definitions.
(a)
Life insurance company.
The term
life insurance company
as used in subtitle A of the Code is defined in section 801. For the purpose of determining
whether a company is a “life insurance company” within the meaning of that term as used in section 801, it must first be determined whether the company is taxable as an insurance company under the Code. For the definition of an “insurance company”, see paragraph (b) of this section. In determining whether an insurance company is a life insurance company, the life insurance reserves (as defined in section 803(b)) plus any unearned premiums and unpaid losses on noncancellable life, health, or accident policies, not included in “life insurance reserves” must comprise more than 50 percent of its total reserves (as defined in section 801). An insurance company writing only noncancellable life, health, or accident policies and having no “life insurance reserves” may qualify as a life insurance company if its unearned premiums and unpaid losses on such policies comprise more than 50 percent of its total reserves. A noncancellable insurance policy means a contract which the insurance company is under an obligation to renew or continue at a specified premium and with respect to which a reserve in addition to the unearned premium must be carried to cover that obligation. For the purpose of the preceding sentence, the term “unearned premium” means the amount which will cover the cost of carrying the insurance risk for the period for which the premium has been paid in advance. A burial or funeral benefit insurance company qualifying as a life insurance company engaged directly in the manufacture of funeral supplies or the performance of funeral services will be taxable under section 821 or section 831 as an insurance company other than life.
(b)
Insurance companies.
(1) Insurance companies include both stock and mutual companies, as well as mutual benefit insurance companies. A voluntary unincorporated association of employees formed for the purpose of relieving sick and aged members and the dependents of deceased members is an insurance company, whether the fund for such purpose is created wholly by membership dues or partly by contributions from the employer. A corporation which merely sets aside a fund for the insurance of its employees is not required to file a separate return for such fund, but the income therefrom shall be included in the return of the corporation.
(2) Though its name, charter powers, and subjection to State insurance laws are significant in determining the business which a corporation is authorized and intends to carry on, the character of the business actually done in the taxable year determines whether it is taxable as an insurance company under the Code. For example, during the year 1954 the M Corporation, incorporated under the insurance laws of the State of R, carried on the business of lending money in addition to guaranteeing the payment of principal and interest of mortgage loans. Of its total income for the year, one-third was derived from its insurance business of guaranteeing the payment of principal and interest of mortgage loans and two-thirds was derived from its noninsurance business of lending money. The M Corporation is not an insurance company for the year 1954 within the meaning of the Code and the regulations thereunder.
§ 1.801-2
Taxable years affected.
Section 1.801-1 is applicable only to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1953, and before January 1, 1955, and all references to sections of part I, subchapter L, chapter 1 of the Code are to the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, before amendments. Sections 1.801-3 through 1.801-6 are applicable only to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1957, and all references to sections of part I, subchapter L, chapter 1 of the Code are to the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended by the Life Insurance Company Income Tax Act of 1959 (73 Stat. 112). Section 1.801-8 is applicable only to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1961, and all references to sections of part I, subchapter L, chapter 1 of the Code are to the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended by the Life Insurance Company Income Tax Act of 1959 (73 Stat. 112) and section 3 of the Act of October 23, 1962 (76 Stat. 1134).
[T.D. 6886, 31 FR 8681, June 23, 1966, as amended by T.D. 9911, 85 FR 64392, Oct. 13, 2020]
§ 1.801-3
Definitions.
For purposes of part I, subchapter L, chapter 1 of the Code, this section defines the following terms, which are to be used in determining if a taxpayer is a life insurance company (as defined in section 801(a) and paragraph (b) of this section):
(a)
Insurance company.
(1) The term
insurance company
means a company whose primary and predominant business activity during the taxable year is the issuing of insurance or annuity contracts or the reinsuring of risks underwritten by insurance companies. Thus, though its name, charter powers, and subjection to State insurance laws are significant in determining the business which a company is authorized and intends to carry on, it is the character of the business actually done in the taxable year which determines whether a company is taxable as an insurance company under the Internal Revenue Code.
(2) Insurance companies include both stock and mutual companies, as well as mutual benefit insurance companies. For taxable years beginning before January 1, 1970, a voluntary unincorporated association of employees, including an association fulfilling the requirements of section 801(b)(2)(B) (as in effect for such years), formed for the purpose of relieving sick and aged members and the dependents of deceased members, is an insurance company, whether the fund for such purpose is created wholly by membership dues or partly by contributions from the employer. A corporation which merely sets aside a fund for the insurance of its employees is not an insurance company, and the income from such fund shall be included in the return of the corporation.
(b)
Life insurance company.
(1) The term
life insurance company,
as used in subtitle A of the Code, is defined in section 801(a). For the purpose of determining whether a company is a “life insurance company” within the meaning of that term as used in section 801(a), it must first be determined whether the company is taxable as an insurance company (as defined in paragraph (a) of this section). An insurance company shall be taxed as a life insurance company if it is engaged in the business of issuing life insurance and annuity contracts (either separately or combined with health and accident insurance), or noncancellable contracts of health and accident insurance, and its life insurance reserves (as defined in section 801(b) and § 1.801-4), plus unearned premiums, and unpaid losses (whether or not ascertained), on noncancellable life, health, or accident policies not included in life insurance reserves, comprise more than 50 percent of its total reserves (as defined in section 801(c) and § 1.801-5). For purposes of determining whether it satisfies the percentage requirements of the preceding sentence, a company shall first make any adjustments to life insurance reserves and total reserves required by section 806(a) (relating to adjustments for certain changes in reserves and assets) and then as required by section 801(d) (relating to adjustments in reserves for policy loans). For examples of the adjustments required under section 806(a), see paragraph (b)(4) of § 1.806-3. For an example of the adjustments required under section 801(d), see paragraph (c) of § 1.801-6. Furthermore, if an insurance company which computes its life insurance reserves on a preliminary term basis elects to revalue such reserves on a net level premium basis under section 818(c), such revalued basis shall be disregarded for purposes of section 801.
(2) An insurance company writing only noncancellable life, health, or accident policies and having no “life insurance reserves” may qualify as a life insurance company if its unearned premiums, and unpaid losses (whether or not ascertained), on such policies comprise more than 50 percent of its total reserves.
(3) Section 801(f) provides that a burial or funeral benefit insurance company engaged directly in the manufacture of funeral supplies or the performance of funeral services shall not be taxable under section 802 but shall be taxable under section 821 or section 831 as an insurance company other than life.
(c)
Noncancellable life, health, or accident insurance policy.
The term
noncancellable life, health, or accident insurance policy
means a health and accident contract, or a health and accident
contract combined with a life insurance or annuity contract, which the insurance company is under an obligation to renew or continue at a specified premium and with respect to which a reserve in addition to the unearned premiums (as defined in paragraph (e) of this section) must be carried to cover that obligation. Such a health and accident contract shall be considered noncancellable even though it states a termination date at a stipulated age, if, with respect to the health and accident contract, such age termination date is 60 or over. Such a contract, however, shall not be considered to be noncancellable after the age termination date stipulated in the contract has passed. However, if the age termination date stipulated in the contract occurs during the period covered by a premium received by the life insurance company prior to such date, and the company cannot cancel or modify the contract during such period, the age termination date shall be deemed to occur at the expiration of the period for which the premium has been received.
(d)
Guaranteed renewable life, health, and accident insurance policy.
The term
guaranteed renewable life, health, and accident insurance policy
means a health and accident contract, or a health and accident contract combined with a life insurance or annuity contract, which is not cancellable by the company but under which the company reserves the right to adjust premium rates by classes in accordance with its experience under the type of policy involved, and with respect to which a reserve in addition to the unearned premiums (as defined in paragraph (e) of this section) must be carried to cover that obligation. Section 801(e) provides that such policies shall be treated in the same manner as noncancellable life, health, and accident insurance policies. For example, the age termination date requirements applicable to noncancellable health and accident insurance policies shall also apply to guaranteed renewable life, health, and accident insurance policies. See paragraph (c) of this section.
(e)
Unearned premiums.
The term
unearned premiums
means those amounts which shall cover the cost of carrying the insurance risk for the period for which the premiums have been paid in advance. Such term includes all unearned premiums, whether or not required by law.
(f)
Life insurance reserves.
For the definition of the term “life insurance reserves”, see section 801(b) and § 1.801-4.
(g)
Unpaid losses (whether or not ascertained).
The term
unpaid losses (whether or not ascertained)
means a reasonable estimate of the amount of the losses (based upon the facts in each case and the company's experience with similar cases):
(1) Reported and ascertained by the end of the taxable year but where the amount of the loss has not been paid by the end of the taxable year,
(2) Reported by the end of the taxable year but where the amount thereof has not been either ascertained or paid by the end of the taxable year, or
(3) Which have occurred by the end of the taxable year but which have not been reported or paid by the end of the taxable year.
(h)
Total reserves.
For the definition of the term
total reserves,
see section 801(c) and § 1.801-5.
(i)
Amount of reserves.
For purposes of subsections (a), (b), and (c) of section 801 and this section, section 801(b)(5) provides that the amount of any reserve (or portion thereof) for any taxable year shall be the mean of such reserve (or portion thereof) at the beginning and end of the taxable year.
[T.D. 6513, 25 FR 12655, Dec. 10, 1960, as amended by T.D. 7172, 37 FR 5619, Mar. 17, 1972]
§ 1.801-4
Life insurance reserves.
(a)
Life insurance reserves defined.
For purposes of part I, subchapter L, chapter 1 of the Code, the term
life insurance reserves
(as defined in section 801(b)) means those amounts:
(1) Which are computed or estimated on the basis of recognized mortality or morbidity tables and assumed rates of interest;
(2) Which are set aside to mature or liquidate, either by payment or reinsurance, future unaccrued claims arising from life insurance, annuity, and noncancellable health and accident insurance contracts (including life insurance or annuity contracts combined
with noncancellable health and accident insurance) involving, at the time with respect to which the reserve is computed, life, health, or accident contingencies; and
(3) Which, except as otherwise provided by section 801(b)(2) and paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, are required by law. For the meaning of the term “reserves required by law”, see paragraph (b) of § 1.801-5.
For purposes of determining life insurance reserves, only those amounts shall be taken into account which must be reserved either by express statutory provisions or by rules and regulations of the insurance department of a State, Territory, or the District of Columbia when promulgated in the exercise of a power conferred by statute. Moreover, such amounts must actually be held by the company during the taxable year for which the reserve is claimed. However, reserves held by the company with respect to the net value of risks reinsured in other solvent companies (whether or not authorized) shall be deducted from the company's life insurance reserves. For example, if an ordinary life policy with a reserve of $100 is reinsured in another solvent company on a yearly renewable term basis, and the reserve on such yearly renewable term policy is $10, the reinsured company shall include $90 ($100 minus $10) in determining its life insurance reserves. Generally, life insurance reserves, as in the case of level premium life insurance, are held to supplement the future premium receipts when the latter, alone, are insufficient to cover the increased risk in the later years. For examples of reserves which qualify as life insurance reserves, see paragraph (d) of this section. For examples of reserves which do not qualify as life insurance reserves, see paragraph (e) of this section.
(b)
Certain reserves which need not be required by law.
Section 801(b)(2) sets forth certain reserves which, though not required by law, may still qualify as life insurance reserves, provided, however, that they first satisfy the requirements of section 801(b)(1) (A) and (B) and paragraph (a) (1) and (2) of this section. Thus, reserves need not be required by law:
(1) In the case of policies covering life, health, and accident insurance combined in one policy issued on the weekly premium payment plan, continuing for life and not subject to cancellation, and
(2) For taxable years beginning before January 1, 1970, in the case of policies issued by an organization which met the requirements of section 501(c)(9) (as it existed prior to amendment by the Tax Reform Act of 1969) other than the requirement of subparagraph (B) thereof.
(c)
Assessment companies.
Section 801(b)(3) provides that in the case of an assessment life insurance company or association, the term
life insurance reserves
includes:
(1) Sums actually deposited by such company or association with officers of a State or Territory pursuant to law as guaranty or reserve funds, and
(2) Any funds maintained, under the charter or articles of incorporation or association of such company or association (or bylaws approved by the State insurance commissioner) of such company or association, exclusively for the payment of claims arising under certificates of membership or policies issued upon the assessment plan and not subject to any other use.
For purposes of part I, subchapter L, chapter 1 of the Code, the reserves described in this paragraph shall be included as life insurance reserves even though such reserves do not meet the requirements of section 801(b) and paragraph (a) of this section. However, for such reserves to be included as life insurance reserves, they must be deposited or maintained to liquidate future unaccrued claims arising from life insurance, annuity, or noncancellable health and accident insurance contracts (including life insurance or annuity contracts combined with noncancellable health and accident insurance) involving, at the time with respect to which the reserve is deposited or maintained, life, health, or accident contingencies. The rate of interest assumed in calculating the reserves described in this paragraph shall be 3 percent, regardless of the rate of interest (if any) specified in the contract in respect of such reserves.
(d)
Reserves which qualify as life insurance reserves.
The following reserves, provided they meet the requirements of section 801(b) and paragraph (a) of this section, are illustrative of reserves which shall be included as life insurance reserves:
(1) Reserves held under life insurance contracts.
(2) Reserves held under annuity contracts (including reserves held under variable annuity contracts as described in section 801(g)(1)).
(3) Reserves held under noncancellable health and accident insurance contracts (as defined in paragraph (c) of § 1.801-3) and reserves held under guaranteed renewable health and accident insurance contracts (as defined in paragraph (d) of § 1.801-3).
(4) Reserves held either separately or combined under contracts described in subparagraphs (1), (2), or (3) of this paragraph.
(5) Reserves held under deposit administration contracts. Generally, the reserves held by a life insurance company on both the active and retired lives under deposit administration contracts will meet the requirements of section 801(b) and paragraph (a) of this section.
However, reserves held by the company with respect to the net value of risks reinsured in other solvent companies (whether or not authorized) shall be deducted from the company's life insurance reserves. See paragraph (a) of this section.
(e)
Reserves and liabilities which do not qualify as life insurance reserves.
The following are illustrative of reserves and liabilities which do not meet the requirements of section 801(b) and paragraph (a) of this section and, accordingly, shall not be included as life insurance reserves:
(1) Liability for supplementary contracts not involving at the time with respect to which the liability is computed, life, health, or accident contingencies.
(2) In the case of cancellable health and accident policies and similar cancellable contracts, the unearned premiums and unpaid losses (whether or not ascertained).
(3) The unearned premiums, and unpaid losses (whether or not ascertained), on noncancellable life, health, or accident policies (and guaranteed renewable life, health, and accident policies) not included in life insurance reserves. (However, such amounts shall be taken into account under section 801(a)(2) for purposes of determining whether an insurance company is a life insurance company.)
(4) The deficiency reserve (as defined in section 801(b)(4)) for each individual contract, that is, that portion of the reserve for such contract equal to the amount (if any) by which:
(i) The present value of the future net premiums required for such contract, exceeds
(ii) The present value of the future actual premiums and consideration charged for such contract.
(5) Reserves required to be maintained to provide for the ordinary operating expenses of a business which must be currently paid by every company from its income if its business is to continue, such as taxes, salaries, and unpaid brokerage.
(6) Liability for premiums received in advance.
(7) Liability for premium deposit funds.
(8) Liability for annual and deferred dividends declared or apportioned.
(9) Liability for dividends left on deposit at interest.
(10) Liability for accrued but unsettled policy claims whether known or unreported.
(11) A mandatory securities valuation reserve.
(f)
Adjustments to life insurance reserves.
In the event it is determined on the basis of the facts of a particular case that premiums deferred and uncollected and premiums due and unpaid are not properly accruable for the taxable year under section 809 and, accordingly, are not properly includible under assets (as defined in section 805(b)(4)) for the taxable year, appropriate reduction shall be made in the life insurance reserves. This reduction shall be made when the insurance company has calculated life insurance reserves on the assumption that the premiums on all policies are paid annually or that all
premiums due on or prior to the date of the annual statement have been paid.
[T.D. 6513, 25 FR 12656, Dec. 10, 1960, as amended by T.D. 7172, 37 FR 5619, Mar. 17, 1972]
§ 1.801-5
Total reserves.
(a)
Total reserves defined.
For purposes of section 801(a) and § 1.801-3, the term “total reserves” is defined in section 801(c) as the sum of:
(1) Life insurance reserves (as defined in section 801(b) and § 1.801-4),
(2) Unearned premiums (as defined in paragraph (e) of § 1.801-3), and unpaid losses (whether or not ascertained) (as defined in paragraph (g) of § 1.801-3), not included in life insurance reserves, and
(3) All other insurance reserves required by law.
The term “total reserves” does not, however, include deficiency reserves (within the meaning of section 801(b)(4), and paragraph (e)(4) of § 1.801-4), even though such deficiency reserves are required by State law. In determining total reserves, a company is permitted to make use of the highest aggregate reserve required by any State or Territory or the District of Columbia in which it transacts business, but the reserve must have been actually held during the taxable year for which the reserve is claimed. For example, during the taxable year 1958 a life insurance company sells life insurance and annuity contracts in States A and B. State A requires reserves of 10 against the life and 5 against the annuity business. State B requires reserves of 9 against the life and 7 against the annuity business. Assuming the company actually holds these reserves during the taxable year 1958, its highest aggregate reserve for such taxable year is the 16 required by State B. Thus, the company is not permitted to compute its highest aggregate reserve by taking State A's requirement of 10 against its life insurance business and adding it to State B's requirement of 7 against its annuity business.
(b)
Reserves required by law defined.
For purposes of part I, subchapter L, chapter 1 of the Code, the term
reserves required by law
means reserves which are required either by express statutory provisions or by rules and regulations of the insurance department of a State, Territory, or the District of Columbia when promulgated in the exercise of a power conferred by statute, and which are reported in the annual statement of the company and accepted by state regulatory authorities as held for the fulfillment of the claims of policyholders or beneficiaries.
(c) [Reserved]
(d)
Illustration of principles.
The provisions of section 801 relating to the percentage requirements for qualification as a life insurance company may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
The books of Y, an insurance company, selling life insurance, noncancellable health and accident insurance, and cancellable accident and health insurance, reflect (after adjustment under sections 806(a) and 801(d)) the following facts for the taxable year 1958:
Jan. 1
Dec. 31
Mean of year
1. Life insurance reserves
$3,000
$5,000
$4,000
2. Unearned premiums, and unpaid losses (whether or not ascertained), on noncancellable accident and health insurance not included in life insurance reserves
400
600
500
3. Unearned premiums, and unpaid losses (whether or not ascertained), on cancellable accident and health insurance
1,800
2,200
2,000
4. All other insurance reserves required by law
900
1,100
1,000
5. Total reserves
7,500
The rules provided by section 801 require that the sum of the mean of the year figures in items 1 and 2 comprise more than 50 percent of the mean of the year figure in item 5 for an insurance company to qualify as a life insurance company. Thus, Y would qualify as a life insurance company for the taxable year 1958 as the sum of the mean of the year figures in items 1 and 2 ($4,500) comprise 60 percent of the mean of the year figure in item 5 ($7,500).

§ 1.801-6
Adjustments in reserves for policy loans.
(a)
In general.
Section 801(d) provides that for purposes only of determining whether or not an insurance company is a life insurance company (as defined in section 801(a) and paragraph (b) of § 1.801-3), the life insurance reserves (as
defined in section 801(b) and § 1.801-4), and the total reserves (as defined in section 801(c) and paragraph (a) of § 1.801-5), shall each be reduced by an amount equal to the mean of the aggregates, at the beginning and end of the taxable year, of the policy loans outstanding with respect to contracts for which life insurance reserves are maintained. Such reduction shall be made after any adjustments required under section 806(a) and § 1.806-3 have been made.
(b)
Policy loans defined.
The term
policy loans
includes loans made by the insurance company, by whatever name called, for which the reserve on a contract is the collateral.
(c)
Illustration of principles.
The provisions of section 801(d) and this section may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
The books of T, an insurance company, selling only life insurance and cancellable accident and health insurance, reflect (after adjustment under section 806 (a)) the following facts for the taxable year 1958:
Jan. 1
Dec. 31
Mean of year
1. Life insurance reserves
$1,000
$2,000
$1,500
2. Policy loans
50
850
450
3. Life insurance reserves less policy loans
1,050
4. Unearned premiums, and unpaid losses (whether or not ascertained), on cancellable accident and health insurance
900
1,600
1,250
5. Total reserves adjusted for policy loans (item 3 plus item 4)
2,300
As the rules provided by section 801 (a) and (d) require that the figure in item 3 ($1,050) be more than 50 percent of the mean of the year figure in item 5 ($2,300) for an insurance company to qualify as a life insurance company, T would not qualify as a life insurance company for the taxable year 1958.

§ 1.801-7
[Reserved]
§ 1.801-8
Contracts with reserves based on segregated asset accounts.
(a)
Definitions
—(1)
Annuity contracts include variable annuity contracts.
Section 801(g)(1)(A) provides that for purposes of part I, subchapter L, chapter 1 of the Code, an annuity contract includes a contract which provides for the payment of a variable annuity computed on the basis of recognized mortality tables and the investment experience of the company issuing such a contract. A variable annuity differs from the ordinary or fixed dollar annuity in that the annuity benefits payable under a variable annuity contract vary with the insurance company's investment experience with respect to such contracts while the annuity benefits paid under a fixed dollar annuity contract are guaranteed irrespective of the company's actual investment earnings.
(2)
Contracts with reserves based on a segregated asset account.
(i) For purposes of part I, section 801(g)(1)(B) defines the term
contract with reserves based on a segregated asset account
as a contract (individual or group):
(
a
) Which provides for the allocation of all or part of the amounts received under the contract to an account which, pursuant to State law or regulation, is segregated from the general asset accounts of the company,
(
b
) Which provides for the payment of annuities, and
(
c
) Under which the amounts paid in, or the amount paid as annuities, reflect the investment return and the market value of the segregated asset account.
(ii) The term
contract with reserves based on a segregated asset account
includes a contract such as a variable annuity contract, which reflects the investment return and the market value of the segregated asset account, even though such contract provides for the payment of an annuity computed on the basis of recognized mortality tables, but the term includes such contract only for the period during which it satisfies the requirements of section 801(g)(1)(B) and subdivision (i) of this subparagraph. However, such term does not include a pension contract written on the basis of the so-called new-money concept. Thus, for example, such term does not include a pension contract whereby reserves are credited on the basis of the company's new high yield investments. Furthermore, such term does not include a contract which during the taxable year contains a right to participate in the divisible surplus of
the company where such right merely reflects the company's investment return. Nevertheless, the term does include a contract which meets the requirements of section 801(g)(1)(B) and of this subparagraph even if part of the amounts received are, for example, allocated to reserves under provisions of the contract which are written on the basis of the new-money concept. However, such reserves do not qualify as a segregated asset account referred to in section 801(g) and this section.
(iii) If at any time during the taxable year a contract otherwise satisfying the requirements of section 801(g)(1)(B) and subdivision (i) of this subparagraph ceases to reflect current investment return and current market value, such contract shall not be considered as meeting the requirements of section 801(g)(1)(B)(iii) and subdivision (i)(
c
) of this subparagraph after such cessation. Thus, a contract with reserves based on a segregated asset account includes a contract under which the reflection of investment return and market value terminates at the beginning of the annuity payments, but only for the period prior to such termination. For example, if the purchaser of a variable annuity contract which meets such requirements elects an option which provides for the payment of a fixed dollar annuity, then such contract shall be considered as satisfying such requirements only for the period prior to the time such contract ceases to reflect current investment return and current market value. Furthermore, a group annuity contract which satisfies the requirements of section 801(g)(1)(B) and subdivision (i) of this subparagraph shall be considered as continuing to meet such requirements even though a certificate holder under the group contract elects an option which provides for the payment of a fixed dollar annuity. However, the annuity attributable to such certificate holder shall not be considered as satisfying such requirements as of the time such annuity ceases to reflect current investment return and current market value. On the other hand, a group annuity contract which does not reflect current market value shall not be considered as satisfying such requirements even though a certificate holder under the group contract elects an option which provides for the payment of a variable annuity. However, the variable annuity attributable to such certificate holder shall be considered as satisfying such requirements as of the time such variable annuity commences to reflect current investment return and current market value.
(b)
Life insurance reserves.
Section 801(g)(2) provides that for purposes of section 801(b)(1)(A), the reflection of the investment return and the market value of the segregated asset account shall be considered an assumed rate of interest. Thus, the reserves held with respect to contracts described in section 801(g)(1) and paragraph (a) of this section shall qualify as life insurance reserves within the meaning of section 801(b)(1) and paragraph (a) of § 1.801-4 provided such reserves are required by law (as defined in paragraph (b) of § 1.801-5) and are set aside to mature or liquidate, either by payment or reinsurance, future unaccrued claims arising from such contracts with reserves based on segregated asset accounts involving, at the time with respect to which the reserve is computed, life, health, or accident contingencies. Accordingly, a company issuing contracts with reserves based on segregated asset accounts shall qualify as a life insurance company for Federal income tax purposes if it satisfies the requirements of section 801(a) (relating to the definition of a life insurance company) and paragraph (b) of § 1.801-3.
(c)
Separate accounting.
(1) For purposes of part I, section 801(g)(3) provides that a life insurance company (as defined in section 801(a) and paragraph (b) of § 1.801-3) which issues contracts with reserves based on segregated asset accounts (as defined in section 801 (g)(1)(B) and paragraph (a)(2) of this section) shall separately account for each and every income, exclusion, deduction, asset, reserve, and other liability item which is properly attributable to such segregated asset accounts. In those cases where such items are not directly accounted for, separate accounting shall be made:
(i) According to the method regularly employed by the company, if such method is reasonable, and
(ii) In all other cases in a manner which, in the opinion of the district director, is reasonable.
A method of separate accounting for such items as are not accounted for directly will be deemed “regularly employed” by a life insurance company if the method was consistently followed in prior taxable years, or if, in the case of a company which has never before issued contracts with reserves based on segregated asset accounts, the company initiates in the first taxable year for which it issues such contracts a reasonable method of separate accounting for such items and consistently follows such method thereafter. Ordinarily, a company regularly employs a method of accounting in accordance with the statute of the State, Territory, or the District of Columbia, in which it operates.
(2) Every life insurance company issuing contracts with reserves based on segregated asset accounts shall keep such permanent records and other data relating to such contracts as is necessary to enable the district director to determine the correctness of the application of the rules prescribed in section 301(g) and this section and to ascertain the accuracy of the computations involved.
(d)
Investment yield.
(1) For purposes of part I, section 801(g)(4)(A) provides that the policy and other contract liability requirements (as determined under section 805), and the life insurance company's share of investment yield (as determined under sections 804(a) or 809(b)), shall be separately computed:
(i) With respect to the items separately accounted for in accordance with section 801(g)(3) and paragraph (c) of this section, and
(ii) Excluding the items taken into account under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph.
Thus, for purposes of determining both taxable investment income and gain or loss from operations, a life insurance company shall separately compute the life insurance company's share of the investment yield on the assets in its segregated asset account without regard to the policy and other contract liability requirements of, and the investment income attributable to, contracts with reserves that are not based on the segregated asset account. Such separate computations shall be made after any allocation required under section 801(g)(4)(B) and subparagraph (2) of this paragraph.
(2)(i) Section 801(g)(4)(B) provides that if the net short-term capital gain (as defined in section 1222(5)) exceeds the net long-term capital loss (as defined in section 1222(8)), determined without regard to any separate computations under section 801(g)(4)(A) and subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, then such excess shall be allocated between section 801(g)(4)(A) (i) and (ii) and subparagraph (1) (i) and (ii) of this paragraph. Such allocation shall be in proportion to the respective contributions to such excess of the items taken into account under each such section and subparagraph. The allocation under this subparagraph shall be made before the separate computations prescribed by section 801(g)(4)(A) and subparagraph (1) of this paragraph.
(ii) The operation of the allocation required under section 801(g)(4)(B) and subdivision (i) of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
For the taxable year 1962, T, a life insurance company which issues regular life insurance and annuity contracts and contracts with reserves based on segregated asset accounts, had (without regard to section 801(g)(4)(A)) realized short-term capital gains of $10,000 and short-term capital losses of $10,000 attributable to its general asset accounts and realized short-term capital gains of $12,000 attributable to its segregated asset accounts. For the taxable year 1962, the excess of the net short-term capital gain ($10,000 + $12,000−$10,000, or $12,000) over the net long-term capital loss (0) was $12,000. Of the excess of $12,000, 100 percent was contributed by the segregated asset accounts. Applying the provisions of section 801(g)(4)(B), T would allocate the entire $12,000 to its segregated asset accounts for such taxable year.

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in example 1 except that for the taxable year 1962, T had (without regard to section 801(g)(4)(A)) realized short-term capital losses of $8,000 attributable to its general asset accounts and realized long-term capital gains of $1,000 and long-term capital losses of $5,000 attributable to its segregated asset accounts. For the taxable year 1962, the excess of the net short-term capital gain ($10,000 + $12,000−$8,000, or $14,000) over the net long-term capital loss ($5,000−$1,000, or $4,000) was $10,000. Of the
excess of $10,000, the general asset accounts contributed 20 percent ($2,000 ($10,000−$8,000) ÷ $10,000) and the segregated asset accounts contributed 80 percent ($8,000 ($12,000−$4,000) ÷ $10,000). Applying the provisions of section 801(g)(4)(B), T would allocate $2,000 ($10,000 × 20 percent) to its general asset accounts and $8,000 ($10,000 × 80 percent) to its segregated asset accounts for such taxable year.

# Example 3.
W is a life insurance company which issues regular life insurance and annuity contracts and contracts with reserves based on either of two segregated asset accounts, Separate Account C or Separate Account D. For the taxable year 1962, W had (without regard to section 801(g)(4)(A)) realized short-term capital gains of $16,000 and long-term capital losses of $15,000 attributable to its general asset accounts, long-term capital gains of $12,000 and short-term capital losses of $6,000 attributable to Separate Account C and long-term capital gains of $7,000 and short-term capital losses of $5,000 attributable to Separate Account D. For the taxable year 1962, the excess of the net short-term capital gain ($16,000−$6,000−$5,000) over the net long-term capital loss (0) was $5,000. Of the $5,000 excess, 20 percent ($16,000−$15,000 ÷ $5,000) was contributed by the general asset accounts, leaving 80 percent as the amount contributed by the segregated asset accounts. Applying the provisions of section 801(g)(4)(B) W would allocate $1,000 (20 percent of $5,000) to the general asset accounts, leaving $4,000 (80 percent of $5,000) to be allocated among the segregated asset accounts, Separate Account C and Separate Account D. W would allocate $3,000 of the $4,000 to Separate Account C computed as follows:
EC14NO91.135
W would allocate $1,000 of the $4,000 to Separate Account D computed as follows:
EC14NO91.136

(f)
Increases and decreases in reserves.
(1) Section 801(g)(6) provides that for purposes of section 810 (a) and (b) (relating to adjustments for increases or decreases in certain reserves), the sum of the items described in section 810(c) and paragraph (b) of § 1.810-2 taken into account as of the close of the taxable year shall be adjusted:
(i) By subtracting therefrom the sum of any amounts added from time to time (for the taxable year) to the reserves separately accounted for in accordance with section 801(g)(3) and paragraph (c) of this section by reason of realized or unrealized appreciation in value of the assets held in relation thereto, and
(ii) By adding thereto the sum of any amounts subtracted from time to time (for the taxable year) from such reserves by reason of realized or unrealized depreciation in the value of such assets.
(2) The provisions of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
Company M, a life insurance company issuing only contracts with reserves based on segregated asset accounts as defined in section 801(g)(1)(B) and paragraph (a)(2) of this section (other than contracts described in section 805(d)(1) (A), (B), (C), or (D)), increased its life insurance reserves held with respect to such contracts during the taxable year 1962 by $275,000. Of the total increase in the reserves, $100,000 was attributable to premium receipts, $50,000 to dividends and interest, $100,000 to unrealized appreciation in the value of the assets held in relation to such reserves, and $25,000 to realized capital gains on the sale of such assets. As of the close of the taxable year 1962, the reserves held by company M with respect to all such contracts amounted to $1,275,000. However, under section 801(g)(6) and this subparagraph, this amount must be reduced by the $100,000 unrealized asset value appreciation and the $25,000 of realized capital gains. Accordingly, for purposes of section 810(a) and (b), the amount of these reserves which is to be taken into account as of the close of the taxable year 1962 under section 810(c) is $1,150,000 ($1,275,000 less $125,000). However, for purposes of section 810 (a) and (b), the amount of these reserves which is to be taken into account as of the beginning of the taxable year 1963 under section 810(c) is $1,275,000 (the amount as of the close of the taxable year 1962 before reduction of $125,000 for unrealized appreciation and realized capital gains).
(3)(i) Under section 801(g)(6), the deduction allowable for items described in section 809(d) (1) and (7) (relating to death benefits and assumption reinsurance, respectively) with respect to segregated asset accounts shall be reduced to the extent that the amount of such items is increased for the taxable year by appreciation (or shall be increased to the extent that the amount of such items is decreased for the taxable year
by depreciation) not reflected in adjustments required to be made under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph.
(ii) The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
On June 30, 1962, X, a life insurance company, reinsured a portion of its insurance contracts with reserves based on segregated asset accounts with Y, a life insurance company, under an agreement whereby Y agreed to assume and become solely liable under the contracts reinsured. The reserves on the contracts reinsured by X were $90,000, of which $10,000 was attributable to unrealized appreciation in the value of the assets held in relation to such reserves. However, no amounts had been added to the reserves by reason of the unrealized appreciation of $10,000 and consequently, the $10,000 was not reflected in adjustments to reserves under section 809(g)(6) or subparagraph (1) of this paragraph. Under the reinsurance agreement, X made a payment of $90,000 in cash to Y for assuming such contracts. Applying the provisions of section 809(d)(7), and assuming no other such reinsurance transactions by X during the taxable year, X would have an allowable deduction of $90,000 as a result of this payment on June 30, 1962. However, applying the provisions of section 801(g)(6) and this subparagraph, the actual deduction allowed would be $80,000 ($90,000 less $10,000). See section 806 (a) and § 1.806-3 for the adjustments in reserves and assets to be made by X and Y as a result of this transaction. For the treatment by Y of this $90,000 payment, see section 809(c)(1) and paragraph (a)(1)(i) of § 1.809-4.
(g)
Basis of assets held for certain pension plan contracts.
Section 801(g)(7) provides that in the case of contracts described in section 805(d)(1) (A), (B), (C), (D), or (E) (relating to the definition of pension plan reserves), the basis of each asset in a segregated asset account shall (in addition to all other adjustments to basis) be (i) increased by the amount of any appreciation in value, and (ii) decreased by the amount of any depreciation in value; but only to the extent that such appreciation and depreciation are reflected in the increases and decreases in reserves, or other items described in section 801(g)(6), with respect to such contracts. Thus, there shall be no capital gains tax payable by a life insurance company on appreciation realized on assets in a segregated asset account to the extent such appreciation has been reflected in reserves, or other items described in section 801(g)(6), for contracts described in section 805(d)(1) (A), (B), (C), (D), or (E) based on segregated asset accounts.
(h)
Additional separate computation
—(1)
Assets and total insurance liabilities.
A life insurance company which issues contracts with reserves based on segregated asset accounts (as defined in section 801(g)(1)(B) and paragraph (a)(2) of this section) shall separately compute and report with its return the assets and total insurance liabilities which are properly attributable to all of such segregated asset accounts. Each foreign corporation carrying on a life insurance business which issues such contracts shall separately compute and report with its return assets held in the United States and total insurance liabilities on United States business which are properly attributable to all of such segregated asset accounts.
(2)
Foreign life insurance companies.
For adjustment under section 819 in the case of a foreign life insurance company which issues contracts based on segregated asset accounts under section 801(g), see § 1.819-2(b)(4).

[Reserved]
§ 1.802-3
Tax imposed on life insurance companies.
(a)
In general.
For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1957, section 802(a)(1) imposes a tax on the life insurance company taxable income (as defined in section 802(b) of every life insurance company (including a foreign life insurance company carrying on a life insurance business within the United States if with respect to its United States business it would qualify as a life insurance company under section 801(a)). The tax imposed by section 802(a)(1) is payable upon the basis of returns rendered by the life insurance companies liable thereto. See subchapter A, chapter 61 (section 6001 and following) of the Code.
(b)
Tax imposed.
The tax imposed by section 802(a)(1) consists of a normal
tax and a surtax computed as provided in section 11 as though the life insurance company taxable income (as defined in section 802(b)) were the taxable income referred to in section 11.
(c)
Normal tax.
The normal tax is computed by applying to the life insurance company taxable income the regular corporate normal tax rate (as in effect for the taxable year) provided by section 11(b).
(d)
Surtax.
The surtax is computed by applying the regular corporate surtax rate (as in effect for the taxable year) provided by section 11(c) to the amount by which the life insurance company taxable income exceeds the surtax exemption for the taxable year as determined under section 11(d). See sections 269 and 1551 and the regulations thereunder, for certain circumstances in which the surtax exemption may be disallowed in whole or in part.
(e)
Special rule for 1959 and 1960.
See section 802(a)(3) for a transitional rule applicable in certain cases in determining tax liability for the taxable years 1959 and 1960 by reason of the operation of section 802(b)(3).
(f)
Tax imposed in case of certain capital gains
—(1)
Taxable years beginning after December 31, 1958, and before January 1, 1962.
For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1958, and before January 1, 1962, if the net long-term capital gain (as defined in section 1222(7)) of any life insurance company exceeds its net short-term capital loss (as defined in section 1222(6)), section 802(a)(2) imposes a separate tax equal to 25 percent of such excess. This separate 25 percent tax rate applies whether or not there is life insurance company taxable income, taxable investment income, or a gain or loss from operations for the taxable year. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1958, and before January 1, 1962, only the excess (if any) of net short-term capital gain (as defined in section 1222(5)) over net long-term capital loss (as defined in section 1222(8)) shall be taken into account in computing taxable investment income and gain or loss from operations. See sections 804(b) and 809(b). Except as modified by section 817 (rules relating to certain gains and losses), the general rules of the Code relating to gains and losses (such as the rules for determining the amount, characterization, and treatment thereof) shall apply with respect to life insurance companies.
(2)
Alternative tax in case of capital gains for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1961.
For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1961, if the net long-term capital gain (as defined in section 1222(7)) of any life insurance company exceeds its net short-term capital loss (as defined in section 1222(6)), section 802(a)(2) imposes an alternative tax in lieu of the tax imposed by section 802(a)(1), if and only if such alternative tax is less than the tax imposed by section 802(a)(1). The alternative tax is the sum of:
(i) A partial tax, computed as provided by section 802(a)(1), on the life insurance company taxable income determined by reducing the taxable investment income, and the gain from operations, by the amount of the excess of its net long-term capital gain over its net short-term capital loss, and
(ii)(
a
) In the case of a taxable year beginning before January 1, 1970, an amount equal to 25 percent of such excess, or
(
b
) In the case of a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1969, an amount determined as provided in section 1201(a) and paragraph (a)(3) of § 1.1201-1 on such excess.
In the computation of the partial tax, the deductions provided by sections 170 (as modified by section 809(a)(3)), 243, 244, 245 (as modified by sections 804 (a)(5) and 809(d)(8)(B)), and the limitation provided by section 809(f), shall not be recomputed as a result of the reduction of taxable investment income, and gain from operations, by the amount of such excess. Except as modified by section 817 (rules relating to certain gains and losses), the general rules of the Code relating to gains and losses (such as the rules for determining the amount, characterization and treatment thereof) shall apply with respect to life insurance companies.
(g)
Foreign life insurance companies.
Foreign life insurance companies not carrying on an insurance business within the United States are not taxable under section 802, but are taxable
as other foreign corporations. See section 881.
(h)
Assessment and collection of tax imposed.
All provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and of the regulations in this part not inconsistent with the specific provisions of sections 801 to 820, inclusive, are applicable to the assessment and collection of the tax imposed by section 802(a), and life insurance companies are subject to the same penalties as are provided in the case of returns and payment of income tax by other corporations. The return shall be on Form 1120L.
(i)
Illustration of principles.
The provisions of section 802(a), other than paragraph (3) thereof, and this section may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
For the taxable year 1959, T, a life insurance company, has life insurance company taxable income of $300,000 (including $25,000 of net short-term capital gain) and $80,000 of net long-term capital gain. The tax of T under section 802(a) for 1959 is $170,500 ($90,000 normal tax, $60,500 surtax, and $20,000 capital gains tax) computed as follows:

§ 1.804-3
Gross investment income of a life insurance company.
(a)
Gross investment income defined.
For purposes of part I, subchapter L, chapter 1 of the Code, section 804(b) defines the term
gross investment income
of a life insurance company as the sum of the following:
(1) The gross amount of income from:
(i) Interest (including tax-exempt interest and partially tax-exempt interest), as described in § 1.61-7. Interest shall be adjusted for amortization of premium and accrual of discount in accordance with the rules prescribed in section 818(b) and the regulations thereunder.
(ii) Dividends, as described in § 1.61-9.
(iii) Rents and royalties, as described in § 1.61-8.
(iv) The entering into of any lease, mortgage, or other instrument or agreement from which the life insurance company may derive interest, rents, or royalties.
(v) The alteration or termination of any instrument or agreement described in subdivision (iv) of this subparagraph.
For example, gross investment income includes amounts received as commitment fees, as a bonus for the entering into of a lease, or as a penalty for the early payment of a mortgage.
(2) In the case of a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1958, the amount (if any) by which the net short-term capital gain (as defined in section 1222(5)) exceeds the net long-term capital loss (as defined in section 1222(8)), and
(3) The gross income from any trade or business (other than an insurance business) carried on by the life insurance company, or by a partnership of which the life insurance company is a partner.
(b)
No double inclusion of income.
In computing the gross income from any trade or business (other than an insurance business) carried on by the life insurance company, or by a partnership of which the life insurance company is a partner, any item described in section 804(b)(1) and paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall not be considered as gross income arising from the conduct
of such trade or business or partnership, but shall be taken into account under section 804(b)(1) and paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
(c)
Exclusion of net long-term capital gains.
Any net long-term capital gains from the sale or exchange of a capital asset (or any gain considered to be from the sale or exchange of a capital asset under applicable law) shall be excluded from the gross investment income of a life insurance company. However, section 804(b)(2) and paragraph (a)(2) of this section provide that the amount (if any) by which the net short-term capital gain exceeds the net long-term capital loss shall be included in the gross investment income of a life insurance company.
[T.D. 6513, 25 FR 12661, Dec. 10, 1960]
§ 1.804-4
Investment yield of a life insurance company.
(a)
Investment yield defined.
Section 804(c) defines the term “investment yield” of a life insurance company for purposes of part I, subchapter L, chapter 1 of the Code. Investment yield means gross investment income (as defined in section 804(b) and paragraph (a) of § 1.804-3), less the deductions provided in section 804(c) and paragraph (b) of this section for investment expenses, real estate expenses, depreciation, depletion, and trade or business (other than an insurance business) expenses. However, such expenses are deductible only to the extent that they relate to investment income and the deduction of such expenses is not disallowed by any other provision of subtitle A of the Code. For example, investment expenses are not allowable unless they are ordinary and necessary expenses within the meaning of section 162, and under section 265, no deduction is allowable for interest on indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or carry obligations the interest on which is wholly exempt from taxation under chapter 1 of the Code. A deduction shall not be permitted with respect to the same item more than once.
(b)
Deductions from gross investment income
—(1)
Investment expenses.
(i) Section 804(c)(1) provides for the deduction of investment expenses by a life insurance company in determining investment yield. “Investment expenses” are those expenses of the taxable year which are fairly chargeable against gross investment income. For example, investment expenses include salaries and expenses paid exclusively for work in looking after investments, and amounts expended for printing, stationery, postage, and stenographic work incident to the collection of interest. An itemized schedule of such expenses shall be attached to the return.
(ii) Any assignment of general expenses to the investment department of a life insurance company for which a deduction is claimed under section 804(c)(1) subjects the entire deduction for investment expenses to the limitation provided in that section and subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph. As used in section 804(c)(1), the term
general expenses
means any expense paid or incurred for the benefit of more than one department of the company rather than for the benefit of a particular department thereof. For example, if real estate taxes, depreciation, or other expenses attributable to office space owned by the company and utilized by it in connection with its investment function are assigned to investment expenses, such items shall be deductible as general expenses assigned to or included in investment expenses and as such shall be subject to the limitation of section 804(c)(1) and subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph. Similarly, if an expense, such as a salary, is attributable to more than one department, including the investment department, such expense may be properly allocated among these departments. If such expenses are allocated, the amount properly allocable to the investment department shall be deductible as general expenses assigned to or included in investment expenses and as such shall be subject to the limitation of section 804(c)(1) and subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph. If general expenses are in part assigned to or included in investment expenses, the maximum allowance (as determined under section 804(c)(1)) shall not be granted unless it is shown to the satisfaction of the district director that such allowance is justified by a reasonable assignment of actual expenses. The accounting procedure employed is not conclusive as to whether any assignment has in fact
been made. Investment expenses do not include Federal income and excess profits taxes, if any. In cases where the investment expenses allowable as deductions under section 804(c)(1) exceed the limitation contained therein, see section 809(d)(9).
(iii) If any general expenses are in part assigned to or included in investment expenses, the total deduction under section 804(c)(1) shall not exceed the sum of:
(
a
) One-fourth of one percent of the mean of the assets (as defined in section 805(b)(4) and paragraph (a)(4) of § 1.805-5) held at the beginning and end of the taxable year,
(
b
) The amount of the mortgage service fees for the taxable year, plus
(
c
) Whichever of the following is the greater:
(
1
) One-fourth of the amount by which the investment yield (computed without any deduction for investment expenses allowed by section 804(c)(1)) exceeds 3
3/4
percent of the mean of the assets (as defined in section 805(b)(4)) held at the beginning and end of the taxable year, reduced by the amount of the mortgage service fees for the taxable year, or
(
2
) One-fourth of one percent of the mean of the value of mortgages held at the beginning and end of the taxable year for which there are no mortgage service fees for the taxable year. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term
mortgages held
refers to mortgages, and other similar liens, on real property which are held by the company as security for “mortgage loans”.
For purposes of section 804(c)(1)(B) and (C)(i) and (
b
) and (
c
)(
1
) of this subdivision, the term
mortgage service fees
includes mortgage origination fees. Such mortgage origination fees shall be amortized in accordance with the rules prescribed in section 818(b) and the regulations thereunder.
(iv) The operation of the limitation contained in section 804(c)(1) and subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
The books of S, a life insurance company, reflect the following items for the taxable year 1958:
Investment expenses (including general expenses assigned to or included in investment expenses)
$125,000
Mean of the assets held at the beginning and end of the taxable year
20,000,000
Mortgage service fees
25,000
Investment yield computed without regard to investment expenses
1,200,000
Mean of the value of mortgages held at the beginning and end of the taxable year for which there are no mortgage service fees
6,000,000
In order to determine the limitation on investment expenses, S would make up the following schedule:
1. Mean of the assets held at the beginning and end of the taxable year
$20,000,000
2. One-fourth of 1 percent of item 1 (1/4 of 1% of $20,000,000)
50,000
3. Mortgage service fees
25,000
4. The greater of (a) or (b):
(a)(i) Investment yield computed without regard to investment expenses
$1,200,000
(ii) Three and three-fourths percent of item 1 (3
3/4
% × $20,000,000)
750,000
(iii) Excess of (i) over (ii) ($1,200,000 minus $750,000)
450,000
(iv) One-fourth of (iii) (1/4 × $450,000)
112,500
(v) Less: Mortgage service fees (item 3)
25,00
(vi) Excess of (iv) over (v) ($112,500 minus $25,000)
87,500
(b) One-fourth of 1 percent of the mean of the value of mortgages held at the beginning and end of the taxable year for which there are no mortgage service fees (1/4 of
1% × $6,000,000)
15,000
5. The greater of item 4 (a) or (b)
87,500
6. Limitation on investment expenses (items 2, 3, and 4(a))
162,500
As the investment expenses (including general expenses assigned to or included in investment expenses) of S for the taxable year 1958 ($125,000) do not exceed the limitation on such expenses ($162,500), S would be entitled to deduct the entire $125,000 under section 804(c)(1).
(2)
Real estate expenses and taxes.
The deduction for expenses and taxes under section 804(c)(2) includes taxes (as defined in section 164) and other expenses for the taxable year exclusively on or with respect to real estate owned by the company. For example, no deduction shall be allowed under section 804(c)(2) for amounts allowed as a deduction under section 164(e) (relating to taxes of shareholders paid by a corporation). No deduction shall be allowed under section 804(c)(2) for any
amount paid out for new buildings, or for permanent improvements or betterments made to increase the value of any property. An itemized schedule of such taxes and expenses shall be attached to the return. See subparagraph (4) of this paragraph for limitation of such deduction.
(3)
Depreciation.
The deduction allowed for depreciation is, except as provided in section 804(c)(3) and subparagraph (4) of this paragraph, identical to that allowed other corporations by section 167. Such amount allowed as a deduction from gross investment income in determining investment yield is limited to depreciation sustained on the property used, and to the extent used, for the purpose of producing the income specified in section 804(b). An election with respect to any of the methods of depreciation provided in section 167 shall not be affected in any way by the enactment of the Life Insurance Company Income Tax Act of 1959 (73 Stat. 112). However, in appropriate cases, the method of depreciation may be changed with the consent of the Commissioner. See section 167(e) and § 1.167(e)-1. See subparagraph (4) of this paragraph for limitation of such deduction. See section 809(d)(12) and the regulations thereunder for the treatment of depreciable property used in the operation of a life insurance business.
(4)
Limitation on deductions allowable under section 804 (c)(2) and (c)(3).
Section 804(c)(3) provides that the amount allowable as a deduction for taxes, expenses, and depreciation on or with respect to any real estate owned and occupied for insurance purposes in whole or in part by a life insurance company shall be limited to an amount which bears the same ratio to such deduction (computed without regard to this limitation) as the rental value of the space not so occupied bears to the rental value of the entire property. For example, T, a life insurance company, owns a twenty-story downtown home office building. The rental value of each floor of the building is identical. T rents nine floors to various tenants, one floor is utilized by it in operating its investment department, and the remaining ten floors are occupied by it in carrying on its insurance business. Since floor space equivalent to eleven-twentieths, or 55 percent, of the rental value of the entire property is owned and occupied for insurance purposes by the company, the deductions allowable under section 804(c)(2) and (3) for taxes, depreciation, and other real estate expenses shall be limited to nine-twentieths, or 45 percent, of the taxes, depreciation, and other real estate expenses on account of the entire property. However, the portion of such allowable deductions attributable to the operation of the investment department (one-twentieth, or 5 percent) may be deductible as general expenses assigned to or included in investment expenses and as such shall be subject to the limitations of section 804(c)(1). Where a deduction is claimed as provided in this section, the parts of the property occupied and the parts not occupied by the company in carrying on its insurance business, together with the respective rental values thereof, must be shown in a schedule accompanying the return.
(5)
Depletion.
The deduction for depletion (and depreciation) provided in section 804(c)(4) is identical to that allowed other corporations by section 611. The amount allowed by section 611 in the case of a life insurance company is limited to depletion (and depreciation) sustained on the property used, and to the extent used, for the purpose of producing the income specified in section 804(b). See section 611 and § 1.611-5 for special rules relating to the depreciation of improvements in the case of mines, oil and gas wells, other natural deposits, and timber.
(6)
Trade or business deductions.
(i) Under section 804(c)(5), the deductions allowed by subtitle A of the Code (without regard to this part) which are attributable to any trade or business (other than an insurance business) carried on by the life insurance company, or by a partnership of which the life insurance company is a partner are, subject to the limitations in subdivisions (ii), (iii), and (iv) of this subparagraph, allowable as deductions from the gross investment income of a life insurance company in determining its investment yield. Such deductions are allowable, however, only to the extent that they are attributable to the production of
income which is included in the life insurance company's gross investment income by reason of section 804(b)(3). However, since any interest, dividends, rents, and royalties received by any trade or business (other than an insurance business) carried on by the life insurance company, or by a partnership of which the life insurance company is a partner, is included in the life insurance company's gross investment income by reason of section 804(b)(1) and paragraph (b) of § 1.804-3, any expenses fairly chargeable against the production of such income may be deductible under section 804(c) (1), (2), (3), or (4). The allowable deductions may exceed the gross income from such business.
(ii) In computing the deductions under section 804(c)(5), there shall be excluded losses:
(
a
) From (or considered as from) sales or exchanges of capital assets,
(
b
) From sales or exchanges of property used in the trade or business (as defined in section 1231(b)), and
(
c
) From the compulsory or involuntary conversion (as a result of destruction, in whole or in part, theft or seizure, or an exercise of the power of requisition or condemnation or the threat or imminence thereof) of property used in the trade or business (as so defined).
(iii) Any item, to the extent attributable to the carrying on of the insurance business, shall not be taken into account. For example, if a life insurance company operates a radio station primarily to advertise its own insurance services, a portion of the expenses of the radio station shall not be allowed as a deduction. The portion disallowed shall be an amount which bears the same ratio to the total expenses of the station as the value of advertising furnished to the insurance company bears to the total value of services rendered by the station.
(iv) The deduction for net operating losses provided in section 172, and the special deductions for corporations provided in part VIII, subchapter B, chapter 1 of the Code, shall not be allowed.

§§ 1.806-1—1.806-2
[Reserved]
§ 1.806-3
Certain changes in reserves and assets.
(a)
In general.
For purposes of part I, subchapter L, chapter 1 of the Code, section 806(a) provides that if there is a change in life insurance reserves (as defined in section 801(b)), during the taxable year, which is attributable to the transfer between the taxpayer and another person of liabilities under contracts taken into account in computing such life insurance reserves, then the means of such reserves, and the mean of the assets, shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect the amounts involved in such transfer. For example, the adjustments required under section 806(a) are applicable to transfers in which one life insurance company purchases or acquires a part or all of the business of another life insurance company under an arrangement whereby the purchaser or transferee becomes solely liable on the contracts transferred. This provision shall apply in the case of assumption reinsurance but not in the case of indemnity reinsurance or reinsurance ceded. Thus, no adjustments shall be required under section 806(a) when, in the ordinary course of business, an indemnity reinsurance contract is entered into with another company (on a yearly renewable term basis, on a coinsurance basis, or otherwise) whereby there is a sharing of risks under one or more individual contracts. It will be necessary for each life insurance company participating in a transfer described in section 806(a) to make the adjustments required by such section. Such adjustments shall be made without regard to whether or not the transferor of the liabilities was the original insurer.
(b)
Manner in which adjustments shall be made
—(1)
Daily basis.
The means of the life insurance reserves, and the mean of the assets, shall be appropriately adjusted, on a daily basis, to reflect the amounts involved in a transfer described in section 806(a) and paragraph (a) of this section. The transferor and the transferee shall be treated as having held such life insurance reserves and assets for a fraction of the year in which the transfer occurs.
(2)
Determination of period held.
In determining the fraction which represents the fractional year that such reserves and assets were held, the numerator shall be the number of days during the taxable year which such reserves and assets were actually held, and the denominator shall be the number of days in the calendar year of the transfer. In computing the period held for purposes of the numerator, the day on which such reserves and assets are transferred is included by the transferor and excluded by the transferee.
(3)
Adjustments to the means of life insurance reserves and assets not transferred.
All life insurance reserves and assets transferred during the taxable year, within the meaning of section 806(a), shall be excluded from the beginning and end of the taxable year balances of the transferor and transferee, respectively. The amount of assets to be excluded from the beginning of the taxable year balance of the transferor shall be an amount equal to the value of such reserves at the beginning of the taxable year. The amount of assets to be excluded from the end of the taxable year balance of the transferee shall be an amount equal to the value of such reserves at the end of the taxable year. The means of the life insurance reserves and assets not so transferred shall be determined in the ordinary manner, that is, the arithmetic means. There shall be added to these means an amount to appropriately adjust them, on a daily basis, for the life insurance reserves and assets that were transferred during the taxable year. This adjustment shall be determined by multiplying (i) the mean of the transferred life insurance reserves (or assets, as the case may be) at the beginning of the taxable year (or, if acquired later, at the beginning of the period held as defined in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph) and the end of the period held as defined in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph (or at the end of the taxable year, if held at such time) by (ii) the fraction determined under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph.
(4)
Examples.
The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
On March 14, 1958, the M Company, a life insurance company, transferred to the N Company, a life insurance company, pursuant to an assumption reinsurance agreement, all of its life insurance reserves, and related assets, on one block of policies. The reserves (and assets) for this block were held by the M Company on January 1, 1958, and totaled $60,000; on March 14, the reserves (and assets) totaled $64,000. The M Company had life insurance reserves of $1,000,000 at the beginning of 1958 (including those subsequently transferred) and $1,040,000 at the end of 1958. The M Company had assets of $1,300,000 at the beginning of 1958 (including those subsequently transferred) and $1,380,000 at the end of 1958. The mean of M's life insurance reserves for the taxable year 1958 is computed as follows:

Assume the facts are the same as in example 1. At the end of 1958, N Company had life insurance reserves (and assets) of $80,000 on the contracts transferred on March 14, 1958. The N Company had life insurance reserves of $6,000,000 at the beginning of 1958 and $6,400,000 at the end of 1958 (including those transferred). The N Company had assets of $6,800,000 at the beginning of 1958 and $7,300,000 at the end of 1958 (including those on the contracts transferred). The mean of N's life insurance reserves for the taxable year 1958 is computed as follows:

# Example 5.
The facts are the same as in example 1, except that on October 19, 1958, company N transfers to company P, a life insurance company, all of the life insurance reserves, and related assets, on the block of policies it had received from company M on March 14, 1958. The reserves (and assets) for this block totaled $76,000 on October 19, 1958. The means of company M's life insurance reserves and assets, as computed in examples 1 and (2), respectively, would be unchanged by the transfer of October 19, 1958. Since company N did not own this block of policies at either the beginning or end of the taxable year, it would not have to recompute its beginning or end of the taxable year reserves or assets. Company N will, however, have to adjust (or increase) the mean of its life insurance reserves and assets on account of the policies it received from company M. This adjustment will be $42,000, which is determined by multiplying the means of the life insurance reserves (or assets) on these policies as of March 15, 1958, and October 19, 1958, $70,000 ($64,000 + $76,000 = $140,000 ÷ 2) by the fraction 219/365 (the numerator of 219 is determined by excluding the day of the transfer to N, March 14, 1958, and including the day of the transfer from N to P, October 19, 1958). Company P will have to recompute its end of the year life insurance reserves and assets (in the same manner as illustrated in examples 3 and 4). Assuming the end of the year reserves (and assets) on this block of policies is $80,000, company P will have an adjustment under section 806 (a) of $15,600, which is determined by multiplying the means of the reserves on these policies as of October 20, 1958, and December 31, 1958, $78,000 ($76,000 + $80,000= $156,000 ÷ 2) by the fraction 73/365.

§ 1.807-1
Computation of life insurance reserves.
(a)
Tax reserve method.
For purposes of determining the amount of life insurance reserves for a contract under section 807(d)(1), section 807(d)(2) requires the determination of the amount of the reserve for a contract using the tax reserve method applicable to the contract. Under section 807(d)(3), the tax reserve method applicable to the contract is the Commissioners' Reserve Valuation Method (CRVM), the Commissioners' Annuities Reserve Valuation Method (CARVM), or other reserve method prescribed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) that applies to
the contract as of the date the reserve is determined. If the NAIC has not prescribed a reserve method that covers the contract, a reserve method that is consistent with the CRVM, the CARVM, or other NAIC-prescribed method as of the date the reserve is determined (whichever is most appropriate) must be used.
(b)
No asset adequacy reserve.
The life insurance reserve determined under section 807(d)(1) does not include any asset adequacy reserve.
(1) An asset adequacy reserve is—
(i) Any reserve that is established as an additional reserve based upon an analysis of the adequacy of reserves that would otherwise be established in accordance with the requirements set forth in the NAIC Valuation Manual, such as the CRVM or CARVM as applicable, or
(ii) Any similar reserve.
(2) In determining whether a reserve is a life insurance reserve, the label placed on such reserve is not determinative, provided, however, any reserve or portion of a reserve that would have been established pursuant to an asset adequacy analysis required by the NAIC's Valuation Manual 30 as it existed on December 22, 2017, the date of enactment of Public Law 115-97, is an asset adequacy reserve.
(c)
Applicability date.
The rules of this section apply to taxable years beginning after
October 13, 2020.

§ 1.807-3
Reporting of reserves.
(a)
Reserve reporting.
A life insurance company subject to tax under section 801 is required to make a return on Form 1120-L,
U.S. Life Insurance Company Income Tax Return.
The Internal Revenue Service may require reporting with respect to the opening balance and closing balance of items described in section 807(c) and with respect to the method of computing such items for purposes of determining income. Such reporting may provide for the manner in which separate account items are reported. (See section 6011 and § 301.6011-1 of this chapter.)

Applicability date.
The rules of this section apply to taxable years beginning after
October 13, 2020.
[T.D. 9911, 85 FR 64392, Oct. 13, 2020]
§ 1.807-4
Adjustment for change in computing reserves.
(a)
Requirement to follow administrative procedures.
Under section 807(f), a change in basis of computing an item referred to in section 807(c) is a change in method of accounting. Accordingly, except as provided in § 1.446-1(e), a change in basis of computing an item referred to in section 807(c) is a change in method of accounting for purposes of § 1.446-1(e). Before computing such item under a new basis, a life insurance company must obtain the consent of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue or his delegate (Commissioner) pursuant to administrative procedures prescribed by the Commissioner. Similarly, an insurance company other than a life insurance company (a nonlife insurance company) that changes its basis of computing life insurance reserves must obtain the consent of the Commissioner pursuant to administrative procedures prescribed by the Commissioner.
(b)
Section 481 adjustment
—(1)
In general.
If the basis of computing any item referred to in section 807(c) as of the close of any taxable year (the year of change) differs from the basis of computing such item at the close of the preceding taxable year, then the difference between the amount of the item at the close of the taxable year computed on the new basis and the amount of the item at the close of the taxable year computed on the old basis that is attributable to contracts issued before the taxable year, is taken into account under section 481 and §§ 1.481-1 through 1.481-5 as an adjustment attributable to a change in method of accounting.
(2)
Loss of company status.
If for any taxable year a taxpayer that was an insurance company for the year of change is no longer an insurance company, then the taxpayer must take into account in the preceding taxable year
(that is, the last taxable year it was an insurance company) the balance of any section 481(a) adjustment determined under paragraph (b)(1) of this section. A taxpayer that was an insurance company for the year of change does not accelerate the balance of any section 481(a) adjustment determined under paragraph (b)(1) of this section merely because it changes from a life insurance company to a nonlife insurance company or because it changes from a nonlife insurance company to a life insurance company.
(c)
Effect on determining increase or decrease in reserves
—(1)
Effect under section 807(a) and (b).
If there is a change in basis of computing any item referred to in section 807(c) for a taxable year, then, for purposes of section 807(a) and (b), the closing balance for such item for the year of change with respect to contracts issued before the year of change is determined on the old basis and the opening balance for such item for the next taxable year for such contracts is computed on the new basis.
(2)
Effect under section 832.
The following rules apply for purposes of section 832(b)(4):
(i) For the year of change, life insurance reserves at the end of the year of change with respect to contracts issued before the year of change are determined on the old basis.
(ii) For the taxable year following the year of change, life insurance reserves at the end of the preceding taxable year (that is, the year of change) with respect to contracts issued before the year of change are determined on the new basis.
(d)
Examples.
The principles of paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section are illustrated by the following examples. For purposes of these examples and except as otherwise provided, IC is a life insurance company within the meaning of section 816(a) that issues life insurance and annuity contracts. IC is required to determine the amount of life insurance reserves under section 807(d) and to take net increases or decreases in the reserves into account in computing life insurance company taxable income. IC's reserve for each insurance contract at issue exceeds the net surrender value for such contract and does not exceed the statutory reserve for such contract. IC is on an accrual method and uses a calendar year as its taxable year.
(1)
Example 1
—(i)
Facts.
In 2021, IC changed the basis of computing the amount of life insurance reserves for a certain type of life insurance contract as described in section 807(f). Both the basis used for computing the reserves for the relevant contracts at the close of the 2020 taxable year (old basis) and the basis of computing the reserves for the relevant type of contract at the close of the 2021 taxable year (new basis) are consistent with the applicable Commissioners' Reserve Valuation Method. IC followed the administrative procedures prescribed by the Commissioner to obtain consent to change the basis of computing these reserves. IC determined that the life insurance reserves as of December 31, 2021, for the relevant contracts issued prior to 2021 were $110x if computed using the old method and $120x if computed using the new method. IC also determined that the life insurance reserves as of December 31, 2021, for the relevant contracts issued during 2021 were $15x using the new basis.
(ii)
Analysis.
IC must take into account under section 481 and the administrative procedures prescribed by the Commissioner the $10x difference between the reserves for the relevant contracts issued prior to 2021 computed under the old basis ($110x) and the reserves for such contracts computed under the new basis ($120x). For purposes of determining any net increase or net decrease in reserves in taxable year 2021 under section 807(a) or (b), IC's closing balance of life insurance reserves computed under section 807(d) with respect to the relevant contracts is $110x for contracts issued prior to 2021 (computed on the old basis) and $15x for contracts issued during 2021 (computed on the new basis). IC's opening balance in 2022 for life insurance reserves for the relevant contracts is $135x (computed on the new basis).
(2)
Example 2
—(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (d)(1) of this section (the facts in
Example 1
), except that IC is an insurance company that is not a life insurance company. IC is required to compute taxable income under section 832.
(ii)
Analysis.
IC must take into account under section 481 and the administrative procedures prescribed by the Commissioner the $10x difference between the reserves for the relevant contracts issued prior to 2021 computed under the old basis ($110x) and the reserves for such contracts computed under the new basis ($120x). For purposes of determining the premiums earned on insurance contracts during the taxable year as described in section 832(b)(4) for the year of change, the life insurance reserves at the end of the taxable year are $110x for contracts issued prior to 2021 (computed on the old basis) and $15x for contracts issued during 2021 (computed on the new basis). For purposes of determining the premiums earned on insurance contracts during the taxable year as described in section 832(b)(4) for the taxable year following the year of change, the life insurance reserves at the end of the preceding taxable year (the year of change) with respect to relevant contracts are $135x (computed on the new basis).
(e)
Applicability date.
The rules of this section apply to taxable years beginning after
October 13, 2020.
However, a taxpayer may choose to apply the rules of this section for a taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017, the effective date of the revision of section 807 by Public Law 115-97, and on or before
October 13, 2020,
provided the taxpayer consistently applies the rules of this section to that taxable year and all subsequent taxable years. See section 7805(b)(7).

# gain and loss from operations
§§ 1.809-1—1.809-3
[Reserved]
§ 1.809-4
Gross amount.
(a)
Items taken into account.
For purposes of determining gain or loss from operations under section 809(b) (1) and (2), respectively, section 809(c) specifies three categories of items which shall be taken into account. Such items are in addition to the life insurance company's share of the investment yield (as determined under section 809(a)(1) and paragraph (c) of § 1.809-2), and the amount (if any) by which the net long-term capital gain exceeds the net short-term capital loss (such capital gains item is included in determining gain or loss from operations only for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1961). The additional three categories of items taken into account are:
(1)
Premiums.
(i) The gross amount of all premiums and other consideration on insurance and annuity contracts (including contracts supplementary thereto); less return premiums and premiums and other consideration arising out of reinsurance ceded. The term
gross amount of all premiums
means the premiums and other consideration provided in the insurance or annuity contract. Thus, the amount to be taken into account shall be the total of the premiums and other consideration provided in the insurance or annuity contract without any deduction for commissions, return premiums, reinsurance, dividends to policyholders, dividends left on deposit with the company, discounts on premiums paid in advance, interest applied in reduction of premiums (whether or not required to be credited in reduction of premiums under the terms of the contract), or any other item of similar nature. Such term includes advance premiums, premiums deferred and uncollected and premiums due and unpaid, deposits, fees, assessments, and consideration in respect of assuming liabilities under contracts not issued by the taxpayer (such as a payment or transfer of property in an assumption reinsurance transaction as defined in paragraph (a)(7)(ii) of § 1.809-5). The term also includes amounts a life insurance company charges itself representing premiums with respect to liability for insurance and annuity benefits for its employees (including full-time life insurance salesmen within the meaning of section 7701(a)(20)).
(ii) The term
return premiums
means amounts returned or credited which are fixed by contract and do not depend on the experience of the company or the discretion of the management. Thus, such term includes amounts refunded due to policy cancellations or erroneously computed premiums. Furthermore, amounts of premiums or
other consideration returned to another life insurance company in respect of reinsurance ceded shall be included in return premiums. For the treatment of amounts which do not meet the requirements of return premiums, see section 811 (relating to dividends to policyholders).
(iii) For purposes of section 809(c)(1) and this subparagraph, the term
reinsurance ceded
means an arrangement whereby the taxpayer (the reinsured) remains solely liable to the policyholder, whether all or only a portion of the risk has been transferred to the reinsurer. Such term includes indemnity reinsurance transactions but does not include assumption reinsurance transactions. See paragraph (a)(7)(ii) of § 1.809-5 for the definition of assumption reinsurance.
(2)
Decreases in certain reserves.
Each net decrease in reserves which is required by section 810 (a) and (d)(1) or 811(b)(2) to be taken into account for the taxable year as a net decrease for purposes of section 809(c)(2).
(3)
Other amounts.
All amounts, not included in computing investment yield and not otherwise taken into account under section 809(c) (1) or (2), shall be taken into account under section 809(c)(3) to the extent that such amounts are includible in gross income under subtitle A of the Code. See section 61 (relating to gross income defined) and the regulations thereunder.
(b)
Treatment of net long-term capital gains.
For taxable years beginning before January 1, 1962, any net long-term capital gains (as defined in section 1222(7)) from the sale or exchange of a capital asset (or any gain considered to be from the sale or exchange of a capital asset under applicable law) shall be excluded from the determination of gain or loss from operations of a life insurance company. On the other hand, with respect to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1961, the amount (if any) by which the net long-term capital gain exceeds the net short-term capital loss (as defined in section 1222(6)) shall be taken into account in determining gain or loss from operations under section 809. However, for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1958, the excess of net short-term capital gain (as defined in section 1222(5)) over net long-term capital loss (as defined in section 1222(8)) is included in computing investment yield (as defined in section 804(c)) and, to that extent, is taken into account in determining gain or loss from operations under section 809.
[T.D. 6535, 26 FR 527, Jan. 20, 1961, as amended by T.D. 6610, 27 FR 8718, Aug. 31, 1962, T.D. 6886, 31 FR 8687, June 23, 1966]
§ 1.809-5
Deductions.
(a)
Deductions allowed.
Section 809(d) provides the following deductions for purposes of determining gain or loss from operations under section 809(b) (1) and (2), respectively:
(1)
Death benefits, etc.
All claims and benefits accrued (less reinsurance recoverable), and all losses incurred (whether or not ascertained), during the taxable year on insurance and annuity contracts (including contracts supplementary thereto). The term
all claims and benefits accrued
includes, for example, matured endowments and amounts allowed on surrender. The term
losses incurred (whether or not ascertained)
includes a reasonable estimate of the amount of the losses (based upon the facts in each case and the company's experience with similar cases) incurred but not reported by the end of the taxable year as well as losses reported but where the amount thereof cannot be ascertained by the end of the taxable year.
(2)
Increases in certain reserves.
The net increase in reserves which is required by section 810 (b) and (d)(1) to be taken into account for the taxable year as a net increase for purposes of section 809(d)(2).
(3)
Dividends to policyholders.
The deduction for dividends to policyholders as determined under section 811(b) and § 1.811-2.
(4)
Operations loss deduction.
The operations loss deduction as determined under section 812.
(5)
Certain nonparticipating contracts.
(i) An amount equal to the greater of:
(
a
) 10 percent of the increase for the taxable year in certain life insurance reserves for nonparticipating contracts (other than group contracts); or
(
b
) 3 percent of the premiums for the taxable year attributable to nonparticipating contracts (other than
group contracts) which are issued or renewed for periods of 5 years or more.
(ii) For purposes of section 809(d)(5) and this subparagraph, the term
nonparticipating contracts
means those contracts which during the taxable year contain no right to participate in the divisible surplus of the company. For example, if at any time during the taxable year for which the deduction allowed under section 809(d)(5) and this subparagraph is claimed such contracts have rights to dividends or similar distributions (as defined in section 811(a) and paragraph (a) of § 1.811-2), such contracts shall no longer be deemed nonparticipating contracts and, therefore, no deduction shall be allowed. Thus, if a class of contracts having no right to participate in the divisible surplus of the company is in force for nine years and on March 10, 1958, it is announced that such contracts shall be accorded dividend rights as of August 1, 1958, no deduction shall be allowed under section 809(d)(5) and this subparagraph for the taxable year 1958 or any succeeding taxable year, whether or not dividends are actually paid on such contracts. However, if the announcement of March 10, 1958, states that such contracts shall be accorded dividend rights as of January 1, 1959, a deduction under section 809(d)(5) and this subparagraph shall be allowed for the taxable year 1958 but not for any succeeding taxable year.
(iii) For purposes of section 809(d)(5) and this subparagraph, the term
reserves for nonparticipating contracts
means such part of the life insurance reserves (as defined in section 801(b) and § 1.801-4), other than that portion of such reserves which is allocable to annuity features, as relates to nonparticipating contracts (as defined in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph). The amount of life insurance reserves taken into account shall be adjusted first as required by section 818(c) (relating to an election with respect to life insurance reserves computed on a preliminary term basis) and then as required by section 806(a) (relating to adjustments for certain changes in reserves and assets). In the case of the adjustments required by section 810(d) (relating to adjustment for change in computing reserves), the increase in life insurance reserves attributable to reserve strengthening shall be taken into account in accordance with the rules prescribed in section 810(d).
(iv) For purposes of section 809(d)(5) and this subparagraph, the term
premiums
means the net amount of the premiums and other consideration attributable to nonparticipating contracts (as defined in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph) which are taken into account under section 809(c)(1). For this purpose, premiums include only such amounts attributable to such contracts which are issued or renewed for periods of 5 years or more, but does not include that portion of the premiums which is allocable to annuity features. No portion of a premium shall be deemed allocable to annuity features solely because a contract, such as an endowment contract, provides that at maturity the insured shall have an option to take an annuity. The determination of whether a contract meets the 5-year requirement shall be made as of the date the contract is issued, or as of the date it is renewed, whichever is applicable. Thus, a 20-year nonparticipating endowment policy shall qualify for the deduction under section 809(d)(5), even though the insured subsequently dies at the end of the second year, since the policy is issued for a period of 5 years or more. However, a 1-year renewable term contract shall not qualify, since as of the date it is issued (or of any renewal date) it is not issued (or renewed) for a period of 5 years or more. In like manner, a policy originally issued for a 3-year period and subsequently renewed for an additional 3-year period shall not qualify. However, if this policy is renewed for a period of 5 years or more, the policy shall qualify for the deduction under section 809(d)(5) from the date it is renewed.
(v) The provisions of section 809(d)(5) and this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
Assume the following facts with respect to X, a life insurance company, for the taxable year 1958:
Life insurance reserves on nonparticipating contracts without annuity features (other than group contracts) at 1-1-58
$150,000
Life insurance reserves on nonparticipating contracts without annuity features (other than group contracts) at 12-31-58
225,000
Annuity reserves on nonparticipating contracts (other than group contracts) at 1-1-58
48,000
Annuity reserves on nonparticipating contracts (other than group contracts) at 12-31-58
57,000
Premiums on nonparticipating contracts without annuity features (other than group contracts) issued or renewed for 5 years or more
85,000
Premiums on nonparticipating contracts allocable to annuity features (other than group contracts) issued or renewed for 5 years or more
14,000
Return premiums on nonparticipating contracts without annuity features (other than group contracts)
5,000
In order to determine the deduction under section 809(d)(5) (without regard to the limitation of section 809(f)), X would make up the following schedule:
(1) Life insurance reserves on nonparticipating contracts without annuity features (other than group contracts) at 12-31-58
$225,000
(2) Life insurance reserves on nonparticipating contracts without annuity features (other than group contracts) at 1-1-58
150,000
(3) Excess of item (1) over item (2) ($225,000 minus $150,000)
75,000
(4) 10 percent of item (3) (10% × $75,000)
7,500
(5) Net premiums on nonparticipating contracts without annuity features issued or renewed for 5 years or more (other than group contracts) (gross premiums on such contracts ($85,000) minus return premiums ($5,000) on such contracts)
80,000
(6) 3 percent of item (5) (3% × $80,000)
2,400
(7) The greater of item (4) or item (6)
7,500
(8) Tentative deduction under sec. 809(d)(5) (computed without regard to the limitation of sec. 809(f))
7,500
(6)
Certain accident and health insurance and group life insurance.
(i) For taxable years beginning before January 1, 1963, an amount equal to two percent of the premiums for the taxable year attributable to group life insurance contracts, group accident and health insurance contracts, or group accident and health insurance contracts with a life feature. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1962, the deduction shall be an amount equal to two percent of the premiums for the taxable year attributable to group life insurance contracts, accident and health insurance contracts (other than those to which section 809(d)(5) applies), or accident and health insurance contracts with a life feature (other than those to which section 809(d)(5) applies). For purposes of section 809(d)(6) and this subparagraph, the term “premiums” means the net amount of the premiums and other consideration attributable to such contracts taken into account under section 809(c)(1). The deduction allowed by section 809(d)(6) and this subparagraph for the taxable year and all preceding taxable years shall not exceed 50 percent of the net amount of the premiums attributable to such contracts for the taxable year. For example, assume that premiums attributable to group life insurance and group accident and health insurance contracts are $103,000 for the taxable year 1962. Assume further that there are $3,000 of return premiums attributable to such contracts for the taxable year. Under the provisions of section 809(d)(6) and this subparagraph, a deduction (determined without regard to section 809(f) of $2,000 (2 percent of $100,000 ($103,000−$3,000)) is allowed. Assuming that the company continues to receive net premiums of $100,000 attributable to such contracts for 15 years, the cumulative amount of these deductions is $30,000 ($2,000 for 15 years). If, in the sixteenth year, net premiums attributable to such contracts amount to $60,000, no deduction shall be allowed under section 809(d)(6) and this subparagraph since the cumulative amount of these deductions ($30,000) equals 50 percent of the current year's premiums ($60,000) from such contracts.
(ii) In computing the deduction under section 809(d)(6), the determination as to when the 50 percent limitation on such deduction has been reached shall be based upon the amount allowed as a deduction for the taxable year and all preceding taxable years after the application of the limitation provided in section 809(f).
(iii) For purposes of determining whether the 50 percent limitation applies to any taxable year, the deduction provided by section 809(d)(6) for all preceding taxable years shall be taken into account, irrespective of whether or not the life insurance company claimed a deduction for these amounts for such preceding taxable years.
(7)
Assumption by another person of liabilities under insurance, etc., contracts.
(i) The consideration (other than consideration arising out of reinsurance
ceded as defined in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of § 1.809-4) in respect of the assumption by another person of liabilities under insurance and annuity contracts (including contracts supplementary thereto) of the taxpayer.
(ii) For purposes of section 809(d)(7) and this subparagraph, the term
assumption reinsurance
means an arrangement whereby another person (the reinsurer) becomes solely liable to the policyholders on the contracts transferred by the taxpayer. Such term does not include indemnity reinsurance or reinsurance ceded (as defined in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of § 1.809-4).
(iii) The provisions of section 809(d)(7) and this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
During the taxable year 1958, T, a life insurance company, transferred a block of insurance policies and made a payment of $50,000 to R, a life insurance company, under an arrangement whereby R became solely liable to the policyholders on the policies transferred by T. Under the provisions of section 809(d)(7) and this subparagraph, T is allowed a deduction of $50,000 for the taxable year 1958. For the treatment by R of this $50,000 payment, see section 809(c)(1) and paragraph (a)(1)(i) of § 1.809-4. See section 806(a) and § 1.806-3 for the adjustments in reserves and assets to be made by T and R as a result of this transaction.
(8)
Tax-exempt interest, dividends, etc.
(i) Each of the following items:
(
a
) The life insurance company's share of interest which under section 103 is excluded from gross income;
(
b
) The deduction for partially tax-exempt interest provided by section 242 (as modified by section 804(a)(3) and paragraph (d)(2)(i) of § 1.804-2) computed with respect to the life insurance company's share of such interest; and
(
c
) The deductions for dividends received provided by sections 243, 244, and 245 (as modified by section 809(d)(8)(B) and subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph) computed with respect to the life insurance company's share of the dividends received.
(ii) The modification contained in section 809(d)(8)(B) provides the method for applying section 246(b) (relating to limitation on aggregate amount of deductions for dividends received) for purposes of section 809(d)(8)(A)(iii) and subdivision (i)(
c
) of this subparagraph. Under this method, the sum of the deductions allowed by sections 243(a)(1) (relating to dividends received by corporations), 244(a) (relating to dividends received on certain preferred stock), and 245 (relating to dividends received from certain foreign corporations) shall be limited to 85 percent of the gain from operations computed without regard to:
(
a
) The deductions provided by section 809(d) (3), (5), and (6);
(
b
) The operations loss deductions provided by section 812; and
(
c
) The deductions allowed by sections 243(a)(1), 244(a), and 245.
If a life insurance company has a loss from operations (as determined under sec. 812) for the taxable year, the limitation provided in section 809(d)(8)(B) and this subdivision shall not be applicable for such taxable year. In that event, the deductions provided by sections 243(a)(1), 244(a), and 245 shall be allowable for all tax purposes to the life insurance company for such taxable year without regard to such limitation. If the life insurance company does not have a loss from operations for the taxable year, however, the limitation shall be applicable for all tax purposes for such taxable year. In determining whether a life insurance company has a loss from operations for the taxable year under section 812, the deductions allowed by sections 243(a)(1), 244(a), and 245 shall be computed without regard to the limitation provided in section 809(d)(8)(B) and this subdivision.
(9)
Investment expenses, etc.
(i) The amount of investment expenses to the extent not allowed as a deduction under section 804(c)(1) in computing investment yield. For example, if a deduction in the amount of $100,000 is claimed for investment expenses, which amount includes general expenses assigned to or included in investment expenses, and due to the operation of the limitation provided by section 804(c)(1) only $85,000 is allowed, then the excess ($15,000) shall be allowed as a deduction under section 809(d)(9) and this subparagraph.
(ii) The amount (if any) by which the sum of the deductions allowable under section 804(c) exceeds the gross investment income. For example, if gross investment income under section 804(b)
equals $400,000, and the sum of the deductions allowable under section 804(c) equals $425,000, then the excess ($25,000) shall be allowed as a deduction under section 809(d)(9) and this subparagraph.
(iii) In determining the amount of the deductions allowed under subdivisions (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph, a life insurance company shall first take such deductions to the full extent allowable under section 804(c)(1), and any amount which is allowed as a deduction under section 804(c) shall not again be allowed as a deduction under section 809(d)(9).
(10)
Small business deduction.
The small business deduction as determined under section 804(a)(4).
(11) [Reserved]
(12)
Other deductions.
Except as modified by section 809(e) and § 1.809-6, all other deductions allowed under subtitle A of the Code for purposes of computing taxable income to the extent not allowed as a deduction in computing investment yield. For example, a life insurance company shall be allowed a deduction under section 809(d)(12) and this subparagraph for amounts representing premiums charged itself with respect to liability for insurance and annuity benefits for its employees (including full-time life insurance salesmen within the meaning of section 7701(a)(20)) in accordance with the rules prescribed in sections 162 and 404 and the regulations thereunder, to the extent that a deduction for such amounts is not allowed under section 804(c)(1) and paragraph (b)(1) of § 1.804-4 or section 809(d)(9) and subparagraph (9) of this paragraph.
(b)
Denial of double deduction.
Nothing in section 809(d) shall permit the same item to be deducted more than once in determining gain or loss from operations. For example, if an item is allowed as a deduction for the taxable year by reason of its being a loss incurred within such taxable year (whether or not ascertained) under section 809(d)(1), such item, or any portion thereof, shall not also be allowed as a deduction for such taxable year under section 809(d)(2).

§ 1.809-6
Modifications.
Under section 809(e), the deductions allowed under section 809(d)(12) and paragraph (a)(12) of § 1.809-5 (relating to other deductions) are subject to the following modifications:
(a)
Interest.
No deduction shall be allowed under section 163 for interest in respect of items described in section 810(c) since such interest is taken into account in the determination of required interest under section 809.
(b)
Bad debts.
No deduction shall be allowed for an addition to reserves for bad debts under section 166(c). However, a deduction for specific bad debts shall be allowed to the extent that such deduction is allowed under section 166 and the regulations thereunder. In the case of a loss incurred on the sale of mortgaged or pledged property, see § 1.166-6 of this chapter.
(c)
Charitable, etc., contributions and gifts.
(1) The deduction by a life insurance company in any taxable year for a charitable contribution (as defined in section 170(c)) shall be limited to 5 percent of the gain from operations (as determined under section 809(b)(1)), computed without regard to any deductions for:
(i) Charitable contributions under section 170;
(ii) Dividends to policyholders under section 811(b);
(iii) Certain nonparticipating contracts under section 809(d)(5);
(iv) Group life insurance contracts and group accident and health insurance contracts under section 809(d)(6);
(v) Tax-exempt interest, dividends, etc., under section 809(d)(8); and
(vi) Any operations loss carryback to the taxable year under section 812.
(2) In applying the first sentence of section 170(b)(2) as contained in section 170 or, in the case of taxable years beginning after December 31, 1969, section 170(d)(2)(B) as contained in section 170A, any excess of the charitable contributions made by a life insurance company in a taxable year over the amount deductible in such year under the limitation contained in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, shall be reduced to the extent that such excess:
(i) Reduces life insurance company taxable income (computed without regard to section 802(b)(3)) for the purpose of determining the offsets referred to in section 812(b)(2); and
(ii) Increases an operations loss carryover under section 812 for a succeeding taxable year.
(3) The application of the rules provided in section 809(e)(3) and this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
Assume that life insurance company P is organized on January 1, 1958, and has a loss from operations for that year in the amount of $100,000 which is an operations loss carryover to 1959. In 1959, company P has a gain from operations and tax base (computed without regard to section 802(b)(3)) of $100,000 before the allowance of a deduction for a $5,000 charitable contribution made in 1959 and before the application of the operations loss carryover from 1958. Under section 170(b)(2), the operations loss carryover from 1958 is first applied to eliminate the $100,000 gain from operations and tax base in 1959 and the $5,000 charitable contribution carryover would (except for the limitation contained in this paragraph) become a charitable contribution carryover to 1960. However, for the purpose of computing the offsets referred to in section 812(b)(2), the $5,000 charitable contribution is applied to reduce the gain from operations and tax base for 1959 to $95,000 before the application of the operations carryover from 1958. Since only $95,000 of the $100,000 loss from operations in 1958 is an offset for 1959, the remaining $5,000 becomes an operations loss carryover to 1960. Accordingly, under the limitation contained in this paragraph, the charitable contributions carryover provided under the second sentence of section 170(b)(2) is eliminated.
(d)
Amortizable bond premium.
No deduction shall be allowed under section 171 for the amortization of bond premiums since a special deduction for such premiums is specifically taken into account under section 818(b).
(e)
Net operating loss deduction.
No deduction shall be allowed under section 172 since section 812 allows an “operations loss deduction”.
(f)
Partially tax-exempt interest.
No deduction shall be allowed under section 242 for partially tax-exempt interest since section 809(d)(8) allows a deduction for such interest.
(g)
Dividends received.
No deduction shall be allowed under sections 243, 244, and 245 for dividends received since section 809(d)(8) allows a deduction for such dividends.

§ 1.810-1
[Reserved]
§ 1.810-2
Rules for certain reserves.
(a)
Adjustment for decrease or increase in certain reserve items
—(1)
Adjustment for decrease.
Section 810(a) provides that if the sum of the items described in section 810(c) and paragraph (b) of this section at the beginning of the taxable year exceeds the sum of such items at the end of the taxable year (reduced by the amount of investment yield not included in gain or loss from operations for the taxable year by reason of section 809(a)(1)), the amount of such excess shall be taken into account as a net decrease referred to in section 809(c)(2) and paragraph (a)(2) of § 1.809-4 in determining gain or loss from operations.
(2)
Adjustment for increase.
Section 810(b) provides that if the sum of the items described in section 810(c) and paragraph (b) of this section at the end of the taxable year (reduced by the amount of investment yield not included in gain or loss from operations for the taxable year by reason of section 809(a)(1)) exceeds the sum of such items at the beginning of the taxable year, the amount of such excess shall be taken into account as a net increase referred to in section 809(d)(2) and paragraph (a)(2) of § 1.809-5 in determining gain or loss from operations.
(b)
Items taken into account.
The items described in section 810(c) and referred to in section 810 (a) and (b) and paragraph (a) of this section are:
(1) The life insurance reserves (as defined in section 801(b) and § 1.801-4);
(2) The unearned premiums and unpaid losses included in total reserves under section 801(c)(2) and § 1.801-5;
(3) The amounts (discounted at the rates of interest assumed by the company) necessary to satisfy the obligations under insurance or annuity contracts (including contracts supplementary thereto), but only if such obligations do not involve (at the time with respect to which the computation
is made under this subparagraph) life, health, or accident contingencies;
(4) Dividend accumulations, and other amounts, held at interest in connection with insurance or annuity contracts (including contracts supplementary thereto); and
(5) Premiums received in advance, and liabilities for premium deposit funds.
(6) Special contingency reserves under contracts of group term life insurance or group health and accident insurance which are established and maintained for the provision of insurance on retired lives, for premium stabilization, or for a combination thereof.
For purposes of this paragraph, the same item shall be counted only once and deficiency reserves (as defined in section 801(b)(4) and paragraph (e)(4) of § 1.801-4) shall not be taken into account.
(c)
Special rules.
For purposes of section 810 (a) and (b) and paragraph (a) of this section, in determining whether there is a net increase or decrease in the sum of the items described in section 810(c) and paragraph (b) of this section for the taxable year, the following rules shall apply:
(1)
Computation of net increase or decrease in reserves.
The sum of the items described in section 810(c) and paragraph (b) of this section at the beginning of the taxable year shall be the aggregate of the sums of each of such items at the beginning of the taxable year. The sum of the items described in section 810(c) and paragraph (b) of this section at the end of the taxable year shall be the aggregate of the sums of each of such items at the end of the taxable year. However, in order to determine whether there is a net increase or decrease in such items for the taxable year, the aggregate of the sums of the items at the end of the taxable year must first be reduced by the amount of investment yield not included in gain or loss from operations for the taxable year by reason of section 809(a)(1).
(2)
Effect of change in basis in computing reserves.
Any increase or decrease in the sum of the items described in section 810(c) and paragraph (b) of this section for the taxable year which is attributable to a change in the basis used in computing such items during the taxable year shall not be taken into account under section 810 (a) or (b) and paragraph (a) of this section but shall be taken into account in the manner prescribed in section 810(d) and paragraph (a) of § 1.810-3.
(3)
Effect of section 818(c) election.
If a company which computes its life insurance reserves on a preliminary term basis elects to revalue such reserves on a net level premium basis under section 818(c), the sum of such reserves at the beginning and end of all taxable years (including the first taxable year) for which the election applies shall be the sum of such reserves computed on such net level premium basis.
(4)
Cross references.
For taxable years beginning before January 1, 1970, see section 810(e) (as in effect for such years) for special rules for determining the net increase or decrease in the sum of the items described in section 810(c) and paragraph (b) of this section in the case of certain voluntary employees' beneficiary associations. For similar special rules in the case of life insurance companies issuing variable annuity contracts, see section 801(g)(4) and the regulations thereunder.
(d)
Illustration of principles.
The provisions of section 810 (a) and (b) and this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Assume the following facts with respect to R, a life insurance company:
Sum of items described in section 810(c) (1) through (6) at beginning of taxable year
$940
Sum of items described in section 810(c) (1) through (6) at end of taxable year
1,060
Required interest (as defined in section 809(a)(2))
70
Investment yield (as defined in section 804(c))
100
Amount of investment yield not included in gain or loss from operations for the taxable year by reason of section 809(a)(1)
70
In order to determine the adjustment for decrease or increase in the sum of the items described in section 810(c) for the taxable year, R must first reduce the sum of such items at the end of the taxable year ($1,060) by the amount of investment yield ($70) not included in gain or loss from operations for the taxable year by reason of section 809(a)(1). Since the adjusted sum of such items at the end of the taxable year, $990 ($1,060 minus $70), exceeds the sum of such items at the beginning of the taxable year, $940, the excess of $50 ($990 minus $940) shall be taken into account as a net increase under section
809(d)(2) and paragraph (a)(2) of § 1.809-5 in determining gain or loss from operations.

# Example 2.
Assume the facts are the same as in example 1, except that the sum of the items described in section 810(c) at the beginning of the taxable year is $1000. Since the sum of the items described in section 810(c) at the beginning of taxable year, $1000, exceeds the sum of such items at the end of the taxable year after adjustment for the amount of investment yield not included in gain or loss from operations for the taxable year by reason of section 809(a)(1), $990 ($1060 minus $70), the excess of $10 ($1000 minus $990) shall be taken into account as a net decrease under section 809 (c)(2) and paragraph (a)(2) of § 1.809-4 in determining gain or loss from operations.

# Example 3.
Assume the following facts with respect to S, a life insurance company:
Sum of items described in section 810(c) (1) through (6) at beginning of taxable year
$1,970
Sum of items described in section 810(c) (1) through (6) at the end of taxable year
2,040
Required interest (as defined in section 809(a)(2))
60
Investment yield (as defined in section 804(c))
40
Amount of investment yield not included in gain or loss from operations by reason of section 809(a)(1)
40
Under the provisions of section 809(a)(1), since the required interest ($60) exceeds the investment yield ($40), the share of each and every item of investment yield set aside for policyholders and not included in gain or loss from operations for the taxable year shall be 100 percent. Thus, applying the provisions of section 810 (a) and (b), the sum of the items described in section 810(c) at the end of the taxable year ($2,040) must first be reduced by the entire amount of the investment yield ($40) in order to determine the net increase or decrease in the sum of such items for the taxable year. Since the adjusted sum of such items at the end of the taxable year, $2,000 ($2,040 minus $40), is greater than the sum of such items at the beginning of the taxable year, $1,970, the excess of $30 ($2,000 minus $1,970) shall be taken into account as a net increase under section 809(d)(2) and paragraph (a)(2) of § 1.809-5 in determining gain or loss from operations. No additional deduction is allowed under section 809(d) for the amount ($20) by which the required interest exceeds the investment yield for the taxable year.

# Example 4.
Assume the facts are the same as in example 1, except that as a result of a change in the basis used in computing an item described in section 810(c) during the taxable year, the sum of such items at the end of the taxable year is $1,200. Under the provisions of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, any increase or decrease in the sum of the section 810(c) items for the taxable year which is attributable to a change in the basis used in computing such items during the taxable year shall not be taken into account under section 810 (a) and (b). Thus, for purposes of section 810 (a) and (b), the sum of the items described in section 810(c) at the end of the taxable year shall be $1,060 (the amount computed without regard to the change in basis) and S shall treat the $50 computed in the manner described in example 1 as a net increase under section 809(d)(2) and paragraph (a)(2) of § 1.809-5 in determining its gain or loss from operations for the taxable year. The amount of the increase in the section 810(c) items which is attributable to the change in basis during the taxable year, $140 ($1,200 minus $1,060), shall be taken into account in the manner prescribed in section 810(d) and paragraph (a) of § 1.810-3.

# Example 5.
The life insurance reserves of M, a life insurance company, computed with respect to contracts for which such reserves are determined on a recognized preliminary term basis amount to $100 on January 1, 1960, and $110 on December 31, 1960. For the taxable year 1960, M elects to revalue such reserves on a net level premium basis under section 818(c). Such reserves computed under section 818(c) amount to $115 on January 1, 1960, and $127 on December 31, 1960. Under the provisions of paragraph (c)(3) of this section, a company which makes the section 818(c) election must use the net level premium basis in computing the sum of its life insurance reserves at the beginning and end of all taxable years for which the election applies. Thus, for purposes of section 810 (a) and (b), in determining whether there is a net increase or decrease in the sum of the section 810(c) items for the taxable year 1960, M shall include $115 as its reserves with respect to such contracts under section 810(c)(1) at the beginning of the taxable year and $127 as its reserves with respect to such contracts under section 810(c)(1) at the end of the taxable year.
[T.D. 6535, 26 FR 531, Jan. 20, 1961, as amended by T.D. 7163, 37 FR 4189, Feb. 29, 1972; T.D. 7172, 37 FR 5619, Mar. 17, 1972; T.D. 9849, 84 FR 9236, Mar. 14, 2019]
§ 1.811-1
Taxable years affected.
Section 1.811-2, except as otherwise provided therein, is applicable only to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1957, and all references to sections of part I, subchapter L, chapter 1 of the Code are to the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended by the Life Insurance Company Income Tax Act of 1959 (73 Stat. 112).
[T.D. 6535, 26 FR 534, Jan. 20, 1961]
§ 1.811-2
Dividends to policyholders.
(a)
Dividends to policyholders defined.
Section 811(a) defines the term
dividends to policyholders,
for purposes of part I, subchapter L, chapter 1 of the Code, to mean dividends and similar distributions to policyholders in their capacity as such. The term includes amounts returned to policyholders where the amount is not fixed in the contract but depends on the experience of the company or the discretion of the management. In general, any payment not fixed in the contract which is made with respect to a participating contract (that is, a contract which during the taxable year contains a right to participate in the divisible surplus of the company) shall be treated as a dividend to policyholders. Similarly, any amount refunded or allowed as a rate credit with respect to either a participating or a nonparticipating contract shall be treated as a dividend to policyholders if such amount depends on the experience of the company. However, the term does not include interest paid (as defined in section 805(e) and paragraph (b) of § 1.805-8) or return premiums (as defined in section 809(c) and paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of § 1.809-4). Thus, so-called excess-interest dividends and amounts returned by one life insurance company to another in respect of reinsurance ceded shall not be treated as dividends to policyholders even though such amounts are not fixed in the contract but depend upon the experience of the company or the discretion of the management.
(b)
Amount of deduction
—(1)
In general.
Section 811(b)(1) provides, subject to the limitation of section 809(f), that the deduction for dividends to policyholders for any taxable year shall be an amount equal to the dividends to policyholders paid during the taxable year:
(i) Increased by the excess of the amounts held as reserves for dividends to policyholders at the end of the taxable year for payment during the year following the taxable year, over the amounts held as reserves for dividends to policyholders at the end of the preceding taxable year for payment during the taxable year, or
(ii) Decreased by the excess of the amounts held as reserves for dividends to policyholders at the end of the preceding taxable year for payment during the taxable year, over the amounts held as reserves for dividends to policyholders at the end of the taxable year for payment during the year following the taxable year.
For the rule as to when dividends are considered paid, see section 561 and the regulations thereunder. For the determination of the amounts held as reserves for dividends to policyholders, see paragraph (c) of this section. For special provisions relating to the treatment of dividends to policyholders paid with respect to policies reinsured under modified coinsurance contracts, see section 820(c)(5) and the regulations thereunder.
(2)
Certain amounts to be treated as net decreases.
Section 811(b)(2) provides that if the amount determined under subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph exceeds the dividends to policyholders paid during the taxable year, the amount of such excess shall be a net decrease referred to in section 809(c)(2).
(c)
Reserves for dividends to policyholders defined
—(1)
In general.
The term
reserves for dividends to policyholders,
as used in section 811(b)(1) (A) and (B) and paragraph (b)(1) of this section, means only those amounts:
(i) Actually held, or set aside as provided in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph and thus treated as actually held, by the company at the end of the taxable year, and
(ii) With respect to which, at the end of the taxable year or, if set aside, within the period prescribed in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, the company is under an obligation, which is either fixed or determined according to a formula which is fixed and not subject to change by the company, to pay such amounts as dividends to policyholders (as defined in section 811(a) and paragraph (a) of this section) during the year following the taxable year.
(2)
Amounts set aside.
(i) In the case of a life insurance company (as defined in section 801(a) and paragraph (b) of § 1.801-3), all amounts set aside before the 16th day of the 3d month of the year following the taxable year for payment as dividends to policyholders (as defined in section 811(a) and paragraph (a) of this section) during the
year following such taxable year shall be treated as amounts actually held at the end of the taxable year.
(ii) In the case of a mutual savings bank subject to the tax imposed by section 594, all amounts set aside before the 16th day of the 4th month of the year following the taxable year for payment as dividends to policyholders (as defined in section 811(a) and paragraph (a) of this section) during the year following such taxable year shall be treated as amounts actually held at the end of the taxable year.
(3)
1958 reserve for dividends to policyholders.
For purposes of section 811(b) and paragraph (b) of this section, the amounts held at the end of 1957 as reserves for dividends to policyholders payable during 1958 shall be determined as if part I, subchapter L, chapter 1 of the Code (as in effect for 1958) applied for 1957. Any adjustment in the reserves for dividends to policyholders at the beginning of 1957 required as a result of an understatement or overstatement of such reserves by the company shall be made to the balance of such reserves as of the beginning of 1957. For example, if at the beginning of 1957 the reserves for dividends to policyholders are stated to be $100 and it is subsequently determined that such reserves should have been $90, the reserves at the beginning of 1957 shall be reduced by $10. Under no circumstances shall an adjustment required with regard to the beginning 1957 reserves be made to the reserves at the end of 1957.
(4)
Information to be filed.
Every company claiming a deduction for dividends to policyholders shall keep such permanent records as are necessary to establish the amount of dividends actually paid during the taxable year. Such company shall also keep a copy of the dividend resolution and any necessary supporting data relating to the amounts of dividends declared and to the amounts held or set aside as reserves for dividends to policyholders during the taxable year. The company shall file with its return a concise statement of the pertinent facts relating to its dividend policy for the year, the amount of dividends actually paid during the taxable year, and the amounts held or set aside as reserves for dividends to policyholders during the taxable year.
(d)
Illustration of principles.
The provisions of section 811(b) and this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
On December 31, 1959, M, a life insurance company, held $200 as reserves for dividends to policyholders due and payable in 1960. On March 10, 1960, M set aside an additional $50 as reserves for dividends to policyholders due and payable in 1960. During the taxable year 1960, M paid $240 as dividends to its policyholders and at the end of the taxable year 1960, held $175 as reserves for dividends to policyholders due and payable in 1961. No additional amount was set aside before March 16, 1961, as reserves for dividends to policyholders due and payable in 1961. For the taxable year 1960, subject to the limitation of section 809(f), M's deduction for dividends to policyholders is $165, computed as follows:
(1) Dividends paid to policyholders during the taxable year 1960
$240
(2) Decreased by the excess of item (a) over item (b):
(a) Reserves for dividends to policyholders as of 12-31-59 (including amounts set aside as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section)
$250
(b) Reserves for dividends to policyholders as of 12-31-60−
175

(3) Deduction for dividends to policyholders under sec. 811(b) (computed without regard to the limitation of sec. 809(f))
$165

# Example 2.
On December 31, 1960, S, a life insurance company, held $100 as reserves for dividends to policyholders due and payable in 1961. During the taxable year 1961, S paid $125 as dividends to its policyholders and at the end of the taxable year 1961, held $110 as reserves for dividends to policyholders due and payable in 1962. No additional amount was set aside for dividends to policyholders as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section before March 16, 1961, or March 16, 1962. For the taxable year 1961, subject to the limitation of section 809(f), S's deduction for dividends to policyholders is $135, computed as follows:
(1) Dividends paid to policyholders during the taxable year 1961
$125
(2) Increased by the excess of item (a) over item (b):
(a) Reserves for dividends to policyholders as of 12-31-61
$110
(b) Reserves for dividends to policyholders as of 12-31-60

# Example 3.
Assume the facts are the same as in example 2, except that on December 31, 1960, the amount held as reserves for dividends to policyholders due and payable in 1961 is $250. For the taxable year 1961, S's deduction for dividends to policyholders is zero, computed as follows:
(1) Dividends paid to policyholders during the taxable year 1961
$125
(2) Decreased by the excess of item (a) over item (b):
(a) Reserves for dividends to policyholders as of 12-31-60
$250
(b) Reserves for dividends to policyholders as of 12-31-61
110
-——
140
(3) Deduction for dividends to policyholders under sec. 811(b) (computed without regard to the limitation of sec. 809(f))
$0
Under the provisions of section 811(b)(2) and paragraph (b)(2) of this section, since the decrease in the reserves for dividends to policyholders during the taxable year, $140 ($250 minus $110), exceeds the dividends to policyholders paid during the taxable year 1961, $125, S shall include $15 (the amount of such excess) as a net decrease under section 809(c)(2) and paragraph (a)(2) of § 1.809-4 in determining its gain or loss from operations for 1961.

Sections 1.812-2 through 1.812-8, except as otherwise provided therein, are applicable only to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1957, and all references to sections of part I, subchapter L, chapter 1 of the Code are to the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended by the Life Insurance Company Income Tax Act of 1959 (73 Stat. 112) and the Act of October 23, 1962 (76 Stat. 1134).
[T.D. 6886, 31 FR 8689, June 23, 1966]
§ 1.812-2
Operations loss deduction.
(a)
Allowance of deduction.
Section 812 provides that a life insurance company shall be allowed a deduction in computing gain or loss from operations for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1957, in an amount equal to the aggregate of the operations loss carryovers and operations loss carrybacks to such taxable year. This deduction is referred to as the operations loss deduction. The loss from operations (computed under section 809), is the basis for the computation of the operations loss carryovers and operations loss carrybacks and ultimately for the operations loss deduction itself. Section 809(e)(5) provides that the net operating loss deduction provided in section 172 shall not be allowed a life insurance company since the operations loss deduction provided in section 812 and this paragraph shall be allowed in lieu thereof.
(b)
Steps in computation of operations loss deduction.
The three steps to be taken in the ascertainment of the operations loss deduction for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1957, are as follows:
(1) Compute the loss from operations for any preceding or succeeding taxable year from which a loss from operations may be carried over or carried back to such taxable year.
(2) Compute the operations loss carryovers to such taxable year from such preceding taxable years and the operations loss carrybacks to such taxable year from such succeeding taxable years.
(3) Add such operations loss carryovers and carrybacks in order to determine the operations loss deduction for such taxable year.
(c)
Statement with tax return.
Every life insurance company claiming an operations loss deduction for any taxable year shall file with its return for such year a concise statement setting forth the amount of the operations loss deduction claimed and all material and pertinent facts relative thereto, including a detailed schedule showing the computation of the operations loss deduction.
(d)
Ascertainment of deduction dependent upon operations loss carryback.
If a life insurance company is entitled in computing its operations loss deduction to a carryback which it is not able to ascertain at the time its return is due, it shall compute the operations loss deduction on its return without regard to such operations loss carryback. When the life insurance company ascertains the operations loss carryback,
it may within the applicable period of limitations file a claim for credit or refund of the overpayment, if any, resulting from the failure to compute the operations loss deduction for the taxable year with the inclusion of such carryback; or it may file an application under the provisions of section 6411 for a tentative carryback adjustment.
(e)
Law applicable to computations.
The following rules shall apply to all taxable years beginning after December 31, 1957:
(1) In determining the amount of any operations loss carryback or carryover to any taxable year, the necessary computations involving any other taxable year shall be made under the law applicable to such other taxable year.
(2) The loss from operations for any taxable year shall be determined under the law applicable to that year without regard to the year to which it is to be carried and in which, in effect, it is to be deducted as part of the operations loss deduction.
(3) The amount of the operations loss deduction which shall be allowed for any taxable year shall be determined under the law applicable for that year.
(f)
Special rules.
For purposes of taxable years beginning after December 31, 1954, and before January 1, 1958:
(1) The amount of any:
(i) Loss from operations;
(ii) Operations loss carryback; and
(iii) Operations loss carryover
shall be computed as if part I, subchapter L, chapter 1 of the Code (as in effect for 1958) and section 381(c)(22) applied to such taxable years.
(2) A loss from operations (determined in accordance with the provisions of section 812(b)(1)(C) and this paragraph) for such taxable years shall in no way affect the tax liability of any life insurance company for such taxable years. However, such loss may, to the extent allowed as an operations loss carryover under section 812, affect the tax liability of a life insurance company for a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1957. For example, for the taxable year 1956, X, a life insurance company, has a loss from operations (determined in accordance with the provisions of section 812(b)(1)(C) and this paragraph). Such loss shall in no way affect X's tax liability for the taxable years 1956 (the year of the loss), 1955 (a year to which such loss shall be carried back), or 1957 (a year to which such loss shall be carried forward). However, to the extent allowed under section 812, any amount of the loss for 1956 remaining after such carryback and carryforward shall be taken into account in determining X's tax liability for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1957.
[T.D. 6535, 26 FR 536, Jan. 20, 1961]
§ 1.812-3
Computation of loss from operations.
(a)
Modification of deductions.
A loss from operations is sustained by a life insurance company in any taxable year, if and to the extent that, for such year, there is an excess of the sum of the deductions provided by section 809(d) over the sum of (1) the life insurance company's share of each and every item of investment yield (including tax-exempt interest, partially tax-exempt interest, and dividends received) as determined under section 809(b)(3), and (2) the sum of the items of gross amount taken into account under section 809(c). In determining the loss from operations for purposes of section 812:
(i) No deduction shall be allowed under section 812 for the operations loss deduction.
(ii) The 85 percent limitation on dividends received provided by section 246 (b) as modified by section 809(d)(8)(B) shall not apply to the deductions otherwise allowed under:
(
a
) Section 243(a) in respect to dividends received by corporations,
(
b
) Section 244 in respect of dividends received on certain preferred stock of public utilities, and
(
c
) Section 245 in respect of dividends received from certain foreign corporations.
(b)
Illustration of principles.
The application of paragraph (a) of this section may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
For the taxable year 1960, X, a life insurance company, has items taken into account under section 809(c) amounting to $150,000, its share of the investment yield amounts to $250,000, and total deductions allowed by section 809(d) of $375,000, exclusive
of any operations loss deduction and exclusive of any deduction for dividends received. In 1960, X received as its share of dividends entitled to the benefits of section 243(a) the amount of $100,000. These dividends are included in X's share of the investment yield. X has no other deductions to which section 812(c) applies. On the basis of these facts, X has a loss from operations for the taxable year 1960 of $60,000, computed as follows:
Deductions for 1960
$375,000
Plus: Deduction for dividends received computed without regard to the limitation provided by sec. 246(b), as modified by sec. 809(d)(8)(B) (85% of $100,000)
85,000
Total deductions as modified by sec. 812(c)
460,000
Less: Sum of sec. 809(c) items and X's share of investment yield (including $100,000 of dividends)

§ 1.812-4
Operations loss carrybacks and operations loss carryovers.
(a)
In general
—(1)
Years to which loss may be carried.
In order to compute the operations loss deduction of a life insurance company the company must first determine the part of any losses from operations for any preceding or succeeding taxable years which are carryovers or carrybacks to the taxable year in issue. Except as otherwise provided by this paragraph, a loss from operations for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1954, shall be carried back to each of the 3 taxable years preceding the loss year and shall be carried forward to each of the 5 taxable years succeeding the loss year. Except as limited by section 812(e)(2) and paragraph (b) of § 1.812-6, if the life insurance company is a new company (as defined in section 812(e)(1)) for the loss year, the loss from operations shall be carried back to each of the 3 taxable years preceding the loss year and shall be carried forward to each of the 8 taxable years succeeding the loss year. In determining the span of years for which a loss from operations may be carried, taxable years in which a company does not qualify as a life insurance company (as defined in section 801(a)), or is not treated as a new company, shall be taken into account.
(2)
Special transitional rules.
(i) A loss from operations for any taxable year beginning before January 1, 1958, shall not be carried back to any taxable year beginning before January 1, 1955. Furthermore, a loss from operations for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1957, shall not be carried back to any taxable year beginning before January 1, 1958.
(ii) If for any taxable year a life insurance company has made an election under section 810(e) (relating to certain decreases in reserves for voluntary employees' beneficiary associations) which is effective for such taxable year, the provisions of section 812(b)(1) and subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall not apply with respect to any loss from operations for any taxable year beginning before January 1, 1958.
(3)
Illustration of principles.
The provisions of section 812(b)(1) and of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
P, a life insurance company, organized in 1940, has a loss from operations of $1,000 in 1958. This loss cannot be carried back, but shall be carried forward to each of the 5 taxable years following 1958.

# Example 2.
Q, a life insurance company, organized in 1940, has a loss from operations of $1,200 in 1959. This loss shall be carried back to the taxable year 1958 and then shall be carried forward to each of the 5 taxable years following 1959.

# Example 3.
R, a life insurance company, organized in 1940, has a loss from operations of $1,300 for the taxable year 1956. This loss shall first be carried back to the taxable year 1955 and then shall be carried forward to each of the 5 taxable years following 1956. The loss for 1956, carryback to 1955, and carryover to 1957 shall each be computed as if part I, subchapter L, chapter 1 of the Code (as in effect for 1958) applied to such taxable years.

# Example 4.
S, a life insurance company, organized in 1958 and meeting the provisions of section 812(e) (rules relating to new companies), has a loss from operations of $1,400 for the taxable year 1958. This loss cannot be carried back, but shall be carried forward to each of the 8 taxable years following 1958, provided, however, S is not a nonqualified corporation at any time during the loss year (1958) or any taxable year thereafter.

# Example 5.
T, a life insurance company, organized in 1954 and meeting the provisions of section 812(e) (rules relating to new companies), has a loss from operations of $1,500 for the taxable year 1956. This loss shall first be carried back to the taxable year 1955 and then carried forward to each of the 8 taxable years following 1956, provided, however, T is not a nonqualified corporation at any time
during the loss year (1956) or any taxable year thereafter. The loss for 1956, carryback to 1955, and carryover to 1957 shall each be computed as if part I of subchapter L (as in effect for 1958) applied to such taxable years.
(4)
Periods of less than 12 months.
A fractional part of a year which is a taxable year under sections 441(b) and 7701(a)(23) is a preceding or a succeeding taxable year for the purpose of determining under section 812 the first, second, etc., preceding or succeeding taxable year. For the determination of the loss from operations for periods of less than 12 months, see section 818(d) and the regulations thereunder.
(5)
Amount of loss to be carried.
The amount which is carried back or carried over to any taxable year is the loss from operations to the extent it was not absorbed in the computation of gain from operations for other taxable years, preceding such taxable year, to which it may be carried back or carried over. For the purpose of determining the gain from operations for any such preceding taxable year, the various operations loss carryovers and carrybacks to such taxable year are considered to be applied in reduction of the gain from operations in the order of the taxable years from which such losses are carried over or carried back, beginning with the loss for the earliest taxable year.
(6)
Corporate acquisitions.
For the computation of the operations loss carryovers in the case of certain acquisitions of the assets of a life insurance company by another life insurance company, see section 381(c)(22) and the regulations thereunder.
(b)
Portion of loss from operations which is a carryback or a carryover to the taxable year in issue
—(1)
Manner of computation.
(i) A loss from operations shall first be carried back to the earliest taxable year permissible under section 812(b) and paragraph (a) of this section for which such loss is allowable as a carryback or a carryover. The entire amount of the loss from operation shall be carried back to such earliest year.
(ii) Section 812(b)(2) provides that the portion of the loss from operations which shall be carried to each of the taxable years subsequent to the earliest taxable year shall be the excess (if any) of the amount of the loss from operations over the sum of the offsets (as defined in section 812(d) and paragraph (a) of § 1.812-5) for all prior taxable years to which the loss from operations may be carried.
(2)
Illustration of principles.
The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
T, a life insurance company (which is not a new company as defined in section 812(e)(1)), has a loss from operations for 1960. The entire amount of the loss from operations for 1960 shall first be carried back to 1958. The amount of the carryback to 1959 is the excess (if any) of the 1960 loss over the offset for 1958. The amount of the carryover to 1961 is the excess (if any) of the 1960 loss over the sum of the offsets for 1958 and 1959. The amount of the 1960 loss remaining (if any) to be carried over to 1962, 1963, or 1964 shall be computed in a like manner.
[T.D. 6535, 26 FR 537, Jan. 20, 1961]
§ 1.812-5
Offset.
(a)
Offset defined.
Section 812(d) defines the term “offset” for purposes of section 812(b)(2) and paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of § 1.812-4. For any taxable year the offset is only that portion of the increase in the operations loss deduction for the taxable year which is necessary to reduce the life insurance company taxable income (computed without regard to section 802(b)(3)) for such year to zero. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the offset shall be determined with the modifications prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section. Such modifications shall be made independently of, and without reference to, the modifications required by paragraph (a) of § 1.812-3 for purposes of computing the loss from operations itself.
(b)
Modifications
—(1)
Operations loss deduction
—(i)
In general.
Section 812(d)(2) provides that for purposes of section 812(d)(1) (relating to the definition of offset), the operations loss deduction for any taxable year shall be computed by taking into account only such losses from operations otherwise allowable as carryovers or as carrybacks to such taxable year as were sustained in taxable years preceding the taxable year in which the life insurance company sustained the loss from operations from which the offset is to be deducted. Thus, for such
purposes the loss from operations for the loss year or for any taxable year thereafter shall not be taken into account.
(ii)
Illustration of principles.
The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
In computing the operations loss deduction for 1960, Y, a life insurance company, has a carryover from 1958 of $9,000, a carryover from 1959 of $6,000, a carryback from 1961 of $18,000, and a carryback from 1962 of $10,000, or an aggregate of $43,000 in carryovers and carrybacks. Thus, the operations loss deduction for 1960, for purposes of determining the tax liability for 1960, is $43,000. However, in computing the offset for 1960 which is subtracted from the loss from operations for 1961 for the purpose of determining the portion of such loss which may be carried over to subsequent taxable years, the operations loss deduction for 1960 is $15,000, that is, the aggregate of the $9,000 carryover from 1958 and the $6,000 carryover from 1959. In computing the operations loss deduction for such purpose, the $18,000 carryback from 1961 and the $10,000 carryback from 1962 are disregarded. In computing the offset for 1960, however, which is subtracted from the loss from operations for 1962 for the purpose of determining the portion of such 1962 loss which may be carried over for subsequent taxable years, the operations loss deduction for 1960 is $33,000, that is, the aggregate of the $9,000 carryover from 1958, the $6,000 carryover from 1959, and the $18,000 carryback from 1961. In computing the operations loss deduction for such purpose, the $10,000 carryback from 1962 is disregarded.
(2)
Recomputation of deductions limited by section 809(f)
—(i)
In general.
If in any taxable year a life insurance company has deductions under section 809(d) (3), (5), and (6), as limited by section 809(f), and sustains a loss from operations in a succeeding taxable year which may be carried back as an operations loss deduction, such limitation and deductions shall be recomputed. This recomputation is required since the carryback must be taken into account for purposes of determining such limitation and deductions.
(ii)
Illustration of principles.
The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example:
(
a
)
Facts.
The books of P, a life insurance company, reveal the following facts:
Taxable investment income
Gain from operations
Loss from operations
1959
$9,000,000
$10,000,000
1960
($9,800,000)
The gain from operations thus shown is computed without regard to any operations loss deduction or deductions under section 809(d) (3), (5), and (6), as limited by section 809(f). Assume that for the taxable year 1959, P has (without regard to the limitation of section 809(f) or the operations loss deduction for 1959) a deduction under section 809(d)(3) of $2,500,000 for dividends to policyholders and no deductions under section 809(d) (5) or (6).
(
b
)
Determination of section 809(f) limitation and deduction for dividends to policyholders without regard to the operations loss deduction for 1959.
In order to determine gain or loss from operations for 1959, P must determine the deduction for dividends to policyholders for such year. Under the provisions of section 809(f), the amount of such deduction shall not exceed the sum of (
1
) the amount (if any) by which the gain from operations for such year (determined without regard to such deduction) exceeds P's taxable investment income for such year, plus (
2
) $250,000. Since the gain from operations as thus determined ($10,000,000) exceeds the taxable investment income ($9,000,000) by $1,000,000, the limitation on such deduction is $1,250,000 ($1,000,000 plus $250,000). Accordingly, only $1,250,000 of the $2,500,000 deduction for dividends to policyholders shall be allowed. The gain from operations for such year is $8,750,000 ($10,000,000 minus $1,250,000).
(
c
)
Recomputation of section 809(f) limitation and deduction for dividends to policyholders after application of the operations loss deduction for 1959.
Since P has sustained a loss from operations for 1960 which shall be carried back to 1959 as an operations loss deduction, it must recompute the section 809(f) limitation and deduction for dividends to policyholders. Taking into account the $9,800,000 operations loss deduction for 1959 reduces gain from operations for such year to $200,000 ($10,000,000 minus $9,800,000). Since the gain from operations as thus determined ($200,000) is
less than the taxable investment income ($9,000,000), the limitation on the deduction for dividends to policyholders is $250,000. Thus, only $250,000 of the $2,500,000 deduction for dividends to policyholders shall be allowed. The gain from operations for such year as thus determined is $9,750,000 ($10,000,000 minus $250,000) since for purposes of this determination the operations loss deduction for 1959 is not taken into account (see section 812(c)(1)). Accordingly, the offset for 1959 is $9,750,000 (the increase in the operations loss deduction for 1959, computed without regard to the carryback for 1960, which reduces life insurance company taxable income for 1959 to zero); thus, the portion of the 1960 loss from operations which shall be carried forward to 1961 is $50,000 (the excess of the 1960 loss ($9,800,000) over the offset for 1959 ($9,750,000)).
(3)
Minimum limitation.
The life insurance company taxable income, as modified under this paragraph, shall in no case be considered less than zero.

§ 1.812-6
New company defined.
Section 812(e) provides that for purposes of part I, subchapter L, chapter 1 of the Code, a life insurance company is a “new company” for any taxable year only if such taxable year begins not more than 5 years after the first day on which it (or any predecessor if section 381(c)(22) applies or would have applied if in effect) was authorized to do business as an insurance company.

Application of subtitle A and subtitle F.
Section 812(f) provides that except as modified by section 809(e) (relating to modifications of deduction items otherwise allowable under subtitle A of the Code) subtitles A and F of the Code shall apply to operations loss carrybacks and carryovers, and to the operations loss deduction, in the same manner and to the same extent that such subtitles apply in respect of net operation loss carrybacks, net operating loss carryovers, and the net operating loss deduction of corporations generally. For the computation of the operations loss carrybacks and carryovers, and of the operations loss deduction in the case of certain acquisitions of the assets of a life insurance company by another life insurance company, see section 381(c)(22) and the regulations thereunder.

# distributions to shareholders
§ 1.815-1
Taxable years affected.
Sections 1.815-2 through 1.815-6, except as otherwise provided therein, are applicable only to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1957, and all references to sections of part I, subchapter L, chapter 1 of the Code are to the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended by the Life Insurance Company Income Tax Act of 1959 (73 Stat. 112), the Act of October 10, 1962 (76 Stat. 808), and the Act of October 23, 1962 (76 Stat. 1134).
[T.D. 6886, 31 FR 8689, June 23, 1966]
§ 1.815-2
Distributions to shareholders.
(a)
In general.
Section 815 provides that every stock life insurance company subject to the tax imposed by section 802 shall establish and maintain two special surplus accounts for Federal income tax purposes. These special accounts are the shareholders surplus account (as defined in section 815(b) and § 1.815-3) and the policyholders surplus account (as defined in section 815(c) and § 1.815-4). To the extent that a distribution to shareholders (as defined in paragraph (c) of this section) is treated as being made out of the shareholders surplus account, no tax is imposed on the company with respect to such distribution. However, to the extent that a distribution to shareholders is treated as being made out of the policyholders surplus account, the amount subtracted from the policyholders surplus account by reason of such distribution shall be taken into account in determining life insurance company taxable income under section 802(b).
(b)
Priority system for distributions to shareholders.
(1) For purposes of section 815 (other than subsection (e) thereof relating to certain mutualizations) and section 802(b)(3) (relating to the determination of life insurance company taxable income), any distribution made to shareholders after December 31, 1958, shall be treated in the following manner:
(i) Distributions shall be treated as first being made out of the shareholders surplus account (as defined in section 815(b) and § 1.815-3);
(ii) Once the shareholders surplus account has been reduced to zero, distributions shall then be treated as being made out of the policyholders surplus account (as defined in section 815(c) and § 1.815-4) until that account has been reduced to zero; and
(iii) Finally, any distributions in excess of the amounts in the shareholders surplus account and the policyholders surplus account shall be treated as being made out of other accounts (as defined in § 1.815-5).
(2) For purposes of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, in order to determine whether a distribution (or any portion thereof) shall be treated as being made out of the shareholders surplus account, policyholders surplus account, or other accounts, the amount in such accounts at the end of any taxable year shall be the cumulative balance in such accounts at the end of the taxable year, computed without diminution by reason of a distribution (or any portion thereof) during the taxable year which is treated as being made out of such accounts. For example, on January 1, 1960, S, a stock life insurance company, had $1,000 in its shareholders surplus account and $3,000 in its policyholders surplus account. On November 1, 1960, S distributed $4,000 to its shareholders. Under the provisions of section 815(b)(2) and paragraph (b) of § 1.815-3, S added $5,000 to its shareholders surplus account for the taxable year 1960. Since the distributions to shareholders during the taxable year 1960, $4,000, does not exceed the cumulative balance in the shareholders surplus account at the end of the taxable year, computed without diminution by reason of distributions treated as made out of such account during the taxable year, $6,000 ($1,000 plus $5,000), the entire distribution is treated as being made out of the shareholders surplus account.
(3) Except in the case of a distribution in cash and as otherwise provided herein, the amount to be charged to the special surplus accounts referred to in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph with respect to any distributions to shareholders (as defined in section 815(a) and paragraph (c) of this section) shall be the fair market value of the property distributed, determined as of the date of distribution. However, for the amount of the adjustment to earnings and profits reflecting such distributions, see section 312 and the regulations thereunder. For a special rule relating to the determination of the amount to be charged to such special surplus accounts in the case of a distribution by a foreign life insurance company carrying on a life insurance business within the United States, see section 819(c)(1) and the regulations thereunder.
(c)
Distributions to shareholders defined.
(1) Except as otherwise provided in section 815(f) and subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, the term
distribution,
as used in section 815(a) and paragraph (b) of this section, means any distribution of property made by a life insurance company to its shareholders. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term
property
means any property (including money, securities, and indebtedness to the company) other than stock, or rights to acquire stock, in the company making the distribution. Thus, for example, the term includes a distribution which is considered a dividend under section 316, but is not limited to the extent that such distribution must be made out of the accumulated or current earnings and profits of the company making the distribution. For example, except as otherwise provided in section 815(f) and subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, there is a distribution within the meaning of this paragraph in any case in which a corporation acquires the stock of a shareholder in exchange for property in a redemption treated as a distribution in exchange for stock under section 302(a) or treated as a distribution of property under section 302(d). For special rules relating to distributions to shareholders in acquisition of stock pursuant to a plan of mutualization, see section 815(e) and paragraph (e) of § 1.815-6.
(2) The term
distribution,
as used in section 815(a) and paragraph (b) of this section, does not (except for purposes of section 815(a)(3) and (e)(2)(B)) include any distribution in redemption of stock issued prior to January 1, 1958, where such stock was at all times on and after the date of its issuance and on and before the date of its redemption limited as to the amount of dividends payable and was callable, at the option of the issuer, at a price not in excess of 105 percent of the sum of its issue price plus the amount of contribution to surplus (if any) made by the original purchaser at the time of his purchase.
[T.D. 6535, 26 FR 542, Jan. 20, 1961, as amended by T.D. 7189, 37 FR 12793, June 29, 1972]
§ 1.815-3
Shareholders surplus account.
(a)
In general.
Every stock life insurance company subject to the tax imposed by section 802 shall establish and maintain a shareholders surplus account. This account shall be established as of January 1, 1958, and the beginning or opening balance of the shareholders surplus account on that date shall be zero.
(b)
Additions to shareholders surplus account.
(1) The amount added to the shareholders surplus account for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1957, shall be the amount by which the sum of:
(i) The life insurance company taxable income (computed without regard to section 802(b)(3)),
(ii) In the case of a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1958, the amount (if any) by which the net long-term capital gain exceeds the net short-term capital loss, reduced (in the case of a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1961) by the amount referred to in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph,
(iii) The deduction for partially tax-exempt interest provided by section 242 (as modified by section 804(a)(3)), the deductions for dividends received provided by sections 243, 244, and 245 (as modified by section 809(d)(8)(B)), and the amount of interest excluded from gross income under section 103, and
(iv) The small business deduction provided by section 809(d)(10). Exceeds the taxes imposed for the taxable year by section 802(a), computed without regard to section 802(b)(3).
(c)
Subtractions from shareholders surplus account
—(1)
In general.
There shall be subtracted from the cumulative balance in the shareholders surplus account at the end of any taxable year, computed without diminution by reason of distributions made during the taxable year, the amount which is treated as being distributed out of such account under section 815(a) and paragraph (b) of § 1.815-2.
(2)
Special rule; distributions in 1958.
There shall be subtracted from the shareholders surplus account (to the extent thereof) for any taxable year beginning in 1958 the amount of the distributions to shareholders made by the company during 1958. For example, assume S, a stock life insurance company, had additions to its shareholders surplus account (as determined under section 815(b)(2) and paragraph (b) of this section) for the taxable year 1958 of $10,000, and actually distributed as dividends to its shareholders $8,000 during the year 1958. The balance in S's shareholders surplus account as of January 1, 1959, shall be $2,000. If S had distributed $12,000 as dividends in 1958, the balance in its shareholders surplus account as of January 1, 1959, would be zero and the other accounts referred to in section 815(a)(3) and paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of § 1.815-2 would be reduced by $2,000.
(d)
Illustration of principles.
The application of section 815(b) and this section may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
The books of S, a stock life insurance company, reflect the following items for the taxable year 1960.
Balance in shareholders surplus account as of 1-1-60

For purposes of determining the amount to be subtracted from its shareholders surplus account for the taxable year, S would first make up the following schedule in order to determine the cumulative balance in the shareholders surplus account at the end of the taxable year, computed without diminution by reason of distributions made during the taxable year:
(1) Balance in shareholders surplus account as of 1-1-60
$5,000
(2) Additions to account:
(a) Life insurance company taxable income computed without regard to sec. 802(b)(3)
$4,000
(b) Excess of net long-term capital gain over net short-term capital loss
1,700
(c) Tax-exempt interest included in gross investment income under sec. 804(b)

1,625
-————
4,375
(3) Cumulative balance in shareholders surplus account as of 12-31-60 (item (1) plus item (2))
9,375
Since the amount distributed to shareholders during the taxable year, $9,000, does not exceed the cumulative balance in the shareholders surplus account at the end of the taxable year, computed without diminution by reason of distributions made during the taxable year, $9,375, under the provisions of section 815(a), the entire distribution shall be treated as being made out of the shareholders surplus account. Thus, $9,000 shall be subtracted from the shareholders surplus account (leaving a balance of $375 in such account at the end of the taxable year) and S shall incur no additional tax liability by reason of the distribution to its shareholders during the taxable year 1960.
[T.D. 6535, 26 FR 542, Jan. 20, 1961, as amended by T.D. 7189, 37 FR 12793, June 29, 1972]
§ 1.815-4
Policyholders surplus account.
(a)
In general.
Every stock life insurance company subject to the tax imposed by section 802 shall establish and maintain a policyholders surplus account. This account shall be established as of January 1, 1959, and the beginning or opening balance of the policyholders surplus account on that date shall be zero.
(b)
Additions to policyholders surplus account.
The amount added to the policyholders surplus account for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1958, shall be the sum of:
(1) An amount equal to 50 percent of the amount by which the gain from operations for the taxable year exceeds the taxable investment income,
(2) The deduction allowed or allowable under section 809(d)(5) (as limited by section 809(f)) for certain nonparticipating contracts, and
(3) The deduction allowed or allowable under section 809(d)(6) (as limited by section 809(f)) for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1963, for group life and group accident and health insurance contracts, and for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1962, for accident and health insurance and group life insurance contracts.
(c)
Subtractions from policyholders surplus account
—(1)
In general.
There shall be subtracted from the cumulative balance in the policyholders surplus account at the end of any taxable year, computed without diminution by reason of distributions made during the taxable year, an amount equal to the sum of:
(i) The amount which (without regard to subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph) is treated under section 815(a) as distributed out of the policyholders surplus account for the taxable year, plus
(ii) The amount (determined without regard to section 802(a)(3)) by which the tax imposed for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1962, by section 802(a)(1), and for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1961, by section 802(a), is increased by reason of section 802(b)(3).
In addition, there shall be subtracted from the policyholders surplus account for the taxable year those amounts which, at the close of the taxable year, are subtracted or treated as subtracted from the policyholders surplus account under section 815(d) (1) and (4) and paragraphs (a) and (d) of § 1.815-6. For purposes of this paragraph, the subtractions from the policyholders surplus account shall be treated as made in the following order:
(
a
) First the amount determined under section 815(c)(3) by reason of distributions to shareholders during the taxable year which are treated as being made out of the policyholders surplus account;
(
b
) Next the amount elected to be subtracted from the policyholders surplus account for the taxable year under section 815(d)(1);
(
c
) Then the amount which is treated as a subtraction from the policyholders surplus account for the taxable year by reason of the limitation provided in section 815(d)(4); and
(
d
) Finally the amount taken into account upon termination as a life insurance company as provided in section 815(d)(2).

—(i)
Where life insurance company taxable income, computed without regard to section 802(b)(3), exceeds $25,000.
If the
life insurance company taxable income for any taxable year computed under section 802(b), computed without regard to section 802(b)(3), exceeds $25,000, the amount subtracted from the policyholders surplus account shall be determined by multiplying the amount treated as distributed out of such account by a ratio, the numerator of which is 100 percent and the denominator of which is 100 percent minus the sum of the normal tax rate and the surtax rate for the taxable year.
(ii)
Where life insurance company taxable income does not exceed $25,000.
If the life insurance company taxable income for any taxable year, computed under section 802(b), does not exceed $25,000, the amount subtracted from the policyholders surplus account shall be determined by multiplying the amount treated as distributed out of such account by a ratio, the numerator of which is 100 percent and the denominator of which is 100 percent minus the normal tax rate for the taxable year.
(iii)
Where life insurance company taxable income, computed without regard to section 802(b)(3) does not exceed $25,000, but computed with regard to section 802(b)(3) does exceed $25,000.
If the life insurance company taxable income for any taxable year, computed without regard to section 802(b)(3) does not exceed $25,000, but computed with regard to section 802(b)(3) does exceed $25,000, the amount subtracted from the policyholders surplus account shall be determined in the following manner:
(
a
) First, determine the amount by which $25,000 exceeds the amount determined under section 802(b) (1) and (2);
(
b
) Then, multiply the amount determined under (
a
) by a ratio, the numerator of which is 100 percent minus the normal tax rate and the denominator of which is 100 percent;
(
c
) Next, determine the amount by which the amount treated as distributed out of the policyholders surplus account exceeds the amount determined under (
b
) and multiply such excess by a ratio, the numerator of which is 100 percent and the denominator of which is 100 percent minus the sum of the normal tax rate and the surtax rate; and
(
d
) Finally, add the amounts determined under (
a
) and (
c
).
(3)
Illustration of principles.
The application of section 815(c)(3) and subparagraph (2) of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
The life insurance company taxable income of S, a stock life insurance company, computed without regard to section 802(b)(3), exceeds $25,000 for the taxable year 1959. Assume that of the amount distributed by S to its shareholders during the taxable year, $9,600 (as determined under section 815(a) and without regard to section 815(c)(3)(B)) is treated as distributed out of the policyholders surplus account. Since the sum of the normal tax rate (30%) and the surtax rate (22%) in effect for 1959 is 52 percent. S shall subtract $20,000 from its policyholders surplus account for the taxable year 1959, computed as follows:
$9,600 × 100 / (100 − 52) = $9,600 × 100 / 48 = $20,000
Of this amount, $9,600 is due to the application of section 815(c)(3)(A) and $10,400 to the application of section 815(c)(3)(B).

# Example 2.
Assume that for the taxable year 1960, S, a stock life insurance company, has taxable investment income of $1,000 and a gain from operations of $2,000. Assume further that of the amount distributed by S to its shareholders during the taxable year, $3,500 (as determined under section 815(a) and without regard to section 815(c)(3)(B)) is treated as distributed out of the policyholders surplus account. Since S's life insurance company taxable income does not exceed $25,000 for the taxable year and the normal tax rate in effect for 1960 is 30 percent, S shall subtract $5,000 from its policyholders surplus account for the taxable year 1960, computed as follows:
$3,500 × 100 / (100 − 30) = $3,500 × 100 / 70 = $5,000
Of this amount, $3,500 is due to the application of section 815(c)(3)(A), and $1,500 to the application of section 815(c)(3)(B).

# Example 3.
For the taxable year 1960, the life insurance company taxable income of S, a stock life insurance company, computed without regard to section 802(b)(3), is $10,000. Assume that of the amount distributed by S to its shareholders during the taxable year, $12,000 (as determined under section 815(a) and without regard to section 815(c)(3)(B)) is treated as distributed out of the policyholders surplus account. Since the life insurance company taxable income of S, computed with regard to section 802(b)(3), exceeds $25,000, in order to determine the amount to be subtracted from its policyholders surplus account, S would make up the following schedule:
(1) $25,000 minus life insurance company taxable income, computed without regard to sec. 802(b)(3) ($25,000 minus $10,000
$15,000
(2) Item (1) multiplied by 100 percent minus the normal tax rate as in effect for 1960, over 100 percent
($15,000 × (100−30) ÷ 100)
10,500
(3) Amount by which the amount treated as distributed out of policyholders surplus account ($12,000) exceeds item (2) ($10,500), multiplied by 100 percent over 100 percent minus the sum of the normal tax rate and the surtax rate as in effect for 1960
($1,500 × 100 ÷ (100−52))
3,125
(4) Item (1) plus item (3) ($15,000 plus $3,125)
18,125
For the taxable year 1960, S shall subtract $18,125 from its policyholders surplus account. Of this amount, $10,500 represents the distribution from the policyholders surplus account which is taxed at a 30 percent tax rate and $1,500 the distribution from the policyholders surplus account which is taxed at a 52 percent tax rate. Thus, of the amount subtracted from the policyholders surplus account for the taxable year 1960, $12,000 is due to the application of section 815(c)(3) (A), and $6,125 to the application of section 815(c)(3)(B).
(d)
Illustration of principles.
The application of section 815(c) and this section may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
The books of S, a stock life insurance company, reflect the following items for the taxable year 1960:
Taxable investment income
$25,000
Gain from operations
30,000
Tax base (sec. 802(b)(1) and (2))
27,500
Deduction for certain nonparticipating policies provided by sec. 809(d)(5) (as limited by sec. 809(f))
600
Deduction for group policies provided by sec. 809(d)(6) (as limited by sec. 809(f))
400
Amount distributed to shareholders
60,000
Cumulative balance in shareholders surplus account as of 12-31-60
36,000
Balance in policyholders surplus account as of 1-1-60
48,000
For purposes of determining the amount to be subtracted from its policyholders surplus account for the taxable year, S would first make up the following schedule in order to determine the cumulative balance in the policyholders surplus account at the end of the taxable year, computed without diminution by reason of distributions made during the taxable year:
(1) Balance in policyholders surplus account as of 1-1-60
$48,000
(2) Additions to account:
(a) 50 percent of the amount by which the gain from operations ($30,000) exceeds the taxable investment income ($25,000) (1/2 × $5,000)
$2,500
(b) The deduction for certain nonparticipating contracts provided by sec. 809(d)(5) (as limited by sec. 809(f))
600
(c) The deduction for group contracts provided by sec. 809(d)(6) (as limited by sec. 809(f))
400
————
3,500
(3) Cumulative balance in policyholders account as of 12-31-60 (item (1) plus item (2))
51,500
Under the provisions of section 815(a), since the amount distributed to shareholders during the taxable year, $60,000, exceeds the cumulative balance in the shareholders surplus at the end of the taxable year, computed without diminution by reason of distributions during the taxable year, $36,000, the shareholders surplus account shall first be reduced to zero. The remaining $24,000 ($60,000 minus $36,000) of the distribution shall then be treated as made out of the policyholders surplus account. Thus, since the tax base under section 802(b)(1) and (2) is in excess of $25,000, the total amount to be subtracted from the policyholders surplus account at the end of the taxable year would be $50,000 ($24,000 × 100 ÷ (100−52)). Of this amount $26,000 ($50,000 minus $24,000) represents the tax on the portion of the distribution to shareholders which is treated as being out of the policyholders surplus account.
(e)
Special rule for 1959 and 1960.
For a special transitional rule applicable to any increase in tax liability under section 802(b)(3) for the taxable years 1959 and 1960 which is due solely to the operation of section 815(c)(3) and this section, see section 802(a)(3).
[T.D. 6535, 26 FR 543, Jan. 20, 1961, as amended by T.D. 6886, 31 FR 8689, June 23, 1966; T.D. 9849, 84 FR 9236, Mar. 14, 2019]
§ 1.815-5
Other accounts defined.
The term
other accounts,
as used in section 815(a)(3) and paragraph (b) of § 1.815-2, means all amounts which are not specifically included in the shareholders surplus account under section 815(b) and paragraph (b) of § 1.815-3, or in the policyholders surplus account under section 815(c) and paragraph (b) of § 1.815-4. Thus, for example, other accounts includes amounts representing the increase in tax due to the operation of section 802(b)(3) which is not taken into account for the taxable years 1959 and 1960 because of the special transitional rule provided in section 802(a)(3), earnings and profits accumulated prior
to January 1, 1958, paid-in surplus, capital, etc. To the extent that a distribution (or any portion thereof) is treated as being made out of other accounts, no tax is imposed on the company with respect to such distribution.
[T.D. 6535, 26 FR 544, Jan. 20, 1961, as amended by T.D. 9849, 84 FR 9236, Mar. 14, 2019]
§ 1.815-6
Special rules.
(a)
Election to transfer amounts from policyholders surplus account to shareholders surplus account
—(1)
In general.
Section 815(d)(1) permits a life insurance company to elect, after the close of any taxable year for which it is a life insurance company, to subtract any amount (or any portion thereof) in its policyholders surplus account as of the close of the taxable year. The effect of such election is to subject the company to tax on the amounts elected to be subtracted for the taxable year for which the election applies. The amount so subtracted, less the amount of tax imposed with respect to such amount by reason of section 802(b)(3), shall be added to the shareholders surplus account as of the beginning of the taxable year following the taxable year for which the election applies and no further tax shall be imposed upon the company if the amount elected to be transferred to the shareholders surplus account is subsequently distributed to shareholders.
(2)
Manner and effect of election.
(i) The election provided by section 815(d)(1) and this section shall be made in a statement attached to the life insurance company's income tax return for any taxable year for which the company desires the election to apply. The statement shall include the name and address of the taxpayer, shall be signed by the taxpayer (or his duly authorized representative), and shall be filed not later than the date prescribed by law (including extensions thereof) for filing the return for such taxable year. In addition, the statement shall indicate that the company has made the election provided under section 815(d)(1) for the taxable year and the amount elected to be subtracted from the policyholders surplus account.
(ii) An election made under section 815(d)(1)(B) and subdivision (i) of this subparagraph shall be effective only with respect to the taxable year for which the election is made. Thus, the company must make a new election for each taxable year for which it desires the election to apply. Once such an election has been made for any taxable year it may not be revoked.
(3) The application of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
For the taxable year 1960, the life insurance company taxable income of S, a stock life insurance company, computed without regard to section 802(b)(3), exceeds $25,000. Assume that S elects to subtract $20,000 from its policyholders surplus account under section 815(d)(1) for the taxable year. Since S is subject to a 52 percent tax rate, the tax on the amount elected to be subtracted from the policyholders surplus account (as of the close of the taxable year 1960) is $10,400 ($20,000 × 52 percent). Thus, the amount to be added to the shareholders surplus account as of January 1, 1961, is $9,600 (the amount subtracted from the policyholders surplus account by virtue of the section 815(d)(1) election, less the tax imposed upon such amount by reason of section 802(b)(3), or $20,000 minus $10,400).
(b)
Termination as life insurance company
—(1)
Effect of termination.
Except as provided in section 381(c)(22) (relating to carryovers in certain corporate readjustments), section 815(d)(2)(A) provides that if for any taxable year the taxpayer is not an insurance company (as defined in paragraph (a) of § 1.801-3), or if for any two successive taxable years the taxpayer is not a life insurance company (as defined in section 801(a) and paragraph (b) of § 1.801-3), the amount taken into account under section 802(b)(3) for the last preceding year for which the company was a life insurance company shall be increased (after the application of section 815(d)(2)(B)) by the entire balance in the policyholders surplus account at the close of such last preceding taxable year.
(2)
Effect of certain distributions.
If for any taxable year the taxpayer is an insurance company (as defined in paragraph (a) of § 1.801-3) but is not a life insurance company (as defined in section 801(a) and paragraph (b) of § 1.801-3), section 815(d)(2)(B) provides that any distribution to shareholders during such taxable year shall be treated as having been made on the last day of
the last preceding taxable year for which the company was a life insurance company.
(3)
Examples.
The application of section 815(d)(2) and this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
At the end of the taxable year 1959, the balance in the policyholders surplus account of S, a life insurance company within the meaning of section 801(a) and paragraph (b) of § 1.801-3, is $12,000. If S fails to qualify as an insurance company (as defined in paragraph (a) of § 1.801-3) for the taxable year 1960, and section 381(c)(22) does not apply, under the provisions of section 815(d)(2)(A), the entire balance of $12,000 in the policyholders surplus account at the end of 1959, the last year S was a life insurance company, shall be taken into account under section 802(b)(3) for purposes of determining S's tax liability for the taxable year 1959.

# Example 2.
Assume the facts are the same as in example 1, except that for the taxable years 1960 and 1961, S qualifies as an insurance company (as defined in paragraph (a) of § 1.801-3) but does not qualify as a life insurance company within the meaning of section 801(a) and paragraph (b) of § 1.801-3. Assume further that as a result of a distribution by S to its shareholders in 1960, $4,800 (as determined under section 815(a) and without regard to section 815(c)(3)(B)) is treated as distributed out of the policyholders surplus account. Under the provisions of section 815(d)(2)(B), if section 381(c)(22) does not apply, any distribution to shareholders during the taxable years 1960 and 1961 shall be treated as having been made on December 31, 1959 (the last day of the last preceding taxable year for which S was a life insurance company). Thus, assuming S is subject to a 52 percent tax rate on additions to life insurance company taxable income, $10,000 ($4,800 plus $5,200, the tax on the portion of the distribution treated as made out of the policyholders surplus account) shall be treated as being subtracted from the policyholders surplus account at the end of 1959 and shall be taken into account under section 802(b)(3) for purposes of determining S's tax liability for the taxable year 1959. Under the provisions of section 815(d)(2)(A), the entire balance of $2,000 ($12,000 minus $10,000) in the policyholders surplus account at the end of 1959 (after the application of section 815(d)(2)(B)), shall also be taken into account under section 802(b)(3) for purposes of determining S's tax liability for the taxable year 1959.
(c)
Treatment of certain indebtedness.
Section 815(d)(3) provides that if a taxpayer makes any payment in discharge of its indebtedness and such indebtedness is attributable to a distribution by the taxpayer to its shareholders after February 9, 1959, the amount of such payment shall be treated as a distribution in cash to shareholders both for purposes of section 802(b)(3) and section 815. However, this paragraph shall only apply to the extent that the distribution of such indebtedness to shareholders was treated as being out of accounts other than the shareholders and policyholders surplus accounts at the time of distribution.
(d)
Limitation on amount in policyholders surplus account
—(1)
In general.
Section 815(d)(4) provides a limitation on the amount that any life insurance company may accumulate in its policyholders surplus account. If the policyholders surplus account at the end of any taxable year (computed without regard to this paragraph) exceeds whichever of the following is the greatest:
(i) 15 percent of life insurance reserves (as defined in section 801(b) and paragraph (a) of § 1.801-4) at the end of the taxable year.
(ii) 25 percent of the amount by which the life insurance reserves at the end of the taxable year exceed the life insurance reserves at the end of 1958, or
(iii) 50 percent of the net amount of the premiums and other consideration taken into account for the taxable year under section 809(c)(1),
then such excess shall be treated as a subtraction from the policyholders surplus account as of the end of such taxable year. The amount so treated as subtracted, less the amount of tax imposed with respect to such amount by reason of section 802(b)(3), shall be added to the shareholders surplus account at the beginning of the succeeding taxable year.
(2)
Example.
The application of the limitation contained in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
The books of S, a stock life insurance company, reflect the following items for the taxable year 1960:
Balance in policyholders surplus account, computed without regard to sec. 815(d)(4), as of 12-31-60
$175
Life insurance reserves (as defined in sec. 801(b)) as of 12-31-60
4,500
Life insurance reserves (as defined in sec. 801(b)) as of 12-31-58
3,900
Premiums and other consideration taken into account for the taxable year under sec. 809(c)(1)
310
In order to determine the limitations on the amount that it may accumulate in its policyholders surplus account at the end of the taxable year under section 815(d)(4), S would make up the following schedule:
(1) 15 percent of life insurance reserves at the end of the taxable year (15% × $4,500)
$675
(2) 25 percent of amount by which life insurance reserves at the end of the taxable year ($4,500) exceed life insurance reserves as of 12-31-58 ($3,900) (25% × $600)
150
(3) 50 percent of premiums and other consideration taken into account under sec. 809(c)(1) for the taxable year (50% × $310)
155
(4) Limitation on policyholders surplus account (the greatest of items (1), (2), or (3))
675
Since the balance in the policyholders surplus account at the end of the taxable year 1960, $175, does not exceed the limitation provided by section 815(d)(4), $675, S is not required to make any further adjustment to its policyholders surplus account at the end of the taxable year.
(e)
Special rule for certain mutualizations
—(1)
In general.
Section 815(e) provides a rule for determining priorities which shall operate in place of section 815(a) and paragraph (b) of § 1.815-2 where a life insurance company makes any distribution to its shareholders after December 31, 1958, in acquisition of stock pursuant to a plan of mutualization. Section 815(e)(1) provides that such a distribution shall first be treated as being made out of paid-in capital and paid-in surplus, and, to the extent thereof, no tax shall be imposed on the company with respect to such distribution. Thereafter, distributions made pursuant to such plan of mutualization shall be treated as made in two allocable parts. One part shall be treated as being made out of other accounts (as defined in § 1.815-5) and the company shall incur no tax with respect to such portion of the distribution. The other part shall be treated as a distribution to which section 815(a) and paragraph (b) of § 1.815-2 applies. Thus, such portion of the distribution shall be treated as first being made out of the shareholders surplus account (as defined in section 815(b) and § 1.815-3), to the extent thereof, and then out of the policyholders surplus account (as defined in section 815(c) and § 1.815-4), to the extent thereof. See paragraph (a) of § 1.815-2. For purposes of this paragraph, a distribution shall be considered as being made pursuant to a plan of mutualization only if the requirements of applicable State law for the adoption of such plan (as, for example, approval by the requisite majority of the board of directors, shareholders, and policyholders) have been fulfilled.
(2)
Allocation ratio.
Section 815(e)(2)(A) provides an allocation ratio which when applied to the amount distributed under a plan of mutualization in excess of the balance in the paid-in capital and paid-in surplus accounts determines the portion of such excess to be treated as distributed out of the shareholders surplus account, policyholders surplus account, or other accounts. The numerator of this ratio is the excess of the assets of the company (as defined in section 805(b)(4) and paragraph (a)(4) of § 1.805-5) over the total liabilities (including reserves), both determined as of December 31, 1958, and adjusted in the manner provided in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph. The denominator of this ratio is the amount included in the numerator plus the amounts in the shareholders surplus account and policyholders surplus account, all determined as of the beginning of the year of the distribution.
(3)
Adjustment for certain distributions.
Section 815(e)(2)(B) provides that if between 1958 and the year of distribution the taxpayer has been treated as having made a distribution (under a plan of mutualization or otherwise) which is treated as a return of paid-in capital and paid-in surplus or as out of other accounts (as defined in § 1.815-5), the aggregate amount of any such prior distributions must be subtracted from the numerator and denominator in all cases where the allocation ratio provided by subparagraph (2) of this paragraph applies.
(f)
Recomputation required as a result of a subsequent loss from operations under section 812
—(1)
In general.
Any amounts added to or subtracted from the special surplus accounts referred to in section 815(a) and paragraph (b) of § 1.815-2 for any taxable year shall be adjusted to the extent necessary to properly reflect a subsequent loss from operations which under section 812 is carried back to the taxable year for which such additions or subtractions were made.
(2)
Example.
The application of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
Assume that for the taxable years 1959 through 1961, the books of S, a stock life insurance company subject to a 30 percent tax rate for all taxable years involved, reflect the following items:

Assume further that S has a loss from operations for the taxable year 1962 of $25. Under the provisions of section 812, the $25 loss from operations would be carried back to the taxable year 1959 and would reduce the 1959 tax base under section 802(b)(1) and (2) to $35 ($60 minus $25). After adjustments reflecting the 1962 loss from operations, the results for the taxable years 1959 through the beginning of 1962 would be as follows:

As a result of the loss from operations for 1962, the election under section 815(d)(1) for the taxable year 1959 has become inapplicable in its entirety since the balance in the policyholders surplus account at the end of 1959, as recomputed, is zero. Thus, S would be entitled to a total refund of $7.50 for the taxable year 1959. Of this amount, $4.50 is due to the recomputation of the section 802(b)(1) and (2) tax base and $3 to the amount of tax paid by reason of the election under section 815(d)(1).

§ 1.816-1
Life insurance reserves.
(a)
Definition of life insurance reserves.
Except as provided in section 816(h), a reserve that meets the requirements of section 816(b)(1) and (2) will not be disqualified as a life insurance reserve solely because the method used to compute the reserve takes into account other factors, provided that the method used to compute the reserve is a tax reserve method as defined in section 807(d)(3) and that such reserve is not an asset adequacy reserve as described in § 1.807-1(b).
(b)
Applicability date.
The section applies to taxable years beginning after
October 13, 2020.
However, a taxpayer may choose to apply the rules of this section for a taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017, the effective date of the revision of section 807 by Public Law 115-97, and on or before
October 13, 2020,
provided the taxpayer consistently applies the rules of this section to that taxable year and all subsequent taxable years. See section 7805(b)(7).

§ 1.817-1
Taxable years affected.
Except as otherwise provided therein, §§ 1.817-2 through 1.817-4 are applicable only to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1957, and all references to sections of part I, subchapter L, chapter 1 of the Code are to the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended by the Life Insurance Company Income Tax Act of 1959 (73 Stat. 112) and section 3 of the Act of October 23, 1962 (76 Stat. 1134).
[T.D. 6886, 31 FR 8689, June 23, 1966]
§ 1.817-2
Treatment of capital gains and losses.
(a)
In general.
For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1958, and before January 1, 1962, if the net long-term capital gain (as defined in section 1222(7)) of any life insurance company exceeds its net short-term capital loss (as defined in section 1222(6)), section 802(a)(2) prior to its amendment by section 3 of the Act of October 23, 1962 (76 Stat. 1134), imposes a separate tax equal to 25 percent of such excess. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1961, if the net long-term capital gain of any life insurance company exceeds its net short-term capital loss, section 802(a)(2) imposes an alternative tax in lieu of the tax imposed by section 802(a)(1), if and only if such alternative tax is less than the tax imposed by section 802(a)(1). Except as modified by section 817 (rules relating to certain gains and losses), the general rules of the Code relating to gains and losses, such as subchapter O (relating to gain or loss on disposition of property), subchapter P (relating to capital gains and losses), etc., shall apply with respect to life insurance companies.
(b)
Modification of section 1221 and 1231.
(1) In the case of a life insurance company, section 817(a)(1) provides that for purposes of applying section 1231(a) (relating to property used in the trade or business and involuntary conversions), the term
property used in the trade or business
shall be treated as including only:
(i) Property used in carrying on an insurance business, of a character subject to the allowance for depreciation under section 167 (even though fully depreciated), held for more than 1 year (6 months for taxable years beginning before 1977; 9 months taxable years beginning in 1977), and real property used in carrying on an insurance business, held for more than 1 year (6 months for taxable years beginning before 1977; 9 months taxable years beginning in 1977), and which is not:
(
a
) Property of a kind which would properly be includible in the inventory of the taxpayer if on hand at the close of the taxable year;
(
b
) Property held by the taxpayer primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business; or
(
c
) A copyright, a literary, musical, or artistic composition, a letter or memorandum, or similar property held by a taxpayer described in section 1221(3). In the case of a letter, memorandum, or property similar to a letter or memorandum, this subdivision (
c
) applies only to sales and other dispositions occurring after July 25, 1969.
(ii) The cutting or disposal of timber, or the disposal of coal or iron ore, to the extent considered arising from a sale or exchange by reason of the provisions of section 631 and the regulations thereunder.
(2) In the case of a life insurance company, section 817(a)(2) provides that for purposes of applying section 1221(2) (relating to the exclusion of certain property from the term capital asset), the reference to property used in trade or business shall be treated as including only property used in carrying on an insurance business.
(3) Section 1231(a), as modified by section 817(a)(1) and subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, shall apply to recognized gains and losses from the following:
(i) The sale, exchange, or involuntary conversion of the following property, if held for more than 1 year (6 months for taxable years beginning before 1977; 9 months taxable years beginning in 1977):
(
a
) The home office and branch office buildings (including land) owned and occupied by the life insurance company;
(
b
) Furniture and equipment owned by the life insurance company and used in the home office and branch office
buildings occupied by the life insurance company; and
(
c
) Automobiles and other depreciable personal property used in connection with the operations conducted in the home office and branch office buildings occupied by the life insurance company.
(ii) The involuntary conversion of capital assets held for more than 1 year (6 months for taxable years beginning before 1977; 9 months taxable years beginning in 1977).
(iii) The cutting or disposal of timber, or the disposal of coal or iron ore, to the extent considered arising from a sale or exchange by reason of the provisions of section 631 and the regulations thereunder.
(4) Section 1221(2), as modified by section 817(a)(2) and subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, shall include only the following property;
(i) The home office and branch office buildings (including land) owned and occupied by the life insurance company;
(ii) Furniture and equipment owned by the life insurance company and used in the home office and branch office buildings occupied by the life insurance company; and
(iii) Automobiles and other depreciable personal property used in connection with the operations conducted in the home office and branch office buildings occupied by the life insurance company.
(5) If an asset described in subparagraph (3) (i)(
a
), (
b
), or (
c
) or subparagraph (4) of this paragraph, or any portion thereof, is also an “investment asset” (an asset from which gross investment income, as defined in section 804(b), is derived), such asset, or portion thereof, shall not be treated as an asset used in carrying on an insurance business. Accordingly, the gains or losses from the sale or exchange (or considered as from the sale or exchange) of depreciable assets attributable to any trade or business, other than the insurance trade or business, carried on by the life insurance company, such as operating a radio station, housing development, or a farm, or renting various pieces of real estate shall be treated as gains or losses from the sale or exchange of a capital asset unless such asset is involuntarily converted (within the meaning of paragraph (e) of § 1.123-1).
(c)
Illustration of principles.
The provisions of section 817(a) and this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
L, a life insurance company, has recognized gains and losses for the taxable year 1959 from the sale or involuntary conversion of the following items:
Gains
Losses
Stocks, held for more than 6 months
$100,000
Bonds, held for more than 6 months
$5,000
Housing development, held for more than 6 months
400,000
Branch office building owned and occupied by L, held for more than 6 months
115,000
Furniture and equipment used in the investment department, held for more than 6 months
30,000
Radio station, held for more than 6 months
200,000
Involuntary conversion of apartment building, held for more than 6 months
7,000
The recognized gains and losses from the sale of the stocks, bonds, housing development, and radio station shall be treated as gains and losses from the sale of capital assets since such items are capital assets within the meaning of section 1221 (as modified by section 817(a)(2)). Accordingly, the provisions of section 1231 shall not apply to the sale of such capital assets. However, the provisions of section 1231 (as modified by section 817(a)(1)) shall apply to the sale of the branch office building and the furniture and equipment, and the apartment building involuntarily converted. Since the aggregate of the recognized losses ($115,000) exceeds the aggregate of the recognized gains ($37,000), the gains and losses are treated as ordinary gains and losses.

# Example 2.
Y, a life insurance company, owns a twenty-story home office building, having an adjusted basis of $15,000,000, ten floors of which it rents to various tenants, one floor of which is utilized by it in operating its investment department, and the remaining nine floors of which are occupied by it in carrying on its insurance business. If in 1960, Y sells the building for $10,000,000, Y must first apportion its basis between that portion of the building (one-half) used in carrying on an insurance business, and that portion of the building (one-half) classified as an “investment asset”, before it can determine the character of the loss attributable to each portion of the building. For such purpose, the one floor utilized by Y in operating
its investment department is treated as used in carrying on an insurance business. Assuming that each portion of the building bears an equal (one-half) relation to the basis of the entire building, Y (without regard to section 817(b)) would have a $2,500,000 ordinary loss on that portion used in carrying on an insurance business (assuming that Y had no gains subject to section 1231), and a $2,500,000 capital loss on that portion of the building classified as an investment asset.

§ 1.817-3
Gain on property held on December 31, 1958, and certain substituted property acquired after 1958.
(a)
Limitation on gain recognized on property held on December 31, 1958.
(1) Section 817(b)(1) limits the amount of gain that shall be recognized on the sale or other disposition of property other than insurance and annuity contracts (and contracts supplementary thereto) and property described in section 1221(1) (relating to stock in trade or inventory-type property) if:
(i) The property was held (or treated as held within the meaning of paragraph (c)(1) of this section) by a life insurance company on December 31, 1958;
(ii) The taxpayer has been a life insurance company at all times on and after December 31, 1958, including the date of the sale or other disposition of the property; and
(iii) The fair market value of the property on December 31, 1958, exceeds the adjusted basis for determining gain as of such date.
The gain on the sale or other disposition of such property shall be limited to an amount (but not less than zero) equal to the amount by which the gain (determined without regard to section 817(b)(1)) exceeds the difference between fair market value of such property on December 31, 1958, and the adjusted basis for determining gain as of such date. Accordingly, the tax imposed under section 802(a) shall apply with respect to the amount of gain so limited. In addition, in the case of a stock life insurance company, the amount of such gain shall be taken into account under section 815(b)(2)(A)(ii) for purposes of determining the amount to be added to the shareholders surplus account (as defined in section 815(b) and § 1.815-3) for the taxable year. Furthermore, the amount of the gain (determined without regard to section 817(b)(1) and this paragraph) which is not taken into account under section 802(a) and under paragraph (f) of § 1.802-3 by reason of the application of section 817(b)(1) shall be included in other accounts (as defined in § 1.815-5) by such a company for the taxable year.
(2) Section 817(b)(1) and subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall not apply for purposes of determining loss with respect to property held on December 31, 1958.
(b)
Illustration of principles.
The application of section 817(b)(1) and paragraph (a) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
On December 31, 1958, J, a stock life insurance company, owned stock of Z Corporation and on such date the stock had an adjusted basis for determining gain of $5,000 and a fair market value of $6,000. On August 1, 1959, the company sells such stock for $8,000. Assuming J qualifies as a life insurance company for the taxable year 1959, and applying the provisions of section 817(b)(1) and paragraph (a) of this section, the gain recognized (assuming no adjustment to basis for the period since December 31, 1958) on the sale shall be limited to $2,000 (the amount by which the gain realized, $3,000, exceeds the difference, $1,000, between the fair market value, $6,000, and the adjusted basis, $5,000, for determining gain on December 31, 1958). Thus, J shall take into account $2,000 under section 815(b)(2)(A)(ii) for purposes of determining the amount to be added to its shareholders surplus account for the taxable year and shall include $1,000 in other accounts for the taxable year.

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in example 1, except that the selling price is $5,800. In such case, no gain shall be recognized even though there is a realized gain of $800 since such realized gain does not exceed the difference ($1,000) between the fair market value ($6,000) and the adjusted basis ($5,000) for determining gain on December 31, 1958. Furthermore, no loss shall be realized or recognized as a result of this transaction. Thus, J shall include $800 in other accounts for the taxable year and shall not take into account any amount under section 815(b)(2)(A)(ii).

# Example 3.
The facts are the same as in example 1, except that the adjusted basis for determining loss is $5,000 and the selling
price is $4,500. In such case, since J has sustained a loss, section 817(b)(1) does not apply.
(c)
Certain substituted property acquired after December 31, 1958.
Section 817(b)(2) provides that if a life insurance company acquires property after December 31, 1958, in exchange for property actually held by the company on December 31, 1958, and the property acquired has a substituted basis within the meaning of section 1016(b) and § 1.1016-10, the following rules shall apply:
(1) For purposes of section 817(b)(1), such acquired property shall be deemed as having been held continuously by the taxpayer since the beginning of the holding period thereof as determined under section 1223;
(2) The fair market value and adjusted basis referred to in section 817(b)(1) shall be that of that property for which the holding period taken into account includes December 31, 1958;
(3) Section 817(b)(1) shall apply only if the property or properties, the holding periods of which are taken into account, were held only by life insurance companies after December 31, 1958, during the holding periods so taken into account;
(4) The difference between the fair market value and adjusted basis referred to in section 817(b)(1) shall be reduced (but not below zero) by the excess of (i) the gain that would have been recognized but for section 817(b) on all prior sales or other dispositions after December 31, 1958, of properties referred to in section 817(b)(2)(C) over (ii) the gain that was recognized on such sales or other dispositions; and
(5) The basis of such acquired property shall be determined as if the gain which would have been recognized but for section 817(b) were recognized gain.
For purposes of section 817(b)(2) and this paragraph, the term
property
does not include insurance and annuity contracts (and contracts supplementary thereto) and property described in section 1221(1) (relating to stock in trade or inventory-type property). Furthermore, the provisions of section 817(b)(1) and paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall not apply for purposes of determining loss with respect to property described in section 817(b)(2) and this paragraph.
(d)
Illustration of principles.
The application of section 817(b)(2) and paragraph (c) of this section may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
Assume that W, a life insurance company, owns property B on December 31, 1958, at which time its adjusted basis was $1,000 and its fair market value was $1,800. On January 31, 1960, in a transaction to which section 1031 (relating to exchange of property held for productive use or investment) applies, W receives property H having a fair market value of $1,700 plus $300 in cash in exchange for property B. The gain realized on the transaction, without regard to section 817(b) is $1,000 (assuming no adjustments to basis for the period since December 31, 1958). Under the provisions of section 817(b)(1) the gain is limited to $200. The entire $200 shall be recognized since such amount is less than the amount of gain ($300) which would be recognized under section 1031. Applying the provisions of section 817(b)(2) and paragraph (c) of this section, the basis of property H shall be determined as if the entire $300 of cash received is recognized gain. Thus, the basis of property H under section 1031 is $1,000 ($1,000 (the basis of property B) minus $300 (the amount of money received) plus $300 (the recognized gain of $200 plus $100 which would have been recognized but for section 817(b)). If W later sells property H for $2,200 cash, and assuming no further adjustments to its basis of $1,000, the gain realized is $1,200, but due to the application of section 817(b)(2) the amount of gain recognized is $500, computed as follows:
Selling price
$2,200
Less: Adjusted basis as of date of sale
1,000
Gain realized
1,200
Fair market value as of 12-31-58
$1,800
Adjusted basis as of 12-31-58
1,000
Excess of fair market value over adjusted basis
800
Less: Excess of gain which would have been recognized on all prior dispositions but for sec. 817(b) over gain recognized on all prior dispositions ($300 minus $200)
100

§ 1.817-4
Special rules.
(a)
Limitation on capital loss carryovers.
Section 817(c) provides that a net capital loss (as defined in section 1222(10)) for any taxable year beginning before January 1, 1959, shall not be taken into account. For any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1958,
the provisions of part II, subchapter P, chapter 1 of the Code (relating to the treatment of capital losses) shall be applicable to life insurance companies for purposes of determining the tax imposed by section 802(a) and § 1.802-3 (relating to the imposition of tax in case of capital gains).
(b)
Gain on transactions occurring prior to January 1, 1959.
For purposes of part I, subchapter L, chapter 1 of the Code, section 817(d) provides that:
(1) There shall be excluded from tax any gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset, and any gain considered as gain from sale or exchange of a capital asset, which results from sales or other dispositions of property prior to January 1, 1959; and
(2) Any gain after December 31, 1958, resulting from the sale or other disposition of property prior to January 1, 1959, which, but for this subparagraph would be taken into account under section 1231, shall not be taken into account under section 1231.
For example, if a life insurance company makes an installment sale of a capital asset prior to January 1, 1959, and payments are received after such date, any capital gain attributable to such sale shall not be taken into account for purposes of section 802(a). Furthermore, any gain referred to in subparagraphs (1) and (2) and the preceding sentence shall not be taken into account in determining the excess of the net short-term capital gain over the net long-term capital loss (and for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1961, the excess of the net long-term capital gain over the net short-term capital loss) for purposes of computing taxable investment income under section 804(a)(2) or gain or loss from operations under section 809(b).
(c)
Certain reinsurance transactions in 1958.
For purposes of part I, section 817(e) provides that where a life insurance company reinsures (or sells) all of its insurance contracts of a particular type, such as an entire industrial department, in either a single transaction, or in a series of related transactions, all of which occurred during 1958, and the reinsuring (or purchasing) company or companies assume all liabilities under such contracts, such reinsurance (or sale) shall be treated as the sale of a capital asset. However, such transaction shall be subject to the provisions of section 806(a) and § 1.806-3 (relating to adjustments for certain changes in reserves and assets).
(d)
Certain other reinsurance transactions.
(1) For any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1958, the reinsurance of all or a part of the insurance contracts of a particular type by a life insurance company, in either a single transaction, or in a series of related transactions, occurring in any such taxable year, whereby the reinsuring company or companies assume all liabilities under such contracts, shall not be treated as the sale or exchange of a capital asset but shall be subject to the provisions of section 806(a) and 809 and the regulations thereunder. However, if in connection with a transaction described in the preceding sentence the reinsured or reinsurer transfers an asset which is a capital asset within the meaning of section 1221 (as modified by section 817(a)(2)), such transfer shall be treated as the sale or exchange of a capital asset by the transferor.
(2)(i) The consideration paid by the reinsured to the reinsurer in connection with a transaction described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall be treated as an item of deduction under section 809(d)(7). However any amount received by the reinsured from the reinsurer shall be applied against and reduce (but not below zero) the amount of such consideration, and to the extent that it exceeds such consideration, shall be treated as an item of gross amount under section 809(c)(3).
(ii) In connection with an assumption reinsurance (as defined in paragraph (a)(7)(ii) of § 1.809-5) transaction, a reinsurer shall in any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1957:
(A) Treat the consideration received from the reinsured in any such taxable year as an item of gross amount under section 809(c)(1), and
(B) Treat any amount paid to the reinsured for the purchase of such contracts, to the extent such amount meets the requirements of section 162, as a deferred expense that may be amortized over the reasonably estimated life (as defined in paragraph (d)(2)(iv) of this section) of the contracts reinsured
and treat the portion of the expense so amortized in each taxable year as a deduction under section 809(d)(12) irrespective of the taxable year in which such amount was paid to the reinsured.
(iii) For purposes of paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section where the reinsured transfers to the reinsurer in connection with the assumption reinsurance transaction a net amount which is less than the increase in the reinsurer's reserves resulting from the transaction, the reinsurer shall be treated as:
(A) Having received from the reinsured consideration in an amount equal to the net amount of the increase in the reinsurer's reserves resulting from the transaction, and
(B) Having paid the reinsured an amount for the purchase of the contracts equal to the excess of the amount of such increase in the reinsurer's reserves over the net amount received from the reinsured.
(iv) For purposes of this subparagraph, the term
reasonably estimated life
means the period during which the contract reinsured remains in force. Such period shall be based on the facts in each case (such as age, health, and sex of the insured, type of contract reinsured, etc.) and the assuming company's experience (such as mortality, lapse rate, etc.) with similar risks.
(3) The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
On June 30, 1959, X, a life insurance company, reinsured a portion of its insurance contracts with Y, a life insurance company, under an agreement whereby Y agreed to assume and to become solely liable under the contracts reinsured. The reserves on the contracts reinsured by X were $100,000. Under the reinsurance agreement X agreed to pay Y $100,000 for assuming such contracts and Y agreed to pay X $17,000 for the right to receive future premium payments under this block of contracts. Rather than exchange payments of money, X agreed to pay Y a net amount of $83,000 in cash. Assuming that the reasonably estimated life of the contracts reinsured is 17 years, that there are no other insurance transactions by X or Y during the taxable year, and assuming that X and Y compute the reserves on the contracts reinsured on the same basis, X has income of $100,000 under section 809(c)(2) as a result of the net decrease in its reserves. X has a net deduction of $83,000 ($100,000−$17,000) under section 809(d)(7). For the taxable year 1959, Y has income of $100,000 under section 809(c)(1) as a result of the consideration received from X and a deduction of $100,000 under section 809(d)(2) for the net increase in reserves and $1,000 ($17,000 divided by 17, the reasonably estimated life of the contracts reinsured), under section 809(d)(12). The remaining $16,000 shall be amortized over the next 16 succeeding taxable years (16 × $1,000 = $16,000) under section 809(d)(12) at the rate of $1,000 for each such taxable year.

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in example 1, except X agreed to pay Y a consideration of $100,000 in cash for assuming these contracts and Y paid X a bonus of $17,000 in cash and that this bonus meets the requirements of section 162. Assuming that the reasonably estimated life of the contracts reinsured is 17 years, X has income of $100,000 under section 809(c)(2) as a result of this net decrease in its reserves and a deduction of $83,000 under section 809(d)(7) for the amount of the consideration ($100,000) paid to Y for assuming these contracts, reduced by the bonus ($17,000) received from Y. For the taxable year 1959, Y has income of $100,000 under section 809(c)(1) as a result of the consideration received from X and deductions of $100,000 under section 809(d)(2) for the net increase in reserves and $1,000 (the bonus of $17,000 divided by 17, the reasonably estimated life of the contracts reinsured), under section 809(d)(12). The remaining amount of the bonus ($16,000) shall be amortized over the next 16 succeeding taxable years (16 × $1,000 = $16,000) under section 809(d)(12) at the rate of $1,000 for each such taxable year.

# Example 3.
The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that the reinsurance agreement does not specifically provide that X agreed to pay Y $100,000 for assuming the contracts reinsured and Y agreed to pay X $17,000 for the right to receive future premium payments under such contracts. Instead, X agreed to pay Y a net amount of $83,000 in cash for assuming such contracts. Nevertheless, Y is treated as having received from X consideration equal to $100,000, the amount of the increase in Y's reserves, and as having paid $17,000 ($100,000 less $83,000) for the purchase of such contracts. Therefore, for the taxable year 1959, Y has income of $100,000 under section 809(c)(1). Y also has a deduction of $100,000 under section 809(d)(2) for the net increase in its reserves and an amortization deduction under section 809(d)(12) of $1,000 ($17,000 divided by 17, the reasonably estimated life of the contracts reinsured). The remaining $16,000 shall be amortized by Y over the next 16 succeeding years at the rate of $1,000 for each such year. For 1959, X has income of $100,000 under section 809(c)(2) as a result of the net decrease in its reserves and a deduction of $83,000 under section 809(d)(7) for the net amount of
consideration paid to Y for assuming the contracts reinsured.

# Example 4.
The facts are the same as in example 1, except that X agreed to pay Y a consideration of $130,000 in cash for assuming such contracts. Based upon these facts, X has income of $100,000 under section 809(c)(2) as a result of this net decrease in its reserves and a deduction of $130,000 under section 809(d)(7) for the amount of the consideration paid to Y for assuming these contracts. Y has income of $130,000 under section 809(c)(1) as a result of the consideration received from X and a deduction of $100,000 under section 809(d)(2) for the net increase in its reserves.

# Example 5.
On August 1, 1960, R, a life insurance company, reinsured all of its insurance policies with S, a life insurance company, under an agreement whereby S agreed to assume and become solely liable under the contracts reinsured. The reserves on the contracts reinsured by R were $3,000,000. Under the reinsurance agreement, R agreed to pay S a consideration of $3,000,000 in stocks and bonds for assuming such contracts. Assuming no other insurance transactions by R or S during the taxable year, that R and S compute the reserves on the contracts reinsured on the same basis, and that R has a recognized gain (after the application of the limitation of section 817(b)(1)) of $20,000 due to appreciation in value of the assets transferred, the results to each company are as follows:
Company R (reinsured)
Net decrease in reserves (sec. 809(c) (2))
$3,000,000
Capital gain (as limited by sec. 817(b) (1)) to be taxed separately under sec. 802(a)(2)
20,000
Consideration paid by R to S in respect of S's assuming liabilities under contracts issued by R (sec. 809(d)(7))
$3,000,000
Income
Company S (reinsurer)
Consideration received by S in respect of assuming liabilities under contracts issued by R (sec. 809(c)(1))
$3,000,000
Deductions
Net increase in reserves (sec.809(d)(2))
$3,000,000

§ 1.817-5
Diversification requirements for variable annuity, endowment, and life insurance contracts.
(a)
Consequences of nondiversification
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, for purposes of subchapter L, section 72, and section 7702(a), a variable contract (as defined in section 817(d)), other than a pension plan contract (as defined in section 818(a)), which is based on one or more segregated asset accounts shall not be treated as an annuity, endowment, or life insurance contract for any calendar quarter period for which the investments of any such account are not adequately diversified. For this purpose, a variable contract shall be treated as based on a segregated asset account for a calendar quarter period if amounts received under the contract (or earnings thereon) are allocated to the segregated asset account at any time during the period. In addition, a variable contract that is not treated as an annuity, endowment, or life insurance contract for any period by reason of this paragraph (a)(1) shall not be treated as an annuity, endowment, or life insurance contract for any subsequent period even if the investments are adequately diversified for such subsequent period. If a variable contract which is a life insurance or endowment contract under other applicable (e.g., State or foreign) law is not treated as a life insurance or endowment contract under section 7702(a), the income on the contract for any taxable year of the policyholder is treated as ordinary income received or accrued by the policyholder during such year in accordance with section 7702 (g) and (h). Likewise, if a variable contract is not treated as an annuity contract under section 72, the income on the contract for any taxable year of the policyholder shall be treated as ordinary income received or accrued by the policyholder during such year in the same manner as a life insurance or endowment contract under section 7702 (g) and (h).
(2)
Inadvertent failure to diversify.
The investments of a segregated asset account shall be treated as satisfying the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section for one or more periods, provided the following conditions are satisfied—
(i) The issuer or holder must show the Commissioner that the failure of the investments to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section for such period or periods was inadvertent,
(ii) The investments of the account must satisfy the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section within a reasonable time after the discovery of such failure, and
(iii) The issuer or holder of the variable contract must agree to make such adjustments or pay such amounts as may be required by the Commissioner with respect to the period or periods during which the investments of the account did not satisfy the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section.
(b)
Diversification of investments
—(1)
In general.
(i) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph and paragraph (c) of this section, the investments of a segregated asset account shall be considered adequately diversified for purposes of this section and section 817(h) only if—
(A) No more than 55% of the value of the total assets of the account is represented by any one investment;
(B) No more than 70% of the value of the total assets of the account is represented by any two investments;
(C) No more than 80% of the value of the total assets of the account is represented by any three investments; and
(D) No more than 90% of the value of the total assets of the account is represented by any four investments.
(ii) For purposes of this section—
(A) All securities of the same issuer, all interests in the same real property project, and all interests in the same commodity are each treated as a single investment; and
(B) In the case of government securities, each government agency or instrumentality shall be treated as a separate issuer.
(iii) See paragraph (f) of this section for circumstances in which a segregated asset account is treated as the owner of assets held indirectly through certain pass-through entities and corporations taxed under subchapter M, chapter 1 of the Code.
(2)
Safe harbor.
A segregated asset account will be considered adequately diversified for purposes of this section and section 817(h) if—
(i) The account meets the requirements of section 851 (b)(4) and the regulations thereunder; and
(ii) No more than 55% of the value of the total assets of the account is attributable to cash, cash items (including receivables), government securities, and securities of other regulated investment companies.
(3)
Alternative diversification requirements for variable life insurance contracts.
(i) A segregated asset account with respect to variable life insurance contracts will be considered adequately diversified for purposes of this section and section 817(h) if the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section are satisfied or if the assets of such account, other than Treasury securities, satisfy the percentage limitations prescribed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section increased by the product of (A) .5 and (B) the percentage of the value of the total assets of the account that is represented by Treasury securities. In determining whether the assets of an account, other than Treasury securities, satisfy the increased percentage limitations, such limitations are applied as if the Treasury securities were not included in the account (
i.e.,
the increased percentage limitations are not applied to Treasury securities and the value of the total assets of the account is reduced by the value of the Treasury securities).
(ii) The provisions of this paragraph (b)(3) may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
On the last day of a quarter of a calendar year, a segregated asset account with respect to variable life insurance contracts holds assets having a total value of $100,000. The assets of the account are represented by Treasury securities having a total value of $90,000 and securities of Corporation A having a total value of $10,000. The 55% limit described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section would be increased by 45% (0.5 × 90%) to 100%, and would then be applied to the assets of the account other than Treasury securities. Because no more than 100% of the value of the assets other than Treasury securities is represented by securities of Corporation A, the investments of the account will be considered adequately diversified.

# Example 2.
On the last day of a quarter of a calendar year, a segregated asset account with respect to variable life insurance contracts holds assets having a total value of $100,000. The assets of the account are represented by Treasury securities having a total value of $60,000, securities of Corporation A having a total value of $30,000, and securities of Corporation B having a total value of $10,000. The 55% and 70% limits described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section would be increased by 30% (0.5 × 60%) to 85% and 100%, respectively, and would then be applied to the assets of the account other
than Treasury securities. Securities of Corporation A represent 75%, and securities of Corporation B represent 25%, of the value of the assets of the account other than Treasury securities. Because no more than 85% of the value of the assets other than Treasury securities is represented by securities of Corporation A or B and no more than 100% of the value of the assets other than Treasury securities is represented by securities of Corporations A and B, the investments of the account will be considered adequately diversified.
(c)
Periods for which an account is adequately diversified
—(1)
In general.
A segregated asset account that satisfies the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section on the last day of a quarter of a calendar year (
i.e.,
March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31) or within 30 days after such last day shall be considered adequately diversified for such quarter.
(2)
Start-up period.
(i) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section, a segregated asset account that is not a real property account on its first anniversary shall be considered adequately diversified until such first anniversary.
(ii) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section, a segregated asset account that is a real property account on its first anniversary shall be considered adequately diversified until the earlier of its fifth anniversary or the anniversary on which the account ceases to be a real property account.
(iii) For purposes of paragraph (c)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section, the anniversary of a segregated asset account is the anniversary of the date on which any amount received under a life insurance or annuity contract, other than a pension plan contract (as defined in section 818 (a)), is first allocated to the account.
(iv) If more than 30 percent of the amount allocated to a segregated asset account as of the last day of a calendar quarter is attributable to contracts entered into more than one year before such date, paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section shall not apply to the segregated asset account for any period after such date. Similarly, if more than 30 percent of the amount allocated to a segregated asset account as of the last day of a calendar quarter is attributable to contracts entered into more than 5 years before such date, paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section shall not apply to the segregated asset account for any period after such date. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2), amounts transferred to the account from a diversified account (determined without regard to this paragraph (c)(2)) or as a result of an exchange pursuant to section 1035 in which the issuer of the contract received in the exchange is not related in a manner specified in section 267(b) to the issuer of the contract transferred in the exchange are not treated as—
(A) Amounts attributable to contracts entered into more than one year before such date, in the case of accounts subject to paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, or
(B) Amounts attributable to contracts entered into more than five years before such date, in the case of accounts subject to paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section.
(3)
Liquidation period.
A segregated asset account that satisfies the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section on the date a plan of liquidation is adopted shall be considered adequately diversified for—
(i) The one-year period beginning on the date the plan of liquidation is adopted if the account is not a real property account on such date; or
(ii) The two-year period beginning on the date the plan of liquidation is adopted if the account is a real property account on such date.
(d)
Market fluctuations.
A segregated asset account that satisfies the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section at the end of any calendar quarter (or within 30 days after the end of such calendar quarter) shall not be considered nondiversified in a subsequent quarter because of a discrepancy between the value of its assets and the diversification requirements unless such discrepancy exists immediately after the acquisition of any asset and such discrepancy is wholly or partly the result of such acquisition.
(e)
Segregated asset account.
For purposes of section 817(h) and this section, a segregated asset account shall consist of all assets the investment return and market value of each of which
must be allocated in an identical manner to any variable contract invested in any of such assets. See paragraph (g) for examples illustrating the application of this paragraph (e).
(f)
Look-through rule for assets held through certain investment companies, partnerships, or trusts
—(1)
In general.
If this paragraph (f) applies, a beneficial interest in a regulated investment company, a real estate investment trust, a partnership, or a trust that is treated under sections 671 through 679 as owned by the grantor or another person (“investment company, partnership, or trust”) shall not be treated as a single investment of a segregated asset account. Instead, a pro rata portion of each asset of the investment company, partnership, or trust shall be treated, for purposes of this section, as an asset of the segregated asset account. For purposes of this section, the ratable interest of a partner in a partnership's assets shall be determined in accordance with the partner's capital interest in the partnership.
(2)
Applicability
—(i)
Certain investment companies, partnerships, and trusts.
This paragraph (f) shall apply to an investment company, partnership, or trust if—
(A) All the beneficial interests in the investment company, partnership, or trust (other than those described in paragraph (f)(3) of this section) are held by one or more segregated asset accounts of one or more insurance companies; and
(B) Public access to such investment company, partnership, or trust is available exclusively (except as otherwise permitted in paragraph (f)(3) of this section) through the purchase of a variable contract. Solely for this purpose, the status of a contract as a variable contract will be determined without regard to section 817(h) and this section.
(ii)
Trusts holding Treasury securities.
This paragraph (f) shall also apply to a trust that is treated under section 671 through 679 as owned by the grantor or another person if substantially all of the assets of the trust are represented by Treasury securities.
(3)
Interests not held by segregated asset accounts.
Satisfaction of the requirements of paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section shall not be prevented by reason of beneficial interests in the investment company, partnership, or trust that are—
(i) Held by the general account of a life insurance company or a corporation related in a manner specified in section 267(b) to a life insurance company, but only if the return on such interests is computed in the same manner as the return on an interest held by a segregated asset account is computed (determined without regard to expenses attributable to variable contracts), there is no intent to sell such interests to the public, and a segregated asset account of such life insurance company also holds or will hold a beneficial interest in the investment company, partnership, or trust;
(ii) Held by the manager, or a corporation related in a manner specified in section 267(b) to the manager, of the investment company, partnership, or trust, but only if the holding of the interests is in connection with the creation or management of the investment company, partnership, or trust, the return on such interest is computed in the same manner as the return on an interest held by a segregated asset account is computed (determined without regard to expenses attributable to variable contracts), and there is no intent to sell such interests to the public;
(iii) Held by the trustee of a qualified pension or retirement plan;
(iv) Held by a qualified tuition program as defined in section 529;
(v) Held by the trustee of a pension plan established and maintained outside of the United States, as defined in section 7701(a)(9), primarily for the benefit of individuals substantially all of whom are nonresident aliens, as defined in section 7701(b)(1)(B);
(vi) Held by an account which, pursuant to Puerto Rican law or regulation, is segregated from the general asset accounts of the life insurance company that owns the account, provided the requirements of section 817(d) and (h) are satisfied. Solely for purposes of this paragraph (f)(3)(vi), the requirement under section 817(d)(1) that the account be segregated pursuant to State law or regulation shall be disregarded and § 1.817-5(f)(1) shall be applied without
regard to the Puerto Rican segregated asset account; or
(vii) Held by the public, or treated as owned by policyholders pursuant to Rev. Rul. 81-225, 1981-2 C.B. 12, but only if (A) the investment company, partnership, or trust was closed to the public in accordance with Rev. Rul. 82-55, 1982-1 C.B. 12, or (B) all the assets of the segregated asset account are attributable to premium payments made by policyholders prior to September 26, 1981, to premium payments made in connection with a qualified pension or retirement plan, or to any combination of such premium payments.
(g)
Examples.
The provisions of paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples.

# Example 1.
(i) The assets underlying variable contracts issued by a life insurance company consist of two groups of assets: (a) a diversified portfolio of debt securities and (b) interests in P, a partnership. All of the beneficial interests in P are held by one or more segregated asset accounts of one or more insurance companies and public access to P is available exclusively through the purchase of a variable contract. The variable contracts provide that policyholders may specify which portion of each premium is to be invested in the debt securities and which portion is to be invested in P interests. The portfolio of debt securities and the assets of P, considered separately, each satisfy the diversification requirements of paragraph (b) of this section.
(ii) As a result of the ability of policyholders to allocate premiums among the two groups of assets, the investment return and market value of the interests in P and the debt securities may be allocated to different variable contracts in a non-identical manner. Accordingly, under paragraph (e) of this section, the interests in P are treated as part of a single segregated asset account (“Account 1”) and the debt securities are treated as part of a different segregated asset account (“Account 2”).
(iii) Since P is described in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section, interests in P will not be treated as a single investment of Account 1. Rather, Account 1 is treated as owning a pro rata portion of the assets of P.
(iv) Since Account 1 and Account 2 each satisfy the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, variable contracts that are based on either or both accounts are treated as annuity, endowment, or life insurance contracts.

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in example 1 except that some of the beneficial interests in P are held by persons not described in paragraph (f)(3) of this section. Since P is not described in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, interests in P will be treated as a single investment of Account 1. As a result, Account 1 does not satisfy the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section. Variable contracts based in whole or in part on Account 1 are not treated as annuity, endowment, or life insurance contracts. Variable contracts that are not based on Account 1 at any time during the period in which such account fails to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section (
i.e.,
contracts based entirely on Account 2), are treated as annuity, endowment, or life insurance contracts. See paragraph (a)(1).

# Example 3.
The facts are the same as in example 2 except that the variable contracts do not permit policyholders to allocate premiums between or among the debt securities and interests in P. Thus, the investment return and market value of the interests in P and the debt securities must be allocated to the same variable contracts and in an identical manner. Under paragraph (e) of this section, the interests in P and the debt securities are treated as part of a single segregated asset account. If the interests in P and the debt securities, considered together, satisfy the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, contracts based on this segregated asset account will be treated as annuity, endowment, or life insurance contracts.
(h)
Definitions.
The terms defined below shall, for purposes of this section, have the meanings set forth in such definitions:
(1)
Government security
—(i)
General rule.
The term
government security
shall mean any security issued or guaranteed or insured by the United States or an instrumentality of the United States; or any certificate of deposit for any of the foregoing. Any security or certificate or deposit insured or guaranteed only in part by the United States or an instrumentality thereof is treated as issued by the United States or its instrumentality only to the extent so insured or guaranteed, and as issued by the direct obligor to the extent not so insured or guaranteed. For purposes of this paragraph (h)(1), an instrumentality of the United States shall mean any person that is treated for purposes of 15 U.S.C. 80a-2 (16), as amended, as a person controlled or supervised by and acting as an instrumentality of the Government of the United States pursuant to authority granted by the Congress of the United States.
(ii)
Example.
A segregated asset account purchases a certificate of deposit in the amount of $150,000 from bank A. Deposits in bank A are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, an instrumentality of the United States, to the extent of $100,000 per depositor. The certificate of deposit is treated as a government security to the extent of the $100,000 insured amount and is treated as a security issued by bank A to the extent of the $50,000 excess of the value of the certificate of deposit over the insured amount.
(2)
Treasury security
—(i)
General rule.
For purposes of paragraph (b)(3) of this section and section 817(h)(3), the term
Treasury security
shall mean a security the direct obligor of which is the United States Treasury.
(ii)
Example.
A segregated asset account purchases put and call options on U.S. Treasury securities issued by the Options Clearing Corporation. The options are not Treasury securities for purposes of paragraph (b)(3) and section 817(h)(3) because the direct obligor of the options is not the United States Treasury.
(3)
Real property.
The term
real property
shall mean any property that is treated as real property under 1.856-3 (d) except that it shall not include interests in real property.
(4)
Real property account.
A segregated asset account is a real property account on an anniversary of the account (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section) or on the date a plan of liquidation is adopted if not less than the applicable percentage of the total assets of the account is represented by real property or interests in real property on such anniversary or date. For this purpose, the applicable percentage is 40% for the period ending on the first anniversary of the date on which premium income is first received, 50% for the year ending on the second anniversary, 60% for the year ending on the third anniversary, 70% for the year ending on the fourth anniversary, and 80% thereafter. A segregated asset account will also be treated as a real property account on its first anniversary if on or before such first anniversary the issuer has stated in the contract or prospectus or in a submission to a regulatory agency, an intention that the assets of the account will be primarily invested in real property or interests in real property, provided that at least 40% of the total assets of the account are so invested within six months after such first anniversary.
(5)
Commodity.
The term
commodity
shall mean any type of personal property other than a security.
(6)
Security.
The term
security
shall include a cash item and any partnership interest, whether or not registered under a Federal or State law regulating the offering or sale of securities. The term shall not include any interest in real property, or any interest in a commodity.
(7)
Interest in real property.
The term
interest in real property
shall include the ownership and co-ownership of land or improvements thereon and leaseholds of land or improvements thereon. Such term shall not, however, include mineral, oil, or gas royalty interests, such as a retained economic interest in coal or iron ore with respect to which the special provisions of section 631(c) apply. The term “interest in real property” also shall include options to acquire land or improvements thereon, and options to acquire leaseholds of land or improvements thereon.
(8)
Interest in a commodity.
The term
interest in a commodity
shall include the ownership and co-ownership of any type of personal property other than a security, and any leaseholds thereof. Such term shall include mineral, oil, and gas royalty interests, including any fractional undivided interest therein. Such term also shall include any put, call, straddle, option, or privilege on any type of personal property other than a security.
(9)
Value.
The term
value
shall mean, with respect to investments for which market quotations are readily available, the market value of such investments; and with respect to other investments, fair value as determined in good faith by the managers of the segregated asset account.
(10)
Terms used in section 851.
To the extent not inconsistent with this paragraph (h) all terms used in this section shall have the same meaning as when used in section 851.
(i)
Effective date
—(1)
In general.
This section is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1983.
(2)
Exceptions.
(i) If, at all times after December 31, 1983, an insurance company would be considered the owner of the assets of a segregated asset account under the principles of Rev. Rul. 81-225, 1981-2 C.B. 12, this section will not apply to such account until December 15, 1986.
(ii) This section will not apply to any variable contract to which Rev. Rul. 77-85, 1977-1 C.B. 12, or Rev. Rul. 81-225, 1981-2 C.B. 12, did not apply by reason of the limited retroactive effect of such rulings.
(iii) In determining whether a segregated asset account is adequately diversified for any calendar quarter ending before July 1, 1988, debt instruments that are issued, guaranteed, or insured by the United States or an instrumentality of the United States shall not be treated as government securities if such debt instruments are secured by a mortgage on real property (other than real property owned by the United States or an instrumentality of the United States) or represent an interest in a pool of debt instruments secured by such mortgages.
(iv) This section shall not apply until January 1, 1989, with respect to a variable contract (as defined in section 817(d)) that (1) provides for the payment of an immediate annuity (as defined in section 72(u)(4)); (2) was outstanding on September 12, 1986; and (3) the segregated asset account on which it was based was, on September 12, 1986, wholly invested in deposits insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation.
(v) A segregated asset account in existence before March 1, 2005, will be considered to be adequately diversified if—
(A) As of March 1, 2005, the account was adequately diversified within the meaning of section 817(h) and this regulation as in effect prior to that date; and
(B) By December 31, 2005, the account is adequately diversified within the meaning of section 817(h) and this regulation.

§ 1.817A-1
Certain modified guaranteed contracts.
(a)
Definitions
—(1)
Modified guaranteed contract.
The term
modified guaranteed contract
(MGC) is defined in section 817A(d) as an annuity, life insurance, or pension plan contract (other than a variable contract described in section 817) under which all or parts of the amounts received under the contract are allocated to a segregated account. Assets and reserves in this segregated account must be valued from time to time with reference to market values for annual statement purposes. Further, an MGC must provide either for a net surrender value or for a policyholder's fund (as defined in section 807(e)(1)). If only a portion of a contract is not described in section 817, such portion is treated as a separate
contract for purposes of applying section 817A.
(2)
Temporary guarantee period.
An MGC may temporarily guarantee a return other than the permanently guaranteed crediting rate for a period specified in the contract (the
temporary guarantee period
). During the temporary guarantee period, the amount paid to the policyholder upon surrender is usually increased or decreased by a market value adjustment, which is determined by a formula set forth under the terms of the MGC.
(3)
Equity-indexed modified guaranteed contract.
An equity-indexed MGC is an MGC, as defined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, that provides a return during or at the end of the temporary guarantee period based on the performance of stocks, other equity instruments, or equity-based derivatives.

§ 1.818-1
Taxable years affected.
Sections 1.818-2 through 1.818-8, except as otherwise provided therein, are applicable only to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1957, and all references to sections of part I, subchapter L, chapter 1 of the Code are to the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended by the Life Insurance Company Income Tax Act of 1959 (73 Stat. 112).
[T.D. 6558, 26 FR 2785, Apr. 4, 1961, as amended by T.D. 7469, 42 FR 12181, Mar. 3, 1977]
§ 1.818-2
Accounting provisions.
(a)
Method of accounting.
(1) Section 818(a)(1) provides the general rule that all computations entering into the determination of taxes imposed by part I, subchapter L, chapter 1 of the Code, shall be made under an accrual method of accounting. Thus, the over-all method of accounting for life insurance companies shall be the accrual method. Except as otherwise provided in part I, the term “accrual method” shall have the same meaning and application in section 818 as it does under section 446 (relating to general rule for methods of accounting) and the regulations thereunder. For general rules relating to the taxable year for inclusion of income and deduction of expenses under an accrual method of accounting, see sections 451 and 461 and the regulations thereunder.
(2) Section 818(a)(2) provides that, to the extent permitted under this section, a life insurance company's method of accounting may be a combination of the accrual method with any other method of accounting permitted by chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, other than the cash receipts and disbursements method. Thus, section 818(a)(2) specifically prohibits the use by a life insurance company of the cash receipts and disbursements method either separately or in combination with a permissible method of accounting. The term “method of accounting” includes not only the over-all method of accounting of the taxpayer but also the accounting treatment of any item. For purposes of section 818(a)(2), a life insurance company may elect to compute its taxable income under an over-all method of accounting consisting of
the accrual method combined with the special methods of accounting for particular items of income and expense provided under other sections of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, other than the cash receipts and disbursements method. These methods of accounting for special items include the accounting treatment provided for depreciation (section 167), research and experimental expenditures (section 174), soil and water conservation expenditures (section 175), organizational expenditures (section 248), etc. In addition, a life insurance company may, where applicable, use the crop method of accounting (as provided in the regulations under sections 61 and 162), and the installment method of accounting for sales of realty and casual sales of personalty (as provided in section 453(b)). To the extent not inconsistent with the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 or the regulations thereunder and the method of accounting adopted by the taxpayer pursuant to this section, all computations entering into the determination of taxes imposed by part I shall be made in a manner consistent with the manner required for purposes of the annual statement approved by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.
(3)(i) An election to use any of the special methods of accounting referred to in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph which was made pursuant to any provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 or prior revenue laws for purposes of determining a company's tax liabilities for prior years, shall have the same force and effect in determining the items of gross investment income under section 804(b) and the items of deduction under section 804(c) of the Life Insurance Company Income Tax Act of 1959 (73 Stat. 112) as if such Act had not been enacted.
(ii) For purposes of determining gain or loss from operations under section 809(b), in computing the life insurance company's share of investment yield under section 809(b) (1)(A) and (2)(A), an election with respect to any of the special methods of accounting referred to in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph which was made pursuant to any provision of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 or prior revenue laws, shall not be affected in any way by the enactment of the Life Insurance Company Income Tax Act of 1959 (73 Stat. 112).
(iii) For purposes of determining gain or loss from operations under section 809(b), in computing the items of gross amount under section 809(c) and the deduction items under section 809(d), an election to use any of the special methods of accounting referred to in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph must be made in accordance with the specific statutory provisions of the sections containing such elections and the regulations thereunder. However, where a particular election may be made only with the consent of the Commissioner (either because the time for making the election without the consent of the Commissioner has expired or because the particular section contained no provision for making an election without consent), and the time prescribed by the applicable regulations for submitting a request for permission to make such an election for the taxable year 1958 has expired, a life insurance company may make such an election for the year 1958 at the time of filing its return for that year (including extensions thereof). For example, a life insurance company may elect any of the methods of depreciation prescribed in section 167 (to the extent permitted under that section and the regulations thereunder) with respect to those assets, or any portion thereof, for which no depreciation was allowable under prior revenue laws, for example, furniture and fixtures used in the underwriting department. Similarly, a life insurance company shall be permitted to make an election under section 461(c) (relating to the accrual of real property taxes) with respect to real property for which no deduction was allowable under prior revenue laws. Any such election shall be made in the manner and form prescribed in the applicable regulations.
(iv) For purposes of subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, the method used under section 1016(a)(3)(C) (relating to adjustments to basis) in determining the amount of exhaustion, wear and tear, obsolescence, and amortization actually sustained shall not preclude a taxpayer from electing any of the
methods prescribed in section 167 in accordance with the provisions of that section and the regulations thereunder for determining the amount of such exhaustion, wear and tear, obsolescence, and amortization for the year 1958. For example, if the amount of depreciation actually sustained, under section 1016(a)(3)(C), on a life insurance company's home office building (other than that portion for which depreciation was allowable under prior revenue laws) is determined on the straight line method, the life insurance company may elect for the year 1958 to use any of the methods prescribed in section 167 for determining its depreciation allowance for 1958. However, such election shall be binding for 1958, and for all subsequent taxable years, unless consent to change such election, if required, is obtained from the Commissioner in accordance with the provisions of section 167 and the regulations thereunder.
(4)(i) For purposes of section 805(b)(3)(B)(i) (relating to the determination of the current earnings rate for any taxable year beginning before January 1, 1958), the determination for any year of the investment yield and the assets shall be made as though the taxpayer had been on the accrual method prescribed in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph for such year, or the accrual method in combination with the other methods of accounting prescribed in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, if these other methods of accounting are used by the taxpayer in determining the investment yield and assets for the taxable year 1958. However, where the method used for determining the deduction under section 167 for the year 1958 differs from the method used in prior years, the amount of the deduction actually allowed or allowable for such prior years for purposes of section 1016(a)(2) (relating to adjustments to basis) shall be the amount to be taken into account in determining the current earnings rate under section 805(b)(3)(B)(i).
(ii) For purposes of section 812(b)(1)(C) (relating to operations loss carrybacks and carryovers for years prior to 1958), the determination for those years of the gain or loss from operations shall be made as though the taxpayer had been on the accrual method of accounting prescribed in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph for such year, or the accrual method in combination with the other methods of accounting prescribed in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, if these other methods of accounting are used by the taxpayer in the determination of gain or loss from operations for the taxable year 1958. However, where any adjustment to basis is required under section 1016(a)(3)(C) on account of exhaustion, wear and tear, obsolescence, amortization, and depletion sustained, the amount actually sustained as determined under section 1016(a)(3)(C) for each of the years involved shall be the amount allowed in the determination of gain or loss from operations for purposes of section 812(b)(1)(C).
(b)
Adjustments required if accrual method of accounting was not used in 1957.
The items of gross amount taken into account under section 809(c) and the items of deductions allowed under section 809(d) for the taxable year 1958 shall be determined as though the taxpayer had been on the accrual method of accounting prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section for all prior years. Thus, life insurance companies not on the accrual method for the year 1957 shall accrue, as of December 31, 1957, those items of gross amount which would have been properly taken into account for the year 1957 if the company had been on the accrual method described in section 818(a). Likewise, life insurance companies not on the accrual method for the year 1957 shall accrue, as of December 31, 1957, those items of deductions which would have been properly allowed for the year 1957 if the company had been on the accrual method described in section 818(a). For example, if certain premium amounts were received during the year 1958 but such amounts would have been properly taken into account for the year 1957 if the taxpayer had been on the accrual method for the year 1957, then the taxpayer will not be required to take such premium amounts into account for the year 1958. If, for example, certain claims, benefits, and losses were paid during the year 1958 but such items would have been properly taken into account for the year 1957 if the
taxpayer had been on the accrual method for the year 1957, then the taxpayer will not be permitted to deduct such expense items for the year 1958. For a special transitional rule applicable with respect to changes in method of accounting required by section 818(a) and paragraph (a) of this section, see section 818(e) and § 1.818-6.
[T.D. 6558, 26 FR 2785, Apr. 4, 1961; as amended by T.D. 9911, 85 FR 64394, Oct. 13, 2020]
§ 1.818-3
Amortization of premium and accrual of discount.
(a)
In general.
Section 818(b) provides that the appropriate items of income, deductions, and adjustments under part I, subchapter L, chapter 1 of the Code, shall be adjusted to reflect the appropriate amortization of premium and the appropriate accrual of discount on bonds, notes, debentures, or other evidences of indebtedness held by a life insurance company. Such adjustments are limited to the amount of appropriate amortization or accrual attributable to the taxable year with respect to such securities which are not in default as to principal or interest and which are amply secured. The question of ample security will be resolved according to the rules laid down from time to time by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. The adjustment for amortization of premium decreases the gross investment income, the exclusion and reduction for wholly tax-exempt interest, the exclusion and deduction for partially tax-exempt interest, and the basis or adjusted basis of such securities. The adjustment for accrual of discount increases the gross investment income, the exclusion and reduction for wholly tax-exempt interest, the exclusion and deduction for partially tax-exempt interest, and the basis or adjusted basis of such securities. However, for taxable years beginning after May 31, 1960, only the accrual of discount relating to issue discount will increase the exclusion and reduction for wholly tax-exempt interest. See section 103.
(b)
Acquisitions before January 1, 1958.
(1) In the case of any such security acquired before January 1, 1958, the premium is the excess of its acquisition value over its maturity value and the discount is the excess of its maturity value over its acquisition value. The acquisition value of any such security is its cost (including buying commissions or brokerage but excluding any amounts paid for accrued interest) if purchased for cash, or if not purchased for cash, its then fair market value. The maturity value of any such security is the amount payable thereunder either at the maturity date or an earlier call date. The earlier call date of any such security may be the earliest interest payment date if it is callable or payable at such date, the earliest date at which it is callable at par, or such other call or payment date, prior to maturity, specified in the security as may be selected by the life insurance company. A life insurance company which adjusts amortization of premium or accrual of discount with reference to a particular call or payment date must make the adjustments with reference to the value on such date and may not, after selecting such date, use a different call or payment date, or value, in the calculation of such amortization or discount with respect to such security unless the security was not in fact called or paid on such selected date.
(2) The adjustments for amortization of premium and accrual of discount will be determined:
(i) According to the method regularly employed by the company, if such method is reasonable, or
(ii) According to the method prescribed by this section.
A method of amortization of premium or accrual of discount will be deemed “regularly employed” by a life insurance company if the method was consistently followed in prior taxable years, or if, in the case of a company which has never before made such adjustments, the company initiates in the first taxable year for which the adjustments are made a reasonable method of amortization of premium or accrual of discount and consistently follows such method thereafter. Ordinarily, a company regularly employs a method in accordance with the statute of some State, Territory, or the District of Columbia, in which it operates.
(3) The method of amortization and accrual prescribed by this section is as follows:
(i) The premium (or discount) shall be determined in accordance with this section; and
(ii) The appropriate amortization of premium (or accrual of discount) attributable to the taxable year shall be an amount which bears the same ratio to the premium (or discount) as the number of months in the taxable year during which the security was owned by the life insurance company bears to the number of months between the date of acquisition of the security and its maturity or earlier call date, determined in accordance with this section. For purposes of this section, a fractional part of a month shall be disregarded unless it amounts to more than half a month, in which case it shall be considered a month.
(c)
Acquisitions after December 31, 1957.
(1) In the case of:
(i) Any bond, as defined in section 171(d), acquired after December 31, 1957, the amount of the premium and the amortizable premium for the taxable year, shall be determined under section 171(b) and the regulations thereunder, as if the election set forth in section 171(c) had been made, and
(ii) Any bond, note, debenture, or other evidence of indebtedness not described in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph and acquired after December 31, 1957, the amount of the premium and the amortizable premium for the taxable year, shall be determined under paragraph (b) of this section.
(2) In the case of any bond, note, debenture, or other evidence of indebtedness acquired after December 31, 1957, the amount of the discount and the accrual of discount attributable to the taxable year shall be determined under paragraph (b) of this section.
(d)
Convertible evidences of indebtedness.
Section 818(b)(2)(B) provides that in no case shall the amount of premium on a convertible evidence of indebtedness (including any bond, note, or debenture) include any amount attributable to the conversion features of the evidence of indebtedness. This provision is the same as the one contained in section 171(b), and the rules prescribed in paragraph (c) of § 1.171-2 shall be applicable for purposes of section 818(b)(2)(B). This provision is to be applied without regard to the date upon which the evidence of indebtedness was acquired. Thus, where a convertible evidence of indebtedness was acquired before January 1, 1958, and a portion or all of the premium attributable to the conversion features of the evidence of indebtedness has been amortized for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1958, no adjustment for such amortization will be required by reason of section 818(b)(2)(B). Such amortization will, however, require an adjustment to the basis of the evidence of indebtedness under section 1016(a)(17). For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1957, no further amortization of the premium attributable to the conversion features of such an evidence of indebtedness will be taken into account.
(e)
Adjustments to basis.
Section 1016(a)(17) (relating to adjustments to basis) provides that in the case of any evidence of indebtedness referred to in section 818(b) and this section, the basis shall be adjusted to the extent of the adjustments required under section 818(b) (or the corresponding provisions of prior income tax laws) for the taxable year and all prior taxable years. The basis of any evidence of indebtedness shall be reduced by the amount of the adjustment required under section 818(b) (or the corresponding provision of prior income tax laws) on account of amortizable premium and shall be increased by the amount of the adjustment required under section 818(b) on account of accruable discounts.
(f)
Denial of double inclusion.
Any amount which is includible in gross investment income by reason of section 818(b) and paragraph (a) of this section shall not be includible in gross income under section 1232(a) (relating to the taxation of bonds and other evidences of indebtedness). See section 1232(a)(2)(C) and the regulations thereunder.

§ 1.818-4
[Reserved]
§ 1.818-5
Short taxable years.
(a)
In general.
Section 818(d) provides that if any return of a corporation made under part I, subchapter L, chapter 1 of the Code, is for a period of less
than the entire calendar year, then section 443 (relating to returns for a period of less than 12 months) shall not apply. This section further provides certain rules to be used in determining the life insurance company taxable income for a period of less than the entire calendar year.
(b)
Returns for periods of less than the entire calendar year.
A return for a short period, that is, for a taxable year consisting of a period of less than the entire calendar year, shall be made only under the following circumstances:
(1) If a company which qualifies as a life insurance company is not in existence for the entire taxable year, a return is required for the short period during which the taxpayer was in existence. For example, a life insurance company organized on August 1, is required to file a return for the short period from August 1 to December 31, and returns for each calendar year thereafter. Similarly, if a company which qualifies as a life insurance company completely dissolves during the taxable year it is required to file a return for the short period from January 1 to the date it goes out of existence. All items entering into the computation of taxable investment income and gain or loss from operations for the short period shall be determined on a consistent basis and in the manner provided in paragraph (c) of this section.
(2) A return must be filed for a short period resulting from the termination by the district director of a taxpayer's taxable year for jeopardy. See section 6851 and the regulations thereunder.
A company which was an insurance company for the preceding taxable year (but not a life insurance company as defined in section 801(a) and paragraph (b) of § 1.801-3) and which for the current taxable year qualifies as a life insurance company shall not file a return for the short period from the time during the taxable year that it first qualifies as a life insurance company to the end of the taxable year. Similarly, an insurance company which was a life insurance company for the preceding taxable year but which for the current taxable year does not qualify as a life insurance company shall not file a return for the short period from the beginning of the taxable year to the time during the taxable year that it no longer qualifies as a life insurance company.
(c)
Computation of life insurance company taxable income for short period.
(1) If a return is made for a short period, section 818(d)(1) provides that the taxable investment income and the gain or loss from operations shall be determined on an annual basis by a ratable daily projection of the appropriate figures for the short period. The appropriate figures for the short period shall be determined on an annual basis by multiplying such figures by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the calendar year in which the short period occurs and the denominator of which is the number of days in the short period.
(2)(i) In computing taxable investment income for a short period, the investment yield, the policy and other contract liability requirements, the policyholders' share of each and every item of investment yield, and the company's share of any item of investment yield shall be determined on an annual basis.
(ii) For purposes of determining the investment yield on an annual basis, each item of gross investment income under section 804(b) and each item of deduction under section 804(c) shall be annualized in the manner provided in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph. In any case in which a limitation is placed on the amount of a deduction provided under section 804(c), the limitation shall apply to the item of deduction computed on an annual basis.
(iii) The policy and other contract liability requirements shall be determined on an annual basis in the following manner:
(
a
) The interest paid (as defined in section 805(e) and § 1.805-8) for the short period shall be annualized in the manner prescribed in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph.
(
b
) The current earnings rate for the taxable year in which the short period occurs shall be determined by dividing the taxpayer's investment yield, as determined on an annual basis under subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, by the mean of the taxpayer's assets at
the beginning and end of the short period. For purposes of section 805, any reference to the current earnings rate for the taxable year in which the short period occurs means the current earnings rate as determined under this subdivision.
(
c
) The adjusted life insurance reserves shall be determined as provided in section 805(c), and the pension plan reserves shall be determined as provided in section 805(d).
(iv) The policyholders' share of each and every item of investment yield (as defined in section 804(a)) shall be that percentage obtained by dividing the policy and other contract liability requirements, determined under subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph, by the investment yield, determined under subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph.
(v) The taxable investment income for the short period shall be an amount (not less than zero) equal to the life insurance company's share of each and every item of investment yield, as determined under subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, reduced by the items described in section 804(a)(2) (A) and (B). In determining these reductions under section 804(a)(2)(A) the amount of the respective items shall be the amount that is determined on an annual basis under subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph. The small business deduction, under section 804(a)(2)(B) shall be an amount (not to exceed $25,000) equal to 10 percent of the investment yield, determined under subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, for the short period.
(vi) Except as provided in this paragraph, the determination of taxable investment income under subpart B, part I, subchapter L, chapter 1 of the Code, shall be made in accordance with all the provisions of that subpart.
(3)(i) In computing gain or loss from operations for a short period, the share of each and every item of investment yield set aside for policyholders, the life insurance company's share of each and every item of investment yield, the items of gross amount, and the items of deduction shall, except as modified by this subparagraph, be determined on an annual basis in the manner provided in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph. In any case in which a limitation is placed on the amount of a deduction provided under section 809, the limitation shall apply to the item of deduction computed on an annualized basis.
(ii) For purposes of sections 809 and 810, the investment yield shall be determined in the manner provided in subparagraph (2)(ii) of this paragraph. The share of any item of investment yield set aside for policyholders shall be that percentage obtained by dividing the required interest as determined under section 809(a)(2), by the investment yield, as determined in this subparagraph, except that if the required interest exceeds the investment yield then the share of any item of investment yield set aside for policyholders shall be 100 percent.
(iii) The items of gross amount and the items of deduction, other than the operations loss deduction under section 809(d)(4), shall be determined on an annual basis. See subdivision (iv) of this subparagraph for the manner in which the net decrease or net increase in reserves under section 810 shall be annualized.
(iv) For purposes of determining either a net decrease in reserves under section 810(a) or a net increase in reserves under section 810(b), the sum of the items described in section 810(c) as of the end of the short period shall be reduced by the amount of the investment yield not included in gain or loss from operations for the short period by reason of section 809(a)(1). The amount of investment yield excluded under section 809(a)(1) has been determined upon an annualized basis while the sum of the items described in section 180(c) at the end of the short period has been determined on an actual basis. In order to place these on the same basis, the amount of investment yield not included in gain or loss from operations by reason of section 809(a)(1), determined under subdivision (ii) shall, for purposes of section 810(a) and section 810(b), be reduced to an amount which bears the same ratio to the full amount as the number of days in the short period bears to the number of days in the entire calendar year. The net decrease or the net increase of the items referred to in section 810(c) for the short period shall then be determined, as provided in section 810(a) and section
810(b), respectively, and the result annualized.
(4) The portion of the life insurance company taxable income described in section 802(b) (1) and (2) (relating to taxable investment income and gain or loss from operations) shall be determined on an annual basis by treating the amounts ascertained under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph as the taxable investment income, and the amount ascertained under subparagraph (3) of this paragraph as the gain or loss from operations, for the taxable year.
(5) The portion of the life insurance company taxable income described in section 802(b) (1) and (2) for the short period shall be the amount which bears the same ratio to the amount ascertained under section 818(d) (2) and subparagraph (4) of this paragraph as the number of days in the short period bears to the number of days in the entire year.
(d)
Special rules.
(1) For purposes of determining the average earnings rate (as defined in section 805(b)(3)) for subsequent taxable years, the current earnings rate for the taxable year in which the short period occurs shall be the rate determined under paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
(2) For purposes of determining an operations loss deduction under section 812, the loss from operations for the short period shall be the loss from operations determined under paragraph (c)(5) of this section.
[T.D. 6558, 26 FR 2788, Apr. 4, 1961]
§ 1.818-6
Transitional rule for change in method of accounting.
(a)
In general.
Section 818(e) prescribes the rules to be followed in recomputing the taxes of a life insurance company for the taxable year 1957 in cases where the method of accounting required to be used in computing the company's taxes for 1958 under section 818(a) and paragraph (a) of § 1.818-2 is different from the method used in 1957.
(b)
Recomputation of 1957 taxes.
(1) For purposes of recomputing its taxes for 1957, a life insurance company must ascertain the net amount of those adjustments which are determined (as of the close of 1957) to be necessary solely by reason of the change to the method of accounting required by section 818(a) and paragraph (a) of § 1.818-2 in order to prevent amounts from being duplicated or omitted. Thus, for example, life insurance companies not on the accrual method of accounting for the year 1957 shall accrue, as of December 31, 1957, those items of gross investment income under section 803(b) and those items of deduction under section 803(c), as in effect for 1957, which would have been properly accruable for the year 1957 if the company had been on the accrual method of accounting.
(2) In the case of a change in the over-all method of accounting, the term “net amount of those adjustments” means the consolidation of adjustments (whether the amounts thereof represent increases or decreases in items of income or deductions) arising with respect to balances in the various accounts on December 31, 1957. In the case of a change in the treatment of a single material item, the amount of the adjustment shall be determined with reference only to the net dollar balances in that particular account.
(3)(i) The amount of the taxpayer's tax for 1957 shall be recomputed (under the law applicable to 1957, modified as provided in section 818(e) (4) and paragraph (e) of this section) by taking into account an amount equal to one-tenth of the net amount of the adjustments determined under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph. The increase or decrease in tax attributable to the adjustments for such year is the difference between the tax for such year computed with the allocation of one-tenth of the net amount of the adjustments to such taxable year over the tax computed without the allocation of any part of the adjustments to such year.
(ii) The amount of increase or decrease (as the case may be) referred to in section 818(e) (2) or (3) and paragraphs (c) or (d) of this section, shall be the amount of the increase or decrease in tax ascertained in the manner described in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, multiplied by 10.
(c)
Treatment of decrease.
Section 818(e) (2) provides that for purposes of subtitle F of the Code, if the recomputation under paragraph (b) (3) (ii) of this section results in a decrease, the
amount of such decrease shall be treated as a decrease in the tax imposed for 1957; except that for purposes of computing the period of limitation on the making of refunds or the allowance of credits with respect to such overpayments, the amount of such decrease shall be treated as an overpayment of tax for 1959. No interest shall be paid, for any period before March 16, 1960, on any overpayment of the tax imposed for 1957 which is attributable to such decrease.
(d)
Treatment of increase
—(1)
In general.
Section 818(e) (3) (A) provides that for purposes of subtitle F of the Code, other than section 6016 (relating to declarations of estimated income tax by corporations) and section 6655 (relating to failure by corporations to pay estimated income tax), if the recomputation under paragraph (b) (3) (ii) of this section results in an increase, the amount of such increase shall be treated as a tax imposed for 1959. Such tax shall be payable in 10 equal annual installments, beginning with March 15, 1960.
(2)
Special rules.
Section 818(e) (3) (B) provides that for purposes of section 818(e) (3) (A) and subparagraph (1) of this paragraph:

(ii) Section 6152(c) (relating to proration of deficiencies to installments) and the regulations thereunder shall apply. However, section 6152(a) (relating to the election to make installment payments) and the regulations thereunder shall not apply.
(iii) In applying section 6502(a) (1) (relating to collection after assessment) and the regulations thereunder, the assessment of any installment described in section 818(e) (3) (A) and subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall be treated as made at the time prescribed therein for the payment of such installment.
(iv) If for any taxable year the taxpayer is not a life insurance company, the amount of the increase in tax (as determined under paragraph (b) (3) (ii) of this section), to the extent not taken into account for prior taxable years, shall be payable on the date the return for such taxable year is due (determined without regard to any extensions of time for filing such return), unless such amount is required to be taken into account by the acquiring corporation under section 381(c) (22) and the regulations thereunder.
(e)
Modifications of 1957 tax computation.
Section 818(e) (4) provides that in recomputing the taxpayer's tax for 1957 for purposes of section 818(e) (1) and paragraph (b) of this section:
(1) Section 804(b), as in effect for 1957 (relating to the maximum reserve and other policy liability deduction), shall not apply with respect to any amount required to be taken into account by reason of section 818(e) (1) and paragraph (b) of this section; and
(2) The amount of the deduction allowed by section 805, as in effect for 1957 (relating to the special interest deduction), shall not be reduced by reason of any amount required to be taken into account under section 818(e) (1) and paragraph (b) of this section.
(f)
Illustration of principles.
The application of section 818(e) and this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
For the taxable year 1957, the life insurance taxable income of M, a life insurance company, is $200,000 computed on the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting. The net amount of the adjustments required under section 818(e)(1) by reason of the change to the accrual method of accounting for 1958, increases M's life insurance taxable income for 1957 by $50,000. The increase in tax attributable to the change in method of accounting required by section 818(a) is $26,000, computed as follows:
(1) Life insurance taxable income before adjustments
$200,000
(2) Adjustments required by sec. 818(e) (1) (1/10 × $50,000)
5,000
(3) Life insurance taxable income after adjustments (item (1) plus item (2))
205,000
(4) Tax liability after adjustments (52% × $205,000, minus $5,500)
101,100
(5) Tax liability before adjustments (52% × $200,000, minus $5,500)
98,500
(6) Excess of item (4) over item (5)
2,600
(7) Increase in tax for purposes of sec. 818(e) (3) (item (6) multiplied by 10)
26,000
Under the provisions of section 818(e)(3), one-tenth of the increase in tax for 1957 attributable to the change in method of accounting required by section 818(a), $2,600 (1/10 × $26,000), was due and payable on March 15, 1960, and the balance, $23,400 (9/10 × $26,000), is
due and payable in equal installments on March 15th of the nine succeeding taxable years. However, if for the taxable year 1965, M is no longer a life insurance company, and section 381(c)(22) does not apply, the balance of the installments not paid in prior taxable years, $10,400 (4/10 × $26,000), shall be due and payable on March 15, 1966.

# Example 2.
Assume the facts are the same as in example 1, except that the net amount of the adjustments required by section 818(e)(1) decreases M's life insurance taxable income for 1957 by $25,000. The decrease in tax attributable to the change in method of accounting required by section 818(a) is $13,000, computed as follows:
(1) Life insurance taxable income before adjustments
$200,000
(2) Adjustments required by sec. 818(e) (1) (1/10 × $25,000)
2,500
(3) Life insurance taxable income after adjustments (item (1) minus item (2))
197,500
(4) Tax liability after adjustments (52% × $197,500, minus $5,500)
97,200
(5) Tax liability before adjustments (52% × $200,000, minus $5,500)
98,500
(6) Excess of item (5) over item (4)
1,300
(7) Decrease in tax for purposes of sec. 818(e)(2) (item (6) multiplied by 10)
13,000
Under the provisions of section 818(e)(2), the entire $13,000 decrease in tax for 1957 attributable to the change in method of accounting required by section 818(a) shall be treated as an overpayment of tax for the taxable year 1959.

§ 1.818-7
Denial of double deductions.
Section 818(f) provides that the same item may not be deducted more than once under subpart B, part I, subchapter L, chapter 1 of the Code (relating to the determination of taxable investment income), and more than once under subpart C, part I, subchapter L, chapter 1 of the Code (relating to the determination of gain or loss from operations).

§ 1.818-8
Special rules relating to consolidated returns and certain capital losses.
Section 818(g) provides that, in the case of a life insurance company filing or required to file a consolidated return under section 1501 for a taxable year, the computations of the policyholders' share of investment yield under subparts B and C, part I, subchapter L, chapter 1 of the Code (including all determinations and computations incident thereto) shall be made as if such company were not filing a consolidated return. Thus, for example, if X and Y are life insurance companies which are entitled to file a consolidated return for 1975 and X has paid dividends to Y during such taxable year, Y must include such dividends in the computation of gross investment income under section 804(b). For other rules relating to the filing of consolidated returns, see sections 1501 through 1504 and the regulations thereunder.

§ 1.819-1
Taxable years affected.
Section 1.819-2 is applicable only to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1957, and all references to sections of part I, subchapter L, chapter 1 of the Code, are to the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended by the Life Insurance Company Income Tax Act of 1959 (73 Stat. 112).

§ 1.819-2
Foreign life insurance companies.
(a)
Carrying on United States insurance business.
Section 819(a) provides that a foreign life insurance company carrying on a life insurance business within the United States, if with respect to its United States business it would qualify as a life insurance company under section 801, shall be taxable on its United States business under section 802 in the same manner as a domestic life insurance company. Thus, the life insurance company taxable income of such a foreign life insurance company shall not be determined in the manner provided by part I, subchapter N, chapter 1 of the Code (relating to determination of sources of income), but shall be determined in the manner provided by part I, subchapter L, chapter 1 of the Code (relating to life insurance companies). See section 842. Accordingly, in determining its life insurance company taxable income from its United States business, such a foreign life insurance company shall take into account the appropriate items of income irrespective of whether such items of income are from sources within or without the United
States. A foreign life insurance company shall take into account the appropriate items of expenses, losses, and other deductions properly allocable to such items of income from its United States business. To the extent not inconsistent with the provisions of this paragraph, section 818(a), and section 819(b), all computations entering into the determination of taxes imposed by part I shall be made in a manner consistent with the manner required for purposes of the annual statement approved by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.
(b)
Adjustment where surplus held in the United States is less than specified minimum
—(1)
In general.
Section 819(b)(1) provides that if the minimum figure for the taxable year determined under section 819(b)(2) and subparagraph (2)(i) of this paragraph exceeds the surplus held in the United States as of the end of the taxable year (as defined in section 819(b)(2)(B) and subparagraph (2)(ii) of this paragraph) by a foreign life insurance company carrying on a life insurance business within the United States and taxable under section 802, then:
(i) The amount of the policy and other contract liability requirements (determined under section 805 and § 1.805-4 without regard to this subparagraph), and
(ii) The amount of the required interest (determined under section 809(a)(2) and paragraph (d) of § 1.809-2 without regard to this subparagraph),
shall each be reduced by an amount determined by multiplying such excess by the current earnings rate (as defined in section 805(b)(2) and paragraph (a)(2) of § 1.805-5) of such company. Such current earnings rate shall be determined by reference to the assets held by the company in the United States.
(2)
Definitions.
For purposes of section 819(b)(1) and subparagraph (1) of this paragraph:
(i) The term
minimum figure,
in the case of a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1957, but before January 1, 1959, means the amount obtained by multiplying the company's total insurance liabilities on United States business by 9 percent. In the case of any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1958, such term means the amount obtained by multiplying the company's total insurance liabilities on United States business by the percentage determined and proclaimed by the Secretary as being applicable for such year.
(ii) The term
surplus held in the United States
means the excess of the assets held in the United States (as of the end of the taxable year) over the total insurance liabilities on United States business (as of the end of the taxable year).
(iii) The term
total insurance liabilities
means the sum of the total reserves (as defined in section 801(c) and paragraph (a) of § 1.801-5) as of the end of the taxable year plus (to the extent not included in total reserves) the items referred to in section 810(c) (3), (4), and (5) of paragraph (b) (3), (4), and (5) of § 1.810-2 as of the end of the taxable year; and
(iv) The term
assets
shall have the same meaning as that contained in section 805(b)(4) and paragraph (a)(4) of § 1.805-5.
(3)
Illustration of principles.
The provisions of section 819(b) and this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
For the taxable year 1958, P, a foreign life insurance company carrying on a life insurance business within the United States and taxable under section 802, has total insurance liabilities on United States business (as of the end of the taxable year) of $940,000, assets held in the United States of $1,000,000 (as of the end of the taxable year), policy and other contract liability requirements in the amount of $30,000 required interest in the amount of $20,000, and a current earnings rate of 4 percent. In order to determine whether section 819(b) applies for the taxable year 1958, P must first compute its minimum figure, for if the minimum figure is less than the surplus held in the United States (as of the end of the taxable year), no section 819(b) adjustments need be made. Since the minimum figure, $84,600 ($940,000, the total insurance liabilities on United States business multiplied by 9 percent, the percentage applicable for 1958), exceeds the surplus held in the United States, $60,000 (the excess of the assets held in the United States, $1,000,000, over the total insurance liabilities on United States business, $940,000), by $24,600, section 819(b) applies for the taxable year 1958. Thus, the amount of the policy and other contract liability requirements, $30,000, and the amount of the required interest, $20,000, shall each be reduced
by $984 ($24,600, the amount of such excess, multiplied by 4 percent, the current earnings rate).
(4)
Segregated asset accounts.
For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1967, pursuant to the provisions of section 801(g):
(i) A foreign corporation carrying on a life insurance business which issues contracts based on segregated asset accounts shall separately compute in a manner consistent with this subparagraph the adjustment (if any) under section 819 to the amount of policy and other contract liability requirements and the amount of required interest properly attributable to each of such segregated asset accounts. The “minimum figure” used in section 819 in making the adjustment with respect to each of the segregated asset accounts shall be computed as provided in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph in lieu of the manner provided in subparagraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this paragraph.
(ii) The minimum figure applicable to a segregated asset account referred to in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph is the amount determined by multiplying the total insurance liabilities on U.S. business attributable to such a segregated asset account, by 1 percent.
(iii) The minimum figure as computed under subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph shall be compared only with the surplus held in the United States attributable to each segregated asset account referred to in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph. Such surplus is the excess of assets held in the United States properly attributable to such segregated asset account over the total insurance liabilities on U.S. business properly attributable to such account.
(iv) If the minimum figure applicable to accounts other than segregated asset accounts exceeds the surplus held in the United States attributable to such other accounts, for purposes of section 819 and this paragraph, the amount of such excess shall not exceed the company's overall excess, as defined in this subdivision. No adjustment under section 819 or this paragraph shall be made with respect to any account if there is no such overall excess. For purposes of this subdivision and of subdivision (v) of this subparagraph, the term “overall excess” means the amount, if any, by which the aggregate minimum figures applicable to segregated asset accounts plus the minimum figure applicable to accounts other than segregated asset accounts exceeds the surplus held in the United States with respect to the company's entire U.S. life insurance business, including segregated asset accounts as well as other accounts.
(v) In the case of a company which issues contracts based on one or more than one segregated asset account, if the minimum figure applicable to a segregated asset account exceeds the surplus held in the United States attributable to such account, then for purposes of section 819 and this paragraph, the amount of such excess shall not exceed the account limitation figure, as defined in this subdivision. Therefore, no adjustment under section 819 or under this subparagraph shall be made with respect to any segregated asset account if the aggregate of the account limitation figures is zero, but nothing in this subdivision shall preclude an adjustment under section 819 with respect to accounts other than segregated asset accounts. For purposes of this subdivision, the term “account limitation figure” is a segregated assets account's proportionate share of the aggregate of the account limitation figures. Such aggregate of the account limitation figures is equal to the lesser of either the company's overall excess as defined in subdivision (iv) of this subparagraph, or the amount, if any, by which the aggregate of the minimum figures applicable to segregated asset accounts exceeds the surplus held in the United States with respect to all such segregated asset accounts. For purposes of this subdivision, a segregated asset account's proportionate share of the aggregate of the account limitation figures is determined by multiplying the amount of such aggregate of account limitation figures by a percentage, the numerator of which is the amount by which the minimum figure applicable to such account exceeds the surplus held in the United States attributable to such account, and the denominator of which is the aggregate of the amounts by which
the minimum figure applicable to each segregated asset account exceeds the surplus held in the United States attributable to such account.
(vi) Subdivisions (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), and (v) of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
(a) For the taxable year 1968, T, a foreign life insurance company carrying on a life insurance business within the United States and taxable under section 802, has the following assets and total insurance liabilities with respect to such U.S. business:
Regular account
Separate account A
Separate account B
Assets
$9,300,000
$1,810,000
$515,000
Total insurance liabilities
8,000,000
1,800,000
500,000
It is further assumed that the percentage determined and proclaimed by the Secretary under section 819(a)(2)(A) for the taxable year 1968 is 15 percent.
(b) In order to determine whether any adjustment under section 819 must be made, T must compute the minimum figure applicable to its Regular Account as well as each of its Separate Accounts. The minimum figure for the Regular Account is $1,200,000 (15 percent of $8,000,000). The minimum figure applicable to Separate Account A is $18,000 (1 percent of $1,800,000). The minimum figure applicable to Separate Account B is $5,000 (1 percent of $500,000). The aggregate of the minimum figures is $1,223,000 ($1,200,000 + $18,000 + $5,000). The surplus held in the United States with respect to the Regular Account is $1,300,000 ($9,300,000−$8,000,000), with respect to Separate Account A is $10,000 ($1,810,000−$1,800,000) and with respect to Separate Account B is $15,000 ($515,000−$500,000). The surplus held in the United States with respect to T's entire U.S. life insurance business is $1,325,000 ($1,300,000 + $10,000 + $15,000).
(c) Since the aggregate of the minimum figures ($1,223,000) does not exceed the surplus held in the United States attributable to T's entire U.S. life insurance business ($1,325,000), under subdivision (iv) of this subparagraph no adjustment under section 819 shall be made with respect to the Regular Account or either of the Separate Accounts.

# Example 2.
(a) The facts are the same as in example 1 except that the assets held in the United States with respect to the Regular Account is $8,300,000 instead of $9,300,000. Thus, the surplus held in the United States with respect to the Regular Account is $300,000 ($8,300,000−$8,000,000), and the surplus held in the United States with respect to T's entire U.S. life insurance business is $325,000 ($300,000 + $10,000 + $15,000).
(b) Since the aggregate of the minimum figures with respect to the Separate Accounts, $23,000 ($18,000 + $5,000), does not exceed the surplus held in the United States with respect to both of such Separate Accounts, $25,000 ($10,000 + $15,000), under subdivision (v) of this subparagraph, no adjustment under section 819 must be made with respect to either of the Separate Accounts.
(c) The excess of the minimum figure for the Regular Account ($1,200,000) over the surplus held in the United States with respect to the Regular Account ($300,000) is equal to $900,000 ($1,200,000−$300,000). However, the company's overall excess as defined in subdivision (iv) of this subparagraph, is $898,000 ($1,223,000−$325,000). Under subdivision (iv) of this subparagraph the excess with respect to the Regular Account ($900,000) is limited to the amount of overall excess ($898,000). Thus, the amount of policy and other contract liability requirements with respect to T's Regular Account and the amount of required interest with respect to T's Regular Account (both computed without regard to section 819) shall each be reduced by an amount equal to the product of $898,000 and the current earnings rate computed only with respect to T's Regular Account.
(c)
Distributions to shareholders
—(1)
In general.
In the case of a foreign life insurance company carrying on a life insurance business within the United States and taxable under section 802, section 819(c)(1) provides alternative methods for determining the amount of distributions to shareholders for purposes of section 815 (relating to distributions to shareholders) and section 802(b)(3) (relating to life insurance company taxable income). Such a foreign life insurance company may elect (in the manner provided by subparagraph (4) of this paragraph) for each taxable year whichever of the alternative methods provided by section 819(c)(1) and this subparagraph it desires, and the method elected for any one taxable year shall be effective only with respect to the taxable year for which the election is made. Such alternative methods are:
(i) The amount of the distributions to shareholders shall be the amount determined by multiplying the total amount of distributions to shareholders by the percentage which the minimum figure for the taxable year is of the excess of the assets of the company over the total insurance liabilities; or
(ii) The amount of the distributions for shareholders shall be the amount determined by multiplying the total amount of distributions for shareholders by the percentage which the total insurance liabilities on United States business for the taxable year is of the total insurance liabilities of the company.
(2)
Definitions.
For purposes of section 819(c)(1) and subparagraph (1) of this paragraph:
(i) The term
total amount of the distributions to shareholders
means all distributions (within the meaning of section 815 and § 1.815-2) by a foreign life insurance company to all of its shareholders whether or not in the United States;
(ii) The term
minimum figure for the taxable year
means the amount determined under section 819(b)(2)(A) and paragraph (b)(2) of this section;
(iii) The term
assets of the company
means all of the assets (as defined in section 805(b) (4) and paragraph (a) (4) of § 1.805-5) of the foreign life insurance company whether or not in the United States (as of the end of the taxable year); and
(iv) The term
total insurance liabilities of the company
means the total insurance liabilities (as defined in section 819(b)(2) and paragraph (b)(2) of this section) on all of its business whether or not in the United States (as of the end of the taxable year).
(3)
Illustration of principles.
The provisions of section 819(c)(1) and subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
For the taxable year 1958, T, a foreign life insurance company carrying on a life insurance business within the United States and taxable under section 802, has a minimum figure of $40,000, total amount of distributions to all shareholders (within the meaning of section 815) of $5,000, assets (as of the end of the year) of $500,000, total insurance liabilities (as of the end of the year) of $450,000, and total insurance liabilities on United States business (as of the end of the year) of $180,000. Based upon these facts, if T elects the method provided in section 819(c)(1)(A) and subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph, the amount of T's distributions to shareholders for the taxable year 1958 is $4,000, that is, $5,000 (the total amount of distributions to shareholders) multiplied by 80 percent (the percentage which the minimum figure for the taxable year, $40,000, is of $50,000, the excess of the assets of the company ($500,000) over the total insurance liabilities ($450,000)).

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in example 1, except that for the taxable year 1958, T elects the method provided in section 819(c)(1)(B) and subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph. Based upon these facts, the amount of T's distributions to shareholders for the taxable year 1958 is $2,000, that is, $5,000 (the total amount of distributions to shareholders) multiplied by 40 percent (the percentage which the total insurance liabilities on United States business ($180,000) is of the total insurance liabilities of the company ($450,000)).
(4)
Manner and effect of election.
(i) The election provided by section 819(c)(1) shall be made in a statement attached to the foreign life insurance company's income tax return for any taxable year for which the company desires the election to apply. The return and statement must be filed not later than the date prescribed by law (including extensions thereof) for filing the return for such taxable year. The statement shall indicate the method elected, the name and address of the taxpayer, and shall be signed by the taxpayer (or his duly authorized representative).
(ii) An election made under section 819(c)(1) and this paragraph shall be effective only with respect to the taxable year for which the election is made. Thus, the company must make a new election for each taxable year for which it desires the election to apply. Once such election has been made for any taxable year it may not be revoked. However, for taxable years beginning prior to April 4, 1961, a company may revoke the election provided by section 819(c)(1) without obtaining consent from the Commissioner by filing, before July 4, 1961, a statement that the company desires to revoke such election. An amended return reflecting such revocation and the selection of the other percentage must accompany the statement for all taxable years for which returns have been filed with respect to such election.
(5)
Application of section 815.
Once the amount of distributions to shareholders is determined under the provisions of section 819(c)(1) and this paragraph, the rules of section 815 (relating to distributions to shareholders) shall
apply to the shareholders surplus account and the policyholders surplus account of a foreign stock life insurance company in the same manner as they would apply to a domestic stock life insurance company.
(d)
Distributions pursuant to certain mutualizations.
Section 819(c)(2) provides that for purposes of applying section 815(e) and paragraph (e) of § 1.815-6 (relating to a special rule for certain mutualizations) in the case of a foreign life insurance company subject to tax under section 802:
(1) The paid-in capital and paid-in surplus referred to in section 815(e)(1)(A) of a foreign life insurance company is the portion of such capital and surplus determined by multiplying such amounts by the percentage selected for the taxable year under section 819(c)(1) and paragraph (c)(1) of this section; and
(2) The excess referred to in section 815(e)(2)(A)(i) (without the adjustment provided by section 815(e)(2)(B)), is whichever of the following is the greater:
(i) The minimum figure for 1958 determined under section 819(b)(2)(A); or
(ii) The surplus held in the United States (as defined in section 819(b)(2)(B)) determined as of December 31, 1958.
(e)
No United States insurance business.
Foreign life insurance companies not carrying on an insurance business within the United States shall not be taxable under part I, subchapter L, chapter 1 of the Code, but shall be taxable as other foreign corporations. See section 881 and the regulations thereunder.

Amortization of premium and accrual of discount.
Section 822(d)(2) makes provision for the appropriate amortization of premium and the appropriate accrual of discount, attributable to the taxable year, on bonds, notes, debentures or other evidences of indebtedness held by a mutual insurance company subject to the tax imposed by section 821. Such amortization and accrual is the same as that provided for life insurance companies by section 803(i), except that in determining the premium and discount of a mutual insurance company subject to the tax imposed by section 821 the basis provided in section 1012 shall be used in lieu of the acquisition value.

§ 1.822-5
Mutual insurance company taxable income.
(a)
Mutual insurance company taxable income defined.
Section 822(a) defines the term “mutual insurance company taxable income” for purposes of part II, subchapter L, chapter 1 of the Code. Mutual insurance company taxable income means gross investment income (as defined in section 822(b) and paragraph (b) of this section), less the deductions provided in section 822(c) and paragraph (c) of this section for wholly tax-exempt interest, investment expenses, real estate expenses, depreciation, interest paid or accrued, capital losses, special deductions, trade or business (other than in insurance business) expenses, and depletion. However, such expenses are deductible only to the extent that they relate to investment income and the deduction of such expenses is not disallowed by any other provision of subtitle A of the Code. For example, investment expenses are not allowable unless they are ordinary and necessary expenses within the meaning of section 162. In addition to the limitations on deductions relating to real estate owned and occupied by a mutual insurance company subject to the tax imposed by section 821 provided in section 822(d)(1), the adjustment for amortization of premium and accrual of discount provided in section 822(d)(2), and the limitation on the deduction for investment expenses where general expenses are allocated to investment income provided in section 822(c)(2), mutual insurance companies subject to the tax imposed by section 821 are subject to the limitation on deductions relating to wholly tax-exempt income provided in section 265. Such companies are not entitled to the net operating loss deduction provided in section 172, and a deduction shall not be permitted with respect to the same item more than once.
(b)
Gross investment income defined.
For purposes of part II, subchapter L, chapter 1 of the Code, section 822(b) defines the term “gross investment income” of a mutual insurance company subject to the tax imposed by section 821 as the sum of the following:
(1) The gross amount of income during the taxable year from:
(i) Interest (including tax-exempt interest and partially tax-exempt interest), as described in § 1.61-7. Interest shall be adjusted for amortization of premium and accrual of discount in accordance with the rules prescribed in section 822(d)(2) and § 1.822-7;
(ii) Dividends, as described in § 1.61-9;
(iii) Rents and royalties, as described in § 1.61-8;
(iv) The entering into of any lease, mortgage or other instrument or agreement from which the company may derive interest, rents, or royalties;
(v) The alteration or termination of any instrument or agreement described in subdivision (iv) of this subparagraph;
(vi) Gains from sales or exchanges of capital assets to the extent provided in subchapter P (section 1201 and following, relating to capital gains and losses), chapter 1 of the Code.
(2) The gross income from any trade or business (other than an insurance business) carried on by a mutual insurance company subject to the tax imposed by section 821, or by a partnership of which the insurance company is a partner.
For example, gross investment income includes amounts received as commitment fees, or as a bonus for the entering into of a lease, or as a penalty for the early payment of a mortgage. In computing the gross income from any trade or business (other than an insurance business) carried on by the insurance company, or by a partnership of which the insurance company is a partner, any item described in section 822(b)(1) and paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall not be considered as gross income arising from the conduct of such trade or business, but shall be taken into account under section 822(b)(1) and paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(c)
Deductions from gross investment income
—(1)
Wholly tax-exempt interest.
Interest which in the case of other taxpayers is excluded from gross income by section 103 but included in the gross investment income by section 822(b) is
allowed as a deduction from gross investment income by section 822(c)(1).
(2)
Investment expenses.
(i) The deduction for investment expenses under section 822(c)(2) includes only those expenses of the taxable year which are fairly chargeable against gross investment income. For example, investment expenses include salaries and expenses paid exclusively for work in looking after investments, and amounts expended for printing, stationery, postage, and stenographic work incident to the collection of interest. An itemized schedule of such expenses shall be attached to the return.
(ii) Any assignment of general expenses to the investment department of a mutual insurance company subject to the tax imposed by section 821 subjects the entire deduction for investment expenses to the limitation provided in section 822(c)(2) and subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph. As used in section 822(c)(2), the term “general expenses” means any expense paid or incurred for the benefit of more than one department of the company rather than for the benefit of a particular department thereof. For example, if an expense, such as a salary, is attributable to more than one department, including the investment department, such expense may be properly allocated among these departments. If such expense is allocated, the amount properly allocable to the investment department shall be deductible as general expenses assigned to or included in investment expenses and as such shall be subject to the limitation of section 822(c)(2) and subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph. However, a company subject to the tax imposed by section 821 shall not deduct under section 822(c)(2) its real estate taxes, depreciation, or other expenses with respect to any portion of the real estate which it owns, irrespective of whether such items are properly allocable to its investment department. For the rules relating to the deductibility of these items, see section 822(c) (3) and (4) and subparagraphs (3) and (4) of this paragraph. If general expenses are in part assigned to or included in investment expenses, the maximum allowance (as determined under section 822(c)(2) shall not be granted unless it is shown to the satisfaction of the district director that such allowance is justified by a reasonable assignment of actual expenses. The accounting procedure employed is not conclusive as to whether any assignment has in fact been made. Investment expenses do not include Federal income and excess profits taxes, if any.
(iii) If any general expenses are in part assigned to or included in investment expenses, the total deduction under section 822(c)(2) shall not exceed the sum of:
(
a
) One-fourth of 1 percent of the mean of the book value of the invested assets held at the beginning and end of the taxable year, plus.
(
b
) One-fourth of the amount by which mutual insurance company taxable income (computed without any deduction for investment expenses, tax-free interest, partially tax-exempt interest, or dividends received) exceeds 33/4 percent of the book value of the mean of the invested assets held at the beginning and end of the taxable year.
For purposes of section 822(c)(2) and this paragraph, the term “invested assets” means only those assets which are owned and used, and to the extent used, for the purpose of producing the income specified in section 822(b). See paragraph (b) of this section. The term does not include real estate owned and occupied, and to the extent owned and occupied, by the company.
(3)
Real estate expenses and taxes.
The deduction for real estate expenses and taxes under section 822(c)(3) includes taxes (as defined in section 164) and other expenses for the taxable year exclusively on or with respect to real estate owned by the company. For example, no deduction shall be allowed under section 822(c)(3) for amounts allowed as a deduction under section 164(e) (relating to taxes of shareholders paid by a corporation). No deduction shall be allowed under section 822(c)(3) for any amount paid out for new buildings, or for permanent improvements or betterments made to increase the value of any property. An itemized schedule of such taxes and expenses shall be attached to the return. See § 1.822-6 for limitation of such deduction.
(4)
Depreciation.
The deduction allowed by section 822(c)(4) for depreciation is, except as provided in section 822(d)(1) and § 1.822-6, identical to that allowed other corporations by section 167. Such amount allowed as a deduction from gross investment income in determining mutual insurance company taxable income is limited to depreciation sustained on the property used, and to the extent used, for the purpose of producing the income specified in section 822(b).
(5)
Interest paid or accrued.
The deduction allowed by section 822(c)(5) for interest on indebtedness is the same as that allowed other corporations by section 163. See § 1.163-1.
(6)
Capital losses.
(i) The deduction for capital losses under section 822(c)(6) includes not only capital losses to the extent provided in subchapter P, chapter 1 of the Code but in addition thereto losses from capital assets sold or exchanged to provide funds to meet abnormal insurance losses and to provide for the payment of dividends and similar distributions to policyholders. Losses in the latter case may be deducted from ordinary income while the deduction for losses under subchapter P is limited to the gains. See section 1211.
(ii) Capital assets are considered as sold or exchanged to provide for the funds or payments specified in section 822(c)(6), to the extent that the gross receipts from the sale or exchange of such assets are not greater than the excess, if any, for the taxable year of the sum of dividends and similar distributions paid to policyholders, and losses and expenses paid over the sum of the items described in section 822(b) (other than paragraph (1)(D) thereof) and net premiums received. If, by reason of a particular sale or exchange of a capital asset, gross receipts are greater than such excess, the gross receipts and the resulting loss should be apportioned and the excess included in capital losses subject to the provisions of subchapter P. Capital losses actually used to reduce net income in any taxable year may not again be used in a succeeding taxable year as an offset against capital gains in that year and for that purpose a special rule is set forth for the application of section 1212.
(iii) The application of section 822(c)(6) may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
The X Company, a mutual fire insurance company subject to the tax imposed by section 821, in the taxable year 1958 sells capital assets in order to obtain funds to meet abnormal insurance losses and to provide for the payment of dividends and similar distributions to policyholders. The gross receipts from the sale are $60,000, resulting in losses of $20,000. It pays dividends to policyholders of $150,000. It sustains losses of $25,000, and pays expenses of $25,000. It receives interest of $50,000, dividends of $5,000, royalties of $4,000, and net premiums of $66,000. The excess of the sum of dividends, losses, and expenses paid ($200,000) over the sum of the items described in section 822(b) (other than paragraph (1)(D) thereof) and net premiums received ($125,000) is $75,000. As the gross receipts from the sale of capital assets ($60,000) do not exceed such excess ($75,000), the losses of $20,000 are allowable as a deduction from gross investment income.

# Example 2.
If in example 1 the gross receipts were $76,000 and the last capital asset sold, for the purpose therein specified, resulted in gross receipts of $2,000 and a loss of $500, the losses allowable as a deduction from gross investment income would be $19,750. The last sale made the gross receipts of $76,000 exceed by $1,000 the excess ($75,000) of the sum of dividends, losses, and expenses paid ($200,000) over the sum of the items described in section 822(b) (other than paragraph (1)(D) thereof) and net premiums received ($125,000). The gross receipts and the resulting loss from the last sale are apportioned on the basis of the ratio of the excess of $1,000 to the gross receipts of $2,000, or 50 percent. Fifty percent of the loss of $500 is deducted from the total loss of $20,000. The remaining gross receipts of $1,000 and the proportionate loss of $250 should be reported as capital losses under subchapter P.

# Example 3.
If in example 1 the X Company had mutual insurance company taxable income for purposes of the surtax of $9,750 and, under the provisions of subchapter P, chapter 1 of the Code, had capital losses of $18,000 and capital gains of $10,000, the net capital loss for the taxable year 1958, in applying section 1212 for the purposes of section 822(c)(6), would be $8,000. This is determined by subtracting from total losses of $38,000 ($18,000 capital losses under subchapter P plus $20,000 other capital losses under section 822(c)(6)) the sum of capital gains of $10,000 and losses from the sale or exchange of capital assets sold or exchanged to obtain funds to meet abnormal insurance losses and to provide for the payment of dividends and
similar distributions to policyholders of $20,000. Such losses of $20,000 are added to capital gains of $10,000, since they are less than taxable income for purposes of the surtax, computed without regard to gains or losses from sales or exchanges of capital assets, of $29,750 ($9,750 taxable income for purposes of the surtax plus $20,000 other capital losses under section 822(c)(6) plus the portion of capital losses allowable under subchapter P of $10,000 minus capital gains under subchapter P of $10,000).
(7)
Special deductions.
Section 822(c)(7) allows a mutual insurance company the special deductions provided by part VIII (section 241 and following), except section 248, subchapter B, chapter 1 of the Code, relating to partially tax-exempt interest and to dividends received.
(8)
Trade or business deductions.
(i) Under section 822(c)(8), the deductions allowed by subtitle A of the Code (without regard to this part) which are attributable to any trade or business (other than an insurance business) carried on by the insurance company, or by a partnership of which the company is a partner are, subject to the limitations in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, allowable as deductions from gross investment income in computing mutual insurance company taxable income. Such deductions are allowable, however, only to the extent that they relate to income which is included in the company's gross investment income by reason of section 822(b) (2). Thus, a deduction shall not be allowed under section 822(c)(8) with respect to any item described in section 822(b)(1). The allowable deductions may exceed the gross income from such business.
(ii) In computing the deductions under section 822(c)(8):
(
a
) Any item, to the extent attributable to the carrying on of the insurance business, shall not be taken into account. For example, if the company operates a radio station primarily to advertise its own insurance services, a portion of the expenses of the radio station shall not be allowed as a deduction. The portion disallowed shall be an amount which bears the same ratio to the total expenses of the station as the value of advertising furnished to the insurance company bears to the total value of services rendered by the station.
(
b
) The deduction for net operating losses provided in section 172 shall not be allowed.
(9)
Depletion.
The deduction allowed by section 822(c)(9) for depletion is the same as that allowed life insurance companies under section 804(c)(4). See paragraph (b)(5) of § 1.804-4.
[T.D. 6610, 27 FR 8720, Aug. 31, 1962, as amended by T.D. 6631, 28 FR 219, Jan. 9, 1963]
§ 1.822-6
Real estate owned and occupied.
Section 822(d)(1) provides that the amount allowable as a deduction for taxes, expenses, and depreciation on or with respect to any real estate owned and occupied in whole or in part by a mutual insurance company subject to the tax imposed by section 821 shall be limited to an amount which bears the same ratio to such deduction (computed without regard to this limitation) as the rental value of the space not so occupied bears to the rental value of the entire property. For example, if the rental value of the space not occupied by the company is equal to one-half of the rental value of the entire property, the deduction for taxes, expenses, and depreciation is one-half of the taxes, expenses, and depreciation on account of the entire property. Where a deduction is claimed as provided in this section, the parts of the property occupied and the parts not occupied by the company, together with the respective rental values thereof, must be shown in a statement accompanying the return.
[T.D. 6610, 27 FR 8722, Aug. 31, 1962]
§ 1.822-7
Amortization of premium and accrual of discount.
Section 822(d)(2) makes provision for the appropriate amortization of premium and the appropriate accrual of discount, attributable to the taxable year, on bonds, notes, debentures, or other evidences of indebtedness held by a mutual insurance company subject to the tax imposed by section 821. Such amortization and accrual is the same as that provided for life insurance companies by section 818(b)(1), as amended by the Life Insurance Company Income Tax Act of 1959 (73 Stat. 133), and shall
be determined in accordance with paragraphs (a) and (b) of § 1.818-3, except in the case of a mutual insurance company subject to the tax imposed by section 821, paragraph (b) of § 1.818-3 shall apply without regard to the date of acquisition and the basis provided in section 1012 shall be used in lieu of the acquisition value.

§ 1.822-8
Determination of taxable investment income.
(a)
In general
—(1)(i)
Taxable investment income defined.
Section 822(a)(1) defines the term “taxable investment income” for purposes of part II, subchapter L, chapter 1 of the Code as the gross investment income (as defined in section 822(b) and paragraph (b) of this section), less the deductions provided in section 822(c) and paragraph (c) of this section for wholly tax-exempt interest, investment expenses, real estate expenses, depreciation, interest paid or accrued, capital losses, special deductions, trade or business (other than an insurance business) expenses, and depletion. However, such expenses are deductible only to the extent that they relate to investment income and the deduction of such expenses is not disallowed by any other provision of subtitle A of the Code.
(ii) For example, investment expenses are not allowable unless they are ordinary and necessary expenses within the meaning of section 162. In addition to the limitations on deductions relating to real estate owned and occupied by a mutual insurance company subject to the tax imposed by section 821 provided in section 822(d)(1), the adjustment for amortization of premium and accrual of discount provided in section 822(d)(2), and the limitation on the deduction for investment expenses where general expenses are allocated to investment income provided in section 822(c)(2), mutual insurance companies subject to the tax imposed by section 821 (a) or (c) are subject to the limitation on deductions relating to wholly tax-exempt income provided in section 265. Such companies are not entitled to the net operating loss deduction provided in section 172. See, however, section 825 for unused loss deduction allowed companies taxable under section 821(a). A deduction shall not be permitted with respect to the same item more than once.
(2)
Investment loss defined.
The term “investment loss” is defined by section 822(a)(2) as the amount by which the deductions allowable under section 822(c) and paragraph (c) of this section exceed the gross investment income (as defined in section 822(b) and paragraph (b) of this section).
(b)
Gross investment income defined.
For purposes of part II, subchapter L, chapter 1 of the Code, section 822(b) defines the term “gross investment income” of a mutual insurance company subject to the tax imposed by section 821 (a) or (c) as the sum of the following:
(1) The gross amount of income during the taxable year from:
(i) Interest (including tax-exempt interest and partially tax-exempt interest), as described in § 1.61-7. Interest shall be adjusted for amortization of premium and accrual of discount in accordance with the rules prescribed in section 822(d)(2) and § 1.822-10;
(ii) Dividends, as described in § 1.61-9;
(iii) Rents and royalties, as described in § 1.61-8;
(iv) The entering into of any lease, mortgage or other instrument or agreement from which the company may derive interest, rents, or royalties;
(v) The alteration or termination of any instrument or agreement described in subdivision (iv) of this subparagraph;
(vi) Gains from sales or exchanges of capital assets to the extent provided in subchapter P (section 1201 and following, relating to capital gains and losses) chapter 1 of the Code.
(2) The gross income from any trade or business (other than an insurance business) carried on by a mutual insurance company subject to the tax imposed by section 821 (a) or (c), or by a partnership of which the insurance company is a partner.
For example, gross investment income includes amounts received as commitment fees, or as a bonus for the entering into of a lease, or as a penalty for the early payment of a mortgage. In computing the gross income from any
trade or business (other than an insurance business) carried on by the insurance company, or by a partnership of which the insurance company is a partner, any item described in section 822(b)(1) and paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall not be considered as gross income arising from the conduct of such trade or business, but shall be taken into account under section 822(b)(1) and paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(c)
Deductions from gross investment income
—(1)
Wholly tax-exempt interest.
Interest which in the case of other taxpayers is excluded from gross income by section 103 but included in the gross investment income by section 822(b) is allowed as a deduction from gross investment income by section 822(c)(1).
(2)
Investment expenses.
(i) The deduction for investment expenses under section 822(c)(2) includes only those expenses of the taxable year which are fairly chargeable against gross investment income. For example, investment expenses include salaries and expenses paid exclusively for work in looking after investments, and amounts expended for printing, stationery, postage, and stenographic work incident to the collection of interest. An itemized schedule of such expenses shall be attached to the return.
(ii) Any assignment of general expenses to the investment department of a mutual insurance company subject to the tax imposed by section 821 (a) or (c) subjects the entire deduction for investment expenses to the limitation provided in section 822(c)(2) and subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph. As used in section 822(c)(2), the term “general expenses” means any expense paid or incurred for the benefit of more than one department of the company rather than for the benefit of a particular department thereof. For example, if an expense, such as a salary, is attributable to more than one department, including the investment department, such expense may be properly allocated among these departments. If such expense is allocated, the amount properly allocable to the investment department shall be deductible as general expenses assigned to or included in investment expenses and as such shall be subject to the limitation of section 822(c)(2) and subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph. However, a company subject to the tax imposed by section 821 (a) or (c) shall not deduct under section 822(c)(2) its real estate taxes, depreciation, or other expenses with respect to any portion of the real estate which it owns, irrespective of whether such items are properly allocable to its investment department. For the rules relating to the deductibility of these items, see section 822(c) (3) and (4) and subparagraphs (3) and (4) of this paragraph. If general expenses are in part assigned to or included in investment expenses, the maximum allowance (as determined under section 822(c)(2)) shall not be granted unless it is shown to the satisfaction of the district director that such allowance is justified by a reasonable assignment of actual expenses. The accounting procedure employed is not conclusive as to whether any assignment has in fact been made. Investment expenses do not include Federal income and excess profits taxes, if any.
(iii) If any general expenses are in part assigned to or included in investment expenses, the total deduction under section 822(c)(2) shall not exceed the sum of:
(
a
) One-fourth of 1 percent of the mean of the book value of the invested assets held at the beginning and end of the taxable year, plus
(
b
) One-fourth of the amount by which taxable investment income (computed without any deduction for investment expenses, tax-free interest, partially tax-exempt interest, or dividends received) exceeds 33/4 percent of the book value of the mean of the invested assets held at the beginning and end of the taxable year.
For purposes of section 822(c)(2) and this paragraph, the term “invested assets” means only those assets which are owned and used, and to the extent used, for the purpose of producing the income specified in section 822(b). See paragraph (b) of this section. The term does not include real estate owned and occupied, and to the extent owned and occupied, by the company.
(3)
Real estate expenses and taxes.
The deduction for real estate expenses and taxes under section 822(c)(3) includes taxes (as defined in section 164) and
other expenses for the taxable year exclusively on or with respect to real estate owned by the company. For example, no deduction shall be allowed under section 822(c)(3) for amounts allowed as a deduction under section 164(e) (relating to taxes of shareholders paid by a corporation). No deduction shall be allowed under section 822(c)(3) for any amount paid out for new buildings, or for permanent improvements or betterments made to increase the value of any property. An itemized schedule of such taxes and expenses shall be attached to the return. See § 1.822-9 for limitation of such deduction.
(4)
Depreciation.
The deduction allowed by section 822(c)(4) for depreciation is, except as provided in section 822(d)(1) and § 1.822-9, identical to that allowed other corporations by section 167. Such amount allowed as a deduction from gross investment income in determining taxable investment income is limited to depreciation sustained on the property used, and to the extent used, for the purpose of producing the income specified in section 822(b).
(5)
Interest paid or accrued.
The deduction allowed by section 822(c)(5) for interest on indebtedness is the same as that allowed other corporations by section 163. See § 1.163-1.
(6)
Capital losses.
(i) The deduction for capital losses under section 822(c)(6) includes not only capital losses to the extent provided in subchapter P, chapter 1 of the Code but in addition thereto losses from capital assets sold or exchanged to provide funds to meet abnormal insurance losses and to provide for the payment of dividends and similar distributions to policyholders. Losses in the latter case may be deducted from ordinary income while the deduction for losses under subchapter P is limited to the gains. See section 1211.
(ii) Capital assets are considered as sold or exchanged to provide for the funds or payments specified in section 822(c)(6), to the extent that the gross receipts from the sale or exchange of such assets are not greater than the excess, if any, for the taxable year of the sum of dividends and similar distributions paid to policyholders, and losses and expenses paid over the sum of the items described in section 822(b) (other than paragraph (1)(D) thereof) and net premiums received. If, by reason of a particular sale or exchange of a capital asset, gross receipts are greater than such excess, the gross receipts and the resulting loss should be apportioned and the excess included in capital losses subject to the provisions of subchapter P. Capital losses actually used to reduce net income in any taxable year may not again be used in a succeeding taxable year as an offset against capital gains in that year and for that purpose a special rule is set forth for the application of section 1212.
(iii) The application of section 822(c)(6) may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
The X Company, a mutual fire insurance company subject to tax under section 821, in the taxable year 1963 sells capital assets in order to obtain funds to meet abnormal insurance losses and to provide for the payment of dividends and similar distributions to policyholders. The gross receipts from the sale are $60,000, resulting in losses of $20,000. It pays dividends to policyholders of $150,000. It sustains losses of $25,000, and pays expenses of $25,000. It receives interest of $50,000, dividends of $5,000, royalties of $4,000, and net premiums of $66,000. The excess of the sum of dividends, losses, and expenses paid ($200,000) over the sum of the items described in section 822(b) (other than paragraph (1)(D) thereof) and net premiums received ($125,000) is $75,000. Since the gross receipts from the sale of capital assets ($60,000) do not exceed such excess ($75,000), the losses of $20,000 are allowable as a deduction from gross investment income in computing taxable investment income under section 822.

# Example 2.
If in example 1 the gross receipts were $76,000 and the last capital asset sold, for the purpose therein specified, resulted in gross receipts of $2,000 and a loss of $500, the losses allowable as a deduction from gross investment income would be $19,750. The last sale made the gross receipts of $76,000 exceed by $1,000 the excess ($75,000) of the sum of dividends, losses, and expenses paid ($200,000) over the sum of the items described in section 822(b) (other than paragraph (1)(D) thereof) and net premiums received ($125,000). The gross receipts and the resulting loss from the last sale are apportioned on the basis of the ratio of the excess of $1,000 to the gross receipts of $2,000, or 50 percent. Fifty percent of the loss of $500 is deducted from the total loss of $20,000. The
remaining gross receipts of $1,000 and the proportionate loss of $250 should be reported as capital losses under subchapter P.

# Example 3.
If in example 1 the X Company had taxable investment income for purposes of the surtax of $9,750 and, under the provisions of subchapter P, chapter 1 of the Code, had capital losses of $18,000 and capital gains of $10,000, the net capital loss for the taxable year 1963, in applying section 1212 for the purposes of section 822(c)(6), would be $8,000. This is determined by subtracting from total losses of $38,000 ($18,000 capital losses under subchapter P plus $20,000 other capital losses under section 822(c)(6)) the sum of capital gains of $10,000 and losses from the sale or exchange of capital assets sold or exchanged to obtain funds to meet abnormal insurance losses and to provide for the payment of dividends and similar distributions to policyholders of $20,000. Such losses of $20,000 are added to capital gains of $10,000, since they are less than taxable investment income for purposes of the surtax, computed without regard to gains or losses from sales or exchanges of capital assets, of $29,750 ($9,750 taxable investment income for purposes of the surtax plus $20,000 other capital losses under section 822(c)(6) plus the portion of capital losses allowable under subchapter P of $10,000 minus capital gains under subchapter P of $10,000).
(7)
Special deductions.
Section 822(c)(7) allows a mutual insurance company the special deductions provided by part VIII (section 241 and following), except section 248, subchapter B, chapter 1 of the Code, relating to partially tax-exempt interest and to dividends received. In applying section 246(b) (relating to limitation on aggregate amount of deductions for dividends received) for purposes of this subparagraph, the reference in such section to “taxable income” shall be treated as a reference to “taxable investment income”.
(8)
Trade or business deductions.
(i) Under section 822(c)(8), the deductions allowed by subtitle A of the Code (without regard to this part) which are attributable to any trade or business (other than an insurance business) carried on by the insurance company, or by a partnership of which the company is a partner are, subject to the limitations in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, allowable as deductions from gross investment income in computing taxable investment income. Such deductions are allowable, however, only to the extent that they relate to income which is included in the company's gross investment income by reason of section 822(b)(2). Thus, a deduction shall not be allowed under section 822(c)(8) with respect to any item described in section 822(b)(1). The allowable deductions may exceed the gross income from such business.
(ii) In computing the deductions under section 822(c)(8):
(
a
) Any item, to the extent attributable to the carrying on of the insurance business, shall not be taken into account. For example, if the company operates a radio station primarily to advertise its own insurance services, a portion of the expenses of the radio station shall not be allowed as a deduction. The portion disallowed shall be an amount which bears the same ratio to the total expenses of the station as the value of advertising furnished to the insurance company bears to the total value of services rendered by the station.
(
b
) The deduction for net operating losses provided in section 172 shall not be allowed.
(9)
Depletion.
The deduction allowed by section 822(c)(9) for depletion is the same as that allowed life insurance companies under section 804(c)(4). See paragraph (b)(5) of § 1.804-4.
[T.D. 6681, 28 FR 11113, Oct. 17, 1963, as amended by T.D. 9849, 84 FR 9236, Mar. 14, 2019]
§ 1.822-9
Real estate owned and occupied.
Section 822(d)(1) provides that the amount allowable as a deduction for taxes, expenses, and depreciation on or with respect to any real estate owned and occupied in whole or in part by a mutual insurance company subject to the tax imposed by section 821 (a) or (c) shall be limited to an amount which bears the same ratio to such deduction (computed without regard to this limitation) as the rental value of the space not so occupied bears to the rental value of the entire property. For example, if the rental value of the space not occupied by the company is equal to one-half of the rental value of the entire property, the deduction for taxes, expenses, and depreciation is one-half of the taxes, expenses, and depreciation on account of the entire property.
Where a deduction is claimed as provided in this section, the parts of the property occupied and the parts not occupied by the company, together with the respective rental values thereof, must be shown in a statement accompanying the return.
[T.D. 6681, 28 FR 11115, Oct. 17, 1963]
§ 1.822-10
Amortization of premium and accrual of discount.
(a)
In general.
In computing taxable investment income for the taxable year, the gross amount of income from interest, the deduction under section 822(c)(1) for wholly tax-exempt interest, and the deduction under section 242 for partially tax-exempt interest, are, under the provisions of section 822(d)(2), each to be decreased by the appropriate amortization of premium and increased by the appropriate accrual of discount attributable to the taxable year on bonds, notes, debentures, or other evidences of indebtedness held by a mutual insurance company subject to the tax imposed by section 821 (a) or (c). However, only the accrual of discount relating to issue discount will increase the deduction for wholly tax-exempt interest. See section 103. Such amortization and accrual is the same as that provided for life insurance companies by section 818(b)(1), as amended by the Life Insurance Company Income Tax Act of 1959 (73 Stat. 133), and shall be determined in accordance with paragraphs (a) and (b) of § 1.818-3, except as provided by paragraph (b) of this section.
(b)
Modifications.
(1) Paragraph (b) of § 1.818-3 shall apply to mutual casualty insurance companies subject to the tax imposed by section 821 (a) or (c) without regard to the date of acquisition of the particular securities to which the amortization of premium or accrual of discount is attributable.
(2) In computing the amount of premium or discount for purposes of section 822(d)(2) with respect to securities held by a company taxable under section 821, the basis provided by section 1012 shall be used in lieu of the acquisition value provided by paragraph (b) of § 1.818-3. In the case of a company subject to the tax imposed by section 821(c), adjustments to basis to reflect the accrual of discount and the amortization of premium shall be made in the manner provided by paragraphs (a) and (b) of § 1.818-3. However, for purposes of determining statutory underwriting income or loss for the taxable year under section 823, a company subject to the tax imposed by section 821(a) is not required to accrue discount or to amortize premium in computing its income under section 832 as if it were subject to the tax imposed by section 831. Thus, the accrual of discount and amortization of premium required in the computation of taxable investment income by a company subject to the tax imposed by section 821(a) neither increases nor decreases the mutual insurance company taxable income of such a company and, except to the extent such a company actually accrues discount or amortizes premium for purposes of making the section 832 computation, no adjustment shall be made to the basis of obligations held by it to reflect accrual of discount or amortization of premium.
[T.D. 6681, 28 FR 11115, Oct. 17, 1963]
§ 1.822-11
Net premiums.
The term “net premiums”, defined in section 822(f)(1), includes deposits and assessments, but excludes amounts returned to policyholders which are treated as dividends under section 822(f)(2). Net premiums are used in sections 822(c)(6) and 832(c)(5) in determining the limitation on certain capital losses and in the application of section 1212.
[T.D. 6681, 28 FR 11115, Oct. 17, 1963]
§ 1.822-12
Dividends to policyholders.
(a) Dividends to policyholders are used in determining the “underwriting loss” for purposes of the special transitional underwriting loss deduction provided by section 821(f), and the limitation on capital losses under section 822(c)(6); in computing statutory underwriting income or loss under section 823, and the subtractions from the protection against loss account under section 824(d). The term “dividends to policyholders” is defined in section 822(f)(2) as dividends and similar distributions paid or declared to policyholders. It includes amounts returned to policyholders where the amount is
not fixed in the insurance contract but depends upon the experience of the company or the discretion of the management. Such amounts are not to be treated as return premiums under section 822(f)(1). Savings credited to the individual accounts of the subscribers of a reciprocal underwriter or interinsurer under section 823(b)(2) are not dividends paid or declared within the meaning of this paragraph. However, distributions in respect of such credits shall be considered as dividends paid. See section 823(b)(2). The term “paid or declared” is to be construed according to the method of accounting regularly employed in keeping the books of the insurance company, and such method shall be consistently followed with respect to all deductions (including dividends and similar distributions to policyholders) and all items of income.
(b) If the method of accounting so employed is the cash receipts and disbursements method, the deduction is limited to the dividends and similar distributions actually paid to policyholders in the taxable year. If, on the other hand, the method of accounting so employed is the accrual method, the deduction, or a reasonably accurate estimate thereof, for dividends and similar distributions declared to policyholders for any taxable year will, in general, be computed by adding the amount of dividends and similar distributions declared but unpaid at the end of the taxable year to dividends and similar distributions paid during the taxable year and deducting dividends and similar distributions declared but unpaid at the beginning of the taxable year. If an insurance company using the accrual method does not compute the deduction for dividends and similar distributions declared to policyholders in the manner stated, it must submit with its return a full and complete explanation of the manner in which the deduction is computed. For the rule as to when dividends are considered paid, see the regulations under section 561.
[T.D. 6681, 28 FR 11115, Oct. 17, 1963, as amended by T.D. 9849, 84 FR 9236, Mar. 14, 2019]
§ 1.826-1
Election by reciprocal underwriters and interinsurers.
(a)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in section 826(c), any mutual insurance company which is an interinsurer or reciprocal underwriter taxable under section 821(a) may elect under section 826(a) to limit its deductions for amounts paid or incurred to its attorney-in-fact to the deductions of its attorney-in-fact which are allocable to income received by the attorney-in-fact from the reciprocal during the taxable year. See § 1.826-4 for rules relating to allocation of expenses. In no case may such an election increase the amount deductible by the reciprocal for amounts paid or due its attorney-in-fact for the taxable year. The election allowed by section 826(a) and this section in effect increases the income of the reciprocal by the net income of the attorney-in-fact attributable to its business with the reciprocal. A reciprocal making the election is allowed a credit for the amount of tax paid by the attorney-in-fact for the taxable year which is attributable to income received by the attorney-in-fact from the reciprocal. See section 826(e) and § 1.826-5.
(b)
Companies eligible to elect under section 826(a).
Any mutual insurance company which is a reciprocal underwriter or interinsurer subject to the tax imposed by section 821(a) may elect (in the manner prescribed by paragraph (c) of this section) to be subject to the limitation provided by section 826(b) and paragraph (a) of this section provided the attorney-in-fact of the electing reciprocal:
(1) Is subject to the taxes imposed by section 11 (b) and (c) and the regulations thereunder;
(2) Consents (in the manner provided by paragraph (a) of § 1.826-3) to provide the information required under paragraph (b) of § 1.826-3 during the period in which the election made under section 826(a) and this section is in effect;
(3) Reports the income received from the reciprocal and the deductions allocable thereto under the same method of accounting used by the reciprocal in reporting its deductions for amounts paid or due its attorney-in-fact; and
(4) Files its income tax return on a calendar year basis.
(c)
Manner of making election.
The election provided by section 826(a) and this section shall be made in a statement attached to the taxpayer's income tax return for the first taxable year for which such election is to apply. The statement shall include the name and address of the taxpayer, shall be signed by the taxpayer (or its duly authorized representative), and shall be filed not later than the time prescribed by law for filing the income tax return (including extensions thereof) for the first taxable year for which such election is to apply. For information required of an electing reciprocal, see paragraph (e) of this section.
(d)
Scope of election.
The election allowed by section 826(a) is binding for the taxable year for which made and all succeeding taxable years unless the Commissioner consents to a revocation of such election. Whether revocation will be permitted will depend upon the facts and circumstances of each particular case.
(e)
Information required of an electing company.
Every reciprocal underwriter or interinsurer making the election provided by section 826(a) and this section shall, in the manner provided by paragraph (f) of this section, furnish the following information for each taxable year during which such election is in effect:
(1) The name and address of the attorney-in-fact with respect to which the election allowed by section 826(a) and this section is in effect; the district in which such attorney-in-fact filed its return for the taxable year; and a copy of the consent required by section 826 and § 1.826-3 and the date and district in which such consent was filed;
(2) The deductible amount paid or due to such attorney-in-fact from the reciprocal computed without regard to the limitation provided by section 826(b);
(3) The total amount claimed as a deduction by the reciprocal for amounts paid to its attorney-in-fact after giving effect to the limitation provided by section 826(b);
(4) The amount of the increase (if any) in underwriting gain (as defined in section 824(a)) attributable to the election allowed by section 826(a);
(5) The amount of the increase (if any) in the deduction allowed by section 824(a) (relating to deduction to provide protection against losses) attributable to the election allowed by section 826(a);
(6) The amount of any increase or decrease in the statutory underwriting income or loss for the taxable year (as computed under section 823) attributable to the election allowed by section 826(a);
(7) The amount of any increase or decrease in the mutual insurance company taxable income or unused loss for the taxable year attributable to the election allowed by section 826(a);
(8) The amount of the increase (if any) in the tax liability of the reciprocal for the taxable year attributable to the election allowed by section 826(a) before taking into account the credit provided by section 826(e);
(9) The amount of tax attributable to income received by the attorney-in-fact from the reciprocal during the taxable year (as determined under § 1.826-5) claimed (under section 826(e) and paragraph (a) of this section) by the reciprocal as a credit for the taxable year; and
(10) The information which the attorney-in-fact is required to submit to the reciprocal under paragraphs (b) and (c) of § 1.826-3.
(f)
Manner in which information is to be provided.
The information required by paragraph (e) of this section shall be set forth in a statement attached to the taxpayer's income tax return for each taxable year for which such information is required. Such statement shall include the name and address of the taxpayer; and shall be filed not later than the date prescribed by law (including extensions thereof) for filing the income tax return for the taxable year with respect to which such information is being provided.
[T.D. 6681, 28 FR 11124, Oct. 17, 1963]
§ 1.826-2
Special rules applicable to electing reciprocals.
(a)
Protection against loss account.
Section 826(d) provides that for purposes of determining the amount to be subtracted from the protection against loss account under section 824(d)(1)(D)
and the regulations thereunder (relating to amounts added to the account for the fifth preceding taxable year) for any taxable year, any amount which was added to such account by reason of the election under section 826(a) and paragraph (a) of § 1.826-1 shall be treated as having been added by reason of section 824(a)(1)(A) and the regulations thereunder (relating to amounts equal to 1 percent of losses incurred during the taxable year). Thus, no amount added to the protection against loss account by reason of an election made under section 826(a) may remain in such account beyond the end of the fifth taxable year following the taxable year with respect to which such amount was added. See section 824(d)(1)(D) and paragraph (b)(3) of § 1.824-1. The amount added to the protection against loss account by reason of an election under section 826(a) is that amount which is equal to 25 percent (plus, in the case of a reciprocal which qualifies as a concentrated risk company under section 824(a), so much of the concentrated wind-storm, etc., premium percentage as exceeds 40 percent) of the amount by which:
(1) The underwriting gain (as defined by section 824(a)(1)) computed after taking into account the limitation provided by section 826(b) and § 1.826-1, exceeds
(2) The underwriting gain computed without regard to the limitation provided by section 826(b) and § 1.826-1.
(b)
Denial of surtax exemption.
Section 826(f) provides that the tax imposed upon any increase in the mutual insurance company taxable income of a reciprocal which is attributable to the limitation provided by section 826(b) shall be computed without regard to the surtax exemption provided by section 821(a)(2) and the regulations thereunder. Thus, a company making the election provided under section 826(a) will be subject to surtax, as well as normal tax, on the increase in its mutual insurance company taxable income for the taxable year which is attributable to such election. Similarly, any amount which was added to the protection against loss account by reason of an election under section 826(a) and § 1.826-1, and which is subtracted from such account in accordance with section 826(d) and paragraph (a) of this section, will be subject to surtax, as well as normal tax, to the extent such amount increases mutual insurance company taxable income in the year in which the subtraction is made. Furthermore, the company will be subject to surtax on such increases notwithstanding the fact that it may have no normal tax liability for the taxable year, because its mutual insurance company taxable income (after giving effect to the election provided by section 826(a)) does not exceed $6,000.
(c)
Adjustment for refunds.
Section 826(g) provides that if for any taxable year an attorney-in-fact is allowed a credit or refund for taxes paid with respect to which credit or refund to the reciprocal resulted under section 826(e), the taxes of such reciprocal for such taxable year shall be properly adjusted. The reciprocal shall make the adjustment required by section 826(g) by increasing its income tax liability for its taxable year in which the credit or refund is allowed to the attorney-in-fact by the amount of such credit or refund which is attributable to taxes paid by the attorney-in-fact on income received from the reciprocal, as determined under § 1.826-6, but only to the extent that the payment of such amount by the attorney-in-fact resulted in a credit or refund to the reciprocal. However, if the refund or credit to the attorney-in-fact is the result of an error in determining its items of income or deduction for the taxable year with respect to which the refund or credit is allowed, and such error affects the amount of deductions allocable to its reciprocal for such taxable year, then, if the reciprocal's period for filing an amended return has not otherwise expired, the preceding sentence shall not apply and the reciprocal shall make the adjustment required by section 826(g) by filing an amended return for such taxable year and all subsequent taxable years for which an adjustment is required. The reciprocal's amended return or returns shall give effect to the change in the deductions of the attorney-in-fact allocable to income received from the reciprocal and the tax paid by the attorney-in-fact attributable to such income. The amount of any adjustment
required by section 826(g) and this section and the computation thereof shall be set forth in a statement attached to and filed with the taxpayer's income tax return for the taxable year for which the adjustment is made. Such statement shall include the name and address of the taxpayer, and a copy of the notification received by the attorney-in-fact indicating that it has been allowed the credit or refund requiring adjustment of the reciprocal's taxes.
[T.D. 6681, 28 FR 11125, Oct. 17, 1963, as amended by T.D. 7100, 36 FR 5334, Mar. 20, 1971]
§ 1.826-3
Attorney-in-fact of electing reciprocals.
(a)
Manner of making consent.
Section 826(c)(2) provides that a reciprocal may not elect to be subject to the limitation provided by section 826(b) unless its attorney-in-fact consents to make certain information available. See paragraph (b) of this section. The attorney-in-fact of a reciprocal making the election provided by section 826(a) shall signify the consent required by section 826(c) in a statement attached to its income tax return for the first taxable year for which the reciprocal's election is to apply. Such statement shall include the name and address of the consenting taxpayer; the name and address of the reciprocal with respect to which such consent is to apply; shall be signed by the taxpayer (or its duly authorized representative); and shall be filed not later than the date prescribed by law (including extensions thereof) for filing the income tax return for the first taxable year for which such consent is to apply. In addition, such statement shall specify that the taxpayer is subject to the taxes imposed by section 11 (b) and (c); the method of accounting used in reporting income received from its reciprocal and the deductions allocable thereto; and that its return is filed on the calendar year basis. Consent, once given, shall be irrevocable for the period during which the election provided for the reciprocal by section 826(a) is in effect. See paragraph (e) of § 1.826-1.
(b)
Information required of consenting attorney-in-fact.
Every attorney-in-fact making the consent provided by section 826(c)(2) and paragraph (a) of this section shall, in the manner prescribed by paragraph (c) of this section, furnish the following information for each taxable year during which the consent provided by section 826(c)(2) and paragraph (a) of this section is in effect:
(1) The name and address of the reciprocal with respect to which the consent required by section 826(c)(2) and paragraph (a) of this section is to apply;
(2) Gross income in total and by sources, adjusted for returns and allowances;
(3) Deductions (itemized to the same extent as on taxpayer's income tax return and accompanying schedules) allocable to each source of gross income and in total (see § 1.826-4);
(4) Method of allocation used in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph;
(5) Taxable income (if any) in total and by sources, as in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph (income by sources from subparagraph (2) of this paragraph minus expenses allocable thereto under subparagraph (3) of this paragraph);
(6) Total income tax liability (if any) for the taxable year;
(7) Taxes paid attributable (under § 1.826-5) to income earned by the taxpayer in dealing with the reciprocal;
(8) Such other information as may be required by the district director.
(c)
Manner in which information is to be provided.
(1) The information required by paragraph (b) of this section shall be set forth in a statement attached to the taxpayer's income tax return for each taxable year for which the consent provided by section 826(c)(2) and paragraph (a) of this section is in effect. Such statement shall include the name and address of the taxpayer, and shall be filed not later than the date prescribed by law (including extensions thereof) for filing the income tax return for each taxable year for which such information is required.
(2) A copy of the statement containing the information required by paragraph (b) of this section shall be submitted to the board of advisors (or other comparable body) of the reciprocal on whose behalf the consent provided under section 826(c)(2) is given. The copy shall be executed in the same
manner as the original and shall be delivered to such board not later than 10 days before the last date prescribed by law (including extensions thereof) for filing the reciprocal's income tax return for the taxable year for which the information is required unless the attorney-in-fact establishes to the satisfaction of the district director that the failure to furnish such copy or the failure to furnish such copy within the prescribed 10 day period was due to circumstances beyond its control. In addition, there shall be attached to and made a part of such copy, a copy of the income tax return of the attorney-in-fact (including accompanying schedules) for each taxable year for which such statement is required.
[T.D. 6681, 28 FR 11125, Oct. 17, 1963]
§ 1.826-4
Allocation of expenses.
An attorney-in-fact allocating expenses as required by section 826(b) and paragraph (b) of § 1.826-3 shall allocate each expense itemized in its income tax return (and accompanying schedules) for the taxable year to each source of gross income (as set forth pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of § 1.826-3). However, no portion of the net operating loss deduction allowed by section 172 shall be allocated to income received or due from the reciprocal, and no expenses, other than those directly related thereto, shall be allocated to capital gains. Where the method of allocation used by the taxpayer does not reasonably reflect the expenses of the taxpayer allocable to income received or due from the reciprocal, the district director may require the taxpayer to use such other method of allocation as is reasonable under the circumstances.
[T.D. 6681, 28 FR 11126, Oct. 17, 1963]
§ 1.826-5
Attribution of tax.
(a)
In general.
Section 826(e) provides that a reciprocal making the election allowed by section 826(a) shall be credited with so much of the tax paid by the attorney-in-fact as is attributable to the income received by the attorney-in-fact from the reciprocal in such taxable year.
(b)
Computation.
For purposes of section 826(e) and paragraph (a) of this section, the amount of tax attributable to income received by the attorney-in-fact from the reciprocal in the taxable year shall be computed in the following manner:
(1) First, compute the taxable income (if any) from each source of gross income set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of § 1.826-3 by deducting from each such amount the expenses allocable thereto under § 1.826-4;
(2) Second, compute the normal tax on each amount of taxable income computed in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph at the rate provided by section 11(b) of the Code;
(3) Third, deduct from each amount determined in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph an amount which bears the same proportion to the surtax exemption provided by section 11(c) of the Code as each amount computed under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph bears to the total of the amounts computed under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph;
(4) Fourth, compute the surtax on each remainder computed in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph at the rate provided by section 11(c) of the Code;
(5) Fifth, add the normal tax computed under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph to the surtax computed under subparagraph (4) of this paragraph for each amount computed under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph;
(6) Sixth, deduct from each amount of tax computed under subparagraph (5) of this paragraph any tax credits (other than those arising from payments made with respect to the tax liability for the taxable year or other taxable years) allocable (in the same manner as provided for expenses under § 1.826-4) to such amount;
(7) Seventh, compute that amount which bears the same proportion to the tax actually paid with respect to the taxable year as each individual amount computed under subparagraph (6) of this paragraph bears to the total of the amounts computed under subparagraph (6) of this paragraph. The amount so determined with respect to each amount computed under subparagraph (6) of this paragraph is the tax paid which is attributable to the amount computed under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph.
To the extent the amounts determined under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph are attributable to amounts received from the reciprocal for the taxable year, the tax attributable to such amounts (as determined under subparagraph (7) of this paragraph) shall be the amount of tax attributable to income received by the attorney-in-fact from the reciprocal during the taxable year.
(c)
Taxes of attorney-in-fact unaffected.
Nothing in section 826 or the regulations thereunder shall increase or decrease the taxes imposed on the income of the attorney-in-fact.
[T.D. 6681, 28 FR 11126, Oct. 17, 1963]
§ 1.826-6
Credit or refund.
(a)
Notification required.
In any case where a taxpayer applies for a credit or refund of taxes paid by it in respect of a taxable year for which the taxpayer was the consenting attorney-in-fact of a reciprocal making the election provided by section 826(a), such taxpayer shall give notice to its reciprocal for such taxable year, first, upon applying for the credit or refund; and again, within 10 days from the date on which a final determination is made that such credit or refund has been allowed or denied.
(b)
Notice form.
The notices required by this section shall include the name and address of the taxpayer and shall be signed by the taxpayer or its duly authorized representative. In addition, there shall be attached to and made a part of each first notice a concise statement of the claim upon which the application for refund or credit is based; and there shall be attached to and made a part of each second notice:
(1) A copy of the notification (if any) received by the taxpayer indicating that the credit or refund has been allowed; and
(2) A statement setting forth the amount of such credit or refund attributable to taxes paid by the taxpayer on income received from the reciprocal, and the computation by which such amount was determined.
(c)
Manner of apportioning refund or credit.
The taxpayer shall determine the amount of the refund or credit attributable to taxes paid on income received from its reciprocal by reallocating its income and expense items for the taxable year, with respect to which the refund or credit is allowed, in the manner provided by §§ 1.826-3 and 1.826-4 so as to reflect the adjustments (if any) in such items which resulted in the credit or refund of tax for the taxable year. The taxpayer shall then recompute the tax attributable to income received from its reciprocal for such taxable year in the manner provided by § 1.826-5. The district director may require such additional information as may be necessary in the circumstances to verify the computations required by this paragraph.

§ 1.826-7
Examples.
The application of section 826 may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
For the taxable year 1963, R, a reciprocal underwriter subject to the taxes imposed by section 821(a), has the following items (determined before applying any election under section 826):
Gross income under sec. 832
$578
Gross investment income
50
Deductions under sec. 832 (as modified by sec. 823(b)):
Deduction for amounts paid by R to attorney-in-fact A
$100
All other deductions
500
Total deductions under sec. 832
600
Deductions under sec. 822(c)
40
Incurred losses
400
Protection against loss deduction
4
Underwriting gain
0
Mutual insurance company taxable income
0
Unused loss
22
Credit or refund for taxes paid
0
Assume that the deductions of attorney-in-fact A allocable to the income received by A from R are 60 and the tax paid by A allocable to the income received from R is 16. If R elects to be subject to the limitation provided in section 826(b), the results for 1963 would be as follows:
Gross income under sec. 832
$578
Gross investment income
50
Deductions under sec. 832 (as modified by sec. 823(b)):
Deduction for amounts paid by R to attorney-in-fact A
$60
All other deductions
500
Total deduction under sec. 832
560
Deductions under sec. 822(c)
40
Incurred losses
400
Underwriting gain
8
Protection against loss deduction
6
Mutual insurance company taxable income
12
Unused loss
0
Credit or refund for taxes paid
16
Under the provisions of section 826(b), R's deduction for amounts paid or incurred to the attorney-in-fact in the taxable year 1963 would be limited to the deductions of A allocable to the income received by A from R. Thus, R's deductions under section 832 (as modified by section 823(b)) for 1963 would be 60 (the deductions of A which are allocable to the income received by A from R). As a result of making the election under section 826(a) for the taxable year 1963, R's underwriting gain would be 8, and its statutory underwriting income would be 2 (the underwriting gain of 8 minus the protection against loss deduction of 6—of which 4 represents the amount determined under section 824(a)(1)(A)—and 2 represents the amount determined under section 824(a)(1)(B)—or 8 minus 6). R's mutual insurance company taxable income for 1963 would be 12, consisting of taxable investment income of 10 (gross investment income minus deductions under section 822(c), or 50 minus 40) plus statutory underwriting income of 2. Since all of R's mutual insurance company taxable income of 12 is attributable to the limitation under section 826(b), the entire amount is subject to the surtax under section 821(a)(2) without regard to the $25,000 surtax exemption. The credit of 16, representing that part of the tax paid by A which is allocable to the income received by A from R, may be applied by R against its taxes with respect to its mutual insurance company taxable income of 12 for 1963, and R would be entitled to a refund of any excess of the amount of such credit over its tax liability for 1963.
Under the provisions of section 826(d), no portion of the amount added to the protection against loss account in 1963 by reason of the election under section 826(a), 2 (25 percent of the amount by which the consolidated underwriting gain exceeds 25 percent of the underwriting gain determined without regard to the election under section 826(a), or the amount by which 25 percent of 8 exceeds 25 percent of 0), may remain in such account beyond the taxable year 1968.

# Example 2.
For the taxable year 1963, F is a corporate attorney-in-fact subject to the taxes imposed by section 11(b) and (c) of the Code. F files its return on the calendar year basis and reports income received from its reciprocal and the deductions allocable thereto under the same method of accounting used by its reciprocal in reporting its deductions for amounts paid to R. F properly consents to provide the information required by paragraph (b) of § 1.826-3. In addition to its attorney-in-fact business, F owns real estate for investment purposes, and operates a real estate management service. For the taxable year 1963, F has gross income from these various sources as follows:
Attorney-in-fact fees
$85,000
Real estate management fees
18,000
Rental income
25,000
F allocates its expenses for the taxable year on the basis of their direct relation to each source of income. During 1963, F acquired property for use in its attorney-in-fact operations which entitled F to an investment credit of $800 under section 38. For 1963, F determines that the tax paid by it which is attributable to its reciprocal is $21,863, computed as follows:

Under paragraph (b)(1) of § 1.826-5, F computes its taxable income from its attorney-in-fact fees to be $60,000 ($85,000 minus $25,000), and its taxable income from its real estate management to be $15,000 ($18,000 minus $3,000). Since F's rental operations resulted in a $10,000 loss for the taxable year ($25,000 minus $35,000), F's taxable income from its rental operations is zero. Using the 30 percent rate provided by section 11(b), F computes its normal tax to be $18,000 on its attorney-in-fact fees and $4,500 on its real estate management operations. F's normal tax on total income is $19,500. The $3,000 difference between the normal tax on F's total income and the normal taxes on F's profitable operations results from the loss on F's rental operations. Under paragraph (b)(3) of § 1.826-5, F allocates its surtax exemption as follows: $20,000 $60,000/$75,000 × $25,000) to its attorney-in-fact fees; and $5,000 $15,000/$75,000 × $25,000) to its real estate management operations. F computes its surtax on its profitable operations at the 22 percent rate provided by section 11(c) as follows: $8,800 (22 percent of $40,000) on attorney-in-fact fees; and $2,200 (22 percent of $10,000) on real estate management income. F adds its normal tax and surtax on its profitable operations and determines its total tax to be $26,800 on
its attorney-in-fact operations; $6,700 on its real estate management operations; and $28,300 on its total income. F must allocate its investment credit on the same basis as it used to allocate its expenses. Thus, F's entire investment credit must be allocated to its attorney-in-fact operations. Accordingly, F's 1963 tax liability is $26,000 on its attorney-in-fact fees; $6,700 on its real estate management operations; $0 on its rental operations; and $27,500 on its total income. Under paragraph (b)(7) of § 1.826-5, F allocates $21,863 ($26,000/$32,700 × $27,500) of its 1963 tax paid to its attorney-in-fact fees; and $5,637 ($6,700/$32,700 × $27,500) of its 1963 tax paid to its real estate management business. F's reciprocal will be allowed a credit or refund of $21,863 for taxes paid by F which are attributable to F's income received from its reciprocal.

# Example 3.
Assume the same facts as in example 2, and assume further that in 1966 F sustains a net operating loss on its overall operations of $5,000. In carrying the loss back to 1963 as a net operating loss deduction under section 172, F must allocate the deduction under the same method it used in allocating its 1963 deductions. Thus, if the loss was entirely attributable to F's rental operations for the taxable year 1966, F would reduce its taxable income attributable to those operations by the entire amount of the loss and would recompute the tax attributable to those operations under paragraph (b) of § 1.826-5. As recomputed in the table below, F's 1963 tax liability from attorney-in-fact fees would be $19,800 and F's total tax liability would be $24,900.

As a result of its 1966 net operating loss, F would be entitled to a refund of $2,600 (1963 taxes paid of $27,500 minus recomputed 1963 taxes of $24,900). Under paragraph (a) of § 1.826-6, F would be required to notify its reciprocal of its claim for refund and of the amount of the refund or credit attributable to taxes paid on income received from the reciprocal. Since the 1963 tax paid by F attributable to its reciprocal (as recomputed) is less than the amount claimed in 1963 by F's reciprocal as a credit, F's reciprocal would be required, under section 826(g), to add the difference—$2,063 ($21,863 minus $19,800), to its tax liability for 1966. Thus, F's reciprocal would first compute its tax liability for 1966 without regard to section 826(g) and then would increase such liability by $2,063.

# Other Insurance Companies
§ 1.831-1
Tax on insurance companies (other than life or mutual), mutual marine insurance companies, and mutual fire insurance companies issuing perpetual policies.
(a) All insurance companies, other than life or mutual or foreign insurance companies not carrying on an insurance business within the United States, and all mutual marine insurance companies and mutual fire insurance companies exclusively issuing either perpetual policies, or policies for which the sole premium charged is a single deposit which, except for such deduction of underwriting costs as may be provided, is refundable upon cancellation or expiration of the policy, are subject to the tax imposed by section 831. As used in this section and §§ 1.832-1 and 1.832-2, the term “insurance companies” means only those companies which qualify as insurance companies under the definition provided by paragraph (b) of § 1.801-1 and which are subject to the tax imposed by section 831.
(b) All provisions of the Code and of the regulations in this part not inconsistent with the specific provisions of section 831 are applicable to the assessment and collection of the tax imposed by section 831(a), and insurance companies are subject to the same penalties
as are provided in the case of returns and payment of income tax by other corporations.
(c) Since section 832 provides that the underwriting and investment exhibit of the annual statement approved by the National Convention of Insurance Commissioners shall be the basis for computing gross income and since the annual statement is rendered on the calendar year basis, the returns under section 831 shall be made on the basis of the calendar year and shall be on Form 1120. Insurance companies are entitled, in computing insurance company taxable income, to the deductions provided in part VIII (section 241 and following), subchapter B, chapter 1 of the Code.
(d) Foreign insurance companies not carrying on an insurance business within the United States are not taxable under section 831 but are taxable as other foreign corporations. See section 881.
(e) Insurance companies are subject to both normal tax and surtax. The normal tax shall be computed as provided in section 11(b) and the surtax shall be computed as provided in section 11(c). For the circumstances under which the $25,000 exemption from surtax for certain taxable years may be disallowed in whole or in part, see section 1551. For alternative tax where the net long-term capital gain for any taxable year exceeds the net short-term capital loss, see section 1201(a) and the regulations thereunder.
§ 1.831-2
Taxable years affected.
Section 1.831-1 is applicable only to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1953, but before January 1, 1963, and ending after August 16, 1954, and all references therein to sections of the Code and regulations are to sections of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 and the regulations thereunder before amendments. Section 1.831-3 is applicable only to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1962, and all references therein to sections of the Code and regulations are to sections of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 as amended.
[T.D. 6681, 28 FR 11128, Oct. 17, 1963, as amended by T.D. 9849, 84 FR 9236, Mar. 14, 2019]
§ 1.831-3
Tax on insurance companies (other than life or mutual), mutual marine insurance companies, mutual fire insurance companies issuing perpetual policies, and mutual fire or flood insurance companies operating on the basis of premium deposits; taxable years beginning after December 31, 1962.
(a) All insurance companies, other than life or mutual or foreign insurance companies not carrying on an insurance business within the United States, and all mutual marine insurance companies and mutual fire or flood insurance companies exclusively issuing perpetual policies or whose principal business is the issuance of policies for which the premium deposits are the same regardless of the length of the term for which the policies are written, are subject to the tax imposed by section 831 if the unabsorbed portion of such premium deposits not required for losses, expenses or reserves is returned or credited to the policyholder on cancellation or expiration of the policy. For purposes of section 831 and this section, in the case of a mutual flood insurance company, the premium deposits will be considered to be the same if the payment of a premium increases the total insurance under the policy in an amount equal to the amount of such premium and the omission of any annual premium does not result in the reduction or suspension of coverage under the policy. As used in this section and section 832 and the regulations thereunder, the term “insurance companies” means only those companies which qualify as insurance companies under the definition provided by paragraph (b) of § 1.801-1 and which are subject to the tax imposed by section 831.
(b) All provisions of the Code and of the regulations in this part not inconsistent with the specific provisions of section 831 are applicable to the assessment and collection of the tax imposed by section 831(a), and insurance companies are subject to the same penalties as are provided in the case of returns and payment of income tax by other corporations.
(c) Since section 832 provides that the underwriting and investment exhibit of the annual statement approved by the
National Convention of Insurance Commissioners shall be the basis for computing gross income and since the annual statement is rendered on the calendar year basis, the returns under section 831 shall be made on the basis of the calendar year and shall be on Form 1120. Insurance companies are entitled, in computing insurance company taxable income, to the deductions provided in part VIII (section 241 and following), subchapter B, chapter 1 of the Code.
(d) Foreign insurance companies not carrying on an insurance business within the United States are not taxable under section 831 but are taxable as other foreign corporations. See section 881.
(e) Insurance companies are subject to both normal tax and surtax. The normal tax shall be computed as provided in section 11(b) and the surtax shall be computed as provided in section 11(c). For the circumstances under which the $25,000 exemption from surtax for certain taxable years may be disallowed in whole or in part, see section 1551. For alternative tax where the net long-term capital gain for any taxable year exceeds the net short-term capital loss, see section 1201(a) and the regulations thereunder.
[T.D. 6681, 28 FR 11128, Oct. 17, 1963]
§ 1.832-1
Gross income.
(a) Gross income as defined in section 832(b)(1) means the gross amount of income earned during the taxable year from interest, dividends, rents, and premium income, computed on the basis of the underwriting and investment exhibit of the annual statement approved by the National Convention of Insurance Commissioners, as well as the gain derived from the sale or other disposition of property, and all other items constituting gross income under section 61, except that in the case of a mutual fire insurance company described in § 1.831-1 the amount of single deposit premiums received, but not assessments, shall be excluded from gross income. Gross income does not include increase in liabilities during the year on account of reinsurance treaties, remittances from the home office of a foreign insurance company to the United States branch, borrowed money, or gross increase due to adjustments in book value of capital assets. The underwriting and investment exhibit is presumed to reflect the true net income of the company, and insofar as it is not inconsistent with the provisions of the Code will be recognized and used as a basis for that purpose. All items of the exhibit, however, do not reflect an insurance company's income as defined in the Code. By reason of the definition of investment income, miscellaneous items which are intended to reflect surplus but do not properly enter into the computation of income, such as dividends declared to shareholders in their capacity as such, home office remittances and receipts, and special deposits, are ignored. Gain or loss from agency balances and bills receivable not admitted as assets on the underwriting and investment exhibit will be ignored, excepting only such agency balances and bills receivable as have been allowed as deductions for worthless debts or, having been previously so allowed, are recovered during the taxable year. In computing “premiums earned on insurance contracts during the taxable year” the amount of the unearned premiums shall include (1) life insurance reserves as defined in section 803(b) and § 1.803-1 pertaining to the life, burial, or funeral insurance, or annuity business of an insurance company subject to the tax imposed by section 831 and not qualifying as a life insurance company under section 801, and (2) liability for return premiums under a rate credit or retrospective rating plan based on experience, such as the “War Department Insurance Rating Plan,” and which return premiums are therefore not earned premiums. In computing “losses incurred” the determination of unpaid losses at the close of each year must represent actual unpaid losses as nearly as it is possible to ascertain them.
(b) Every insurance company to which this section applies must be prepared to establish to the satisfaction of the district director that the part of the deduction for “losses incurred” which represents unpaid losses at the close of the taxable year comprises only actual unpaid losses stated in amounts which, based upon the facts in
each case and the company's experience with similar cases, can be said to represent a fair and reasonable estimate of the amount the company will be required to pay. Amounts included in, or added to, the estimates of such losses which, in the opinion of the district director are in excess of the actual liability determined as provided in the preceding sentence will be disallowed as a deduction. The district director may require any such insurance company to submit such detailed information with respect to its actual experience as is deemed necessary to establish the reasonableness of the deduction for “losses incurred.”
(c) That part of the deduction for “losses incurred” which represents an adjustment to losses paid for salvage and reinsurance recoverable shall, except as hereinafter provided, include all salvage in course of liquidation, and all reinsurance in process of collection not otherwise taken into account as a reduction of losses paid, outstanding at the end of the taxable year. Salvage in course of liquidation includes all property (other than cash), real or personal, tangible or intangible, except that which may not be included by reason of express statutory provisions (or rules and regulations of an insurance department) of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia in which the company transacts business. Such salvage in course of liquidation shall be taken into account to the extent of the value thereof at the end of the taxable year as determined from a fair and reasonable estimate based upon either the facts in each case or the company's experience with similar cases. Cash received during the taxable year with respect to items of salvage or reinsurance shall be taken into account in computing losses paid during such taxable year.
§ 1.832-2
Deductions.
(a) The deductions allowable are specified in section 832(c) and by reason of the provisions of section 832(c)(10) and (12) include in addition certain deductions provided in sections 161, and 241 and following. The deductions, however, are subject to the limitation provided in section 265, relating to expenses and interest in respect of tax-exempt income. The net operating loss deduction is computed under section 172 and the regulations thereunder. For the purposes of section 172, relating to net operating loss deduction, “gross income” shall mean gross income as defined in section 832(b)(1) and the allowable deductions shall be those allowed by section 832(c) with the exceptions and limitations set forth in section 172(d). In addition to the deduction for capital losses provided in subchapter P (section 1201 and following), chapter 1 of the Code, insurance companies are allowed a deduction for losses from capital assets sold or exchanged in order to obtain funds to meet abnormal insurance losses and to provide for the payment of dividends and similar distributions to policyholders. A special rule is provided for the application of the capital loss carryover provisions of section 1212. The deduction is the same as that allowed mutual insurance companies subject to the tax imposed by section 821; see section 822(c)(6) and the regulations thereunder. Insurance companies, other than mutual fire insurance companies described in § 1.831-1, are also allowed a deduction for dividends and similar distributions paid or declared to policyholders in their capacity as such. The deduction is otherwise the same as that allowed mutual insurance companies subject to the tax imposed by section 821; see section 823(2) and the regulations thereunder.
(b) Among the items which may not be deducted are income and profits taxes imposed by the United States, income and profits taxes imposed by any foreign country or possession of the United States (in cases where the company chooses to claim to any extent a credit for such taxes), taxes assessed against local benefits, decrease during the year due to adjustments in the book value of capital assets, decrease in liabilities during the year on account of reinsurance treaties, dividends paid to shareholders in their capacity as such, remittances to the home office of a foreign insurance company by the United States branch, and borrowed money repaid.
(c) In computing taxable income of insurance companies, losses sustained during the taxable year from the sale
or other disposition of property are deductible subject to the limitation contained in section 1211. Insurance companies are entitled to the alternative taxes provided in section 1201.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11814, Nov. 26, 1960, as amended by T.D. 6867, 30 FR 15094, Dec. 12, 1965]
§ 1.832-3
Taxable years affected.
Sections 1.832-1 and 1.832-2 are applicable only to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1953, and before January 1, 1963, and ending after August 16, 1954, and all references therein to sections of the Code and regulations are to sections of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 and the regulations thereunder before amendments. Sections 1.832-4, 1.832-5, and 1.832-6 are applicable only to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1962, and all references therein to sections of the Code and regulations are to sections of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 as amended.
[T.D. 6681, 28 FR 11129, Oct. 17, 1963]
§ 1.832-4
Gross income.
(a)(1) Gross income as defined in section 832(b)(1) means the gross amount of income earned during the taxable year from interest, dividends, rents, and premium income, computed on the basis of the underwriting and investment exhibit of the annual statement approved by the National Convention of Insurance Commissioners, as well as the gain derived from the sale or other disposition of property, and all other items constituting gross income under section 61, except that in the case of a mutual fire insurance company described in section 831(a)(3)(A) the amount of single deposit premiums received, but not assessments, shall be excluded from gross income. Section 832(b)(1)(D) provides that in the case of a mutual fire or flood insurance company described in section 831(a)(3)(B), there shall be included in gross income an amount equal to 2 percent of the premiums earned during the taxable year on contracts described in section 831(a)(3)(B) after deduction of premium deposits returned or credited during such taxable year with respect to such contracts. Gross income does not include increase in liabilities during the year on account of reinsurance treaties, remittances from the home office of a foreign insurance company to the United States branch, borrowed money, or gross increase due to adjustments in book value of capital assets.
(2) The underwriting and investment exhibit is presumed to reflect the true net income of the company, and insofar as it is not inconsistent with the provisions of the Code will be recognized and used as a basis for that purpose. All items of the exhibit, however, do not reflect an insurance company's income as defined in the Code. By reason of the definition of investment income, miscellaneous items which are intended to reflect surplus but do not properly enter into the computation of income, such as dividends declared to shareholders in their capacity as such, home office remittances and receipts, and special deposits, are ignored. Gain or loss from agency balances and bills receivable not admitted as assets on the underwriting and investment exhibit will be ignored, excepting only such agency balances and bills receivable as have been allowed as deductions for worthless debts or, having been previously so allowed, are recovered during the taxable year.
(3)
Premiums earned.
The determination of premiums earned on insurance contracts during the taxable year begins with the insurance company's gross premiums written on insurance contracts during the taxable year, reduced by return premiums and premiums paid for reinsurance. Subject to the exceptions in sections 832(b)(7), 832(b)(8), and 833(a)(3), this amount is increased by 80 percent of the unearned premiums on insurance contracts at the end of the preceding taxable year, and is decreased by 80 percent of the unearned premiums on insurance contracts at the end of the current taxable year.
(4)
Gross premiums written
—(i)
In general.
Gross premiums written are amounts payable for insurance coverage. The label placed on a payment in a contract does not determine whether an amount is a gross premium written. Gross premiums written do
not include other items of income described in section 832(b)(1)(C) (for example, charges for providing loss adjustment or claims processing services under administrative services or cost-plus arrangements). Gross premiums written on an insurance contract include all amounts payable for the effective period of the insurance contract. To the extent that amounts paid or payable with respect to an arrangement are not gross premiums written, the insurance company may not treat amounts payable to customers under the applicable portion of such arrangements as losses incurred described in section 832(b)(5).
(ii)
Items included.
Gross premiums written include—
(A) Any additional premiums resulting from increases in risk exposure during the effective period of an insurance contract;
(B) Amounts subtracted from a premium stabilization reserve to pay for insurance coverage; and
(C) Consideration in respect of assuming insurance liabilities under insurance contracts not issued by the taxpayer (such as a payment or transfer of property in an assumption reinsurance transaction).
(5)
Method of reporting gross premiums written
—(i)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided under this paragraph (a)(5), an insurance company reports gross premiums written for the earlier of the taxable year that includes the effective date of the insurance contract or the year in which the company receives all or a portion of the gross premium for the insurance contract. The effective date of the insurance contract is the date on which the insurance coverage provided by the contract commences. The effective period of an insurance contract is the period over which one or more rates for insurance coverage are guaranteed in the contract. If a new rate for insurance coverage is guaranteed after the effective date of an insurance contract, the making of such a guarantee generally is treated as the issuance of a new insurance contract with an effective period equal to the duration of the new guaranteed rate for insurance coverage.
(ii)
Special rule for additional premiums resulting from an increase in risk exposure.
An insurance company reports additional premiums that result from an increase in risk exposure during the effective period of an insurance contract in gross premiums written for the taxable year in which the change in risk exposure occurs. Unless the increase in risk exposure is of temporary duration (for example, an increase in risk exposure under a workers' compensation policy due to seasonal variations in the policyholder's payroll), the company reports additional premiums resulting from an increase in risk exposure based on the remainder of the effective period of the insurance contract.
(iii)
Exception for certain advance premiums.
If an insurance company receives a portion of the gross premium for an insurance contract prior to the first day of the taxable year that includes the effective date of the contract, the company may report the advance premium (rather than the full amount of the gross premium for the contract) in gross premiums written for the taxable year in which the advance premium is received. An insurance company may adopt this method of reporting advance premiums only if the company's deduction for premium acquisition expenses for the taxable year in which the company receives the advance premium does not exceed the limitation of paragraph (a)(5)(vii) of this section. A company that reports an advance premium in gross premiums written under this paragraph (a)(5)(iii) takes into account the remainder of the gross premium written and premium acquisition expenses for the contract in the taxable year that includes the effective date of the contract. A company that adopts this method of reporting advance premiums must use the method for all contracts with advance premiums.
(iv)
Exception for certain cancellable accident and health insurance contracts with installment premiums.
If an insurance company issues or proportionally reinsures a cancellable accident and health insurance contract (other than a contract with an effective period that exceeds 12 months) for which the gross premium is payable in installments
over the effective period of the contract, the company may report the installment premiums (rather than the total gross premium for the contract) in gross premiums written for the earlier of the taxable year in which the installment premiums are due under the terms of the contract or the year in which the installment premiums are received. An insurance company may adopt this method of reporting installment premiums for a cancellable accident and health insurance contract only if the company's deduction for premium acquisition expenses for the first taxable year in which an installment premium is due or received under the contract does not exceed the limitation of paragraph (a)(5)(vii) of this section. A company that adopts this method of reporting installment premiums for a cancellable accident and health contract must use the method for all of its cancellable accident and health insurance contracts with installment premiums.
(v)
Exception for certain multi-year insurance contracts.
If an insurance company issues or proportionally reinsures an insurance contract, other than a contract described in paragraph (a)(5)(vi) of this section, with an effective period that exceeds 12 months, for which the gross premium is payable in installments over the effective period of the contract, the company may treat the insurance coverage provided under the multi-year contract as a series of separate insurance contracts. The first contract in the series is treated as having been written for an effective period of twelve months. Each subsequent contract in the series is treated as having been written for an effective period equal to the lesser of 12 months or the remainder of the period for which the rates for insurance coverage are guaranteed in the multi-year insurance contract. An insurance company may adopt this method of reporting premiums on a multi-year contract only if the company's deduction for premium acquisition expenses for each year of the multi-year contract does not exceed the limitation of paragraph (a)(5)(vii) of this section. A company that adopts this method of reporting premiums for a multi-year contract must use the method for all multi-year contracts with installment premiums.
(vi)
Exception for insurance contracts described in section 832(b)(7).
If an insurance company issues or reinsures the risks related to a contract described in section 832(b)(7), the company may report gross premiums written for the contract in the manner required by sections 803 and 811(a) for life insurance companies. An insurance company may adopt this method of reporting premiums on contracts described in section 832(b)(7) only if the company also determines the deduction for premium acquisition costs for the contract in accordance with section 811(a), as adjusted by the amount required to be taken into account under section 848 in connection with the net premiums of the contract. A company that adopts this method of reporting premiums for a contract described in section 832(b)(7) must use the method for all of its contracts described in that section.
(vii)
Limitation on deduction of premium acquisition expenses.
An insurance company's deduction for premium acquisition expenses (for example, commissions, state premium taxes, overhead reimbursements to agents or brokers, and other similar amounts) related to an insurance contract is within the limitation of this paragraph (a)(5)(vii) if—
(A) The ratio obtained by dividing the sum of the company's deduction for premium acquisition expenses related to the insurance contract for the taxable year and previous taxable years by the total premium acquisition expenses attributable to the insurance contract; does not exceed
(B) The ratio obtained by dividing the sum of the amounts included in gross premiums written with regard to the insurance contract for the taxable year and previous taxable years by the total gross premium written for the insurance contract.
(viii)
Change in method of reporting gross premiums.
An insurance company that adopts a method of accounting for gross premiums written and premium acquisition expenses described in paragraph (a)(5)(iii), (iv), (v), or (vi) of this section must continue to use the method to report gross premiums written
and premium acquisition expenses unless the company obtains the consent of the Commissioner to change to a different method under section 446(e) and § 1.446-1(e).
(6)
Return premiums
—(i)
In general.
An insurance company's liability for return premiums includes amounts previously included in an insurance company's gross premiums written, which are refundable to a policyholder or ceding company, provided that the amounts are fixed by the insurance contract and do not depend on the experience of the insurance company or the discretion of its management.
(ii)
Items included.
Return premiums include amounts—
(A) Which were previously paid and become refundable due to policy cancellations or decreases in risk exposure during the effective period of an insurance contract;
(B) Which reflect the unearned portion of unpaid premiums for an insurance contract that is canceled or for which there is a decrease in risk exposure during its effective period; or
(C) Which are either previously paid and refundable or which reflect the unearned portion of unpaid premiums for an insurance contract, arising from the redetermination of a premium due to correction of posting or other similar errors.
(7)
Method of reporting return premiums.
An insurance company reports the liability for a return premium resulting from the cancellation of an insurance contract for the taxable year in which the contract is canceled. An insurance company reports the liability for a return premium attributable to a reduction in risk exposure under an insurance contract for the taxable year in which the reduction in risk exposure occurs.
(8)
Unearned premiums
—(i)
In general.
The unearned premium for a contract, other than a contract described in section 816(b)(1)(B), generally is the portion of the gross premium written that is attributable to future insurance coverage during the effective period of the insurance contract. However, unearned premiums held by an insurance company with regard to the net value of risks reinsured with other solvent companies (whether or not authorized to conduct business under state law) are subtracted from the company's unearned premiums. Unearned premiums also do not include any additional liability established by the insurance company on its annual statement to cover premium deficiencies. Unearned premiums do not include an insurance company's estimate of its liability for amounts to be paid or credited to a customer with regard to the expired portion of a retrospectively rated contract (retro credits). An insurance company's estimate of additional amounts payable by its customers with regard to the expired portion of a retrospectively rated contract (retro debits) cannot be subtracted from unearned premiums.
(ii)
Special rules for unearned premiums.
For purposes of computing “premiums earned on insurance contracts during the taxable year” under section 832(b)(4), the amount of unearned premiums includes—
(A) Life insurance reserves (as defined in section 816(b), but computed in accordance with section 807(d) and sections 811(c) and (d));
(B) In the case of a mutual flood or fire insurance company described in section 832(b)(1)(D) (with respect to contracts described in that section), the amount of unabsorbed premium deposits that the company would be obligated to return to its policyholders at the close of the taxable year if all its insurance contracts were terminated at that time;
(C) In the case of an interinsurer or reciprocal underwriter that reports unearned premiums on its annual statement net of premium acquisition expenses, the unearned premiums on the company's annual statement increased by the portion of premium acquisition expenses allocable to those unearned premiums; and
(D) In the case of a title insurance company, its discounted unearned premiums (computed in accordance with section 832(b)(8)).
(9)
Method of determining unearned premiums.
If the risk of loss under an insurance contract does not vary significantly over the effective period of the contract, the unearned premium attributable to the unexpired portion of the effective period of the contract
is determined on a pro rata basis. If the risk of loss varies significantly over the effective period of the contract, the insurance company may consider the pattern and incidence of the risk in determining the portion of the gross premium that is attributable to the unexpired portion of the effective period of the contract. An insurance company that uses a method of computing unearned premiums other than the pro rata method must maintain sufficient information to demonstrate that its method of computing unearned premiums accurately reflects the pattern and incidence of the risk for the insurance contract.
(10)
Examples.
The provisions of paragraphs (a)(4) through (a)(9) of this section are illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
(i) IC is a non-life insurance company which, pursuant to section 843, files its returns on a calendar year basis. IC writes a casualty insurance contract that provides insurance coverage for a one-year period beginning on July 1, 2000 and ending on June 30, 2001. IC charges a $500 premium for the insurance contract, which may be paid either in full by the effective date of the contract or in quarterly installments over the contract's one year term. The policyholder selects the installment payment option. As of December 31, 2000, IC collected $250 of installment premiums for the contract.
(ii) The effective period of the insurance contract begins on July 1, 2000 and ends on June 30, 2001. For the taxable year ending December 31, 2000, IC includes the $500 gross premium, based on the effective period of the contract, in gross premiums written under section 832(b)(4)(A). IC's unearned premium with respect to the contract was $250 as of December 31, 2000. Pursuant to section 832(b)(4)(B), to determine its premiums earned, IC deducts $200 ($250 × .8) for the insurance contract at the end of the taxable year.

# Example 2.
(i) The facts are the same as
Example 1,
except that the insurance contract has a stated term of 5 years. On each contract anniversary date, IC may adjust the rate charged for the insurance coverage for the succeeding 12 month period. The amount of the adjustment in the charge for insurance coverage is not substantially limited under the insurance contract.
(ii) Under paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section, IC is required to report gross premiums written for the insurance contract based on the effective period for the contract. The effective period of the insurance contract is the period for which a rate for insurance coverage is guaranteed in the contract. Although the insurance contract issued by IC has a stated term of 5 years, a rate for insurance coverage is guaranteed only for a period of 12 months beginning with the contract's effective date and each anniversary date thereafter. Thus, for the taxable year ending December 31, 2000, IC includes the $500 gross premium for the 12 month period beginning with the contract's effective date in gross premiums written. IC's unearned premium with respect to the contract was $250 as of December 31, 2000. Pursuant to section 832(b)(4)(B), to determine its premiums earned, IC deducts $200 ($250 × .8) for the insurance contract at the end of the taxable year.

# Example 3.
(i) The facts are the same as
Example 1,
except that coverage under the insurance contract begins on January 1, 2001 and ends on December 31, 2001. On December 15, 2000, IC collects the first $125 premium installment on the insurance contract. For the taxable year ended December 31, 2000, IC deducts $20 of premium acquisition expenses related to the insurance contract. IC's total premium acquisition expenses, based on the insurance contract's $500 gross premium, are $80.
(ii) Under paragraph (a)(5)(iii) of this section, IC may elect to report only the $125 advance premium (rather than the contract's $500 gross premium) in gross premiums written for the taxable year ended December 31, 2000, provided that IC's deduction for the premium acquisition expenses related to the insurance contract does not exceed the limitation in paragraph (a)(5)(vii). IC's deduction for premium acquisition expenses is within this limitation only if the ratio of the insurance contract's premium acquisition expenses deducted for the taxable year and any previous taxable year to the insurance contract's total premium acquisition expenses does not exceed the ratio of the amounts included in gross premiums written for the taxable year and any previous taxable year for the contract to the total gross premium written for the contract.
(iii) For the taxable year ended December 31, 2000, IC deducts $20 of premium acquisition expenses related to the insurance contract. This deduction represents 25% of the total premium acquisition expenses for the insurance contract ($20 / $80 = 25%). This ratio does not exceed the ratio of the $125 advance premium to the insurance contract's $500 gross premium ($125 / $500 = 25%). Therefore, under paragraph (a)(5)(iii) of this section, IC may elect to report only the $125 advance premium (rather than the $500 gross premium) in gross premiums written for the taxable year ending December 31, 2000. IC reports the balance of the gross premium for the insurance contract ($375) and deducts the remaining premium acquisition expenses
($60) for the insurance contract in the taxable year ending December 31, 2001.

# Example 4.
(i) The facts are the same as
Example 3,
except that for the taxable year ending December 31, 2000, IC deducts $60 of premium acquisition expenses related to the insurance contract.
(ii) For the taxable year ended December 31, 2000, IC deducted 75% of total premium acquisition expenses for the insurance contract ($60 / $80 = 75%). This ratio exceeds the ratio of the $125 advance premium to the $500 gross premium ($125 / $500 = 25%). Because IC's deduction for premium acquisition expenses allocable to the contract exceeds the limitation in paragraph (a)(5)(vii) of this section, paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section requires IC to report the $500 gross premium in gross premiums written for the taxable year ending December 31, 2000. IC's unearned premium with respect to the contract was $500 as of December 31, 2000. Pursuant to section 832(b)(4)(B), to determine its premiums earned, IC deducts $400 ($500 × .8) for the insurance contract at the end of the taxable year.

# Example 5.
(i) IC is a non-life insurance company which, pursuant to section 843, files its returns on a calendar year basis. On August 1, 2000, IC issues a one-year cancellable accident and health insurance policy to X, a corporation with 80 covered employees. The gross premium written for the insurance contract is $320,000. Premiums are payable in monthly installments. As of December 31, 2000, IC has collected $150,000 of installment premiums from X. For the taxable year ended December 31, 2000, IC has paid or incurred $21,000 of premium acquisition expenses related to the insurance contract. IC's total premium acquisition expenses for the insurance contract, based on the $320,000 gross premium, are $48,000.
(ii) Under paragraph (a)(5)(iv) of this section, IC may elect to report only the $150,000 of installment premiums (rather than the $320,000 estimated gross premium) in gross premiums written for the taxable year ended December 31, 2000, provided that its deduction for premium acquisition expenses allocable to the insurance contract does not exceed the limitation in paragraph (a)(5)(vii). For the taxable year ended December 31, 2000, IC deducts $21,000 of premium acquisition expenses related to the insurance contract, or 43.75% of total premium acquisition expenses for the insurance contract ($21,000 / $48,000 = 43.75%). This ratio does not exceed the ratio of installment premiums to the gross premium for the contract ($150,000 / $320,000 = 46.9%). Therefore, under paragraph (a)(5)(iv) of this section, IC may elect to report only $150,000 of installment premiums for the insurance contract (rather than $320,000 of gross premium) in gross premiums written for the taxable year ending December 31, 2000.

# Example 6.
(i) IC is a non-life insurance company which, pursuant to section 843, files its returns on a calendar year basis. On July 1, 2000, IC issues a one-year workers' compensation policy to X, an employer. The gross premium for the policy is determined by applying a monthly rate of $25 to each of X's employees. This rate is guaranteed for a period of 12 months, beginning with the effective date of the contract. On July 1, 2000, X has 1,050 employees. Based on the assumption that X's payroll would remain constant during the effective period of the contract, IC determines an estimated gross premium for the contract of $315,000 (1,050 × $25 × 12 = $315,000). The estimated gross premium is payable by X in equal monthly installments. At the end of each calendar quarter, the premiums payable under the contract are adjusted based on an audit of X's actual payroll during the preceding three months of coverage.
(ii) Due to an expansion of X's business in 2000, the actual number of employees covered under the contract during each month of the period between July 1, 2000 and December 31, 2000 is 1,050 (July), 1,050 (August), 1,050 (September), 1,200 (October), 1,200 (November), and 1,200 (December). The increase in the number of employees during the year is not attributable to a temporary or seasonal variation in X's business activities and is expected to continue for the remainder of the effective period of the contract.
(iii) Under paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section, IC is required to report gross premiums written for the insurance contract based on the effective period of the contract. The effective period of X's contract is based on the 12 month period for which IC has guaranteed rates for insurance coverage. Under paragraph (a)(5)(ii), IC must also report the additional premiums resulting from the change in risk exposure under the contract for the taxable year in which the change in such exposure occurs. Unless the change in risk exposure is of temporary duration, the additional gross premiums are included in gross premiums written for the remainder of the effective period of the contract. Thus, for the taxable year ending December 31, 2000, IC reports gross premiums written of $348,750 with respect to the workers' compensation contract issued to X, consisting of the sum of the initial gross premium for the contract ($315,000) plus the additional gross premium attributable to the 150 employees added to X's payroll who will be covered during the last nine months of the contract's effective period (150 × $25 (monthly premium) × 9 = $33,750). IC's unearned premium with respect to the contract was $180,000 as of December 31, 2000, which consists of the sum of the remaining portion of the original gross premium ($315,000 × 6 / 12 = $157,500), plus the additional premiums resulting from the change in risk exposure ($33,750 × 6 / 9 = $22,500) that
are allocable to the remaining six months of the contract's effective period. Pursuant to section 832(b)(4)(B), to determine its premiums earned, IC deducts $144,000 ($180,000 × .8) for the insurance contract at the end of the taxable year.

# Example 7.
(i) The facts are the same as
Example 6,
except that the increase in the number of X's employees for the period ending December 31, 2000 is attributable to a seasonal variation in X's business activity.
(ii) Under paragraph (a)(5)(ii) of this section, for the taxable year ending December 31, 2000, IC reports gross premiums written of $326,500, consisting of the sum of the initial gross premium for the contract ($315,000) plus the additional premium attributable to the temporary increase in risk exposure during the taxable year (150 × $25 × 3 = $11,250). The unearned premium that is allocable to the remaining six months of the effective period of the contract is $157,500. Pursuant to section 832(b)(4)(B), to determine its premiums earned, IC deducts $126,000 ($157,500 × .8) for the insurance contract at the end of the taxable year.

# Example 8.
(i) IC, a non-life insurance company, issues a noncancellable accident and health insurance contract (other than a qualified long-term care insurance contract, as defined in section 7702B(b)) to A, an individual, on July 1, 2000. The contract has an entry-age annual premium of $2,400, which is payable by A in equal monthly installments of $200 on the first day of each month of coverage. IC incurs agents' commissions, premium taxes, and other premium acquisition expenses equal to 10% of the gross premiums received for the contract. As of December 31, 2000, IC has collected $1,200 of installment premiums for the contract.
(ii) A noncancellable accident and health insurance contract is a contract described in section 832(b)(7). Thus, under paragraph (a)(5)(vi) of this section, IC may report gross premiums written in the manner required for life insurance companies under sections 803 and 811. Accordingly, for the taxable year ending December 31, 2000, IC may report gross premiums written of $1,200, based on the premiums actually received on the contract. Pursuant to section (a)(5)(vi) of this section, IC deducts a total of $28 of premium acquisition costs for the contract, based on the difference between the acquisition costs actually paid or incurred under section 811(a) ($1,200 × .10 = $120) and the amount required to be taken into account under section 848 in connection with the net premiums for the contract ($1,200 × .077 = $92).
(iii) Under paragraph (a)(8)(ii)(A) of this section, IC includes the amount of life insurance reserves (as defined in section 816(b), but computed in accordance with section 807(d) and sections 811(c) and (d)) in unearned premiums under section 832(b)(4)(B). Section 807(d)(3)(A)(iii) requires IC to use a two-year preliminary term method to compute the amount of life insurance reserves for a noncancellable accident and health insurance contract (other than a qualified long-term care contract). Under this tax reserve method, no portion of the $1,200 gross premium received by IC for A's contract is allocable to future insurance coverage. Accordingly, for the taxable year ending December 31, 2000, no life insurance reserves are included in IC's unearned premiums under section 832(b)(4)(B) with respect to the contract.

# Example 9.
(i) IC, a non-life insurance company, issues an insurance contract with a twelve month effective period for $1,200 on December 1, 2000. Immediately thereafter, IC reinsures 90% of its liability under the insurance contract for $900 with IC-2, an unrelated and solvent insurance company. On December 31, 2000, IC-2 has an $825 unearned premium with respect to the reinsurance contract it issued to IC. In computing its earned premiums, pursuant to section 832(b)(4)(B), IC-2 deducts $660 of unearned premiums ($825 × .8) with respect to the reinsurance contract.
(ii) Under paragraph (a)(8)(i) of this section, unearned premiums held by an insurance company with regard to the net value of the risks reinsured in other solvent companies are deducted from the ceding company's unearned premiums taken into account for purposes of section 832(b)(4)(B). If IC had not reinsured 90% of its risks, IC's unearned premium for the insurance contract would have been $1,100 ($1,200 × 11 / 12) and IC would have deducted $880 ($1,100 × .8) of unearned premiums with respect to such contract. However, because IC reinsured 90% of its risks under the contract with IC-2, as of December 31, 2000, the net value of the risks retained by IC for the remaining 11 months of the effective period of the contract is $110 ($1,100 − $990). For the taxable year ending December 31, 2000, IC includes the $1,200 gross premium in its gross premiums written and deducts the $900 reinsurance premium paid to IC-2 under section 832(b)(4)(A). Pursuant to section 832(b)(4)(B), to determine its premiums earned, IC deducts $88 ($110 × .8) for the insurance contract at the end of the taxable year.
(11)
Change in method of accounting
—(i)
In general.
A change in the method of determining premiums earned to comply with the provisions of paragraphs (a)(3) through (a)(10) of this section is a change in method of accounting for which the consent of the Commissioner is required under section 446(e) and § 1.446-1(e).
(ii)
Application.
For the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1999, a taxpayer is granted consent of the Commissioner to change its method of
accounting for determining premiums earned to comply with the provisions of paragraphs (a)(3) through (a)(10) of this section. A taxpayer changing its method of accounting in accordance with this section must follow the automatic change in accounting provisions of Rev. Proc. 99-49, 1999-52 I.R.B. 725 (see § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter), except that—
(A) The scope limitations in section 4.02 of Rev. Proc. 99-49 shall not apply;
(B) The timely duplicate filing requirement in section 6.02(2) of Rev. Proc. 99-49 shall not apply; and
(C) If the method of accounting for determining premiums earned is an issue under consideration within the meaning of section 3.09 of Rev. Proc. 99-49 as of January 5, 2000, then section 7.01 of Rev. Proc. 99-49 shall not apply.
(12)
Effective date.
Paragraphs (a)(3) through (a)(11) of this section are applicable with respect to the determination of premiums earned for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1999.
(13) In computing the amount of unabsorbed premium deposits which a mutual fire or flood insurance company described in section 831(a)(3)(B) would be obligated to return to its policyholders at the close of its taxable year, the company must use its own schedule of unabsorbed premium deposit returns then in effect. A copy of the applicable schedule must be filed with the company's income tax return for each taxable year for which a computation based upon such schedule is made. In addition, a taxpayer making such a computation must provide the following information for each taxable year for which the computation is made:
(i) The amount of gross premiums received during the taxable year, and the amount of premiums paid for reinsurance during the taxable year, on the policies described in section 831(a)(3)(B) and on other policies;
(ii) The amount of insurance written during the taxable year under the policies described in section 831(a)(3)(B) and under other policies, and the amount of such insurance written which was reinsured during the taxable year. The information required under this subdivision shall only be submitted upon the specific request of the district director for a statement setting forth such information, and, if required, such statement shall be filed in the manner provided by this subparagraph or in such other manner as is satisfactory to the district director;
(iii) The amount of premiums earned during the taxable year on the policies described in section 831(a)(3)(B) and on other policies and the computations by which such amounts were determined, including sufficient information to support the taxpayer's determination of the amount of unearned premiums on premium deposit plan and other policies at the beginning and end of the taxable year, and the amount of unabsorbed premium deposits at the beginning and end of the taxable year on policies described in section 831(a)(3)(B).
The information required by this subparagraph shall be set forth in a statement attached to the taxpayer's income tax return for the taxable year for which such information is being provided. Such statement shall include the name and address of the taxpayer, and shall be filed not later than the date prescribed by law (including extensions thereof) for filing the income tax return for the taxable year.
(14) In computing “losses incurred” the determination of unpaid losses at the close of each year must represent actual unpaid losses as nearly as it is possible to ascertain them.
(b)
Losses incurred.
Every insurance company to which this section applies must be prepared to establish to the satisfaction of the district director that the part of the deduction for “losses incurred” which represents unpaid losses at the close of the taxable year comprises only actual unpaid losses. See section 846 for rules relating to the determination of discounted unpaid losses. These losses must be stated in amounts which, based upon the facts in each case and the company's experience with similar cases, represent a fair and reasonable estimate of the amount the company will be required to pay. Amounts included in, or added to, the estimates of unpaid losses which, in the opinion of the district director, are in excess of a fair and reasonable estimate will be disallowed as
a deduction. The district director may require any insurance company to submit such detailed information with respect to its actual experience as is deemed necessary to establish the reasonableness of the deduction for “losses incurred.”
(c)
Losses incurred are reduced by salvage.
Under section 832(b)(5)(A), losses incurred are computed by taking into account losses paid reduced by salvage and reinsurance recovered, the change in discounted unpaid losses, and the change in estimated salvage and reinsurance recoverable. For purposes of section 832(b)(5)(A)(iii), estimated salvage recoverable includes all anticipated recoveries on account of salvage, whether or not the salvage is treated, or may be treated, as an asset for state statutory accounting purposes. Estimates of salvage recoverable must be based on the facts of each case and the company's experience with similar cases. Except as otherwise provided in guidance published by the Commissioner in the Internal Revenue Bulletin, estimated salvage recoverable must be discounted either—
(1) By using the applicable discount factors published by the Commissioner for estimated salvage recoverable; or
(2) By using the loss payment pattern for a line of business as the salvage recovery pattern for that line of business and by using the applicable interest rate for calculating unpaid losses under section 846(c). For purposes of section 832(b)(5)(A) and the regulations thereunder, the term “salvage recoverable” includes anticipated recoveries on account of subrogation claims arising with respect to paid or unpaid losses.
(d)
Increase in unpaid losses shown on annual statement in certain circumstances
—(1)
In general.
An insurance company that takes estimated salvage recoverable into account in determining the amount of its unpaid losses shown on its annual statement is allowed to increase its unpaid losses by the amount of estimated salvage recoverable taken into account if the company complies with the disclosure requirement of paragraph (d)(2) of this section. This adjustment shall not be used in determining under section 846(d) the loss payment pattern for a line of business.
(2)
Disclosure requirement.
(i)
In general.
A company described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section is allowed to increase the unpaid losses shown on its annual statement only if the company either—
(A) Discloses on its annual statement, by line of business and accident year, the extent to which estimated salvage recoverable is taken into account in computing the unpaid losses shown on the annual statement filed by the company for the calendar year ending with or within the taxable year of the company; or
(B) Files a statement on or before the due date of its Federal income tax return (determined without regard to extensions) with the appropriate state regulatory authority of each state to which the company is required to submit an annual statement. The statement must be contained in a separate document captioned “DISCLOSURE CONCERNING LOSS RESERVES” and must disclose, by line of business and accident year, the extent to which estimated salvage recoverable is taken into account in computing the unpaid losses shown on the annual statement filed by the company for the calendar year ending with or within the taxable year of the company.
(ii)
Transitional rule.
For a taxable year ending before December 31, 1991, a taxpayer is deemed to satisfy the disclosure requirement of paragraph (d)(2)(i)(B) of this section if the taxpayer files the statement described in paragraph (d)(2)(i)(B) of this section before March 17, 1992.
(3)
Failure to disclose in a subsequent year.
If a company that claims the increase permitted by paragraph (d)(1) of this section fails in a subsequent taxable year to make the disclosure described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the company cannot claim an increase under paragraph (d)(1) of this section in any subsequent taxable year without the consent of the Commissioner.
(e)
Treatment of estimated salvage recoverable
—(1)
In general.
An insurance company is required to take estimated salvage recoverable (including that which cannot be treated as an asset for state statutory accounting purposes)
into account in computing the deduction for losses incurred. Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section, an insurance company must apply this method of accounting to estimated salvage recoverable for all lines of business and for all accident years.
(2)
Change in method of accounting
—(i) If an insurance company did not take estimated salvage recoverable into account as required by paragraph (c) of this section for its last taxable year beginning before January 1, 1990, taking estimated salvage recoverable into account as required by paragraph (c) of this section is a change in method of accounting.
(ii) If a company does not claim the deduction under section 11305(c)(3) of the 1990 Act, the company must take into account 13 percent of the adjustment that would otherwise be required under section 481 for pre-1990 accident years as a result of the change in accounting method. This paragraph (e)(2)(ii) applies only to an insurance company subject to tax under section 831.
(iii) If a company claims the deduction under section 11305(c)(3) of the 1990 Act and paragraph (f) of this section, the company must implement the change in method of accounting for estimated salvage recoverable for post-1989 taxable years pursuant to a “cut-off” method.
(3)
Rule for overestimates.
An insurance company is required under section 11305(c)(4) of the 1990 Act to include in gross income 87 percent of any amount (adjusted for discounting) by which the section 481 adjustment is overestimated. The rule is applied by comparing the amount of the section 481 adjustment (determined without regard to paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section and any discounting) to the sum of the actual salvage recoveries and remaining undiscounted estimated salvage recoverable that are attributable to losses incurred in accident years beginning before 1990. For any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1989, any excess of the section 481 adjustment over this sum (reduced by amounts treated as overestimates in prior taxable years pursuant to this paragraph (e)(3)) is an overestimate. To determine the amount to be included in income, it is necessary to discount this excess and multiply the resulting amount by 87 percent.
(f)
Special deduction
—(1)
In general.
Under section 11305(c)(3) of the 1990 Act, an insurance company may deduct an amount equal to 87 percent of the discounted amount of estimated salvage recoverable that the company took into account in determining the deduction for losses incurred under section 832(b)(5) in the last taxable year beginning before January 1, 1990. A company that claims the special deduction must establish to the satisfaction of the district director that the deduction represents only the discounted amount of estimated salvage recoverable that was actually taken into account by the company in computing losses incurred for that taxable year.
(2)
Safe harbor.
The requirements of paragraph (f)(1) of this section are deemed satisfied and the amount that the company reports as bona fide estimated salvage recoverable is not subject to adjustment by the district director, if—
(i) The company files with the insurance regulatory authority of the company's state of domicile, on or before September 16, 1991, a statement disclosing the extent to which losses incurred for each line of business reported on its 1989 annual statement were reduced by estimated salvage recoverable,
(ii) The company attaches a statement to its Federal income tax return filed for the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1989, agreeing to apply the special rule for overestimates under section 11305(c)(4) of the 1990 Act to the amount of estimated salvage recoverable for which it has taken the special deduction, and
(iii) In the case of a company that is a member of a consolidated group, each insurance company subject to tax under section 831 that is included in the consolidated group complies with paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section with respect to its special deduction, if any.
(3)
Limitations on special deduction
—(i) The special deduction under section 11305(c)(3) of the 1990 Act is available only to an insurance company subject to tax under section 831.
(ii) An insurance company that claimed the benefit of the “fresh start” with respect to estimated salvage recoverable under section 1023(e) of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 may not claim the special deduction allowed by section 11305(c)(3) of the 1990 Act to the extent of the estimated salvage recoverable for which a fresh start benefit was previously claimed.
(iii) A company that claims the special deduction is precluded from also claiming the section 481 adjustment provided in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section for pre-1990 accident years.
(g)
Effective date.
Paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section are effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1989.

§ 1.832-5
Deductions.
(a) The deductions allowable are specified in section 832(c) and by reason of the provisions of section 832(c)(10) and (12) include in addition certain deductions provided in sections 161, and 241 and following. The deductions, however, are subject to the limitation provided in section 265, relating to expenses and interest in respect of tax-exempt income. The net operating loss deduction is computed under section 172 and the regulations thereunder. For the purposes of section 172, relating to net operating loss deduction, “gross income” shall mean gross income as defined in section 832(b)(1) and the allowable deductions shall be those allowed by section 832(c) with the exceptions and limitations set forth in section 172(d). In addition to the deduction for capital losses provided in subchapter P (section 1201 and following), chapter 1 of the Code, insurance companies are allowed a deduction for losses from capital assets sold or exchanged in order to obtain funds to meet abnormal insurance losses and to provide for the payment of dividends and similar distributions to policyholders. A special rule is provided for the application of the capital loss carryover provisions of section 1212. The deduction is the same as that allowed mutual insurance companies subject to the tax imposed by section 821; see section 822(c)(6) and the regulation thereunder. Insurance companies, other than mutual fire insurance companies described in section 831(a)(3)(A) and the regulations thereunder, are also allowed a deduction for dividends and similar distributions paid or declared to policyholders in their capacity as such. Similar distributions include such payments as the so-called unabsorbed premium deposits returned to policyholders by factory mutual insurance companies. The deduction is otherwise the same as that allowed mutual insurance companies subject to the tax imposed by section 821; see section 822(f)(2) and the regulations thereunder.
(b) Among the items which may not be deducted are income and profits taxes imposed by the United States, income and profits taxes imposed by any foreign country or possession of the United States (in cases where the company chooses to claim to any extent a credit for such taxes), taxes assessed against local benefits, decrease during the year due to adjustments in the book value of capital assets, decrease in liabilities during the year on account of reinsurance treaties, dividends paid to shareholders in their capacity as such, remittances to the home office of a foreign insurance company by the United States branch, and borrowed money repaid.
(c) In computing taxable income of insurance companies, losses sustained during the taxable year from the sale or other disposition of property are deductible subject to the limitation contained in section 1211. Insurance companies are entitled to the alternative taxes provided in section 1201.
[T.D. 6681, 28 FR 11130, Oct. 17, 1963, as amended by T.D. 6867, 30 FR 15094, Dec. 7, 1965]
§ 1.832-6
Policyholders of mutual fire or flood insurance companies operating on the basis of premium deposits.
For purposes of determining his taxable income for any taxable year, a taxpayer insured by a mutual fire or flood insurance company under a policy for which the premium deposit is
the same regardless of the length of the term for which the policy is written, and who is entitled to have returned or credited to his on the cancellation or expiration of such policy the unabsorbed portion of the premium deposit not required for losses, expenses, or establishment of reserves, may, if such amount is otherwise deductible under this chapter, deduct so much of his premium deposit as was absorbed by the company during the taxpayer's taxable year. The amount of the premium deposit absorbed during the taxpayer's taxable year shall be determined in accordance with the schedule of unabsorbed premium deposit returns in effect for the company during such taxable year. If the taxpayer is unable to determine the applicable rate of absorption in effect during his taxable year, he shall compute his deduction on the basis of the rate of absorption in effect at the end of the company's taxable year which next preceded the end of the taxpayer's taxable year. In such a case, an appropriate adjustment will be made upon the final determination of the rate of absorption applicable to the taxable year.
[T.D. 6681, 28 FR 11130, Oct. 17, 1963]
§ 1.833-1
Medical loss ratio under section 833(c)(5).
(a)
In general.
Section 833(a)(2) and (3) do not apply to an organization unless the organization's medical loss ratio (MLR) for a taxable year is at least 85 percent.

(c)
Computation of MLR under section 833(c)(5)
—(1)
In general.
Starting with the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2015, and for all succeeding taxable years, an organization's MLR with respect to a taxable year is the ratio, expressed as a percentage, of the MLR numerator, as described in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, to the MLR denominator, as described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.
(i)
MLR numerator.
The numerator of an organization's MLR is the total premium revenue expended on reimbursement for clinical services and activities that improve health care quality provided to enrollees under its policies for the taxable year, computed using a three-year period in the same manner as those expenses are computed for the plan year for purposes of section 300gg-18(b) of title 42, United States Code and regulations issued under that section (see 45 CFR part 158).
(ii)
MLR denominator.
The denominator of an organization's MLR is the organization's total premium revenue for the taxable year, computed using a three-year period in the same manner as the total premium revenue is computed for the plan year for purposes of section 300gg-18(b) of title 42, United States Code and regulations issued
under that section (see 45 CFR part 158).
(2)
Transition rules.
The transition rules in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section apply solely for the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2013, and the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2014.
(i)
First taxable year beginning after December 31, 2013.
For the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2013, the numerator of an organization's MLR is the total premium revenue expended on reimbursement for clinical services and activities that improve health care quality provided to enrollees under its policies for the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2013, and the denominator of an organization's MLR is the organization's total premium revenue for the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2013.
(ii)
First taxable year beginning after December 31, 2014.
For the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2014, the numerator of an organization's MLR is the sum of the total premium revenue expended on reimbursement for clinical services and activities that improve health care quality provided to enrollees under its policies for the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2013, and for the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2014, and the denominator of an organization's MLR is the sum of the organization's total premium revenue for the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2013, and for the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2014.
(d)
Failure to qualify under section 833(c)(5)
—(1)
In general.
If, for any taxable year, an organization's MLR is less than 85 percent, then beginning in that taxable year and for each subsequent taxable year for which the organization's MLR remains less than 85 percent, paragraphs (d)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section apply.
(i)
Special deduction.
The organization is not allowed the special deduction set forth in section 833(b).
(ii)
Premiums earned.
The organization must take into account 80 percent, rather than 100 percent, of its unearned premiums under section 832(b)(4) as it applies to other non-life insurance companies.
(2)
No material change.
An organization's loss of eligibility for the treatment provided by sections 833(a)(2) and (3) solely by reason of section 833(c)(5) will not be treated as a material change in the operations of such organization or in its structure for purposes of section 833(c)(2)(C).
(e)
Effective/applicability date.
This section applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2016. However, taxpayers may rely on this section for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2009.
[T.D. 9772, 81 FR 40520, June 22, 2016]
§ 1.846-1
Application of discount factors.
(a)
In general
—(1)
Rules.
A separate series of discount factors are computed for, and applied, to undiscounted unpaid losses attributable to each accident year of each line of business shown on the annual statement (as defined by section 846(e)(3)) filed by that taxpayer for the calendar year ending with or within the taxable year of the taxpayer. See § 1.832-4(b) relating to the determination of unpaid losses. Paragraph (b) of this section provides rules relating to applicable discount factors. Once a taxpayer applies a series of discount factors to unpaid losses attributable to an accident year of a line of business, that series of discount factors must be applied to discount the unpaid losses for that accident year for that line of business for all future taxable years. The discount factors cannot be changed to reflect a change in the taxpayer's loss payment pattern during a subsequent year or to reflect a different interest rate assumption.
(2)
Increase in discounted unpaid losses shown on the annual statement.
If the amount of unpaid losses shown on the annual statement is determined on a discounted basis, and the extent to which the unpaid losses were discounted can be determined on the basis of information disclosed on or with the annual statement, the amount of the unpaid losses to which the discount factors are applied shall be determined without regard to any reduction attributable to the discounting reflected on the annual statement.
(3)
Increase in unpaid losses which take into account estimated salvage recoverable.
If the amount of unpaid losses shown on the annual statement reflects a reduction for estimated salvage recoverable and the extent to which the unpaid losses were reduced by estimated salvage recoverable is appropriately disclosed as required by § 1.832-4(d)(2), the amount of unpaid losses shall be determined without regard to the reduction for salvage recoverable.
(b)
Applicable discount factors
—(1)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in section 846(e)(6) (relating to certain accident and health lines of business), in this paragraph (b), or in other guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin, the following factors must be used—
(i)
Discount factors published by the Service.
If the Service has published discount factors for a line of business, a taxpayer must discount unpaid losses attributable to that line by applying those discount factors; and
(ii)
Composite discount factors.
If the Service has not published discount factors for a line of business, a taxpayer must discount unpaid losses attributable to that line by applying composite discount factors.
(iii)
Annual statement changes.
If the groupings of individual lines of business on the annual statement changes, taxpayers must discount the unpaid losses on the resulting lines of business with the discounting patterns that would have applied to those unpaid losses based on their annual statement classification prior to the change.
(2)
Title insurance company reserves.
A title insurance company may only take into account case reserves (relating to claims which have been reported to the insurance company). Unless the Service publishes other guidance, the reserves must be discounted using the “Miscellaneous Casualty” discount factors published by the Service. Section 832(b)(8) provides rules for determining the discounted unearned premiums of a title insurance company.
(3)
Reinsurance business
—(i)
Proportional reinsurance.
For the 1988 accident year and subsequent accident years, unpaid losses for proportional reinsurance must be discounted using discount factors applicable to the line of business to which those unpaid losses are allocated as required on the annual statement.
(ii)
Non-proportional reinsurance
For the 1992 accident year and subsequent accident years, unpaid losses for non-proportional reinsurance must be discounted using the applicable discount factors published by the Service for the appropriate reinsurance line of business.
(4)
Composite discount factors.
For purposes of the regulations under section 846, “composite discount factors” means the series of discount factors published annually by the Service determined on the basis of the appropriate composite loss payment pattern.
(c)
Determination of annual rate.
The applicable interest rate is the annual rate determined by the Secretary for any calendar year on the basis of the corporate bond yield curve (as defined in section 430(h)(2)(D)(i), determined by substituting “60-month period” for “24-month period” therein). The annual rate for any calendar year is determined on the basis of a yield curve that reflects the average, for the most recent 60-month period ending before the beginning of the calendar year, of monthly yields on corporate bonds described in section 430(h)(2)(D)(i). The annual rate is the average of that yield curve's monthly spot rates with times to maturity from four and one-half years to ten years.
(d)
Determination of loss payment pattern
—(1)
In general.
Under section 846(d)(1), the loss payment pattern determined by the Secretary for each line of business is determined by reference to the historical loss payment pattern applicable to such line of business determined in accordance with the method of determination set forth in section 846(d)(2) and the computational rules prescribed in section 846(d)(3) on the basis of the annual statement data from annual statements described in section 846(d)(2)(A) and (B). However, the Secretary may adjust the loss payment pattern for any line of business as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
(2)
Smoothing adjustments.
The Secretary may adjust the loss payment pattern for any line of business using a
methodology described by the Secretary in other published guidance if necessary to avoid negative payment amounts and otherwise produce a stable pattern of positive discount factors less than one.
(e)
Applicability dates.
(1) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, this section applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986.
(2) Paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017.

[T.D. 8456, 57 FR 61818, Dec. 29, 1992]
§ 1.848-1
Definitions and special provisions.
(a)
Scope and effective date.
The definitions and special provisions in this section apply solely for purposes of determining specified policy acquisition expenses under section 848 of the Internal Revenue Code, this section, and §§ 1.848-2 and 1.848-3. Unless otherwise specified, the rules of this section are effective for the taxable years of an insurance company beginning after November 14, 1991.
(b)
Specified insurance contract
—(1)
In general.
A “specified insurance contract” is any life insurance contract, annuity contract, noncancellable or guaranteed renewable accident and health insurance contract, or combination contract. A reinsurance agreement that reinsures the risks under a specified insurance contract is treated in the same manner as the reinsured contract.
(2)
Exceptions
—(i)
In general.
A “specified insurance contract” does not include any pension plan contract (as defined in section 818(a)), flight insurance or similar contract, or qualified foreign contract (as defined in section 807(e)(3)).
(ii)
Reinsurance of qualified foreign contracts.
The exception for qualified foreign contracts does not apply to reinsurance agreements that reinsure qualified foreign contracts.
(c)
Life insurance contract.
A “life insurance contract” is any contract—
(1) Issued after December 31, 1984, that qualifies as a life insurance contract under section 7702(a) (including an endowment contract as defined in 7702(h)); or
(2) Issued prior to January 1, 1985, if the premiums on the contract are reported as life insurance premiums on the insurance company's annual statement (or could be reported as life insurance premiums if the company were required to file the annual statement for life and accident and health companies).
(d)
Annuity contract.
An “annuity contract” is any contract (other than a life insurance contract as defined in paragraph (c) of this section) if amounts received under the contract are subject to the rules in section 72(b) or section 72(e) (determined without regard to section 72(u)). The term “annuity contract” also includes a contract that is a qualified funding asset under section 130(d).
(e)
Noncancellable accident and health insurance contract.
The term “noncancellable accident and health insurance contract” has the same meaning for purposes of section 848 as the term has for purposes of section 816(b).
(f)
Guaranteed renewable accident and health insurance contract.
The term “guaranteed renewable accident and health insurance contract” has the same meaning for purposes of section 848 as the term has for purposes of section 816(e).
(g)
Combination contract
—(1)
Definition.
A “combination contract” is a contract (other than a contract described in section 848(e)(3)) that provides two or more types of insurance coverage, at least one of which if offered separately would be a life insurance contract, an annuity contract, or a noncancellable or guaranteed renewable accident and health insurance contract.
(2)
Treatment of premiums on a combination contract
—(i)
In general.
If the premium allocable to each type of insurance coverage is separately stated on the insurance company's annual statement (or could be separately stated if the insurance company were required to file the annual statement for life and accident and health companies), the premium allocable to each type of insurance coverage in a combination contract is subject to the capitalization rate, if any, that would apply if that coverage was provided in a separate contract. If the premium allocable to each type of insurance coverage in a combination contract is not separately stated, the entire premium is subject to the highest capitalization percentage applicable to any of the coverages provided.
(ii)
De minimis premiums.
For purposes of this paragraph (g)(2)—
(A) A de minimis premium is not required to be separately stated;
(B) In determining the highest capitalization percentage applicable to a combination contract, the coverage to which a de minimis premium is allocable is disregarded;
(C) If the separate statement requirement of this paragraph (g)(2) is satisfied, a de minimis premium is treated in accordance with its characterization on the insurance company's annual statement; and
(D) Whether a premium for an insurance coverage is de minimis is determined by comparing that premium with the aggregate of the premiums for the combination contract. A premium that is not more than 2 percent of the premium for the entire contract is considered de minimis. Whether a premium that is more than 2 percent is de minimis is determined based on all the facts and circumstances.
(3)
Example.
The principles of this paragraph (g) are illustrated by the following example.

# Example.
A life insurance company (L1) issues a contract to an employer (X) which provides cancellable accident and health insurance coverage and group term life insurance coverage to X's employees. L1 charges a premium of $1,000 for the contract, $950 of which is attributable to the cancellable accident and health insurance coverage and $50 of which is attributable to the group term life insurance coverage. On its annual statement, L1 reports the premiums attributable to the accident and health insurance coverage separately from the premiums attributable to the group term life insurance coverage. The contract issued by L1 is a combination contract as defined in paragraph (g)(1) of this section. Pursuant to paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section, only the premiums attributable to the group term life insurance coverage ($50) are subject to the provisions of section 848. The premiums attributable to the cancellable accident and health insurance coverage ($950) are not subject to the provisions of section 848.
(h)
Group life insurance contract
—(1)
In general.
A life insurance contract (as defined in paragraph (c) of this section) is group life insurance contract if—
(i) The contract is a group life insurance contract under the applicable law;
(ii) The coverage is provided under a master contract issued to the group policyholder, which may be a trust, trustee, or agent;
(iii) The premiums on the contract are reported either as group life insurance premiums or credit life insurance premiums on the insurance company's annual statement (or could be reported as group life insurance premiums or credit life insurance premiums if the company were required to file the annual statement for life and accident and health companies);
(iv) The group affiliation requirement of paragraph (h)(2) of this section is satisfied;
(v) The premiums on the contract are determined on a group basis within the meaning of paragraph (h)(3) of this section; and
(vi) The proceeds of the contract are not payable to or for the benefit of the insured's employer, an organization or association to which the insured belongs, or other similar person. (See paragraph (h)(7) of this section for special rules that apply in determining if this requirement is satisfied.)
(2)
Group affiliation requirement
—(i)
In general.
The group affiliation requirement of section 848(e)(2)(A) and this paragraph (h)(2) is satisfied only if all of the individuals eligible for coverage under the contract constitute a group described in paragraphs (h)(2) (ii) through (viii) of this section.
(ii)
Employee group.
An employee group consists of all of the employees (including statutory employees within the meaning of section 3121(d)(3) and individuals who are treated as employed by a single employer under section 414 (b), (c), or (m)), or any class or classes thereof within the meaning of paragraph (h)(2)(x) of this section, of an employer. For this purpose, the term “employee” includes—
(A) A retired or former employee;
(B) The sole proprietor, if the employer is a sole proprietorship;

(B) Has been in active existence for at least two years (including, in the case of a merged or successor association, the years of active existence of any predecessor association); and
(C) Has at least 100 members.
(vi)
Credit union group.
A credit union group consists of all of the members or borrowers, or any class or classes thereof within the meaning of paragraph (h)(2)(x) of this section, of a credit union.

(viii)
Certain discretionary groups.
Provided that the contract otherwise satisfies the requirements of paragraph (h)(1) of this section, a contract issued to one of the following discretionary groups is treated as satisfying the group affiliation requirement of this paragraph (h)(2)—
(A) A contract issued to a group consisting of students of one or more universities or other educational institutions;
(B) A contract issued to a group consisting of members or former members of the U.S. Armed Forces;
(C) A contract issued to a group of individuals for the payment of future funeral expenses; and

b
) of this chapter.)
(ix)
Employees treated as members.
In determining whether the group affiliation requirement of paragraph (h)(2) of this section is satisfied, the employees of a labor union, credit union, or association may be treated as members of a labor union group, a credit union group, or an association group, respectively.
(x)
Class or classes of a group determined without regard to individual health characteristics
—(A)
In general.
A class or classes of a group described in paragraphs (h)(2) (ii) through (viii) of this section may be determined using any reasonable characteristics (for example, amount of insurance, location, or occupation) other than individual health characteristics. The employees of a single employer covered under a policy issued to a multi-employer trust are considered a class of a group described in paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of this section.
(B)
Limitation of coverage based on certain work and age requirements permissible.
A limitation of coverage under a group contract to persons who are actively at work or of a pre-retirement age (for example, age 65 or younger) is not treated as based on individual health characteristics.
(3)
Premiums determined on a group basis
—(i)
In general.
Premiums for a contract are determined on a group basis for purposes of section 848(e)(2)(B) and this paragraph (h) only if the premium charged by the insurance company for each member of the group (or any class thereof) is determined on the basis of the same rates for the corresponding amount of coverage (for example, per $1,000 of insurance) or on the basis of rates which differ only because of the gender, smoking habits, or age of the member.
(ii)
Exception for substandard premium rates for certain high risk insureds.
Any difference in premium rates is disregarded for purposes of this paragraph (h)(3) if the difference is charged for an individual who was accepted for coverage at a substandard rate prior to January 1, 1993.
(iii)
Flexible premium contracts.
In the case of a group universal life insurance contract, the identical premium requirement is satisfied if the premium rates used by the insurance company in determining the periodic mortality charges applied to the policy account
value of any member insured by the contract differ from those of other members (within the same class) only because of the gender, smoking habits, or age of the member.
(iv)
Determination of actual age.
For purposes of this paragraph (h)(3), determinations of actual age may be made using any reasonable method, provided that this method is applied consistently for all members of the group.
(4)
Underwriting practices used by company.
[Reserved]
(5)
Disqualification of group
—(i)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (h)(5), if the requirements of paragraphs (h)(1), (2), and (3) of this section are not satisfied with respect to one or more members of the group, or of a class within a group (within the meaning of paragraph (h)(2)(x) of this section), the premiums for the entire group (or class) are treated as individual life insurance premiums.
(ii)
Exception for de minimis failures.
If the requirements of paragraphs (h) (1), (2), or (3) of this section are not satisfied with respect to one or more members of the group (or class), but the sum of the premiums charged by the insurance company for those individuals is no more than 5 percent of the aggregate premiums for the group (or class), only the premiums charged for those individuals are treated as premiums for an individual life insurance contract.
(6)
Supplemental life insurance coverage.
For purposes of determining whether the requirement in paragraph (h)(3)(i) of this section is satisfied, any supplemental life insurance coverage (including optional coverage for members of the group, their spouses, or their dependent children) is (or is treated as) a separate contract. In determining whether the group affiliation requirement of paragraph (h)(2) of this section is satisfied for the supplemental coverage, a member's spouse and dependent children are treated as members of the group if they are eligible for coverage.
(7)
Special rules relating to the payment of proceeds.
The following rules apply for purposes of section 848(e)(2) and paragraph (h)(1)(vi) of this section.
(i)
Contracts issued to a welfare benefit fund.
If a contract issued to a welfare benefit fund (as defined in section 419) provides for payment of proceeds to the welfare benefit fund, the proceeds of the contract are not considered payable to or for the benefit of the insured's employer, an organization or association to which the insured belongs, or other similar person, provided the proceeds are paid as benefits to the employee or the employee's beneficiary.
(ii)
Credit life insurance contracts.
If a credit life insurance contract provides for payment of proceeds to the insured's creditor, the proceeds of the contract are not treated as payable to or for the benefit of the insured's employer, an organization or association to which the insured belongs, or other similar person, provided the proceeds are applied against an outstanding indebtedness of the insured.
(iii)
“Organization or association” limited to the sponsor of the contract or the group policyholder.
The term “organization or association” means the organization or association that is either the sponsor of the contract or the group policyholder.
(i)
General deductions.
The term “general deductions” is defined in section 848(c)(2). An insurance company determines its general deductions for the taxable year without regard to amounts capitalized or amortized under section 848(a). The amount of a company's general deductions is also determined without regard to the rules of § 1.848-2(f), which apply only for purposes of determining net consideration for reinsurance agreements.
[T.D. 8456, 57 FR 61819, Dec. 29, 1992; 58 FR 9245, Feb. 19, 1993, as amended by T.D. 9911, 85 FR 64394, Oct. 13, 2020]
§ 1.848-2
Determination of net premiums.
(a)
Net premiums
—(1)
In general.
An insurance company must use the accrual method of accounting (as prescribed by section 811(a)(1)) to determine the net premiums with respect to each category of specified insurance contracts. With respect to any category of contracts, net premiums means—
(i) The gross amount of premiums and other consideration (see paragraph (b) of this section); reduced by
(ii) The sum of—
(A) The return premiums (see paragraph (e) of this section); and
(B) The net negative consideration for a reinsurance agreement (other than an agreement described in paragraph (h)(2) of this section). See paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section for rules relating to the determination of net negative consideration.
(2)
Separate determination of net premiums for certain reinsurance agreements.
Net premiums with respect to reinsurance agreements for which an election under paragraph (h)(3) of this section has been made (certain reinsurance agreements with parties not subject to United States taxation) are treated separately and are subject to the rules of paragraph (h) of this section.
(b)
Gross amount of premiums and other consideration
—(1)
General rule.
The term “gross amount of premiums and other consideration” means the sum of—
(i) All premiums and other consideration (other than amounts on reinsurance agreements); and
(ii) The net positive consideration for any reinsurance agreement (other than an agreement for which an election under paragraph (h)(3) of this section has been made).
(2)
Items included.
The gross amount of premiums and other consideration includes—
(i) Advance premiums;
(ii) Amounts in a premium deposit fund or similar account, to the extent provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section;
(iii) Fees;
(iv) Assessments;
(v) Amounts that the insurance company charges itself representing premiums with respect to benefits for its employees (including full-time life insurance salesmen treated as employees under section 7701(a)(20)); and
(vi) The value of a new contract issued in an exchange described in paragraph (c)(2) or (c)(3) of this section.
(3)
Treatment of premium deposits
—(i)
In general.
An amount in a premium deposit fund or similar account is taken into account in determining the gross amount of premiums and other consideration at the earlier of the time that the amount is applied to, or irrevocably committed to, the payment of a premium on a specified insurance contract. If an amount is irrevocably committed to the payment of a premium on a specified insurance contract, then neither that amount nor any earnings allocable to that amount are included in the gross amount of premiums and other consideration when applied to the payment of a premium on the same contract.
(ii)
Amounts irrevocably committed to the payment of premiums.
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section, an amount in a premium deposit fund or similar account is irrevocably committed to the payment of premiums on a contract only if neither the amount nor any earnings allocable to that amount may be—
(A) Returned to the policyholder or any other person (other than on surrender of the contract); or
(B) Used by the policyholder to fund another contract.
(iii)
Retired lives reserves.
Premiums received by an insurance company under a retired lives reserve arrangement are treated as irrevocably committed to the payment of premiums on a specified insurance contract.
(4)
Deferred and uncollected premiums.
The gross amount of premiums and other consideration does not include deferred and uncollected premiums.
(c)
Policy exchanges
—(1)
General rule.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (c), an exchange of insurance contracts (including a change in the terms of a specified insurance contract) does not result in any amount being included in the gross amount of premiums and other consideration.
(2)
External exchanges.
If a contract is exchanged for a specified insurance contract issued by another insurance company, the company that issues the new contract must include the value of the new contract in the gross amount of premiums and other consideration.
(3)
Internal exchanges resulting in fundamentally different contracts
—(i)
In general.
If a contract is exchanged for a specified insurance contract issued by the same insurance company that issued the original contract, the company must include the value of the new
contract in the gross amount of premiums and other consideration if the new contract—
(A) Relates to a different category of specified insurance contract than the original contract;
(B) Does not cover the same insured as the original contract; or
(C) Changes the interest, mortality, morbidity, or expense guarantees with respect to the nonforfeiture benefits provided in the original contract.
(ii)
Certain modifications treated as not changing the mortality, morbidity, interest, or expense guarantees.
For purposes of paragraph (c)(3)(i)(C) of this section, the following items are not treated as changing the interest, mortality, morbidity, or expense guarantees with respect to the nonforfeiture benefits provided in the contract—
(A) A change in a temporary guarantee with respect to the amounts to be credited as interest to the policyholder's account, or charged as mortality, morbidity, or expense charges, if the new guarantee applies for a period of ten years or less;
(B) The determination of benefits on annuitization using rates which are more favorable to the policyholder than the permanently guaranteed rates; and
(C) Other items as specified by the Commissioner in subsequent guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin.
(iii)
Exception for contracts restructured by a court supervised rehabilitation or similar proceeding.
No amount is included in the gross amount of premiums and other consideration with respect to any change made to the interest, mortality, morbidity, or expense guarantees with respect to the nonforfeiture benefits of contracts of an insurance company that is the subject of a rehabilitation, conservatorship, insolvency, or similar state proceeding. This treatment applies only if the change—
(A) Occurs as part of the rehabilitation, conservatorship, insolvency, or similar state proceeding; and
(B) Is approved by the state court, the state insurance department, or other state official with authority to act in the rehabilitation, conservatorship, insolvency, or similar state proceeding.
(4)
Value of the contract
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of paragraph (c)(2) or (c)(3) of this section, the value of the new contract is established through the most recent sale by the company of a comparable contract. If the value of the new contract is not readily ascertainable, the value may be approximated by using the interpolated terminal reserve of the original contract as of the date of the exchange.
(ii)
Special rule for group term life insurance contracts.
In the case of any exchange involving a group term life insurance contract without cash value, the value of the new contract is deemed to be zero.
(iii)
Special rule for certain policy enhancement and update programs
—(A)
In general.
If the interest, mortality, morbidity, or expense guarantees with respect to the nonforfeiture benefits of a specified insurance contract are changed pursuant to a policy enhancement or update program, the value of the contract included in the gross amount of premiums and other consideration equals 30 percent of the value determined under paragraph (c)(4) of this section.
(B)
Policy enhancement or update program defined.
For purposes of paragraph (c)(4)(iii)(A) of this section, a policy enhancement or update program means any offer or commitment by the insurance company to all of the policyholders holding a particular policy form to change the interest, mortality, morbidity, or expense guarantees used to determine the contract's nonforfeiture benefits.
(5)
Example.
The principles of this paragraph (c) are illustrated by the following example.

# Example.
(i) An individual (A) owns a life insurance policy issued by a life insurance company (L1). On January 1, 1993, A purchases additional term insurance for $250, which is added as a rider to A's life insurance policy. The purchase of the additional term insurance does not change the interest mortality, morbidity, or expense guarantees with respect to the nonforfeiture benefits provided by A's life insurance policy.
(ii) A's purchase of the term insurance rider is not considered to result in a fundamentally different contract under paragraph (c)(3) of this section because the addition of the rider did not change the interest, mortality, morbidity, or expense guarantees with respect to the nonforfeiture values of A's original life insurance policy. Therefore, L1 includes only the $250 received from A in the gross amount of premiums and other consideration.
(d)
Amounts excluded from the gross amount of premiums and other consideration
—(1)
In general.
The following items are not included in the gross amount of premiums and other consideration—
(i) Items treated by section 808(e) as policyholder dividends that are paid to the policyholder and immediately returned to the insurance company as a premium on the same contract that generated the dividends, including—
(A) A policyholder dividend applied to pay a premium under the contract that generated the dividend;
(B) Excess interest accumulated within the contract;
(C) A policyholder dividend applied for additional coverage (for example, a paid-up addition, extension of the period for which insurance protection is provided, or reduction of the period for which premiums are paid) on the contract that generated the dividend;
(D) A policyholder dividend applied to reduce premiums otherwise payable on the contract that generated the dividend;
(E) An experience-rated refund applied to pay a premium on the group contract that generated the refund; and
(F) An experience-rated refund applied to a premium stabilization reserve held with respect to the group contract that generated the refund;
(ii) Premiums waived as a result of the disability of an insured or the disability or death of a premium payor;
(iii) Premiums considered to be paid on a contract as the result of a partial surrender or withdrawal from the contract, or as a result of the surrender or withdrawal of a paid-up addition previously issued with respect to the same contract; and
(iv) Amounts treated as premiums upon the selection by a policyholder or by a beneficiary of a settlement option provided in a life insurance contract.
(2)
Amounts received or accrued from a guaranty association.
Amounts received or accrued from a guaranty association relating to an insurance company that is subject to an insolvency, delinquency, conservatorship, rehabilitation, or similar proceeding are not included in the gross amount of premiums and other consideration.
(3)
Exclusion not to apply to dividend accumulations.
For purposes of section 848(d)(3) and paragraph (d)(1) of this section, amounts applied from a dividend accumulation account to pay premiums on a specified insurance contract are not amounts treated as paid to, and immediately returned by, the policyholder.
(e)
Return premiums.
For purposes of section 848(d)(1)(B) and this section, return premiums do not include policyholder dividends (as defined in section 808), claims or benefits payments, or amounts returned to another insurance company under a reinsurance agreement. For the treatment of amounts returned to another insurance company under a reinsurance agreement, see paragraph (f) of this section.
(f)
Net consideration for a reinsurance agreement
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of section 848, the ceding company and the reinsurer must treat amounts arising from the reinsurance of a specified insurance contract consistently in determining their net premiums. See paragraph (g) of this section for restrictions on the amount of the net negative consideration for any reinsurance agreement that may be taken into account. See paragraph (h) of this section for special rules applicable to reinsurance agreements with parties not subject to United States taxation.
(2)
Net consideration determined by a ceding company
—(i)
In general.
The net consideration determined by a ceding company for a reinsurance agreement equals—
(A) The gross amount incurred by the reinsurer with respect to the reinsurance agreement, including any ceding commissions, annual allowances, reimbursements of claims and benefits, modified coinsurance reserve adjustments under paragraph (f)(5) of this
section, experience-rated adjustments, and termination payments; less
(B) The gross amount of premiums and other consideration incurred by the ceding company with respect to the reinsurance agreement.
(ii)
Net negative and net positive consideration.
If the net consideration is less than zero, the ceding company has net negative consideration for the reinsurance agreement. If the net consideration is greater than zero, the ceding company has net positive consideration for the reinsurance agreement.
(3)
Net consideration determined by the reinsurer
—(i)
In general.
The net consideration determined by a reinsurer for a reinsurance agreement equals—
(A) The amount described in paragraph (f)(2)(i)(B) of this section; less
(B) The amount described in paragraph (f)(2)(i)(A) of this section.
(ii)
Net negative and net positive consideration.
If the net consideration is less than zero, the reinsurer has net negative consideration for the reinsurance agreement. If the net consideration is greater than zero, the reinsurer has net positive consideration for the reinsurance agreement.
(4)
Timing consistency required.
For purposes of determining the net consideration of a party for a reinsurance agreement, an income or expense item is taken into account for the first taxable year for which the item is required to be taken into account by either party. Thus, the ceding company and the reinsurer must take the item into account for the same taxable year (or for the same period if the parties have different taxable years).
(5)
Modified coinsurance and funds-withheld reinsurance agreements
—(i)
In general.
In the case of a modified coinsurance or funds-withheld reinsurance agreement, the net consideration for the agreement includes the amount of any payments or reserve adjustments, as well as any related loan transactions between the ceding company and the reinsurer. The amount of any investment income transferred between the parties as the result of a reserve adjustment or loan transaction is treated as an item of consideration under the reinsurance agreement.
(ii)
Special rule for certain funds-withheld reinsurance agreements.
In the case of a funds-withheld reinsurance agreement that is entered into after November 14, 1991, but before the first day of the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1991, and is terminated before January 1, 1995, the parties' net consideration in the year of termination must include the amount of the original reserve for any reinsured specified insurance contract that, in applying the provisions of subchapter L, was treated as premiums and other consideration incurred for reinsurance for the taxable year in which the agreement became effective.
(6)
Treatment of retrocessions.
For purposes of this paragraph (f), a retrocession agreement is treated as a separate reinsurance agreement. The party that is relieved of liability under a retrocession agreement is treated as the ceding company.
(7)
Mixed reinsurance agreement.
If a reinsurance agreement includes more than one category of specified insurance contracts (or specified insurance contracts and contracts that are not specified insurance contracts), the portion of the agreement relating to each category of reinsured specified insurance contracts is treated as a separate agreement. The portion of the agreement relating to reinsured contracts that are not specified insurance contracts is similarly treated as a separate agreement.
(8)
Treatment of policyholder loans.
For purposes of determining the net consideration under a reinsurance agreement, the transfer of a policyholder loan receivable is treated as an item of consideration under the agreement. The interest credited with respect to a policyholder loan receivable is treated as investment income earned directly by the party holding the receivable. The amounts taken into account as claims and benefit reimbursements under the agreement must be determined without reduction for the policyholder loan.
(9)
Examples.
The principles of this paragraph (f) are illustrated by the following examples.

# Example 1.
On July 1, 1992, a life insurance company (L1) transfers a block of individual life insurance contracts to an unrelated life insurance company (L2) under an agreement whereby L2 becomes solely liable to the policyholders under the contracts reinsured. L1
and L2 are calendar year taxpayers. Under the assumption reinsurance agreement, L1 agrees to pay L2 $100,000 for assuming the life insurance contracts, and L2 agrees to pay L1 a $17,000 ceding commission. Under paragraph (f)(2) of this section, L1 has net negative consideration of ($83,000) ($17,000 ceding commission incurred by L2—$100,000 incurred by L1 for reinsurance). Under paragraph (f)(3) of this section, L2 has net positive consideration of $83,000. Under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, L2 includes the net positive consideration in its gross amount of premiums and other consideration.

# Example 2.
(i) On July 1, 1992, a life insurance company (L1) transfers a block of individual life insurance contracts to an unrelated life insurance company (L2) under an agreement whereby L1 remains liable to the policyholders under the reinsured contracts. L1 and L2 are calendar year taxpayers. Under the indemnity reinsurance agreement, L1 agrees to pay L2 $100,000 for reinsuring the life insurance contracts, and L2 agrees to pay L1 a $17,000 ceding commission. L1 agrees to pay L2 an amount equal to the future premiums on the reinsured contracts. L2 agrees to indemnify L1 for claims and benefits and administrative expenses incurred by L1 while the reinsurance agreement is in effect.
(ii) For the period beginning July 1, 1992, and ending December 31, 1992, the following income and expense items are determined with respect to the reinsured contracts:
Item
Income
Expense
Premiums
$25,000
Death benefits
$10,000
Surrender benefits
8,000
Premium taxes and other expenses
2,000
Total
20,000
(iii) Under paragraph (f)(2) of this section, L1's net negative consideration equals ($88,000), which is determined by subtracting the $125,000 ($100,000 + $25,000) incurred by L1 from the $37,000 incurred by L2 under the reinsurance agreement ($17,000 + $10,000 + $8,000 + $2,000). L2's net positive consideration is $88,000. Under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, L2 includes the $88,000 net positive consideration in its gross amount of premiums and other consideration.

# Example 3.
(i) Assume that the reinsurance agreement referred to in
Example 2
is terminated on December 31, 1993. During the period from January 1, 1993 through December 31, 1993, the following income and expense items are determined with respect to the reinsured contracts:
Item
Income
Expense
Premiums
$45,000
Death benefits
$18,000
Surrender benefits
6,000
Premium taxes and other expenses
8,000
Total
32,000
(ii) On the termination of the reinsurance agreement, L1 receives a payment of $70,000 from L2 as consideration for releasing L2 from liability with respect to the reinsured contracts.
(iii) L1's net positive consideration equals $57,000, which is the excess of the $102,000 incurred by L2 for the year ($18,000 + $6,000 + $8,000 + $70,000) over the $45,000 incurred by L1. L2's net negative consideration is ($57,000). L1 includes the net positive consideration in its gross amount of premiums and other consideration.

# Example 4.
(i) On January 1, 1993, an insurance company (L1) enters into a modified coinsurance agreement with another insurance company (L2), covering a block of individual life insurance contracts. Both L1 and L2 are calendar year taxpayers. Under the agreement, L2 is credited with an initial reinsurance premium equal to L1's reserves on the reinsured contracts at the inception of the agreement, any new premiums received with respect to the reinsured contracts, any decrease in L1's reserves on the reinsured contracts, and an amount of investment income determined by reference to L1's reserves on the reinsured contracts. L2 is charged for all claims and expenses incurred with respect to the reinsured contracts plus an amount reflecting any increase in L1's reserves. The agreement further provides that cash settlements between the parties are made at the inception and termination of the agreement, as well as at the end of each calendar year while the agreement is in effect. The cash settlement is determined by netting the sum of the amounts credited to L2 against the sum of the amounts charged to L2 with respect to the reinsured policies. L1's reserves on the reinsured policies at the inception of the reinsurance agreement are $375,000.
(ii) Under the cash settlement formula, L2 is credited with an initial reinsurance premium equal to L1's reserves on the reinsured policies ($375,000), but is charged an amount reflecting L1's policy reserve requirements ($375,000).
(iii) For the period ending December 31, 1993, L2 is also credited and charged the following amounts with respect to the reinsured contracts.
Item
Income
Expense
Premiums
$100,000
Investment income
39,000
Death benefits
$65,000
Increase in reserves
75,000
(iv) Under paragraph (f)(5) of this section, L2's net negative consideration for the 1993 taxable year equals ($1,000) which is determined by subtracting the sum of the amounts charged to L2 ($375,000 + $65,000 + $75,000 = $515,000) from the sum of the amounts credited to L2 ($375,000 + $100,000 + $39,000 = $514,000). L1's net positive consideration for calendar year 1993 equals $1,000. Under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, L1 includes the $1,000 net positive consideration in its gross amount of premiums and other consideration.

# Example 5.
(i) On January 1, 1993, an insurance company (L1) enters into a coinsurance agreement with another insurance company (L2) covering a block of individual life insurance contracts. Both L1 and L2 are calendar year taxpayers. Under the agreement, L2 is credited with an initial reinsurance premium equal to L1's reserves on the effective date of the agreement, any new premiums received on the reinsured contracts, but must indemnify L1 of all claims and expenses incurred with respect to the contracts. As part of the agreement, L2 makes a loan to L1 equal to the amount of the reserves on the reinsured contracts. L1's reserves on the reinsured contracts on the effective date of the agreement are $375,000. Thus, on the inception date of the reinsurance agreement, L1 transfers to L2 its note for $375,000 as consideration for reinsurance.
(ii) The reinsurance agreement between L1 and L2 is a funds-withheld reinsurance agreement. Under paragraph (f)(5) of this section, the amount of any loan transaction is taken into account in determining the parties' net consideration. At the inception of the reinsurance agreement, L2 is credited with a reinsurance premium equal to L1's reserves on the reinsured contracts ($375,000). L2's $375,000 loan to L1 is treated as an amount returned to L1 under the agreement.
(iii) For the period ending December 31, 1993, L2 is credited and charged the following amounts with respect to the reinsured contracts and the loan transaction with L1.
Item
Income
Expense
Premiums
$100,000
Accrued interest
39,000
Death benefits
$65,000
Increase in loan to L1
75,000
(iv) Under paragraph (f)(5) of this section, L2's net negative consideration for the 1993 taxable year equals ($1,000), which is determined by subtracting the sum of amounts incurred by L2 with respect to death benefits and the loan transaction ($375,000 + $65,000 + $75,000 = $515,000) from the sum of the amounts credited to L2 as reinsurance premiums and interest on the loan transaction ($375,000 + $100,000 + 39,000 = $514,000). L1's net positive consideration for calendar year 1993 equals $1,000. Under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, L1 includes the $1,000 net positive consideration in its gross amount of premiums and other consideration.

# Example 6.
(i) On December 31, 1993, an insurance company (L1) enters into a reinsurance agreement with another insurance company (L2) covering a block of individual life insurance contracts. Both L1 and L2 are calendar year taxpayers. Under the agreement, L2 is credited with L1's reserves on the reinsured contracts on the effective date of the agreement, plus any new premiums received on the reinsured contracts, but must indemnify L1 for all claims and expenses incurred with respect to the contracts. Under the agreement, L1 transfers cash of $325,000 to L2 plus rights to its policyholder loan receivables on the reinsured contracts ($50,000). L2 reports the reinsurance agreement by including the transferred policyholder loan receivables as an asset on its books.
(ii) For the period beginning January 1, 1994 and ending December 31, 1994, the following income and expense items are incurred with respect to the reinsured contracts.
Item
Income
Expense
Premiums
$100,000
Death benefits
$25,000
Surrender benefits
5,000
Premium taxes and other expenses
8,000
Total
38,000
(iii) These amounts are net of the outstanding policyholder loans held by L2 of $20,000 with respect to death benefits and $15,000 with respect to surrender benefits.
(iv) Under paragraph (f)(8) of this section, the transferred policyholder loan receivables are treated as an item of consideration under the reinsurance agreement. In determining the parties' net consideration for the agreement, the transferred policyholder loan receivables ($50,000) are treated as an item of consideration incurred by L1 under paragraph (f)(2)(i)(B) of this section. Therefore, for the 1993 taxable year, L1 has net negative consideration of ($375,000). L2 has net positive consideration of $375,000. Under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, L2 includes the $375,000 net positive consideration in its gross amount of premiums and other consideration.
(v) For the 1994 taxable year, L2 has net positive consideration for the reinsurance agreement of $62,000 before adjustment for the transferred policyholder loans. Under paragraph (f)(8) of this section, the amounts taken into account as claim and benefit payments must be adjusted by the amount of any transferred policyholder loan receivables which are netted against the reinsurer's claim and benefit reimbursements. Therefore, L2 takes into account $45,000 ($25,000 + $20,000 = $45,000) as reimbursements for death
benefits, and $20,000 ($5,000 + $15,000 = $20,000) as reimbursements for surrender benefits. After adjustment for these items, L2 has net positive consideration of $27,000, which is determined by subtracting the sum of the amounts charged to L2 ($45,000 + $20,000 + $8,000 = $73,000) from the sum of the amounts credited to L2 ($100,000). L1 has net negative consideration of ($27,000) under the agreement. Under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, L2 includes the $27,000 net positive consideration in its gross amount of premiums and other consideration. The amount of any interest earned on the policyholder loan receivables after their transfer to L2 is treated as investment income earned directly by L2, and is not taken into account as an item of consideration under the agreement.
(g)
Reduction in the amount of net negative consideration to ensure consistency of capitalization for reinsurance agreements
—(1)
In general.
Paragraph (g)(3) of this section provides for a reduction in the amount of net negative consideration that a party to a reinsurance agreement (other than a reinsurance agreement described in paragraph (h)(2) of this section) may take into account in determining net premiums under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section if the party with net positive consideration has a capitalization shortfall (as defined in paragraph (g)(4) of this section). Unless the party with net negative consideration demonstrates that the party with net positive consideration does not have a capitalization shortfall or demonstrates the amount of the other party's capitalization shortfall which is allocable to the reinsurance agreement, the net negative consideration that may be taken into account under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section is zero. However, the reduction of paragraph (g)(3) of this section does not apply to a reinsurance agreement if the parties make a joint election under paragraph (g)(8) of this section. Under the election, the party with net positive consideration capitalizes specified policy acquisition expenses with respect to the agreement without regard to the general deductions limitation of section 848(c)(1).
(2)
Application to reinsurance agreements subject to the interim rules.
In applying this paragraph (g) to a reinsurance agreement that is subject to the interim rules of § 1.848-3, the term “premiums and other consideration incurred for reinsurance under section 848(d)(1)(B)” is substituted for “net negative consideration,” and the term “gross amount of premiums and other consideration under section 848(d)(1)(A)” is substituted for “net positive consideration.” If an insurance company has “premiums and other consideration incurred for reinsurance under section 848(d)(1)(B)” and a “gross amount of premiums and other consideration under section 848(d)(1)(A)” for the same agreement, the net of these amounts is taken into account for purposes of this paragraph (g).
(3)
Amount of reduction.
The reduction required by this paragraph (g)(3) equals the amount obtained by dividing—
(i) The portion of the capitalization shortfall (as defined in paragraph (g)(4) of this section) allocated to the reinsurance agreement under paragraph (g)(7) of this section; by
(ii) The applicable percentage set forth in section 848(c)(1) for the category of specified insurance contracts reinsured by the agreement.
(4)
Capitalization shortfall.
A “capitalization shortfall” equals the excess of—
(i) The sum of the required capitalization amounts (as defined in paragraph (g)(5) of this section) for all reinsurance agreements (other than reinsurance agreements for which an election has been made under paragraph (h)(3) of this section); over
(ii) The general deductions allocated to those reinsurance agreements, as determined under paragraph (g)(6) of this section.
(5)
Required capitalization amount
—(i)
In general.
The “required capitalization amount” for a reinsurance agreement (other than a reinsurance agreement for which an election has been made under paragraph (h)(3) of this section) equals the amount (either positive or negative) obtained by multiplying—
(A) The net positive or negative consideration for an agreement not described in paragraph (h)(2) of this section, and the net positive consideration for an agreement described in paragraph (h)(2) of this section, but for which an election under paragraph (h)(3) of this section has not been made; by
(B) The applicable percentage set forth in section 848(c)(1) for that category of specified insurance contracts.
(ii)
Special rule with respect to net negative consideration.
Solely for purposes of computing a party's required capitalization amount under this paragraph (g)(5)—
(A) If either party to the reinsurance agreement is the direct issuer of the reinsured contracts, the party computing its required capitalization amount takes into account the full amount of any net negative consideration without regard to any potential reduction under paragraph (g)(3) of this section; and
(B) If neither party to the reinsurance agreement is the direct issuer of the reinsured contracts, any net negative consideration is deemed to equal zero in computing a party's required capitalization amount except to the extent that the party with the net negative consideration establishes that the other party to that reinsurance agreement capitalizes the appropriate amount.
(6)
General deductions allocable to reinsurance agreements.
An insurance company's general deductions allocable to its reinsurance agreements equals the excess, if any, of—
(i) The company's general deductions (excluding additional amounts treated as general deductions under paragraph (g)(8) of this section); over
(ii) The amount determined under section 848(c)(1) on specified insurance contracts that the insurance company has issued directly (determined without regard to any reinsurance agreements).
(7)
Allocation of capitalization shortfall among reinsurance agreements.
The capitalization shortfall is allocated to each reinsurance agreement for which the required capitalization amount (as determined in paragraph (g)(5) of this section) is a positive amount. The portion of the capitalization shortfall allocable to each agreement equals the amount which bears the same ratio to the capitalization shortfall as the required capitalization amount for the reinsurance agreement bears to the sum of the positive required capitalization amounts.
(8)
Election to determine specified policy acquisition expenses for an agreement without regard to general deductions limitation
—(i)
In general.
The reduction specified by paragraph (g)(3) of this section does not apply if the parties to a reinsurance agreement make an election under this paragraph (g)(8). The election requires the party with net positive consideration to capitalize specified policy acquisition expenses with respect to the reinsurance agreement without regard to the general deductions limitation of section 848(c)(1). That party must reduce its deductions under section 805 or section 832(c) by the amount, if any, of the party's capitalization shortfall allocable to the reinsurance agreement. The additional capitalized amounts are treated as specified policy acquisition expenses attributable to premiums and other consideration on the reinsurance agreement, and are deductible in accordance with section 848(a)(2).
(ii)
Manner of making election.
To make an election under paragraph (g)(8) of this section, the ceding company and the reinsurer must include an election statement in the reinsurance agreement, either as part of the original terms of the agreement or by an addendum to the agreement. The parties must each attach a schedule to their federal income tax returns which identifies the reinsurance agreement for which the joint election under this paragraph (g)(8) has been made. The schedule must be attached to each of the parties' federal income tax returns filed for the later of—
(A) The first taxable year ending after the election becomes effective; or
(B) The first taxable year ending on or after December 29, 1992.
(iii)
Election statement.
The election statement in the reinsurance agreement must—
(A) Provide that the party with net positive consideration for the reinsurance agreement for each taxable year will capitalize specified policy acquisition expenses with respect to the reinsurance agreement without regard to the general deductions limitation of section 848(a)(1);
(B) Set forth the agreement of the parties to exchange information pertaining to the amount of net consideration under the reinsurance agreement each year to ensure consistency;
(C) Specify the first taxable year for which the election is effective; and
(D) Be signed by both parties.
(iv)
Effect of election.
An election under this paragraph (g)(8) is effective for the first taxable year specified in the election statement and for all subsequent taxable years for which the reinsurance agreement remains in effect. The election may not be revoked without the consent of the Commissioner.
(9)
Example.
The principles of this paragraph (g) are illustrated by the following examples.

# Example 1.
(i) On December 31, 1992, a life insurance company (L1) transfers a block of individual life insurance contracts to an unrelated life insurance company (L2) under an agreement in which L2 becomes solely liable to the policyholders on the reinsured contracts. L1 transfers $105,000 to L2 as consideration for the reinsurance of the contracts.
(ii) L1 and L2 do not make an election under paragraph (g)(8) of this section to capitalize specified policy acquisition expenses with respect to the reinsurance agreement without regard to the general deductions limitation. L2 has no other insurance business, and its general deductions for the taxable year are $3,500.
(iii) Under paragraph (f)(2) of this section, L1's net negative consideration is ($105,000). Under paragraph (f)(3) of this section, L2's net positive consideration is $105,000. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, L2 includes the net positive consideration in its gross amount of premiums and other consideration.
(iv) The required capitalization amount under paragraph (g)(5) of this section for the reinsurance agreement is $8,085 ($105,000 × .077). L2's general deductions, all of which are allocable to the reinsurance agreement with L1, are $3,500. The $4,585 difference between the required capitalization amount ($8,085) and the general deductions allocable to the reinsurance agreement ($3,500) represents L2's capitalization shortfall under paragraph (g)(4) of this section.
(v) Since L2 has a capitalization shortfall allocable to the agreement, the rules of paragraph (g)(1) of this section apply for purposes of determining the amount by which L1 may reduce its net premiums. Under paragraph (g)(3) of this section, L1 must reduce the amount of net negative consideration that it takes into account under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section by $59,545 ($4,585/.077). Thus, of the $105,000 net negative consideration under the reinsurance agreement, L1 may take into account only $45,455 as a reduction of its net premiums.

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as
Example 1,
except that L1 and L2 make the election under paragraph (g)(8) of this section to capitalize specified policy acquisition expenses with respect to the reinsurance agreement without regard to the general deductions limitation. Pursuant to this election, L2 must capitalize as specified policy acquisition expenses an amount equal to $8,085 ($105,000 × .077). L1 may reduce its net premiums by the $105,000 of net negative consideration.

# Example 3.
(i) A life insurance company (L1) is both a direct issuer and a reinsurer of life insurance and annuity contracts. For 1993, L1's net premiums under section 848 (d)(1) for directly issued individual life insurance and annuity contracts are as follows:
Category
Net premiums
Life insurance contracts
$17,000,000
Annuity contracts
8,000,000
(ii) L1's general deductions for 1993 are $1,500,000.
(iii) For 1993, L1 is a reinsurer under four separate indemnity reinsurance agreements with unrelated insurance companies (L2, L3, L4, and L5). The agreements with L2, L3, and L4 cover life insurance contracts issued by those companies. The agreement with L5 covers annuity contracts issued by L5, The parties to the reinsurance agreements have not made the election under paragraph (g)(8) of this section to capitalize specified policy acquisition expenses with respect to these agreements without regard to the general deductions limitation.
(iv) L1's net consideration for 1993 with respect to its reinsurance agreements is as follows:
Agreement
Net consideration
L2
$1,200,000
L3
(350,000)
L4
300,000
L5
600,000
(v) To determine whether a reduction under paragraph (g)(3) of this section applies with respect to these reinsurance agreements, L1 must determine the required capitalization amounts for its reinsurance agreements and the amount of its general deductions allocable to these agreements.
(vi) Pursuant to paragraph (g)(5) of this section, the required capitalization amount for each reinsurance agreement is determined as follows:
L2
$1,200,000 × .077 = $92,400
L3
($350,000) × .077 = ($26,950)
L4
$300,000 × .077 = $23,100
L5
$600,000 × .0175 = $10,500
(vii) Thus, the sum of L1's required capitalization amounts on its reinsurance agreements equals $99,050.
(viii) Pursuant to paragraph (g)(6) of this section, L1 determines its general deductions allocable to its reinsurance agreements. The amount determined under section 848(c)(1) on its directly issued contracts is:
Required capitalization amount
Category:
Annuity contracts
$8,000,000 × .0175 =
$140,000
Life insurance contracts
$17,000,000 × .077 =
1,309,000
$1,449,000
(ix) L1's general deductions allocable to its reinsurance agreements are $51,000 ($1,500,000−$1,449,000).
(x) Pursuant to paragraph (g)(4) of this section, L1's capitalization shortfall equals $48,050, reflecting the excess of L1's required capitalization amounts for its reinsurance agreements ($99,050) over the general deductions allocable to its reinsurance agreements ($51,000).
(xi) Pursuant to paragraph (g)(7) of this section, the capitalization shortfall of $48,050 must be allocated between each of L1's reinsurance agreements with net positive consideration in proportion to their respective required capitalization amounts. The allocation of the shortfall between L1's reinsurance agreements is determined as follows:
L2 = $35,237 ($48,050 × 92,400 / 126,000)
L4 = $8,809 ($48,050 × 23,100 / 126,000)
L5 = $4,004 ($48,050 × 10,500 / 126,000)
(xii) Accordingly, the reduction under paragraph (g)(3) of this section that applies to the amount of net negative consideration that may be taken into account by L2, L4, and L5 under paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(B) of this section is determined as follows:
L2 = $457,623 ($35,237/.077)
L4 = $114,403 ($8,809/.077)
L5 = $228,800 ($4,004/.0175)

# Example 4.
The facts are the same as
Example 3,
except that L1 and L4 make a joint election under paragraph (g)(8) of this section to capitalize specified policy acquisition expenses with respect to the reinsurance agreement without regard to the general deductions limitation. Pursuant to this election, L1 must reduce its deductions under section 805 by an amount equal to the capitalization shortfall allocable to the reinsurance agreement with L4 ($8,809). L1 treats the additional capitalized amounts as specified policy acquisition expenses allocable to premiums and other consideration under the agreement. L4 may reduce its net premiums by the $300,000 net negative consideration. The election by L1 and L4 does not change the amount of the capitalization shortfall allocable under paragraph (g)(7) of this section to the reinsurance agreements with L2 and L5. Thus, the reduction required by paragraph (g)(3) of this section with respect to the amount of the net negative consideration that L2 and L5 may recognize under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section is $457,623 and $228,800, respectively.
(h)
Treatment of reinsurance agreements with parties not subject to U.S. taxation
—(1)
In general.
Unless an election under paragraph (h)(3) of this section is made, an insurance company may not reduce its net premiums by the net negative consideration for the taxable year (or, with respect to a reinsurance agreement that is subject to the interim rules of § 1.848-3, by the premiums and other consideration incurred for reinsurance) under a reinsurance agreement to which this paragraph (h) applies.
(2)
Agreements to which this paragraph (h) applies
—(i)
In general.
This paragraph (h) applies to a reinsurance agreement if, with respect to the premiums and other consideration under the agreement, one party to that agreement is subject to United States taxation and the other party is not.
(ii)
Parties subject to U.S. taxation
—(A)
In general.
A party is subject to United States taxation for this purpose if the party is subject to United States taxation either directly under the provisions of subchapter L of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code (subchapter L), or indirectly under the provisions of subpart F of part III of subchapter N of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code (subpart F).
(B)
Effect of a closing agreement.
If a reinsurer agrees in a closing agreement with the Internal Revenue Service to be subject to tax under rules equivalent to the provisions of subchapter L on its premiums and other consideration from reinsurance agreements with parties subject to United States taxation, the reinsurer is treated as an insurance company subject to tax under subchapter L.
(3)
Election to separately determine the amounts required to be capitalized for reinsurance agreements with parties not subject to U.S. taxation
—(i)
In general.
This paragraph (h)(3) authorizes an insurance company to make an election to separately determine the amounts required to be capitalized for the taxable year with respect to reinsurance
agreements with parties that are not subject to United States taxation. If this election is made, an insurance company separately determines a net foreign capitalization amount for the taxable year for all reinsurance agreements to which this paragraph (h) applies.
(ii)
Manner of making the election.
An insurance company makes the election authorized by this paragraph (h)(3) by attaching an election statement to the federal income tax return (including an amended return) for the taxable year for which the election becomes effective. The election applies to that taxable year and all subsequent taxable years unless permission to revoke the election is obtained from the Commissioner.
(4)
Amount taken into account for purposes of determining specified policy acquisition expenses.
If for a taxable year an insurance company has a net positive foreign capitalization amount (as defined in paragraph (h)(5)(i) of this section), any portion of that amount remaining after the reduction described in paragraph (h)(7) of this section is treated as additional specified policy acquisition expenses for the taxable year (determined without regard to amounts taken into account under this paragraph (h)). A net positive capitalization amount is treated as an amount otherwise required to be capitalized for the taxable year for purposes of the reduction under section 848(f)(1)(A).
(5)
Net foreign capitalization amount
—(i)
In general.
An insurance company's net foreign capitalization amount equals the sum of the foreign capitalization amounts (netting positive and negative amounts) determined under paragraph (h)(5)(ii) of this section for each category of specified insurance contracts reinsured by agreements described in paragraph (h)(2) of this section. If the amount is less than zero, the company has a net negative foreign capitalization amount. If the amount is greater than zero, the company has a net positive foreign capitalization amount.
(ii)
Foreign capitalization amounts by category.
The foreign capitalization amount for a category of specified insurance contracts is determined by—
(A) Combining the net positive consideration and the net negative consideration for the taxable year (or, with respect to a reinsurance agreement that is subject to the interim rules of § 1.848-3, by combining the gross amount of premiums and other consideration and the premiums and other consideration incurred for reinsurance) for all agreements described in paragraph (h)(2) of this section which reinsure specified insurance contracts in that category; and
(B) Multiplying the result (either positive or negative) by the percentage for that category specified in section 848(c)(1).
(6)
Treatment of net negative foreign capitalization amount
—(i)
Applied as a reduction to previously capitalized amounts.
If for a taxable year an insurance company has a net negative foreign capitalization amount, the negative amount reduces (but not below zero) the unamortized balances of the amounts previously capitalized (beginning with the amount capitalized for the most recent taxable year) to the extent attributable to prior years' net positive foreign capitalization amounts. The amount by which previously capitalized amounts is reduced is allowed as a deduction for the taxable year.
(ii)
Carryover of remaining net negative foreign capitalization amount.
The net negative foreign capitalization amount, if any, remaining after the reduction described in paragraph (h)(6)(i) of this section is carried over to reduce a future net positive capitalization amount. The remaining net negative foreign capitalization amount may only offset a net positive foreign capitalization amount in a future year, and may not be used to reduce the amounts otherwise required to be capitalized under section 848(a) for the taxable year, or to reduce the unamortized balances of specified policy acquisition expenses from preceding taxable years, with respect to directly written business or reinsurance agreements other than agreements for which the election under paragraph (h)(3) of this section has been made.
(7)
Reduction of net positive foreign capitalization amount by carryover
amounts allowed.
If for a taxable year an insurance company has a net positive foreign capitalization amount, that amount is reduced (but not below zero) by any carryover of net negative foreign capitalization amounts from preceding taxable years. Any remaining net positive foreign capitalization amount is taken into account as provided in paragraph (h)(4) of this section.
(8)
Examples.
The principles of this paragraph (h) are illustrated by the following examples.

# Example 1.
(i) On January 1, 1993, a life insurance company (L1) enters into a reinsurance agreement with a foreign corporation (X) covering a block of annuity contracts issued to residents of the United States. X is not subject to taxation either directly under subchapter L or indirectly under subpart F on the premiums for the reinsurance agreement with L1. L1 makes the election under paragraph (h)(3) of this section to separately determine the amounts required to be capitalized for the taxable year with respect to parties not subject to United States taxation.
(ii) For the taxable year ended December 31, 1993, L1 has net negative consideration of ($25,000) under its reinsurance agreement with X. L1 has no other reinsurance agreements with parties not subject to United States taxation.
(iii) Under paragraph (h)(5) of this section, L1's net negative foreign capitalization amount for the 1993 taxable year equals ($437.50), which is determined by multiplying L1's net negative consideration on the agreement with X ($25,000) by the percentage in section 848(c)(1) for the reinsured specified insurance contracts (1.75%). Under paragraph (h)(6)(ii) of this section, L1 carries over the net negative foreign capitalization amount of $437.50) to future taxable years. The net negative foreign capitalization amount may not be used to reduce the amounts which L1 is required to capitalize on directly written business or reinsurance agreements other than those agreements described in paragraph (h)(2) of this section.

# Example 2.
(i) The facts are the same as
Example 1
except that L1 terminates its reinsurance agreement with X and receives $35,000 on December 31, 1994. For the 1994 taxable year, L1 has net positive consideration of $35,000 under its agreement with X. L1 has no other reinsurance agreements with parties not subject to United States taxation.
(ii) Under paragraph (h)(5) of this section, L1's net positive net foreign capitalization amount for the 1984 taxable year equals $612.50, which is determined by multiplying the net positive consideration on the agreement with X ($35,000) by the percentage in section 848(c)(1) for the reinsured specified insurance contracts (1.75%). Under paragraph (h)(4) of this section, L1 reduces the net positive foreign capitalization amount for the taxable year by the net negative foreign capitalization amount carried over from preceding taxable years ($437.50). After this reduction, L1 includes $175 ($612.50-$437.50) as specified policy acquisition expenses for the 1994 taxable year.
(i)
Carryover of excess negative capitalization amount
—(1)
In general.
This paragraph (i) authorizes a carryover of an excess negative capitalization amount (as defined in paragraph (i)(2) of this section) to reduce amounts otherwise required to be capitalized under section 848. Paragraph (i)(4) provides special rules for the treatment of excess negative capitalization amounts of insolvent insurance companies.
(2)
Excess negative capitalization amount.
The excess negative capitalization amount with respect to a category of specified insurance contracts for a taxable year is equal to the excess of—
(A) The negative capitalization amount with respect to that category; over
(B) The amount that can be utilized under section 848(f)(1).
(3)
Treatment of excess negative capitalization amount.
The excess negative capitalization amount for a taxable year reduces the amounts that are otherwise required to be capitalized by an insurance company under section 848(c)(1) for future years.
(4)
Special rule for the treatment of an excess negative capitalization amount of an insolvent company
—(i)
When applicable.
This paragraph (i)(4) applies only for the taxable year in which an insolvent insurance company has an excess negative capitalization amount and has net negative consideration under a reinsurance agreement. See paragraph (i)(4)(v) of this section for the definition of “insolvent.”
(ii)
Election to forego carryover of excess negative capitalization amount.
At the joint election of the insolvent insurance company and the other party to the reinsurance agreement—
(A) The insolvent insurance company reduces the excess negative capitalization amount which would otherwise be carried over under paragraph (i)(1) of this section by the amount determined
under paragraph (i)(4)(iii) of this section; and
(B) The other party reduces the amount of its specified policy acquisition expenses for the taxable year by the amount determined under paragraph (i)(4)(iii) of this section.
(iii)
Amount of reduction to the excess negative capitalization amount and specified policy acquisition expenses.
To determine the reduction to the carryover of an insolvent insurance company's excess negative capitalization amount and the specified policy acquisition expenses of the other party with respect to a reinsurance agreement—
(A) Multiply the net negative consideration for each reinsurance agreement of the insolvent insurer for which there is net negative consideration for the taxable year by the appropriate percentage specified in section 848(c)(1) for the category of specified insurance contracts reinsured by the agreement;
(B) Sum the results for each agreement;
(C) Calculate the ratio between the results in paragraphs (i)(4)(iii) (A) and (B) of this section for each agreement; and
(D) Multiply that result by the increase in the excess negative capitalization amount of the insolvent insurer for the taxable year.
(iv)
Manner of making election.
To make an election under paragraph (i)(4) of this section, each party to the reinsurance agreement must attach an election statement to its federal income tax return (including an amended return) for the taxable year for which the election is effective. The election statement must identify the reinsurance agreement for which the joint election under this paragraph (i)(4) has been made, state the amount of the reduction to the insolvent insurance company's excess negative capitalization amount that is attributable to the agreement, and be signed by both parties. An election under this paragraph (i)(4) is effective for the taxable year specified in the election statement, and may not be revoked without the consent of the Commissioner.
(v)
Presumptions relating to the insolvency of an insurance company undergoing a court supervised rehabilitation or similar state proceeding.
For purposes of this paragraph (i)(4), an insurance company which is undergoing a rehabilitation, conservatorship, or similar state proceeding shall be presumed to be insolvent if the state proceeding results in—
(A) An order of the state court finding that the fair market value of the insurance company's assets is less than its liabilities;
(B) The use of funds, guarantees, or reinsurance from a guaranty association;
(C) A reduction of the policyholders' available account balances; or
(D) A substantial limitation on access to funds (for example, a partial or total moratorium on policyholder withdrawals or surrenders that applies for a period of 5 years).
(vi)
Example.
The principles of this paragraph (i)(4) are illustrated by the following example.

# Example.
(i) An insurance company (L1) is the subject of a rehabilitation proceeding under the supervision of a state court. The state court has made a finding that the fair market value of L1's assets is less than its liabilities. On December 31, 1993, L1 transfers a block of individual life insurance contracts to an unrelated insurance company (L2) under an assumption reinsurance agreement whereby L2 becomes solely liable to the policyholders under the contracts reinsured. Under the agreement, L1 agrees to pay L2 $2,000,000 for assuming the life insurance contracts. This negative net consideration causes L1 to incur an excess negative capitalization amount of $138,600 for the 1993 taxable year. L1 has no other reinsurance agreements for the taxable year.
(ii) As part of the reinsurance agreement, L1 and L2 agree to make an election under paragraph (i)(4) of this section. Under the election, L1 agrees to forgo the carryover of the $138,600 excess negative capitalization amount for future taxable years. L2 must include the $2,000,000 net positive consideration for the reinsurance agreement in its gross amount of premiums and other consideration. L2 reduces its specified policy acquisition expenses for the 1993 taxable year by $138,600.
(j)
Ceding commissions with respect to reinsurance of contracts other than specified insurance contracts.
A ceding commission incurred with respect to the reinsurance of an insurance contract that is not a specified insurance contract is not subject to the provisions of section 848(g).
(k)
Effective dates
—(1)
In general.
Unless otherwise specified in this paragraph, the rules of this section are effective for the taxable years of an insurance company beginning after November 14, 1991.
(2)
Reduction in the amount of net negative consideration to ensure consistency of capitalization for reinsurance agreements.
Section 1.848-2(g) (which provides for an adjustment to ensure consistency) is effective for—
(i) All amounts arising under any reinsurance agreement entered into after November 14, 1991; and
(ii) All amounts arising under any reinsurance agreement for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1991, without regard to the date on which the reinsurance agreement was entered into.
(3)
Net consideration rules.
Section 1.848-2(f) (which provides rules for determining the net consideration for a reinsurance agreement) applies to—
(i) Amounts arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1991, under a reinsurance agreement entered into after November 14, 1991; and
(ii) Amounts arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1994, under a reinsurance agreement entered into before November 15, 1991.
(4)
Determination of the date on which a reinsurance agreement is entered into.
A reinsurance agreement is considered entered into at the earlier of—
(i) The date of the reinsurance agreement; or
(ii) The date of a binding written agreement to enter into a reinsurance transaction if the written agreement evidences the parties' agreement on substantially all material items relating to the reinsurance transaction.
(5)
Special rule for certain reinsurance agreements with parties not subject to U.S. taxation.
The election and special rules in paragraph (h) of this section relating to the determination of amounts required to be capitalized on reinsurance agreements with parties not subject to United States taxation apply to taxable years ending on or after September 30, 1990.
(6)
Carryover of excess negative capitalization amount.
The provisions of paragraph (i) of this section, including the special rule for the treatment of excess negative capitalization amounts of insolvent insurance companies, are affected with respect to amounts arising in taxable years ending on or after September 30, 1990.
[T.D. 8456, 57 FR 61821, Dec. 29, 1992; 58 FR 7987, Feb. 11, 1993; 59 FR 947, Jan. 7, 1994]
§ 1.848-3
Interim rules for certain reinsurance agreements.
(a)
Scope and effective dates.
The rules of this section apply in determining net premiums for a reinsurance agreement with respect to—
(1) Amounts arising in taxable years beginning before January 1, 1992, under a reinsurance agreement entered into after November 14, 1991; and
(2) Amounts arising in taxable years beginning before January 1, 1995, under a reinsurance agreement entered into before November 15, 1991.
(b)
Interim rules.
In determining a company's gross amount of premiums and other consideration under section 848(d)(1)(A) and premiums and other consideration incurred for reinsurance under section 848(d)(1)(B), the general rules of subchapter L of the Internal Revenue Code apply with the adjustments and special rules set forth in paragraph (c) of this section. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(5) of this section (which applies to modified coinsurance transactions), the gross amount of premiums and other consideration is determined without any reduction for ceding commissions, annual allowances, reimbursements of claims and benefits, or other amounts incurred by a reinsurer with respect to reinsured contracts.
(c)
Adjustment and special rules.
This paragraph sets forth certain adjustments and special rules that apply for reinsurance agreements in determining the gross amount of premiums and other consideration under section 848(d)(1)(A) and premiums and other considerations incurred for reinsurance under section 848(d)(1)(B).
(1)
Assumption reinsurance.
The ceding company must treat the gross amount of consideration incurred with respect to an assumption reinsurance agreement as premiums and other consideration incurred for reinsurance under section 848(d)(1)(B). The reinsurance must include the same amount in the
gross amount of premiums and other consideration under section 848(d)(1)(A). For rules relating to the determination and treatment of ceding commissions, see paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
(2)
Reimbursable dividends.
The reinsurer must treat the amount of policyholder dividends reimbursable to the ceding company (other than under a modified coinsurance agreement covered by paragraph (c)(5) of this section) as a return premium under section 848(d)(1)(B). The ceding company must include the same amount in the gross amount of premiums and other consideration under section 848(d)(1)(A). The amount of any experience-related refund due the ceding company is treated as a policyholder dividend reimbursable to the ceding company.
(3)
Ceding commissions
—(i)
In general.
The reinsurer must treat ceding commissions as a general deduction. The ceding company must treat ceding commissions as non-premium related income under section 803(a)(3). The ceding company may not reduce its general deductions by the amount of the ceding commission.
(ii)
Amount of ceding commission.
For purposes of this section, the amount of a ceding commission equals the excess, if any, of—
(A) The increase in the reinsurer's tax reserves resulting from the reinsurance agreement (computed in accordance with section 807(d)); over
(B) The gross consideration incurred by the ceding company for the reinsurance agreement, less any amount incurred by the reinsurer as part of the reinsurance agreement.
(4)
Termination payments.
The reinsurer must treat the gross amount of premiums and other consideration payable as a termination payment to the ceding company (including the tax reserves on the reinsured contracts) as premiums and other consideration incurred for reinsurance under section 848(d)(1)(B). The ceding company must include the same amount in the gross amount of premiums and other consideration under section 848(d)(1)(A). This paragraph does not apply to modified coinsurance agreements.
(5)
Modified coinsurance agreements.
In the case of a modified coinsurance agreement, the parties must determine their net premiums on a net consideration basis as described in § 1.848-2(f)(5).
(D)
Examples.
The principles of this section are illustrated by the following examples.

# Example 1.
On July 1, 1991, an insurance company (L1) transfers a block of individual life insurance contracts to an unrelated insurance company (L2) under an arrangement whereby L2 becomes solely liable to the policy holder under the contracts reinsured. The tax reserves on the reinsured contracts are $100,000. Under the assumption reinsurance agreement, L1 pays L2 $83,000 for assuming the life insurance contracts. Under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, since the increase in L2's tax reserves ($100,000) exceeds the net consideration transferred by L1 ($83,000), the reinsurance agreement provides for a ceding commission. The ceding commission equals $17,000 ($100,000-$83,000). Under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, L1 reduces its gross amount of premiums and other consideration for the 1991 taxable year under section 848(d)(1)(B) by the $100,000 premium incurred for reinsurance, and L2 includes the $100,000 premium for reinsurance in its gross amount of premiums and other consideration under section 848(d)(1)(A). L1 treats the $17,000 ceding commission as non-premium related income and section 803 (a)(3).

# Example 2.
On July 1, 1991, a life insurance company (L1) transfers a block of individual life insurance contracts to an unrelated insurance company (L2) under an arrangement whereby L2 becomes solely liable to the policyholder under the contracts reinsured. The tax reserves on the reinsured contracts are $100,000. Under the assumption reinsurance agreement, L1 pays L2 $100,000 for assuming the contracts, and L2 pays L1 a $17,000 ceding commission. Under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, L1 reduces its gross amount of premiums and other consideration under section 848(d)(1)(B) by $100,000. L2 includes $100,000 in its gross amount of premiums and other consideration under section 848(d)(1)(A). Under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, since the increase in L2's tax reserves ($100,000) exceeds the net consideration transferred by L1, the reinsurance agreement provides for a ceding commission. The ceding commission equals $17,000 ($100,000 increase in L2's tax reserves less $83,000 net consideration transferred by L1). L1 treats the $17,000 ceding commission as non-premium related income under section 803(a)(3).

# Example 3.
On July 1, 1991, a life insurance company (L1) transfers a block of individual life insurance contracts to an unrelated insurance company (L2) under an arrangement whereby L2 becomes solely liable to the policyholder under the contracts reinsured.
Under the assumption reinsurance agreement, L1 transfers assets of $105,000 to L2. The tax reserves on the reinsured contracts are $100,000. Under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, L1 reduces its gross amount of premiums and other consideration under section 848(d)(1)(B) by $105,000, and L2 increases its gross amount of premiums and other consideration under section 848(d)(1)(A) by $105,000. Since the net consideration transferred by L1 exceeds the increase in L2's tax reserves, there is no ceding commission under paragraph (c)(3) of this section.

# Example 4.
(i) On June 30, 1991, a life insurance company (L1) reinsures 40% of certain individual life insurance contracts to be issued after that date with an unrelated insurance company (L2) under an agreement whereby L1 remains directly liable to the policyholders with respect to the contracts reinsured. The agreement provides that L2 is credited with 40% of any premiums received with respect to the reinsured contracts, but must indemnify L1 for 40% of any claims, expenses, and policyholder dividends. During the period from July 1 through December 31, 1991, L1 has the following income and expense items with respect to the reinsured policies:
Item
Income
Expense
Premiums
$8,000
Benefits paid
$1,000
Commissions
6,000
Policyholder dividends
500
Total
7,500
(ii) Under paragraphs (b) and (c)(2) of this section, L1 includes $8,200 in its gross amount of premiums and other consideration under section 848(d)(1)(A) ($8,000 gross premiums on the reinsured contracts plus $200 of policyholder dividends reimbursed by L2 ($500 × 40%). L1 reduces its gross amount of premiums and other consideration by $3,200 (40% × $8,000) as premiums and other consideration incurred for reinsurance under section 848(d)(1)(B). The benefits and commissions incurred by L1 with respect to the reinsured contracts do not reduce L1's gross amount of premiums and other consideration under section 848(d)(1)(B). L2 includes $3,200 in its gross amount of premiums and other consideration (40% × $8,000) and is treated as having paid return premiums of $200 (the amount of reimbursable dividends paid to L1). L2 is also treated as having incurred the following expenses with respect to the reinsured contracts: $400 as benefits paid (40% × $1,000) and $2,400 as commissions expense (40% × $6,000). Under paragraph (b) of this section, these expenses do not reduce L2's gross amount of premiums and other consideration under section 848(d)(1)(A).

# Example 5.
On December 31, 1991, an insurance company (L1) terminates a reinsurance agreement with an unrelated insurance company (L2). The termination applies to a reinsurance agreement under which L1 had ceded 40% of its liability on a block of individual life insurance contracts to L2. Upon termination of the reinsurance agreement, L2 makes a final payment of $116,000 to L1 for assuming full liability under the contracts. The tax reserves attributable to L2's portion of the reinsured contracts are $120,000. Under paragraph (c)(4) of this section, L2 reduces its gross amount of premiums and other consideration under section 848(d)(1)(B) by $120,000. L1 includes $120,000 in its gross amount of premiums and other consideration under section 848(d)(1)(A).

# Example 6.
(i) On June 30, 1991, an insurance company (L1) reinsures 40% of its existing life insurance contracts with an unrelated life insurance company (L2) under a modified coinsurance agreement. For the period July 1, 1991 through December 31, 1991, L1 reports the following income and expense items with respect to L2's 40% share of the reinsured contracts:
Item
Income
Expense
Premiums
$10,000
Benefits paid
$4,000
Policyholder dividends
500
Reserve adjustment
1,500
Total
6,000
(ii) Pursuant to paragraph (c)(5) of this section, L1 reduces its gross amount of premiums and other consideration under section 848(d)(1)(B) by the $4,000 net consideration for the modified coinsurance agreement ($10,000-$6,000). L2 includes the $4,000 net consideration in its gross amount of premiums and other consideration under section 848(d)(1)(A).
