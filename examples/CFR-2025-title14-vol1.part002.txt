In addition to the landing loads in paragraph (a) of this section, each auxiliary or emergency float, or its support and attaching structure in the airframe or fuselage, must be designed for the load developed by a fully immersed float unless it can be shown that full immersion is unlikely. If full immersion is unlikely, the highest likely float buoyancy load must be applied. The highest likely buoyancy load must include consideration of a partially immersed float creating restoring moments to compensate the upsetting moments caused by side wind, unsymmetrical rotorcraft loading, water wave action, rotorcraft inertia, and probable structural damage and leakage considered under § 29.801(d). Maximum roll and pitch angles determined from compliance with § 29.801(d) may be used, if significant, to determine the extent of immersion of each float. If the floats are deployed in flight, appropriate air loads derived from the flight limitations with the floats deployed shall be used in substantiation of the floats and their attachment to the rotorcraft. For this purpose, the design airspeed for limit load is the float deployed airspeed operating limit multiplied by 1.11.
(2)
Floats deployed after initial water contact.
Each float must be designed for full or partial immersion prescribed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. In addition, each float must be designed for combined vertical and drag loads using a relative limit speed of 20 knots between the rotorcraft and the water. The vertical load may not be less than
the highest likely buoyancy load determined under paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

(6) Analyses supported by test evidence and, if available, service experience.
(f) A residual strength determination is required that substantiates the maximum damage size assumed in the fatigue tolerance evaluation. In determining inspection intervals based on damage growth, the residual strength evaluation must show that the remaining structure, after damage growth, is able to withstand design limit loads without failure.
(g) The effect of damage on stiffness, dynamic behavior, loads, and functional performance must be considered.
(h) Based on the requirements of this section, inspections and retirement times or approved equivalent means must be established to avoid catastrophic failure. The inspections and retirement times or approved equivalent means must be included in the Airworthiness Limitations Section of the Instructions for Continued Airworthiness required by Section 29.1529 and Section A29.4 of Appendix A of this part.
(i) If inspections for any of the damage types identified in paragraph (e)(4) of this section cannot be established within the limitations of geometry, inspectability, or good design practice,

is an assessment that specifies the locations, types, and sizes of damage, considering fatigue, environmental effects, intrinsic and discrete flaws, and impact or other accidental damage (including the discrete source of the accidental damage) that may occur during manufacture or operation.
(d) Damage Tolerance Evaluation:
(1) Each applicant must show that catastrophic failure due to static and fatigue loads, considering the intrinsic or discrete manufacturing defects or accidental damage, is avoided throughout the operational life or prescribed inspection intervals of the rotorcraft by performing damage tolerance evaluations of the strength of composite PSEs and other parts, detail design points, and fabrication techniques. Each applicant must account for the effects of material and process variability along with environmental conditions in the strength and fatigue evaluations. Each applicant must evaluate parts that include PSEs of the airframe, main and tail rotor drive systems, main and tail rotor blades and hubs, rotor controls, fixed and movable control surfaces, engine and transmission mountings, landing gear, other parts, detail design points, and fabrication techniques deemed critical by the FAA. Each damage tolerance evaluation must include:
(i) The identification of all PSEs;
(ii) In-flight and ground measurements for determining the loads or stresses for all PSEs for all critical conditions throughout the range of limits in § 29.309 (including altitude effects), except that maneuvering load factors need not exceed the maximum values expected in service;
(iii) The loading spectra as severe as those expected in service based on loads or stresses determined under paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, including external load operations, if applicable, and other operations including high-torque events;
(iv) A threat assessment for all PSEs that specifies the locations, types, and sizes of damage, considering fatigue, environmental effects, intrinsic and discrete flaws, and impact or other accidental damage (including the discrete source of the accidental damage) that may occur during manufacture or operation; and
(v) An assessment of the residual strength and fatigue characteristics of all PSEs that supports the replacement times and inspection intervals established under paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
(2) Each applicant must establish replacement times, inspections, or other procedures for all PSEs to require the repair or replacement of damaged parts before a catastrophic failure. These replacement times, inspections, or other procedures must be included in the Airworthiness Limitations Section of the Instructions for Continued Airworthiness required by § 29.1529.
(i) Replacement times for PSEs must be determined by tests, or by analysis supported by tests, and must show that the structure is able to withstand the repeated loads of variable magnitude expected in-service. In establishing these replacement times, the following items must be considered:
(A) Damage identified in the threat assessment required by paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section;
(B) Maximum acceptable manufacturing defects and in-service damage (
i.e.
, those that do not lower the residual strength below ultimate design loads and those that can be repaired to restore ultimate strength); and
(C) Ultimate load strength capability after applying repeated loads.
(ii) Inspection intervals for PSEs must be established to reveal any damage identified in the threat assessment required by paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section that may occur from fatigue or other in-service causes before such damage has grown to the extent that the component cannot sustain the required residual strength capability. In establishing these inspection intervals, the following items must be considered:
(A) The growth rate, including no-growth, of the damage under the repeated loads expected in-service determined by tests or analysis supported by tests;
(B) The required residual strength for the assumed damage established after considering the damage type, inspection interval, detectability of damage, and the techniques adopted for damage detection. The minimum required residual strength is limit load; and
(C) Whether the inspection will detect the damage growth before the minimum residual strength is reached and restored to ultimate load capability, or whether the component will require replacement.
(3) Each applicant must consider the effects of damage on stiffness, dynamic behavior, loads, and functional performance on all PSEs when substantiating the maximum assumed damage size and inspection interval.
(e) Fatigue Evaluation: If an applicant establishes that the damage tolerance evaluation described in paragraph (d) of this section is impractical within the limits of geometry, inspectability, or good design practice, the applicant must do a fatigue evaluation of the particular composite rotorcraft structure and:
(1) Identify all PSEs considered in the fatigue evaluation;
(2) Identify the types of damage for all PSEs considered in the fatigue evaluation;
(3) Establish supplemental procedures to minimize the risk of catastrophic failure associated with the damages identified in paragraph (d) of this section; and
(4) Include these supplemental procedures in the Airworthiness Limitations section of the Instructions for Continued Airworthiness required by § 29.1529.

(c) The probable behavior of the rotorcraft in a water landing must be investigated by model tests or by comparison with rotorcraft of similar configuration for which the ditching characteristics are known. Scoops, flaps, projections, and any other factors likely to affect the hydrodynamic characteristics of the rotorcraft must be considered.
(d) It must be shown that, under reasonably probable water conditions, the flotation time and trim of the rotorcraft will allow the occupants to leave the rotorcraft and enter the liferafts required by § 29.1415. If compliance with this provision is shown by bouyancy and trim computations, appropriate allowances must be made for probable structural damage and leakage. If the rotorcraft has fuel tanks (with fuel jettisoning provisions) that can reasonably be expected to withstand a ditching without leakage, the jettisonable volume of fuel may be considered as bouyancy volume.

(1)
Type I.
This type must have a rectangular opening of not less than 24 inches wide by 48 inches high, with corner radii not greater than one-third the width of the exit, in the passenger area in the side of the fuselage at floor level and as far away as practicable from areas that might become potential fire hazards in a crash.
(2)
Type II.
This type is the same as Type I, except that the opening must be at least 20 inches wide by 44 inches high.
(3)
Type III.
This type is the same as Type I, except that—
(i) The opening must be at least 20 inches wide by 36 inches high; and
(ii) The exits need not be at floor level.
(4)
Type IV.
This type must have a rectangular opening of not less than 19 inches wide by 26 inches high, with corner radii not greater than one-third the width of the exit, in the side of the fuselage with a step-up inside the rotorcraft of not more than 29 inches.
Openings with dimensions larger than those specified in this section may be used, regardless of shape, if the base of the opening has a flat surface of not less than the specified width.
(b)
Passenger emergency exits; side-of-fuselage.
Emergency exits must be accessible to the passengers and, except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, must be provided in accordance with the following table:

§ 29.923
Rotor drive system and control mechanism tests.
(a)
Endurance tests, general.
Each rotor drive system and rotor control mechanism must be tested, as prescribed in paragraphs (b) through (n) and (p) of this section, for at least 200 hours plus the time required to meet the requirements of paragraphs (b)(2), (b)(3), and (k) of this section. These tests must be conducted as follows:
(1) Ten-hour test cycles must be used, except that the test cycle must be extended to include the OEI test of paragraphs (b)(2) and (k), of this section if OEI ratings are requested.
(2) The tests must be conducted on the rotorcraft.

The takeoff run must be conducted as follows:
(1) Except as prescribed in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section, the takeoff torque run must consist of 1 hour of alternate runs of 5 minutes at takeoff torque and the maximum speed for use with takeoff torque, and 5 minutes at as low an engine idle speed as
practicable. The engine must be declutched from the rotor drive system, and the rotor brake, if furnished and so intended, must be applied during the first minute of the idle run. During the remaining 4 minutes of the idle run, the clutch must be engaged so that the engine drives the rotors at the minimum practical r.p.m. The engine and the rotor drive system must be accelerated at the maximum rate. When declutching the engine, it must be decelerated rapidly enough to allow the operation of the overrunning clutch.
(2) For helicopters for which the use of a 2
1/2
-minute OEI rating is requested, the takeoff run must be conducted as prescribed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, except for the third and sixth runs for which the takeoff torque and the maximum speed for use with takeoff torque are prescribed in that paragraph. For these runs, the following apply:
(i) Each run must consist of at least one period of 2
1/2
minutes with takeoff torque and the maximum speed for use with takeoff torque on all engines.
(ii) Each run must consist of at least one period, for each engine in sequence, during which that engine simulates a power failure and the remaining engines are run at the 2
1/2
-minute OEI torque and the maximum speed for use with 2
1/2
-minute OEI torque for 2
1/2
minutes.
(3) For multiengine, turbine-powered rotorcraft for which the use of 30-second/2-minute OEI power is requested, the takeoff run must be conducted as prescribed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section except for the following:
(i) Immediately following any one 5-minute power-on run required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section, simulate a failure for each power source in turn, and apply the maximum torque and the maximum speed for use with 30-second OEI power to the remaining affected drive system power inputs for not less than 30 seconds. Each application of 30-second OEI power must be followed by two applications of the maximum torque and the maximum speed for use with the 2 minute OEI power for not less than 2 minutes each; the second application must follow a period at stabilized continuous or 30 minute OEI power (whichever is requested by the applicant). At least one run sequence must be conducted from a simulated “flight idle” condition. When conducted on a bench test, the test sequence must be conducted following stabilization at take-off power.
(ii) For the purpose of this paragraph, an affected power input includes all parts of the rotor drive system which can be adversely affected by the application of higher or asymmetric torque and speed prescribed by the test.
(iii) This test may be conducted on a representative bench test facility when engine limitations either preclude repeated use of this power or would result in premature engine removals during the test. The loads, the vibration frequency, and the methods of application to the affected rotor drive system components must be representative of rotorcraft conditions. Test components must be those used to show compliance with the remainder of this section.
(c)
Endurance tests; maximum continuous run.
Three hours of continuous operation at maximum continuous torque and the maximum speed for use with maximum continuous torque must be conducted as follows:
(1) The main rotor controls must be operated at a minimum of 15 times each hour through the main rotor pitch positions of maximum vertical thrust, maximum forward thrust component, maximum aft thrust component, maximum left thrust component, and maximum right thrust component, except that the control movements need not produce loads or blade flapping motion exceeding the maximum loads of motions encountered in flight.
(2) The directional controls must be operated at a minimum of 15 times each hour through the control extremes of maximum right turning torque, neutral torque as required by the power applied to the main rotor, and maximum left turning torque.
(3) Each maximum control position must be held for at least 10 seconds, and the rate of change of control position must be at least as rapid as that for normal operation.
(d)
Endurance tests; 90 percent of maximum continuous run.
One hour of continuous operation at 90 percent of maximum continuous torque and the maximum speed for use with 90 percent of maximum continuous torque must be conducted.

Endurance tests; 80 percent of maximum continuous run.
One hour of continuous operation at 80 percent of maximum continuous torque and the minimum speed for use with 80 percent of maximum continuous torque must be conducted.
(f)
Endurance tests; 60 percent of maximum continuous run.
Two hours or, for helicopters for which the use of either 30-minute OEI power or continuous OEI power is requested, 1 hour of continuous operation at 60 percent of maximum continuous torque and the minimum speed for use with 60 percent of maximum continuous torque must be conducted.
(g)
Endurance tests; engine malfunctioning run.
It must be determined whether malfunctioning of components, such as the engine fuel or ignition systems, or whether unequal engine power can cause dynamic conditions detrimental to the drive system. If so, a suitable number of hours of operation must be accomplished under those conditions, 1 hour of which must be included in each cycle, and the remaining hours of which must be accomplished at the end of the 20 cycles. If no detrimental condition results, an additional hour of operation in compliance with paragraph (b) of this section must be conducted in accordance with the run schedule of paragraph (b)(1) of this section without consideration of paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
(h)
Endurance tests; overspeed run.
One hour of continuous operation must be conducted at maximum continuous torque and the maximum power-on overspeed expected in service, assuming that speed and torque limiting devices, if any, function properly.
(i)
Endurance tests; rotor control positions.
When the rotor controls are not being cycled during the tie-down tests, the rotor must be operated, using the procedures prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section, to produce each of the maximum thrust positions for the following percentages of test time (except that the control positions need not produce loads or blade flapping motion exceeding the maximum loads or motions encountered in flight):
(1) For full vertical thrust, 20 percent.
(2) For the forward thrust component, 50 percent.
(3) For the right thrust component, 10 percent.
(4) For the left thrust component, 10 percent.
(5) For the aft thrust component, 10 percent.
(j)
Endurance tests, clutch and brake engagements.
A total of at least 400 clutch and brake engagements, including the engagements of paragraph (b) of this section, must be made during the takeoff torque runs and, if necessary, at each change of torque and speed throughout the test. In each clutch engagement, the shaft on the driven side of the clutch must be accelerated from rest. The clutch engagements must be accomplished at the speed and by the method prescribed by the applicant. During deceleration after each clutch engagement, the engines must be stopped rapidly enough to allow the engines to be automatically disengaged from the rotors and rotor drives. If a rotor brake is installed for stopping the rotor, the clutch, during brake engagements, must be disengaged above 40 percent of maximum continuous rotor speed and the rotors allowed to decelerate to 40 percent of maximum continuous rotor speed, at which time the rotor brake must be applied. If the clutch design does not allow stopping the rotors with the engine running, or if no clutch is provided, the engine must be stopped before each application of the rotor brake, and then immediately be started after the rotors stop.
(k)
Endurance tests; OEI power run
—(1)
30-minute OEI power run.
For rotorcraft for which the use of 30-minute OEI power is requested, a run at 30-minute OEI torque and the maximum speed for use with 30-minute OEI torque must be conducted as follows: For each engine, in sequence, that engine must be inoperative and the remaining engines must be run for a 30-minute period.

In addition, a level of safety equal to that of the main rotors must be provided for—
(1) Each component in the rotor drive system whose failure would cause an uncontrolled landing;
(2) Each component essential to the phasing of rotors on multirotor rotorcraft, or that furnishes a driving link for the essential control of rotors in autorotation; and
(3) Each component common to two or more engines on multiengine rotorcraft.
(n)
Special tests.
Each rotor drive system designed to operate at two or more gear ratios must be subjected to special testing for durations necessary to substantiate the safety of the rotor drive system.

(2) The drop impact surface must be nondeforming.
(3) The tanks must be filled with water to 80 percent of the normal, full capacity.
(4) The tank must be enclosed in a surrounding structure representative of the installation unless it can be established that the surrounding structure is free of projections or other design features likely to contribute to upture of the tank.
(5) The tank must drop freely and impact in a horizontal position ±10°.
(6) After the drop test, there must be no leakage.
(b)
Fuel tank load factors.
Except for fuel tanks located so that tank rupture with fuel release to either significant ignition sources, such as engines, heaters, and auxiliary power units, or occupants is extremely remote, each fuel tank must be designed and installed to retain its contents under the following ultimate inertial load factors, acting alone.

(i) The load necessary to separate a breakaway coupling must be between 25 to 50 percent of the minimum ultimate failure load (ultimate strength) of the weakest component in the fluid-carrying line. The separation load must in no case be less than 300 pounds, regardless of the size of the fluid line.

The ultimate strength of frangible or deformable attachments must be as follows:
(1) The load required to separate a frangible attachment from its support structure, or deform a locally deformable attachment relative to its support structure, must be between 25 and 50 percent of the minimum ultimate load (ultimate strength) of the weakest component in the attached system. In no case may the load be less than 300 pounds.

(a)
General.
The helicopter must possess positive static longitudinal control force stability at critical combinations of weight and center of gravity at the conditions specified in paragraphs IV (b) through (f) of this appendix. The stick force must vary with speed so that any substantial speed change results in a stick force clearly perceptible to the pilot. The airspeed must return to within 10 percent of the trim speed when the control force is slowly released for each trim condition specified in paragraphs IV (b) through (f) of this appendix.
(b)

MINI
; and
(2) Landing gear retracted (if retractable).
(e)
Descent.
Stability must be shown throughout the speed range 20 knots either side of trim with—

1/2
amplitude in not more than two cycles.
(c) Any oscillation having a period of 10 seconds or more but less than 20 seconds must be damped.
(d) Any oscillation having a period of 20 seconds or more may not achieve double amplitude in less than 20 seconds.
(e) Any aperiodic response may not achieve double amplitude in less than 9 seconds.
VII.

(i) The controllability and maneuverability requirements in Subpart B must be met throughout a practical flight envelope;
(ii) The flight control, trim, and dynamic stability characteristics must not be impaired below a level needed to allow continued safe flight and landing;
(iii) For Category A helicopters, the dynamic stability requirements of Subpart B must also be met throughout a practical flight envelope; and
(iv) The static longitudinal and static directional stability requirements of Subpart B must be met throughout a practical flight envelope.
(b) The SAS must be designed so that it cannot create a hazardous deviation in flight path or produce hazardous loads on the helicopter during normal operation or in the event of malfunction or failure, assuming corrective action begins within an appropriate period of time. Where multiple systems are installed, subsequent malfunction conditions must be considered in sequence unless their occurrence is shown to be improbable.

The system must be designed so that the standby batteries may not be used for engine starting.
(b)
Miscellaneous requirements.
(1) Instrument systems and other systems essential
for IFR flight that could be adversely affected by icing must be provided with adequate ice protection whether or not the rotorcraft is certificated for operation in icing conditions.
(2) There must be means in the generating system to automatically de-energize and disconnect from the main bus any power source developing hazardous overvoltage.
(3) Each required flight instrument using a power supply (electric, vacuum, etc.) must have a visual means integral with the instrument to indicate the adequacy of the power being supplied.
(4) When multiple systems performing like functions are required, each system must be grouped, routed, and spaced so that physical separation between systems is provided to ensure that a single malfunction will not adversely affect more than one system.
(5) For systems that operate the required flight instruments at each pilot's station—
(i) For pneumatic systems, only the required flight instruments for the first pilot may be connected to that operating system;
(ii) Additional instruments, systems, or equipment may not be connected to an operating system for a second pilot unless provisions are made to ensure the continued normal functioning of the required instruments in the event of any malfunction of the additional instruments, systems, or equipment which is not shown to be extremely improbable;
(iii) The equipment, systems, and installations must be designed so that one display of the information essential to the safety of flight which is provided by the instruments will remain available to a pilot, without additional crew-member action, after any single failure or combination of failures that is not shown to be extremely improbable; and
(iv) For single-pilot configurations, instruments which require a static source must be provided with a means of selecting an alternate source and that source must be calibrated.
(6) In determining compliance with the requirements of § 29.1351(d)(2), the supply of electrical power to all systems necessary for flight under IFR must be included in the evaluation.

# Appendix C to Part 29—Icing Certification
(a)
Continuous maximum icing.
The maximum continuous intensity of atmospheric icing conditions (continuous maximum icing) is defined by the variables of the cloud liquid water content, the mean effective diameter of the cloud droplets, the ambient air temperature, and the interrelationship of these three variables as shown in Figure 1 of this appendix. The limiting icing envelope in terms of altitude and temperature is given in Figure 2 of this appendix. The interrelationship of cloud liquid water content with drop diameter and altitude is determined from Figures 1 and 2. The cloud liquid water content for continuous maximum icing conditions of a horizontal extent, other than 17.4 nautical miles, is determined by the value of liquid water content of Figure 1, multiplied by the appropriate factor from Figure 3 of this appendix.
(b)
Intermittent maximum icing.
The intermittent maximum intensity of atmospheric icing conditions (intermittent maximum icing) is defined by the variables of the cloud liquid water content, the mean effective diameter of the cloud droplets, the ambient air temperature, and the interrelationship of these three variables as shown in Figure 4 of this appendix. The limiting icing envelope in terms of altitude and temperature is given in Figure 5 of this appendix. The interrelationship of cloud liquid water content with drop diameter and altitude is determined from Figures 4 and 5. The cloud liquid water content for intermittent maximum icing conditions of a horizontal extent, other than 2.6 nautical miles, is determined by the value of cloud liquid water content of Figure 4 multiplied by the appropriate factor in Figure 6 of this appendix.

§ 33.17
Fire protection.
(a) The design and construction of the engine and the materials used must minimize the probability of the occurrence and spread of fire during normal operation and failure conditions, and must minimize the effect of such a fire. In addition, the design and construction of turbine engines must minimize the probability of the occurrence of an internal fire that could result in structural failure or other hazardous effects.
(b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, each external line, fitting, and other component, which contains or conveys flammable fluid during normal engine operation, must be fire resistant or fireproof, as determined by the Administrator. Components must be shielded or located to safeguard against the ignition of leaking flammable fluid.
(c) A tank, which contains flammable fluids and any associated shut-off means and supports, which are part of and attached to the engine, must be fireproof either by construction or by protection unless damage by fire will not cause leakage or spillage of a hazardous quantity of flammable fluid. For a reciprocating engine having an integral oil sump of less than 23.7 liters capacity, the oil sump need not be fireproof or enclosed by a fireproof shield.
(d) An engine component designed, constructed, and installed to act as a firewall must be:
(1) Fireproof;
(2) Constructed so that no hazardous quantity of air, fluid or flame can pass around or through the firewall; and,
(3) Protected against corrosion;
(e) In addition to the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, engine control system components that are located in a designated fire zone must be fire resistant or fireproof, as determined by the Administrator.
(f) Unintentional accumulation of hazardous quantities of flammable fluid within the engine must be prevented by draining and venting.
(g) Any components, modules, or equipment, which are susceptible to or are potential sources of static discharges or electrical fault currents must be designed and constructed to be properly grounded to the engine reference, to minimize the risk of ignition in external areas where flammable fluids or vapors could be present.
[Doc. No. FAA-2007-28503, 74 FR 37930, July 30, 2009]
§ 33.19
Durability.
(a) Engine design and construction must minimize the development of an unsafe condition of the engine between overhaul periods. The design of the compressor and turbine rotor cases must provide for the containment of damage from rotor blade failure. Energy levels and trajectories of fragments resulting from rotor blade failure that lie outside the compressor and turbine rotor cases must be defined.
(b) Each component of the propeller blade pitch control system which is a part of the engine type design must meet the requirements of §§ 35.21, 35.23, 35.42 and 35.43 of this chapter.
[Doc. No. 3025, 29 FR 7453, June 10, 1964, as amended by Amdt. 33-9, 45 FR 60181, Sept. 11, 1980; Amdt. 33-10, 49 FR 6851, Feb. 23, 1984; Amdt. 33-28, 73 FR 63346, Oct. 24, 2008]

§ 33.25
Accessory attachments.
The engine must operate properly with the accessory drive and mounting attachments loaded. Each engine accessory drive and mounting attachment must include provisions for sealing to prevent contamination of, or unacceptable leakage from, the engine interior. A drive and mounting attachment requiring lubrication for external drive splines, or coupling by engine oil, must include provisions for sealing to prevent unacceptable loss of oil and to prevent contamination from sources outside the chamber enclosing the drive connection. The design of the engine must allow for the examination, adjustment, or removal of each accessory required for engine operation.
[Amdt. 33-10, 49 FR 6851, Feb. 23, 1984]
§ 33.27
Turbine, compressor, fan, and turbosupercharger rotor overspeed.
(a) For each fan, compressor, turbine, and turbosupercharger rotor, the applicant must establish by test, analysis, or a combination of both, that each rotor will not burst when operated in the engine for 5 minutes at whichever of the conditions defined in paragraph (b) of this section is the most critical with respect to the integrity of such a rotor.
(1) Test rotors used to demonstrate compliance with this section that do not have the most adverse combination of material properties and dimensional tolerances must be tested at conditions which have been adjusted to ensure the minimum specification rotor possesses the required overspeed capability. This can be accomplished by increasing test speed, temperature, and/or loads.
(2) When an engine test is being used to demonstrate compliance with the overspeed conditions listed in paragraph (b)(3) or (b)(4) of this section and the failure of a component or system is sudden and transient, it may not be possible to operate the engine for 5 minutes after the failure. Under these circumstances, the actual overspeed duration is acceptable if the required maximum overspeed is achieved.
(b) When determining the maximum overspeed condition applicable to each rotor in order to comply with paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section, the applicant must evaluate the following rotor speeds taking into consideration the part's operating temperatures and temperature gradients throughout the engine's operating envelope:
(1) 120 percent of the maximum permissible rotor speed associated with any of the engine ratings except one-engine-inoperative (OEI) ratings of less than 2
1/2
minutes.
(2) 115 percent of the maximum permissible rotor speed associated with any OEI ratings of less than 2
1/2
minutes.
(3) 105 percent of the highest rotor speed that would result from either:
(i) The failure of the component or system which, in a representative installation of the engine, is the most critical with respect to overspeed when operating at any rating condition except OEI ratings of less than 2
1/2
minutes, or
(ii) The failure of any component or system in a representative installation of the engine, in combination with any other failure of a component or system that would not normally be detected during a routine pre-flight check or during normal flight operation, that is the most critical with respect to overspeed, except as provided by paragraph (c) of this section, when operating at any rating condition except OEI ratings of less than 2
1/2
minutes.
(4) 100 percent of the highest rotor speed that would result from the failure of the component or system which, in a representative installation of the engine, is the most critical with respect to overspeed when operating at any OEI rating of less than 2
1/2
minutes.
(c) The highest overspeed that results from a complete loss of load on a turbine rotor, except as provided by paragraph (f) of this section, must be included in the overspeed conditions considered by paragraphs (b)(3)(i), (b)(3)(ii), and (b)(4) of this section, regardless of whether that overspeed results from a failure within the engine
or external to the engine. The overspeed resulting from any other single failure must be considered when selecting the most limiting overspeed conditions applicable to each rotor. Overspeeds resulting from combinations of failures must also be considered unless the applicant can show that the probability of occurrence is not greater than extremely remote (probability range of 10
−7
to 10
−9
per engine flight hour).
(d) In addition, the applicant must demonstrate that each fan, compressor, turbine, and turbosupercharger rotor complies with paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section for the maximum overspeed achieved when subjected to the conditions specified in paragraphs (b)(3) and (b)(4) of this section. The applicant must use the approach in paragraph (a) of this section which specifies the required test conditions.
(1) Rotor Growth must not cause the engine to:
(i) Catch fire,
(ii) Release high-energy debris through the engine casing or result in a hazardous failure of the engine casing,
(iii) Generate loads greater than those ultimate loads specified in § 33.23(a), or
(iv) Lose the capability of being shut down.
(2) Following an overspeed event and after continued operation, the rotor may not exhibit conditions such as cracking or distortion which preclude continued safe operation.
(e) The design and functioning of engine control systems, instruments, and other methods not covered under § 33.28 must ensure that the engine operating limitations that affect turbine, compressor, fan, and turbosupercharger rotor structural integrity will not be exceeded in service.
(f) Failure of a shaft section may be excluded from consideration in determining the highest overspeed that would result from a complete loss of load on a turbine rotor if the applicant:
(1) Identifies the shaft as an engine life-limited-part and complies with § 33.70.
(2) Uses material and design features that are well understood and that can be analyzed by well-established and validated stress analysis techniques.
(3) Determines, based on an assessment of the environment surrounding the shaft section, that environmental influences are unlikely to cause a shaft failure. This assessment must include complexity of design, corrosion, wear, vibration, fire, contact with adjacent components or structure, overheating, and secondary effects from other failures or combination of failures.
(4) Identifies and declares, in accordance with § 33.5, any assumptions regarding the engine installation in making the assessment described above in paragraph (f)(3) of this section.
(5) Assesses, and considers as appropriate, experience with shaft sections of similar design.
(6) Does not exclude the entire shaft.
(g) If analysis is used to meet the overspeed requirements, then the analytical tool must be validated to prior overspeed test results of a similar rotor. The tool must be validated for each material. The rotor being certified must not exceed the boundaries of the rotors being used to validate the analytical tool in terms of geometric shape, operating stress, and temperature. Validation includes the ability to accurately predict rotor dimensional growth and the burst speed. The predictions must also show that the rotor being certified does not have lower burst and growth margins than rotors used to validate the tool.

(1) Adversely affects engine operation or that causes an unacceptable permanent loss of power or thrust or unacceptable increase in engine operating temperature; or
(2) Results in unacceptable temporary power loss or engine damage; or
(3) Causes a stall, surge, or flameout or loss of engine controllability. The
applicant must account for in-flight ram effects in any critical point analysis or test demonstration of these flight conditions.

§ 33.69
Ignitions system.
Each engine must be equipped with an ignition system for starting the engine on the ground and in flight. An electric ignition system must have at least two igniters and two separate secondary electric circuits, except that only one igniter is required for fuel burning augmentation systems.
[Amdt. 33-6, 39 FR 35466, Oct. 1, 1974]
§ 33.70
Engine life-limited parts.
By a procedure approved by the FAA, operating limitations must be established which specify the maximum allowable number of flight cycles for each engine life-limited part. Engine life-limited parts are rotor and major static structural parts whose primary failure is likely to result in a hazardous engine effect. Typically, engine life-limited parts include, but are not limited to disks, spacers, hubs, shafts, high-pressure casings, and non-redundant mount components. For the purposes of this section, a hazardous engine effect is any of the conditions listed in § 33.75 of this part. The applicant will establish the integrity of each engine life-limited part by:
(a) An engineering plan that contains the steps required to ensure each engine life-limited part is withdrawn from service at an approved life before hazardous engine effects can occur. These steps include validated analysis, test, or service experience which ensures that the combination of loads, material properties, environmental influences and operating conditions, including the effects of other engine parts influencing these parameters, are sufficiently well known and predictable so that the operating limitations can be established and maintained for each engine life-limited part. Applicants must perform appropriate damage tolerance assessments to address the potential for failure from material, manufacturing, and service induced anomalies within the approved life of the part. Applicants must publish a list of the life-limited engine parts and the approved life for each part in the Airworthiness Limitations Section of the Instructions for Continued Airworthiness as required by § 33.4 of this part.
(b) A manufacturing plan that identifies the specific manufacturing constraints necessary to consistently produce each engine life-limited part with the attributes required by the engineering plan.
(c) A service management plan that defines in-service processes for maintenance and the limitations to repair for each engine life-limited part that will maintain attributes consistent with those required by the engineering plan. These processes and limitations will become part of the Instructions for Continued Airworthiness.

§ 33.71
Lubrication system.
(a)
General.
Each lubrication system must function properly in the flight attitudes and atmospheric conditions in which an aircraft is expected to operate.
(b)
Oil strainer or filter.
There must be an oil strainer or filter through which all of the engine oil flows. In addition:
(1) Each strainer or filter required by this paragraph that has a bypass must be constructed and installed so that oil will flow at the normal rate through the rest of the system with the strainer or filter element completely blocked.
(2) The type and degree of filtering necessary for protection of the engine oil system against foreign particles in the oil must be specified. The applicant must demonstrate that foreign particles passing through the specified filtering means do not impair engine oil system functioning.
(3) Each strainer or filter required by this paragraph must have the capacity (with respect to operating limitations established for the engine) to ensure that engine oil system functioning is not impaired with the oil contaminated to a degree (with respect to particle size and density) that is greater than that established for the engine in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
(4) For each strainer or filter required by this paragraph, except the strainer or filter at the oil tank outlet, there must be means to indicate contamination before it reaches the capacity established in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
(5) Any filter bypass must be designed and constructed so that the release of collected contaminants is minimized by appropriate location of the bypass to ensure that the collected contaminants are not in the bypass flow path.
(6) Each strainer or filter required by this paragraph that has no bypass, except the strainer or filter at an oil tank outlet or for a scavenge pump, must have provisions for connection with a warning means to warn the pilot of the occurance of contamination of
the screen before it reaches the capacity established in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
(7) Each strainer or filter required by this paragraph must be accessible for draining and cleaning.
(c)
Oil tanks.
(1) Each oil tank must have an expansion space of not less than 10 percent of the tank capacity.
(2) It must be impossible to inadvertently fill the oil tank expansion space.
(3) Each recessed oil tank filler connection that can retain any appreciable quantity of oil must have provision for fitting a drain.
(4) Each oil tank cap must provide an oil-tight seal. For an applicant seeking eligibility for an engine to be installed on an airplane approved for ETOPS, the oil tank must be designed to prevent a hazardous loss of oil due to an incorrectly installed oil tank cap.
(5) Each oil tank filler must be marked with the word “oil.”
(6) Each oil tank must be vented from the top part of the expansion space, with the vent so arranged that condensed water vapor that might freeze and obstruct the line cannot accumulate at any point.
(7) There must be means to prevent entrance into the oil tank or into any oil tank outlet, of any object that might obstruct the flow of oil through the system.
(8) There must be a shutoff valve at the outlet of each oil tank, unless the external portion of the oil system (including oil tank supports) is fireproof.
(9) Each unpressurized oil tank may not leak when subjected to a maximum operating temperature and an internal pressure of 5 p.s.i., and each pressurized oil tank must meet the requirements of § 33.64.
(10) Leaked or spilled oil may not accumulate between the tank and the remainder of the engine.
(11) Each oil tank must have an oil quantity indicator or provisions for one.
(12) If the propeller feathering system depends on engine oil—
(i) There must be means to trap an amount of oil in the tank if the supply becomes depleted due to failure of any part of the lubricating system other than the tank itself;
(ii) The amount of trapped oil must be enough to accomplish the feathering opeation and must be available only to the feathering pump; and
(iii) Provision must be made to prevent sludge or other foreign matter from affecting the safe operation of the propeller feathering system.
(d)
Oil drains.
A drain (or drains) must be provided to allow safe drainage of the oil system. Each drain must—
(1) Be accessible; and
(2) Have manual or automatic means for positive locking in the closed position.
(e)
Oil radiators.
Each oil radiator must withstand, without failure, any vibration, inertia, and oil pressure load to which it is subjected during the block tests.

§ 33.72
Hydraulic actuating systems.
Each hydraulic actuating system must function properly under all conditions in which the engine is expected to operate. Each filter or screen must be accessible for servicing and each tank must meet the design criteria of § 33.71.
[Amdt. 33-6, 39 FR 35467, Oct. 1, 1974]
§ 33.73
Power or thrust response.
The design and construction of the engine must enable an increase—
(a) From minimum to rated takeoff power or thrust with the maximum bleed air and power extraction to be permitted in an aircraft, without overtemperature, surge, stall, or other detrimental factors occurring to the engine whenever the power control lever is moved from the minimum to the maximum position in not more than 1 second, except that the Administrator may allow additional time increments for different regimes of control operation requiring control scheduling; and
(b) From the fixed minimum flight idle power lever position when provided, or if not provided, from not more than 15 percent of the rated takeoff power or thrust available to 95 percent rated takeoff power or thrust in not over 5 seconds. The 5-second power or
thrust response must occur from a stabilized static condition using only the bleed air and accessories loads necessary to run the engine. This takeoff rating is specified by the applicant and need not include thrust augmentation.
[Amdt. 33-1, 36 FR 5493, Mar. 24, 1971]
§ 33.74
Continued rotation.
If any of the engine main rotating systems continue to rotate after the engine is shutdown for any reason while in flight, and if means to prevent that continued rotation are not provided, then any continued rotation during the maximum period of flight, and in the flight conditions expected to occur with that engine inoperative, may not result in any condition described in § 33.75(g)(2)(i) through (vi) of this part.
[Amdt. 33-24, 72 FR 50867, Sept. 4, 2007]
§ 33.75
Safety analysis.
(a) (1) The applicant must analyze the engine, including the control system, to assess the likely consequences of all failures that can reasonably be expected to occur. This analysis will take into account, if applicable:
(i) Aircraft-level devices and procedures assumed to be associated with a typical installation. Such assumptions must be stated in the analysis.
(ii) Consequential secondary failures and latent failures.
(iii) Multiple failures referred to in paragraph (d) of this section or that result in the hazardous engine effects defined in paragraph (g)(2) of this section.
(2) The applicant must summarize those failures that could result in major engine effects or hazardous engine effects, as defined in paragraph (g) of this section, and estimate the probability of occurrence of those effects. Any engine part the failure of which could reasonably result in a hazardous engine effect must be clearly identified in this summary.
(3) The applicant must show that hazardous engine effects are predicted to occur at a rate not in excess of that defined as extremely remote (probability range of 10
−7
to 10
−9
per engine flight hour). Since the estimated probability for individual failures may be insufficiently precise to enable the applicant to assess the total rate for hazardous engine effects, compliance may be shown by demonstrating that the probability of a hazardous engine effect arising from an individual failure can be predicted to be not greater than 10
−8
per engine flight hour. In dealing with probabilities of this low order of magnitude, absolute proof is not possible, and compliance may be shown by reliance on engineering judgment and previous experience combined with sound design and test philosophies.
(4) The applicant must show that major engine effects are predicted to occur at a rate not in excess of that defined as remote (probability range of 10
−5
to 10
−7
per engine flight hour).
(b) The FAA may require that any assumption as to the effects of failures and likely combination of failures be verified by test.
(c) The primary failure of certain single elements cannot be sensibly estimated in numerical terms. If the failure of such elements is likely to result in hazardous engine effects, then compliance may be shown by reliance on the prescribed integrity requirements of §§ 33.15, 33.27, and 33.70 as applicable. These instances must be stated in the safety analysis.
(d) If reliance is placed on a safety system to prevent a failure from progressing to hazardous engine effects, the possibility of a safety system failure in combination with a basic engine failure must be included in the analysis. Such a safety system may include safety devices, instrumentation, early warning devices, maintenance checks, and other similar equipment or procedures. If items of a safety system are outside the control of the engine manufacturer, the assumptions of the safety analysis with respect to the reliability of these parts must be clearly stated in the analysis and identified in the installation instructions under § 33.5 of this part.
(e) If the safety analysis depends on one or more of the following items, those items must be identified in the analysis and appropriately substantiated.
(1) Maintenance actions being carried out at stated intervals. This includes the verification of the serviceability of
items that could fail in a latent manner. When necessary to prevent hazardous engine effects, these maintenance actions and intervals must be published in the instructions for continued airworthiness required under § 33.4 of this part. Additionally, if errors in maintenance of the engine, including the control system, could lead to hazardous engine effects, the appropriate procedures must be included in the relevant engine manuals.
(2) Verification of the satisfactory functioning of safety or other devices at pre-flight or other stated periods. The details of this satisfactory functioning must be published in the appropriate manual.
(3) The provisions of specific instrumentation not otherwise required.
(4) Flight crew actions to be specified in the operating instructions established under § 33.5.
(f) If applicable, the safety analysis must also include, but not be limited to, investigation of the following:
(1) Indicating equipment;
(2) Manual and automatic controls;
(3) Compressor bleed systems;
(4) Refrigerant injection systems;
(5) Gas temperature control systems;
(6) Engine speed, power, or thrust governors and fuel control systems;
(7) Engine overspeed, overtemperature, or topping limiters;
(8) Propeller control systems; and
(9) Engine or propeller thrust reversal systems.
(g) Unless otherwise approved by the FAA and stated in the safety analysis, for compliance with part 33, the following failure definitions apply to the engine:
(1) An engine failure in which the only consequence is partial or complete loss of thrust or power (and associated engine services) from the engine will be regarded as a minor engine effect.
(2) The following effects will be regarded as hazardous engine effects:
(i) Non-containment of high-energy debris;
(ii) Concentration of toxic products in the engine bleed air intended for the cabin sufficient to incapacitate crew or passengers;
(iii) Significant thrust in the opposite direction to that commanded by the pilot;
(iv) Uncontrolled fire;
(v) Failure of the engine mount system leading to inadvertent engine separation;
(vi) Release of the propeller by the engine, if applicable; and
(vii) Complete inability to shut the engine down.
(3) An effect whose severity falls between those effects covered in paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) of this section will be regarded as a major engine effect.
[Amdt. 33-24, 72 FR 50867, Sept. 4, 2007]
§ 33.76
Bird ingestion.
(a)
General.
Compliance with paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section shall be in accordance with the following:
(1) Except as specified in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, all ingestion tests must be conducted with the engine stabilized at no less than 100 percent takeoff power or thrust, for test day ambient conditions prior to the ingestion. In addition, the demonstration of compliance must account for engine operation at sea level takeoff conditions on the hottest day that a minimum engine can achieve maximum rated takeoff thrust or power.
(2) The engine inlet throat area as used in this section to determine the bird quantity and weights will be established by the applicant and identified as a limitation in the installation instructions required under § 33.5.
(3) The impact to the front of the engine from the large single bird, the single largest medium bird which can enter the inlet, and the large flocking bird must be evaluated. Applicants must show that the associated components when struck under the conditions prescribed in paragraphs (b), (c) or (d) of this section, as applicable, will not affect the engine to the extent that the engine cannot comply with the requirements of paragraphs (b)(3), (c)(6) and (d)(4) of this section.
(4) For an engine that incorporates an inlet protection device, compliance with this section shall be established with the device functioning. The engine approval will be endorsed to show
that compliance with the requirements has been established with the device functioning.
(5) Objects that are accepted by the Administrator may be substituted for birds when conducting the bird ingestion tests required by paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section.
(6) If compliance with the requirements of this section is not established, the engine type certification documentation will show that the engine shall be limited to aircraft installations in which it is shown that a bird cannot strike the engine, or be ingested into the engine, or adversely restrict airflow into the engine.
(b)
Large single bird.
Compliance with the large bird ingestion requirements shall be in accordance with the following:
(1) The large bird ingestion test shall be conducted using one bird of a weight determined from Table 1 aimed at the most critical exposed location on the first stage rotor blades and ingested at a bird speed of 200-knots for engines to be installed on airplanes, or the maximum airspeed for normal rotorcraft flight operations for engines to be installed on rotorcraft.
(2) Power lever movement is not permitted within 15 seconds following ingestion of the large bird.
(3) Ingestion of a single large bird tested under the conditions prescribed in this section may not result in any condition described in § 33.75(g)(2) of this part.
(4) Compliance with the large bird ingestion requirements of this paragraph may be shown by demonstrating that the requirements of § 33.94(a) constitute a more severe demonstration of blade containment and rotor unbalance than the requirements of this paragraph.

Small and medium flocking bird.
Compliance with the small and medium bird ingestion requirements shall be in accordance with the following:
(1) Analysis or component test, or both, acceptable to the Administrator, shall be conducted to determine the critical ingestion parameters affecting power loss and damage. Critical ingestion parameters shall include, but are not limited to, the effects of bird speed, critical target location, and first stage rotor speed. The critical bird ingestion speed should reflect the most critical condition within the range of airspeeds used for normal flight operations up to 1,500 feet above ground level, but not less than V
1
minimum for airplanes.
(2) Medium bird engine tests shall be conducted so as to simulate a flock encounter, and will use the bird weights and quantities specified in Table 2. When only one bird is specified, that bird will be aimed at the engine core primary flow path; the other critical locations on the engine face area must be addressed, as necessary, by appropriate tests or analysis, or both. When two or more birds are specified in Table 2, the largest of those birds must be aimed at the engine core primary flow path, and a second bird must be aimed at the most critical exposed location on the first stage rotor blades. Any remaining birds must be evenly distributed over the engine face area.
(3) In addition, except for rotorcraft engines, it must also be substantiated by appropriate tests or analysis or both, that when the full fan assembly is subjected to the ingestion of the quantity and weights of bird from Table 3, aimed at the fan assembly's most critical location outboard of the primary core flowpath, and in accordance with the applicable test conditions of this paragraph, that the engine can comply with the acceptance criteria of this paragraph.
(4) A small bird ingestion test is not required if the prescribed number of medium birds pass into the engine rotor blades during the medium bird test.
(5) Small bird ingestion tests shall be conducted so as to simulate a flock encounter using one 85 gram (0.187 lb.) bird for each 0.032 square-meter (49.6 square-inches) of inlet area, or fraction
thereof, up to a maximum of 16 birds. The birds will be aimed so as to account for any critical exposed locations on the first stage rotor blades, with any remaining birds evenly distributed over the engine face area.
(6) Ingestion of small and medium birds tested under the conditions prescribed in this paragraph may not cause any of the following:
(i) More than a sustained 25-percent power or thrust loss;
(ii) The engine to be shut down during the required run-on demonstration prescribed in paragraphs (c)(7) or (c)(8) of this section;
(iii) The conditions defined in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
(iv) Unacceptable deterioration of engine handling characteristics.
(7) Except for rotorcraft engines, the following test schedule shall be used:

(ii) Followed by 2 minutes without power lever movement after the ingestion.
(iii) Followed by 3 minutes at 75-percent of the test condition.
(iv) Followed by 6 minutes at 60-percent of the test condition.
(v) Followed by 6 minutes at 40-percent of the test condition.
(vi) Followed by 1 minute at approach idle.
(vii) Followed by 2 minutes at 75-percent of the test condition.
(viii) Followed by stabilizing at idle and engine shut down.
(ix) The durations specified are times at the defined conditions with the power being changed between each condition in less than 10 seconds.
(8) For rotorcraft engines, the following test schedule shall be used:
(i) Ingestion so as to simulate a flock encounter within approximately 1 second elapsed time between the first ingestion and the last.
(ii) Followed by 3 minutes at 75-percent of the test condition.
(iii) Followed by 90 seconds at descent flight idle.
(iv) Followed by 30 seconds at 75-percent of the test condition.
(v) Followed by stabilizing at idle and engine shut down.
(vi) The durations specified are times at the defined conditions with the power being changed between each condition in less than 10 seconds.
(9) Engines intended for use in multi-engine rotorcraft are not required to comply with the medium bird ingestion portion of this section, providing that the appropriate type certificate documentation is so endorsed.
(10) If any engine operating limit(s) is exceeded during the initial 2 minutes without power lever movement, as provided by paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of this section, then it shall be established that the limit exceedence will not result in an unsafe condition.

§ 33.78
Rain and hail ingestion.
(a)
All engines.
(1) The ingestion of large hailstones (0.8 to 0.9 specific gravity) at the maximum true air speed, up to 15,000 feet (4,500 meters), associated with a representative aircraft operating in rough air, with the engine at maximum continuous power, may not cause unacceptable mechanical damage or unacceptable power or thrust loss after the ingestion, or require the engine to be shut down. One-half the number of hailstones shall be aimed randomly over the inlet face area and the other half aimed at the critical inlet face area. The hailstones shall be ingested in a rapid sequence to simulate a hailstone encounter and the number and size of the hailstones shall be determined as follows:
(i) One 1-inch (25 millimeters) diameter hailstone for engines with inlet areas of not more than 100 square inches (0.0645 square meters).
(ii) One 1-inch (25 millimeters) diameter and one 2-inch (50 millimeters) diameter hailstone for each 150 square inches (0.0968 square meters) of inlet area, or fraction thereof, for engines with inlet areas of more than 100 square inches (0.0645 square meters).
(2) In addition to complying with paragraph (a)(1) of this section and except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, it must be shown that each engine is capable of acceptable operation throughout its specified operating envelope when subjected to sudden encounters with the certification standard concentrations of rain and hail, as defined in appendix B to this part. Acceptable engine operation precludes flameout, run down, continued or non-recoverable surge or stall, or loss of acceleration and deceleration capability, during any three minute continuous period in rain and during any 30 second continuous period in hail. It must also be shown after the ingestion that there is no unacceptable mechanical damage, unacceptable power or thrust loss, or other adverse engine anomalies.
(b)
Engines for rotorcraft.
As an alternative to the requirements specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, for rotorcraft turbine engines only, it must be shown that each engine is capable of acceptable operation during and after the ingestion of rain with an overall ratio of water droplet flow to airflow, by weight, with a uniform distribution at the inlet plane, of at least four percent. Acceptable engine operation precludes flameout, run down, continued or non-recoverable surge or stall, or loss of acceleration and deceleration capability. It must also be shown after the ingestion that there is no unacceptable mechanical damage, unacceptable power loss, or other adverse engine anomalies. The rain ingestion must occur under the following static ground level conditions:
(1) A normal stabilization period at take-off power without rain ingestion, followed immediately by the suddenly commencing ingestion of rain for three minutes at takeoff power, then
(2) Continuation of the rain ingestion during subsequent rapid deceleration to minimum idle, then
(3) Continuation of the rain ingestion during three minutes at minimum idle power to be certified for flight operation, then
(4) Continuation of the rain ingestion during subsequent rapid acceleration to takeoff power.
(c)
Engines for supersonic airplanes.
In addition to complying with paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section, a separate test for supersonic airplane engines only, shall be conducted with three hailstones ingested at supersonic cruise velocity. These hailstones shall be aimed at the engine's critical face area, and their ingestion must not cause unacceptable mechanical damage or unacceptable power or thrust loss after the ingestion or require the engine to be shut down. The size of these hailstones shall be determined from the linear variation in diameter from 1-inch (25 millimeters) at 35,000 feet (10,500 meters) to
1/4
-inch (6 millimeters) at 60,000 feet (18,000 meters) using the diameter corresponding to the lowest expected supersonic cruise altitude. Alternatively, three larger hailstones may be ingested at subsonic velocities such that the kinetic energy of these larger hailstones is equivalent to the applicable supersonic ingestion conditions.
(d) For an engine that incorporates or requires the use of a protection device, demonstration of the rain and hail ingestion capabilities of the engine, as required in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section, may be waived wholly or in part by the Administrator if the applicant shows that:
(1) The subject rain and hail constituents are of a size that will not pass through the protection device;
(2) The protection device will withstand the impact of the subject rain and hail constituents; and
(3) The subject of rain and hail constituents, stopped by the protection device, will not obstruct the flow of induction air into the engine, resulting in damage, power or thrust loss, or other adverse engine anomalies in excess of what would be accepted in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section.

§ 33.79
Fuel burning thrust augmentor.
Each fuel burning thrust augmentor, including the nozzle, must—
(a) Provide cutoff of the fuel burning thrust augmentor;
(b) Permit on-off cycling;
(c) Be controllable within the intended range of operation;
(d) Upon a failure or malfunction of augmentor combustion, not cause the engine to lose thrust other than that provided by the augmentor; and
(e) Have controls that function compatibly with the other engine controls and automatically shut off augmentor fuel flow if the engine rotor speed drops below the minimum rotational speed at which the augmentor is intended to function.

Before each endurance test required by this subpart, the adjustment setting and functioning characteristic of each component having an adjustment setting and a functioning characteristic that can be established independent of installation on the engine must be established and recorded.
[Amdt. 36-6, 39 FR 35468, Oct. 1, 1974]
§ 33.83
Vibration test.
(a) Each engine must undergo vibration surveys to establish that the vibration characteristics of those components that may be subject to mechanically or aerodynamically induced vibratory excitations are acceptable throughout the declared flight envelope. The engine surveys shall be based upon an appropriate combination of experience, analysis, and component test and shall address, as a minimum, blades, vanes, rotor discs, spacers, and rotor shafts.
(b) The surveys shall cover the ranges of power or thrust, and both the physical and corrected rotational speeds for each rotor system, corresponding to operations throughout the range of ambient conditions in the declared flight envelope, from the minimum rotational speed up to 103 percent of the maximum physical and corrected rotational speed permitted for rating periods of two minutes or longer, and up to 100 percent of all other permitted physical and corrected rotational speeds, including those that are overspeeds. If there is any indication of a stress peak arising at the highest of those required physical or corrected rotational speeds, the surveys shall be extended sufficiently to reveal the maximum stress values present, except that the extension need not cover more than a further 2 percentage points increase beyond those speeds.
(c) Evaluations shall be made of the following:
(1) The effects on vibration characteristics of operating with scheduled changes (including tolerances) to variable vane angles, compressor bleeds, accessory loading, the most adverse inlet air flow distortion pattern declared by the manufacturer, and the most adverse conditions in the exhaust duct(s); and
(2) The aerodynamic and aeromechanical factors which might induce or influence flutter in those systems susceptible to that form of vibration.
(d) Except as provided by paragraph (e) of this section, the vibration stresses associated with the vibration characteristics determined under this section, when combined with the appropriate steady stresses, must be less than the endurance limits of the materials concerned, after making due allowances for operating conditions for the permitted variations in properties of the materials. The suitability of these stress margins must be justified for each part evaluated. If it is determined that certain operating conditions, or ranges, need to be limited, operating and installation limitations shall be established.
(e) The effects on vibration characteristics of excitation forces caused by fault conditions (such as, but not limited to, out-of balance, local blockage or enlargement of stator vane passages, fuel nozzle blockage, incorrectly schedule compressor variables, etc.) shall be evaluated by test or analysis, or by reference to previous experience and shall be shown not to create a hazardous condition.
(f) Compliance with this section shall be substantiated for each specific installation configuration that can affect the vibration characteristics of the engine. If these vibration effects cannot be fully investigated during engine certification, the methods by which they can be evaluated and methods by which compliance can be shown shall be substantiated and defined in the installation instructions required by § 33.5.

§ 33.84
Engine overtorque test.
(a) If approval of a maximum engine overtorque is sought for an engine incorporating a free power turbine, compliance with this section must be demonstrated by testing.
(1) The test may be run as part of the endurance test requirement of § 33.87. Alternatively, tests may be performed on a complete engine or equivalent testing on individual groups of components.
(2) Upon conclusion of tests conducted to show compliance with this section, each engine part or individual groups of components must meet the requirements of § 33.93(a)(1) and (a)(2).
(b) The test conditions must be as follows:
(1) A total of 15 minutes run at the maximum engine overtorque to be approved. This may be done in separate runs, each being of at least 2
1/2
minutes duration.
(2) A power turbine rotational speed equal to the highest speed at which the maximum overtorque can occur in service. The test speed may not be more than the limit speed of take-off or OEI ratings longer than 2 minutes.
(3) For engines incorporating a reduction gearbox, a gearbox oil temperature equal to the maximum temperature when the maximum engine overtorque could occur in service; and for
all other engines, an oil temperature within the normal operating range.
(4) A turbine entry gas temperature equal to the maximum steady state temperature approved for use during periods longer than 20 seconds when operating at conditions not associated with 30-second or 2 minutes OEI ratings. The requirement to run the test at the maximum approved steady state temperature may be waived by the FAA if the applicant can demonstrate that other testing provides substantiation of the temperature effects when considered in combination with the other parameters identified in paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section.

§ 33.85
Calibration tests.
(a) Each engine must be subjected to those calibration tests necessary to establish its power characteristics and the conditions for the endurance test specified § 33.87. The results of the power characteristics calibration tests form the basis for establishing the characteristics of the engine over its entire operating range of speeds, pressures, temperatures, and altitudes. Power ratings are based upon standard atmospheric conditions with no airbleed for aircraft services and with only those accessories installed which are essential for engine functioning.
(b) A power check at sea level conditions must be accomplished on the endurance test engine after the endurance test and any change in power characteristics which occurs during the endurance test must be determined. Measurements taken during the final portion of the endurance test may be used in showing compliance with the requirements of this paragraph.
(c) In showing compliance with this section, each condition must stabilize before measurements are taken, except as permitted by paragraph (d) of this section.
(d) In the case of engines having 30-second OEI, and 2-minute OEI ratings, measurements taken during the applicable endurance test prescribed in § 33.87(f) (1) through (8) may be used in showing compliance with the requirements of this section for these OEI ratings.
[Doc. No. 3025, 29 FR 7453, June 10, 1964, as amended by Amdt. 33-6, 39 FR 35468, Oct. 1, 1974; Amdt. 33-18, 61 FR 31328, June 19, 1996]
§ 33.87
Endurance test.
(a)
General.
Each engine must be subjected to an endurance test that includes a total of at least 150 hours of operation and, depending upon the type and contemplated use of the engine, consists of one of the series of runs specified in paragraphs (b) through (g) of this section, as applicable. For engines tested under paragraphs (b), (c), (d), (e) or (g) of this section, the prescribed 6-hour test sequence must be conducted 25 times to complete the required 150 hours of operation. Engines for which the 30-second OEI and 2-minute OEI ratings are desired must be further tested under paragraph (f) of this section. The following test requirements apply:
(1) The runs must be made in the order found appropriate by the FAA for the particular engine being tested.
(2) Any automatic engine control that is part of the engine must control the engine during the endurance test except for operations where automatic control is normally overridden by manual control or where manual control is otherwise specified for a particular test run.
(3) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, power or thrust, gas temperature, rotor shaft rotational speed, and, if limited, temperature of external surfaces of the engine must be at least 100 percent of the value associated with the particular engine operation being tested. More than one test may be run if all parameters cannot be held at the 100 percent level simultaneously.
(4) The runs must be made using fuel, lubricants and hydraulic fluid which conform to the specifications specified in complying with § 33.7(c).
(5) Maximum air bleed for engine and aircraft services must be used during at least one-fifth of the runs, except for the test required under paragraph (f) of this section, provided the validity of the test is not compromised. However, for these runs, the power or thrust or the rotor shaft rotational speed may be
less than 100 percent of the value associated with the particular operation being tested if the FAA finds that the validity of the endurance test is not compromised.
(6) Each accessory drive and mounting attachment must be loaded in accordance with paragraphs (a)(6)(i) and (ii) of this section, except as permitted by paragraph (a)(6)(iii) of this section for the test required under paragraph (f) of this section.
(i) The load imposed by each accessory used only for aircraft service must be the limit load specified by the applicant for the engine drive and attachment point during rated maximum continuous power or thrust and higher output.
(ii) The endurance test of any accessory drive and mounting attachment under load may be accomplished on a separate rig if the validity of the test is confirmed by an approved analysis.
(iii) The applicant is not required to load the accessory drives and mounting attachments when running the tests under paragraphs (f)(1) through (f)(8) of this section if the applicant can substantiate that there is no significant effect on the durability of any accessory drive or engine component. However, the applicant must add the equivalent engine output power extraction from the power turbine rotor assembly to the engine shaft output.
(7) During the runs at any rated power or thrust the gas temperature and the oil inlet temperature must be maintained at the limiting temperature except where the test periods are not longer than 5 minutes and do not allow stabilization. At least one run must be made with fuel, oil, and hydraulic fluid at the minimum pressure limit and at least one run must be made with fuel, oil, and hydraulic fluid at the maximum pressure limit with fluid temperature reduced as necessary to allow maximum pressure to be attained.
(8) If the number of occurrences of either transient rotor shaft overspeed, transient gas overtemperature or transient engine overtorque is limited, that number of the accelerations required by paragraphs (b) through (g) of this section must be made at the limiting overspeed, overtemperature or overtorque. If the number of occurrences is not limited, half the required accelerations must be made at the limiting overspeed, overtemperature or overtorque.
(9) For each engine type certificated for use on supersonic aircraft the following additional test requirements apply:
(i) To change the thrust setting, the power control lever must be moved from the initial position to the final position in not more than one second except for movements into the fuel burning thrust augmentor augmentation position if additional time to confirm ignition is necessary.
(ii) During the runs at any rated augmented thrust the hydraulic fluid temperature must be maintained at the limiting temperature except where the test periods are not long enough to allow stabilization.
(iii) During the simulated supersonic runs the fuel temperature and induction air temperature may not be less than the limiting temperature.
(iv) The endurance test must be conducted with the fuel burning thrust augmentor installed, with the primary and secondary exhaust nozzles installed, and with the variable area exhaust nozzles operated during each run according to the methods specified in complying with § 33.5(b).
(v) During the runs at thrust settings for maximum continuous thrust and percentages thereof, the engine must be operated with the inlet air distortion at the limit for those thrust settings.
(b)
Engines other than certain rotorcraft engines.
For each engine except a rotorcraft engine for which a rating is desired under paragraph (c), (d), or (e) of this section, the applicant must conduct the following runs:
(1)
Takeoff and idling.
One hour of alternate five-minute periods at rated takeoff power or thrust and at idling power or thrust. The developed powers or thrusts at takeoff and idling conditions and their corresponding rotor speed and gas temperature conditions must be as established by the power control in accordance with the schedule established by the applicant.

Design and test requirements for Early ETOPS eligibility.
An applicant seeking type design approval for an engine to be installed on a two-engine airplane approved for ETOPS without the service experience specified in part 25, appendix K, K25.2.1 of this chapter, must comply with the following:
(a) The engine must be designed using a design quality process acceptable to the FAA, that ensures the design features of the engine minimize the occurrence of failures, malfunctions, defects, and maintenance errors that could result in an IFSD, loss of thrust control, or other power loss.
(b) The design features of the engine must address problems shown to result in an IFSD, loss of thrust control, or other power loss in the applicant's other relevant type designs approved within the past 10 years, to the extent that adequate service data is available within that 10-year period. An applicant without adequate service data must show experience with and knowledge of problem mitigating design practices equivalent to that gained
from actual service experience in a manner acceptable to the FAA.
(c) Except as specified in paragraph (f) of this section, the applicant must conduct a simulated ETOPS mission cyclic endurance test in accordance with an approved test plan on an engine that substantially conforms to the type design. The test must:
(1) Include a minimum of 3,000 representative service start-stop mission cycles and three simulated diversion cycles at maximum continuous thrust or power for the maximum diversion time for which ETOPS eligibility is sought. Each start-stop mission cycle must include the use of take-off, climb, cruise, descent, approach, and landing thrust or power and the use of thrust reverse (if applicable). The diversions must be evenly distributed over the duration of the test. The last diversion must be conducted within 100 cycles of the completion of the test.
(2) Be performed with the high speed and low speed main engine rotors independently unbalanced to obtain a minimum of 90 percent of the recommended field service maintenance vibration levels. For engines with three main engine rotors, the intermediate speed rotor must be independently unbalanced to obtain a minimum of 90 percent of the recommended production acceptance vibration level. The required peak vibration levels must be verified during a slow acceleration and deceleration run of the test engine covering the main engine rotor operating speed ranges.
(3) Include a minimum of three million vibration cycles for each 60 rpm incremental step of the typical high-speed rotor start-stop mission cycle. The test may be conducted using any rotor speed step increment from 60 to 200 rpm provided the test encompasses the typical service start-stop cycle speed range. For incremental steps greater than 60 rpm, the minimum number of vibration cycles must be linearly increased up to ten million cycles for a 200 rpm incremental step.
(4) Include a minimum of 300,000 vibration cycles for each 60 rpm incremental step of the high-speed rotor approved operational speed range between minimum flight idle and cruise power not covered by paragraph (c)(3) of this section. The test may be conducted using any rotor speed step increment from 60 to 200 rpm provided the test encompasses the applicable speed range. For incremental steps greater than 60 rpm the minimum number of vibration cycles must be linearly increased up to 1 million for a 200 rpm incremental step.
(5) Include vibration surveys at periodic intervals throughout the test. The equivalent value of the peak vibration level observed during the surveys must meet the minimum vibration requirement of § 33.201(c)(2).
(d) Prior to the test required by paragraph (c) of this section, the engine must be subjected to a calibration test to document power and thrust characteristics.
(e) At the conclusion of the testing required by paragraph (c) of this section, the engine must:
(1) Be subjected to a calibration test at sea-level conditions. Any change in power or thrust characteristics must be within approved limits.
(2) Be visually inspected in accordance with the on-wing inspection recommendations and limits contained in the Instructions for Continued Airworthiness submitted in compliance with § 33.4.
(3) Be completely disassembled and inspected—
(i) In accordance with the applicable inspection recommendations and limits contained in the Instructions for Continued Airworthiness submitted in compliance with § 33.4;
(ii) With consideration of the causes of IFSD, loss of thrust control, or other power loss identified by paragraph (b) of this section; and
(iii) In a manner to identify wear or distress conditions that could result in an IFSD, loss of thrust control, or other power loss not specifically identified by paragraph (b) of this section or addressed within the Instructions for Continued Airworthiness.
(4) Not show wear or distress to the extent that could result in an IFSD, loss of thrust control, or other power loss within a period of operation before the component, assembly, or system would likely have been inspected or functionally tested for integrity while in service. Such wear or distress must
have corrective action implemented through a design change, a change to maintenance instructions, or operational procedures before ETOPS eligibility is granted. The type and frequency of wear and distress that occurs during the engine test must be consistent with the type and frequency of wear and distress that would be expected to occur on ETOPS eligible engines.
(f) An alternative mission cycle endurance test that provides an equivalent demonstration of the unbalance and vibration specified in paragraph (c) of this section may be used when approved by the FAA.
(g) For an applicant using the simulated ETOPS mission cyclic endurance test to comply with § 33.90, the test may be interrupted so that the engine may be inspected by an on-wing or other method, using criteria acceptable to the FAA, after completion of the test cycles required to comply with § 33.90(a). Following the inspection, the ETOPS test must be resumed to complete the requirements of this section.

§ 34.7
Exemptions.
Notwithstanding part 11 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 11), all petitions for rulemaking involving either the substance of an emission standard or test procedure prescribed by the EPA that is incorporated in this FAR, or the compliance date for such standard or procedure, must be submitted to the EPA. Information copies of such petitions are invited by the FAA. Petitions for rulemaking or exemption involving provisions of this FAR that do not affect the substance or the compliance date of an emission standard or test procedure that is prescribed by the EPA, and petitions for exemptions under the provisions for which the EPA has specifically granted exemption authority to the Secretary of Transportation are subject to part 11 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 11). Petitions for rulemaking or exemptions involving these FARs must be submitted to the FAA.
(a)
Exemptions based on flights for short durations at infrequent intervals.
The emission standards of this part do not apply to engines which power aircraft operated in the United States for short durations at infrequent intervals. Such operations are limited to:
(1) Flights of an aircraft for the purpose of export to a foreign country, including any flights essential to demonstrate the integrity of an aircraft prior to a flight to a point outside the United States.
(2) Flights to a base where repairs, alterations or maintenance are to be performed, or to a point of storage, or for the purpose of returning an aircraft to service.
(3) Official visits by representatives of foreign governments.
(4) Other flights the Administrator determines, after consultation with the Administrator of the EPA, to be for short durations at infrequent intervals. A request for such a determination shall be made before the flight takes place.
(b)
Exemptions for very low production engine models.
The emissions standards of this part do not apply to engines of very low production after the date of applicability. For the purpose of this part, “very low production” is limited to a maximum total production for United States civil aviation applications of no more than 200 units covered by the same type certificate after January 1, 1984. Engines manufactured under this provision must be reported
to the FAA by serial number on or before the date of manufacture and exemptions granted under this provision are not transferable to any other engine. This exemption is limited to the requirements of § 34.21 only.
(c)
Exemptions for new engines in other categories.
The emissions standards of this part do not apply to engines for which the Administrator determines, with the concurrence of the Administrator of the EPA, that application of any standard under § 34.21 is not justified, based upon consideration of—
(1) Adverse economic impact on the manufacturer;
(2) Adverse economic impact on the aircraft and airline industries at large;
(3) Equity in administering the standards among all economically competing parties;
(4) Public health and welfare effects; and
(5) Other factors which the Administrator, after consultation with the Administrator of the EPA, may deem relevant to the case in question.
(d)
Applicants seeking exemption from other emissions standards of this part and 40 CFR 1031.15.
Applicants must request exemption from both the FAA and the EPA, even where the underlying regulatory requirements are the same. The FAA and EPA will jointly consider such exemption requests, and will assure consistency in the respective agency determinations.
(e) Applications for exemption from this part shall be submitted in duplicate to the Administrator in accordance with the procedures established by the Administrator in part 11.
(f) The Administrator shall publish in the
Federal Register
the name of the organization to whom exemptions are granted and the period of such exemptions.
(g) No state or political subdivision thereof may attempt to enforce a standard respecting emissions from an aircraft or engine if such aircraft or engine has been exempted from such standard under this part.

# Subpart E—Certification Provisions
§ 34.48
Derivative engines for emissions certification purposes.
(a)
General.
A type certificate holder may request from the FAA a determination that an engine configuration is considered a derivative engine for emissions certification purposes (all gaseous emissions and either nvPM or smoke number as applicable). To be considered a derivative engine for emissions certification purposes under this part, the configuration must have been derived from the original engine that was certificated to the requirements of part 33 of this chapter and one of the following:
(1) The FAA has determined that a safety issue exists that requires an engine modification.
(2) Emissions from the derivative engines are determined to be similar. In general, this means the emissions must meet the criteria specified in paragraph (b) of this section. The FAA may amend the criteria of paragraph (b) in unusual circumstances, for individual cases, consistent with good engineering judgment.
(3) All of the regulated emissions from the derivative engine are lower than the original engine.
(b)
Emission similarity
(1) The type certificate holder must demonstrate that the proposed derivative engine model's emissions meet the applicable standards and differ from the original model's emission rates within the following ranges and values:
(i) ±3.0 g/kN for NO
X
.
(ii) ±1.0 g/kN for HC.
(iii) ±5.0 g/kN for CO.
(iv) ±2.0 SN for smoke (where applicable).
(v) The following values apply for maximum nvPM
MC
, nvPM
mass
, and nvPM
num
(where applicable):
(A) maximum nvPM
MC
:
(
1
) ±200 µg/m3 if the characteristic level of maximum nvPM
MC
is below 1,000 µg/m
3
; or
(
2
) ±20% of the characteristic level if the characteristic level for maximum nvPM
MC
is at or above 1,000 µg/m
3
.
(B) nvPM
mass
:
(
1
) 80 mg/kN if the characteristic level for nvPM
mass
emissions is below 400 mg/kN; or
(
2
) ±20% of the characteristic level if the characteristic level for nvPM
mass
emissions is greater than or equal to 400 mg/kN.
(C) nvPM
num
:
(
1
) 4 × 10
14
particles/kN if the characteristic level for nvPM
num
emissions is below 2×10
15
particles/kN; or
(
2
) ±20% of the characteristic level if the characteristic level for nvPM
num
emissions is greater than or equal to 2 × 10
15
particles/kN.
(2) If the characteristic level of the original certificated engine model (or any other sub-models within the emission type certificate family tested for certification) before modification is at or above 95% of the applicable standard for any pollutant, an applicant must measure the proposed derivative engine model's emissions for all pollutants to demonstrate that the derivative engine's resulting characteristic levels will not exceed the applicable emission standards. If the characteristic levels of the originally certificated engine model (and all other sub-models within the emission type certificate family tested for certification) are below 95% of the applicable standard for each pollutant, the applicant may use engineering analysis consistent with good engineering judgment to demonstrate that the derivative engine will not exceed the applicable emission standards. The engineering analysis must address all modifications from the original engine, including those approved for previous derivative engines.
(3) In unusual circumstances and consistent with good engineering judgement, the FAA may adjust the ranges specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section to evaluate a proposed derivative engine.
(c)
Continued production allowance.
Derivative engines for emissions certification purposes may continue to be produced after the applicability date for new emissions standards when the engines conform to the specifications of this section.
(d)
Non-derivative engines.
If the FAA determines that an engine model does not meet the requirements for a derivative engine for emissions certification purposes, the type certificate holder is required to demonstrate that the engine complies with the emissions standards applicable to a new engine type.

# Subpart G—Test Procedures for Engine Exhaust Gaseous Emissions (Aircraft and Aircraft Gas Turbine Engines)
§ 34.60
Introduction.
(a) Use the equipment and procedures specified in Appendix 3, Appendix 5, and Appendix 6 of ICAO Annex 16, as applicable, to demonstrate whether engines meet the applicable gaseous emission standards specified in subpart C of this part. Measure the emissions of all regulated gaseous pollutants. Use the equipment and procedures specified in Appendix 2 and Appendix 6 of ICAO Annex 16 to determine whether engines meet the applicable smoke standard specified in subpart C of this part. The compliance demonstration consists of establishing a mean value from testing the specified number of engines, then calculating a “characteristic level” by applying a set of statistical factors that take into account the number of engines tested. Round each characteristic level to the same number of decimal places as the corresponding emission standard. For turboprop engines, use the procedures specified for turbofan engines, consistent with good engineering judgment.
(b) Use a test fuel that meets the specifications described in Appendix 4 of ICAO Annex 16. The test fuel must not have additives whose purpose is to
suppress smoke, such as organometallic compounds.
(c) Prepare test engines by including accessories that are available with production engines if they can reasonably be expected to influence emissions. The test engine may not extract shaft power or bleed service air to provide power to auxiliary gearbox-mounted components required to drive aircraft systems.
(d) Test engines must reach a steady operating temperature before the start of emission measurements.
(e) In consultation with the EPA, the FAA may approve alternative procedures for measuring emissions, including testing and sampling methods, analytical techniques, and equipment specifications that differ from those specified in this part. Manufacturers and operators may request approval of alternative procedures by written request with supporting justification to the FAA and to the Designated EPA Program Officer. To be approved, one of the following conditions must be met:
(1) The engine cannot be tested using the specified procedures; or
(2) The alternative procedure is shown to be equivalent to, or more accurate or precise than, the specified procedure.
(f) The following landing and takeoff (LTO) cycles apply for emissions testing and for calculating weighted LTO values:

Before any calculations are made, the FAA must approve the exclusion of any measurements that the applicant seeks to exclude, including any justification for such exclusions.
(k) The system and procedure for sampling and measurement of gaseous emissions shall be as specified by Appendices 1, 4, 6, and 7 of ICAO Annex 16, Volume II (incorporated by reference, see § 34.4).
§ 34.73
Demonstration of compliance for nvPM emissions.
(a) Each compliance demonstration by an applicant requires:
(1) Establishing a mean value from tests conducted on one or more engines;
(2) Calculating a “characteristic level” by applying a set of statistical factors that take into account the number of engines tested in accordance with § 34.71(b) of this part; and
(3) Rounding each characteristic level to the same number of decimal places as the corresponding emission limit.
(b) In demonstrating compliance with this subpart, an applicant must use the
nvPM measurements collected in accordance with § 34.71 as follows:
(1) An engine complies with an applicable standard when the engine type certificate family's characteristic level does not exceed any nvPM limit described in § 34.25 of this part; and
(2) A compliance demonstration consists of:
(i) Determining the maximum nvPM
MC
, and the mean value for nvPM
mass
and nvPM
num
from the data collected in accordance with paragraph § 34.71(f) of this part;
(ii) Correcting each data point to standard temperature and pressure conditions;
(iii) Applying the appropriate statistical factor shown in Table 6-1 of Appendix 6 of ICAO Annex 16, Volume II (incorporated by reference, see § 34.4) to account for the number of engines tested; and
(iv) Rounding each characteristic level to the same number of decimal places as the corresponding nvPM limit in § 34.25 of this part.
(c) (1) In determining maximum nvPM
MC
, an applicant must use one of the following evaluation methods for all engines measured in accordance with § 34.71(c) of this par and using the thrust settings given in § 34.71(h) of this part. An applicant may choose to measure additional thrust settings; while there is no restriction on the number of thrust settings measured, the same thrust settings must be used on each engine tested. A dataset consists of nvPM
MC
measurements made at each thrust setting across the thrust range chosen by the applicant for each engine. Plot all nvPM
MC
measurements versus thrust setting.
(i) Method 1—
(A) Average the individual data points measured at each thrust setting to develop one dataset of nvPM mass concentration for each engine tested, creating an average dataset for each engine; and
(B) Use the averages generated in paragraph (c)(1) of this section to develop a single curve fit to determine the overall maximum nvPM
MC
value;
(ii) Method 2—
(A) Measure individual data points of nvPM
MC
versus thrust. Using all datasets generated for each engine physically tested, develop a single, separate curve fit;
(B) Determine the maximum nvPM
MC
from each engine curve fit resulting from paragraph (c)(1) of this section; and
(C) If more than one engine is physically tested, average the nvPM
MC
values from paragraph (c)(2) of this section to determine the overall maximum nvPM
MC
value for the model tested; or
(iii) Method 3—
(A) Develop a curve fit of nvPM
MC
versus thrust for each test conducted on each engine physically tested;
(B) From each curve fit developed in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, use the resultant curve fit equation to solve for each maximum;
(C) Average the maximum values for each engine physically tested; and
(D) Average the maximum values determined in paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(C) of this section to determine the overall average maximum nvPM
MC
value.
(2) Using the data measured in § 34.71(b) of this part, determine the nvPM characteristic levels for nvPM
num
and nvPM
mass
as follows:
(i) Average all nvPM
num
and nvPM
mass
measurements in units of number of particles per kN or mg per kN, as applicable, from each emissions test at each percentage of rated output thrust setting;
(ii) Multiply the averaged measurement from paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section by the appropriate time in mode (TIM) as shown in § 34.71(h);
(iii) Sum the products from paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section to determine the LTO values for nvPM
num
and nvPM
mass
; and
(iv) Divide the result of paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section by the characteristic level factor, shown in Table A6-1 of Appendix 6 of ICAO Annex 16, Volume II (incorporated by reference, see § 34.4), for the number of engines physically tested to determine the nvPM
mass
and nvPM
num
characteristic values.
(d) The data used to determine the regressed curves must meet a 90% confidence interval, CI
90
, limit of ±1.5% of each nvPM limit specified in § 34.25 of this part. If a certification test fails to meet the CI
90
limit, the engine type
may still comply with the requirements. Failure may be caused by excessive data scatter, too few data points, or erroneous data used to regress an accurate curve. Without deleting or removing any prior measurement data, additional data acquired from further tests may improve the CI
90
by adding to the sample population.
(e) The following information must be reported to the FAA substantiating compliance with nvPM limits of § 34.25 of this part:
(1) The values of nvPM emissions measured and computed in accordance with the procedures and calculated as required by this subpart in § 34.71 of this part and paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section;
(2) For each engine tested:
(i) Engine model, series, and serial number;
(ii) Rated thrust (kN);
(iii) Overall pressure ratio;
(iv) The methods of data acquisition; and
(v) The method of data analysis chosen by the applicant under paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section.

§ 35.15
Safety analysis.
(a)(1) The applicant must analyze the propeller system to assess the likely consequences of all failures that can reasonably be expected to occur. This analysis will take into account, if applicable:
(i) The propeller system in a typical installation. When the analysis depends on representative components, assumed interfaces, or assumed installed conditions, the assumptions must be stated in the analysis.
(ii) Consequential secondary failures and dormant failures.
(iii) Multiple failures referred to in paragraph (d) of this section, or that result in the hazardous propeller effects defined in paragraph (g)(1) of this section.
(2) The applicant must summarize those failures that could result in major propeller effects or hazardous propeller effects defined in paragraph (g) of this section, and estimate the probability of occurrence of those effects.
(3) The applicant must show that hazardous propeller effects are not predicted to occur at a rate in excess of that defined as extremely remote (probability of 10
−7
or less per propeller flight hour). Since the estimated probability for individual failures may be insufficiently precise to enable the applicant to assess the total rate for hazardous propeller effects, compliance may be shown by demonstrating that the probability of a hazardous propeller effect arising from an individual failure can be predicted to be not greater than 10
−8
per propeller flight hour. In dealing with probabilities of this low order of magnitude, absolute proof is not possible and reliance must be placed on engineering judgment and previous experience combined with sound design and test philosophies.
(b) If significant doubt exists as to the effects of failures or likely combination of failures, the Administrator may require assumptions used in the analysis to be verified by test.
(c) The primary failures of certain single propeller elements (for example, blades) cannot be sensibly estimated in numerical terms. If the failure of such elements is likely to result in hazardous propeller effects, those elements must be identified as propeller critical parts. For propeller critical parts, applicants must meet the prescribed integrity specifications of § 35.16. These instances must be stated in the safety analysis.
(d) If reliance is placed on a safety system to prevent a failure progressing to hazardous propeller effects, the possibility of a safety system failure in
combination with a basic propeller failure must be included in the analysis. Such a safety system may include safety devices, instrumentation, early warning devices, maintenance checks, and other similar equipment or procedures. If items of the safety system are outside the control of the propeller manufacturer, the assumptions of the safety analysis with respect to the reliability of these parts must be clearly stated in the analysis and identified in the propeller installation and operation instructions required under § 35.3.
(e) If the safety analysis depends on one or more of the following items, those items must be identified in the analysis and appropriately substantiated.
(1) Maintenance actions being carried out at stated intervals. This includes verifying that items that could fail in a latent manner are functioning properly. When necessary to prevent hazardous propeller effects, these maintenance actions and intervals must be published in the instructions for continued airworthiness required under § 35.4. Additionally, if errors in maintenance of the propeller system could lead to hazardous propeller effects, the appropriate maintenance procedures must be included in the relevant propeller manuals.
(2) Verification of the satisfactory functioning of safety or other devices at pre-flight or other stated periods. The details of this satisfactory functioning must be published in the appropriate manual.
(3) The provision of specific instrumentation not otherwise required. Such instrumentation must be published in the appropriate documentation.
(4) A fatigue assessment.
(f) If applicable, the safety analysis must include, but not be limited to, assessment of indicating equipment, manual and automatic controls, governors and propeller control systems, synchrophasers, synchronizers, and propeller thrust reversal systems.
(g) Unless otherwise approved by the Administrator and stated in the safety analysis, the following failure definitions apply to compliance with this part.
(1) The following are regarded as hazardous propeller effects:
(i) The development of excessive drag.
(ii) A significant thrust in the opposite direction to that commanded by the pilot.
(iii) The release of the propeller or any major portion of the propeller.
(iv) A failure that results in excessive unbalance.
(2) The following are regarded as major propeller effects for variable pitch propellers:

means a helicopter that has been shown under this part to comply with Stage 2 noise limits (including applicable tradeoffs) prescribed in section H36.305 of appendix H of this part, or a helicopter that has been shown under this part to comply with the Stage 2 noise limit prescribed in section J36.305 of appendix J of this part.
(5) A “Stage 3 noise level” means a takeoff, flyover, or approach noise level at or below the Stage 3 noise limits prescribed in section H36.305 of appendix H of this part, or a flyover noise level at or below the Stage 3 noise limit prescribed in section J36.305 of appendix J of this part.
(6) A “Stage 3 helicopter” means a helicopter that has been shown under this part to comply with the Stage 3 noise limits (including applicable tradeoffs) prescribed in section H36.305 of appendix H of this part, or a helicopter that has been shown under this part to comply with the Stage 3 noise limit prescribed in section J36.305 of appendix J of this part.
(7)
Maximum normal operating RPM
means the highest rotor speed corresponding to the airworthiness limit imposed by the manufacturer and approved by the FAA. Where a tolerance on the highest rotor speed is specified, the maximum normal operating rotor speed is the highest rotor speed for which that tolerance is given. If the rotor speed is automatically linked with flight condition, the maximum normal operating rotor speed corresponding with the reference flight condition must be used during the noise certification procedure. If rotor speed can be changed by pilot action, the highest normal operating rotor speed specified in the flight manual limitation section for reference conditions must be used during the noise certification procedure.
(i) For the purpose of showing compliance with this part for tiltrotors, the following terms have the specified meanings:
Airplane mode
means a configuration with nacelles on the down stops (axis aligned horizontally) and rotor speed set to cruise revolutions per minute (RPM).
Airplane mode RPM
means the lower range of rotor rotational speed in RPM defined for the airplane mode cruise flight condition.
Fixed operation points
mean designated nacelle angle positions selected for airworthiness reference. These are default positions used to refer to normal nacelle positioning operation of the aircraft. The nacelle angle is controlled by a self-centering switch. When the nacelle angle is 0 degrees (airplane mode) and the pilot moves the nacelle switch upwards, the nacelles are programmed to automatically turn to the first default position (for example, 60 degrees) where they will stop. A second upward move of the switch will tilt the nacelle to the second default position (for example, 75 degrees). Above the last default position, the nacelle angle can be set to any angle up to approximately 95 degrees by moving the switch in the up or down direction. The number and position of the fixed operation points may vary on different tiltrotor configurations.
Nacelle angle
is defined as the angle between the rotor shaft centerline and the longitudinal axis of the aircraft fuselage.
Tiltrotor
means a class of aircraft capable of vertical take-off and landing, within the powered-lift category, with rotors mounted at or near the wing tips that vary in pitch from near vertical to near horizontal configuration relative to the wing and fuselage.
Vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) mode
means the aircraft state or configuration having the rotors orientated with the axis of rotation in a vertical manner (
i.e.
, nacelle angle of approximately 90 degrees) for vertical takeoff and landing operations.
V
CON
is defined as the maximum authorized speed for any nacelle angle in VTOL/Conversion mode.
VTOL/Conversion mode
is all approved nacelle positions where the design operating rotor speed is used for hover operations.
VTOL mode RPM
means highest range of RPM that occur for takeoff, approach, hover, and conversion conditions.

# Section A36.2 Noise Certification Test and Measurement Conditions
A36.2.1
General.
A36.2.1.1 This section prescribes the conditions under which noise certification must be conducted and the measurement procedures that must be used.

# Note:
Many noise certifications involve only minor changes to the airplane type design. The resulting changes in noise can often be established reliably without resorting to a complete test as outlined in this appendix. For this reason, the FAA permits the
use of approved equivalent procedures. There are also equivalent procedures that may be used in full certification tests, in the interest of reducing costs and providing reliable results. Guidance material on the use of equivalent procedures in the noise certification of subsonic jet and propeller-driven large airplanes is provided in the current advisory circular for this part.
A36.2.2
Test environment.
A36.2.2.1 Locations for measuring noise from an airplane in flight must be surrounded by relatively flat terrain having no excessive sound absorption characteristics such as might be caused by thick, matted, or tall grass, shrubs, or wooded areas. No obstructions that significantly influence the sound field from the airplane must exist within a conical space above the point on the ground vertically below the microphone, the cone being defined by an axis normal to the ground and by a half-angle 80° from this axis.

# Note:
Those people carrying out the measurements could themselves constitute such obstruction.
A36.2.2.2 The tests must be carried out under the following atmospheric conditions.
(a) No precipitation;
(b) Ambient air temperature not above 95 °F (35 °C) and not below 14 °F (−10 °C), and relative humidity not above 95% and not below 20% over the whole noise path between a point 33 ft (10 m) above the ground and the airplane;

# Note:
Care should be taken to ensure that the noise measuring, airplane flight path tracking, and meteorological instrumentation are also operated within their specific environmental limitations.
(c) Relative humidity and ambient temperature over the whole noise path between a point 33 ft (10 m) above the ground and the airplane such that the sound attenuation in the one-third octave band centered on 8 kHz will not be more than 12 dB/100 m unless:
(1) The dew point and dry bulb temperatures are measured with a device which is accurate to ±0.9 °F (±0.5 °C) and used to obtain relative humidity; in addition layered sections of the atmosphere are used as described in section A36.2.2.3 to compute equivalent weighted sound attenuations in each one-third octave band; or
(2) The peak noy values at the time of PNLT, after adjustment to reference conditions, occur at frequencies less than or equal to 400 Hz.;
(d) If the atmospheric absorption coefficients vary over the PNLTM sound propagation path by more than ±1.6 dB/1000 ft (±0.5 dB/100m) in the 3150Hz one-third octave band from the value of the absorption coefficient derived from the meteorological measurement obtained at 33 ft (10 m) above the surface, “layered” sections of the atmosphere must be used as described in section A36.2.2.3 to compute equivalent weighted sound attenuations in each one-third octave band; the FAA will determine whether a sufficient number of layered sections have been used. For each measurement, where multiple layering is not required, equivalent sound attenuations in each one-third octave band must be determined by averaging the atmospheric absorption coefficients for each such band at 33 ft (10 m) above ground level, and at the flight level of the airplane at the time of PNLTM, for each measurement;
(e) Average wind velocity 33 ft (10 m) above ground may not exceed 12 knots and the crosswind velocity for the airplane may not exceed 7 knots. The average wind velocity must be determined using a 30-second averaging period spanning the 10 dB-down time interval. Maximum wind velocity 33 ft (10 m) above ground is not to exceed 15 knots and the crosswind velocity is not to exceed 10 knots during the 10 dB-down time interval;
(f) No anomalous meteorological or wind conditions that would significantly affect the measured noise levels when the noise is recorded at the measuring points specified by the FAA; and
(g) Meteorological measurements must be obtained within 30 minutes of each noise test measurement; meteorological data must be interpolated to actual times of each noise measurement.
A36.2.2.3 When a multiple layering calculation is required by section A36.2.2.2(c) or A36.2.2.2(d) the atmosphere between the airplane and 33 ft (10 m) above the ground must be divided into layers of equal depth. The depth of the layers must be set to not more than the depth of the narrowest layer across which the variation in the atmospheric absorption coefficient of the 3150 Hz one-third octave band is not greater than ±1.6 dB/1000 ft (±0.5 dB/100m), with a minimum layer depth of 100 ft (30 m). This requirement must be met for the propagation path at PNLTM. The mean of the values of the atmospheric absorption coefficients at the top and bottom of each layer may be used to characterize the absorption properties of each layer.
A36.2.2.4 The airport control tower or another facility must be aproved by the FAA for use as the central location at which measurements of atmospheric parameters are representative of those conditions existing over the geographical area in which noise measurements are made.
A36.2.3
Flight path measurement.
A36.2.3.1 The airplane height and lateral position relative to the flight track must be determined by a method independent of normal flight instrumentation such as radar tracking, theodolite triangulation, or photographic scaling techniques, to be approved by the FAA.
A36.2.3.2 The airplane position along the flight path must be related to the noise recorded at the noise measurement locations by means of synchronizing signals over a distance sufficient to assure adequate data during the period that the noise is within 10 dB of the maximum value of PNLT.
A36.2.3.3 Position and performance data required to make the adjustments referred to in section A36.9 of this appendix must be automatically recorded at an approved sampling rate. Measuring equipment must be approved by the FAA.

# Section A36.3 Measurement of Airplane Noise Received on the Ground
A36.3.1
Definitions.
For the purposes of section A36.3 the following definitions apply:
A36.3.1.1
Measurement system
means the combination of instruments used for the measurement of sound pressure levels, including a sound calibrator, windscreen, microphone system, signal recording and conditioning devices, and one-third octave band analysis system.

# Note:
Practical installations may include a number of microphone systems, the outputs from which are recorded simultaneously by a multi-channel recording/analysis device via signal conditioners, as appropriate. For the purpose of this section, each complete measurement channel is considered to be a measurement system to which the requirements apply accordingly.
A36.3.1.2
Microphone system
means the components of the measurement system which produce an electrical output signal in response to a sound pressure input signal, and which generally include a microphone, a preamplifier, extension cables, and other devices as necessary.
A36.3.1.3
Sound incidence angle
means in degrees, an angle between the principal axis of the microphone, as defined in IEC 61094-3 and IEC 61094-4, as amended and a line from the sound source to the center of the diaphragm of the microphone (incorporated by reference, see § 36.6).

# Note:
When the sound incidence angle is 0°, the sound is said to be received at the microphone at “normal (perpendicular) incidence;” when the sound incidence angle is 90°, the sound is said to be received at “grazing incidence.”
A36.3.1.4
Reference direction
means, in degrees, the direction of sound incidence specified by the manufacturer of the microphone, relative to a sound incidence angle of 0°, for which the free-field sensitivity level of the microphone system is within specified tolerance limits.
A36.3.1.5
Free-field sensitivity of a microphone system
means, in volts per Pascal, for a sinusoidal plane progressive sound wave of specified frequency, at a specified sound incidence angle, the quotient of the root mean square voltage at the output of a microphone system and the root mean square sound pressure that would exist at the position of the microphone in its absence.
A36.3.1.6
Free-field sensitivity level of a microphone system
means, in decibels, twenty times the logarithm to the base ten of the ratio of the free-field sensitivity of a microphone system and the reference sensitivity of one volt per Pascal.

# Note:
The free-field sensitivity level of a microphone system may be determined by subtracting the sound pressure level (in decibels re 20 µPa) of the sound incident on the microphone from the voltage level (in decibels re 1 V) at the output of the microphone system, and adding 93.98 dB to the result.
A36.3.1.7
Time-average band sound pressure level
means in decibels, ten times the logarithm to the base ten, of the ratio of the time mean square of the instantaneous sound pressure during a stated time interval and in a specified one-third octave band, to the square of the reference sound pressure of 20 µPa.
A36.3.1.8
Level range
means, in decibels, an operating range determined by the setting of the controls that are provided in a measurement system for the recording and one-third octave band analysis of a sound pressure signal. The upper boundary associated with any particular level range must be rounded to the nearest decibel.
A36.3.1.9
Calibration sound pressure level
means, in decibels, the sound pressure level produced, under reference environmental conditions, in the cavity of the coupler of the sound calibrator that is used to determine the overall acoustical sensitivity of a measurement system.
A36.3.1.10
Reference level range
means, in decibels, the level range for determining the acoustical sensitivity of the measurement system and containing the calibration sound pressure level.
A36.3.1.11
Calibration check frequency
means, in hertz, the nominal frequency of the sinusoidal sound pressure signal produced by the sound calibrator.
A36.3.1.12
Level difference
means, in decibels, for any nominal one-third octave midband frequency, the output signal level measured on any level range minus the level of the corresponding electrical input signal.
A36.3.1.13
Reference level difference
means, in decibels, for a stated frequency, the level difference measured on a level range for an electrical input signal corresponding to the calibration sound pressure level, adjusted as appropriate, for the level range.
A36.3.1.14
Level non-linearity
means, in decibels, the level difference measured on any level range, at a stated one-third octave nominal midband frequency, minus the corresponding reference level difference, all
input and output signals being relative to the same reference quantity.
A36.3.1.15
Linear operating range
means, in decibels, for a stated level range and frequency, the range of levels of steady sinusoidal electrical signals applied to the input of the entire measurement system, exclusive of the microphone but including the microphone preamplifier and any other signal-conditioning elements that are considered to be part of the microphone system, extending from a lower to an upper boundary, over which the level non-linearity is within specified tolerance limits.

# Note:
Microphone extension cables as configured in the field need not be included for the linear operating range determination.
A36.3.1.16
Windscreen insertion loss
means, in decibels, at a stated nominal one-third octave midband frequency, and for a stated sound incidence angle on the inserted microphone, the indicated sound pressure level without the windscreen installed around the microphone minus the sound pressure level with the windscreen installed.
A36.3.2
Reference environmental conditions.
A36.3.2.1 The reference environmental conditions for specifying the performance of a measurement system are:
(a) Air temperature 73.4 °F (23 °C);
(b) Static air pressure 101.325 kPa; and
(c) Relative humidity 50%.
A36.3.3.
General.

# Note:
Measurements of aircraft noise that are made using instruments that conform to the specifications of this section will yield one-third octave band sound pressure levels as a function of time. These one-third octave band levels are to be used for the calculation of effective perceived noise level as described in section A36.4.
A36.3.3.1 The measurement system must consist of equipment approved by the FAA and equivalent to the following:
(a) A windscreen (See A36.3.4.);
(b) A microphone system (See A36.3.5):
(c) A recording and reproducing system to store the measured aircraft noise signals for subsequent analysis (see A36.3.6);
(d) A one-third octave band analysis system (see A36.3.7); and
(e) Calibration systems to maintain the acoustical sensitivity of the above systems within specified tolerance limits (see A36.3.8).
A36.3.3.2. For any component of the measurement system that converts an analog signal to digital form, such conversion must be performed so that the levels of any possible aliases or artifacts of the digitization process will be less than the upper boundary of the linear operating range by at least 50 dB at any frequency less than 12.5 kHz. The sampling rate must be at least 28 kHz. An anti-aliasing filter must be included before the digitization process.
A36.3.4
Windscreen.
A36.3.4.1 In the absence of wind and for sinusoidal sounds at grazing incidence, the insertion loss caused by the windscreen of a stated type installed around the microphone must not exceed ±1.5 dB at nominal one-third octave midband frequencies from 50 Hz to 10 kHz inclusive.
A36.3.5
Microphone system.
A36.3.5.1 The microphone system must meet the specifications in sections A36.3.5.2 to A36.3.5.4. Various microphone systems may be approved by the FAA on the basis of demonstrated equivalent overall electroacoustical performance. Where two or more microphone systems of the same type are used, demonstration that at least one system conforms to the specifications in full is sufficient to demonstrate conformance.

# Note:
An applicant must still calibrate and check each system as required in section A36.3.9.
A36.3.5.2 The microphone must be mounted with the sensing element 4 ft (1.2 m) above the local ground surface and must be oriented for grazing incidence,
i.e.
, with the sensing element substantially in the plane defined by the predicted reference flight path of the aircraft and the measuring station. The microphone mounting arrangement must minimize the interference of the supports with the sound to be measured. Figure A36-1 illustrates sound incidence angles on a microphone.
A36.3.5.3 The free-field sensitivity level of the microphone and preamplifier in the reference direction, at frequencies over at least the range of one-third-octave nominal midband frequencies from 50 Hz to 5 kHz inclusive, must be within ±1.0 dB of that at the calibration check frequency, and within ±2.0 dB for nominal midband frequencies of 6.3 kHz, 8 kHz and 10 kHz.
A36.3.5.4 For sinusoidal sound waves at each one-third octave nominal midband frequency over the range from 50 Hz to 10 kHz inclusive, the free-field sensitivity levels of the microphone system at sound incidence angles of 30°, 60°, 90°, 120° and 150°, must not differ from the free-field sensitivity level at a sound incidence angle of 0° (“normal incidence”) by more than the values shown in Table A36-1. The free-field sensitivity level differences at sound incidence angles between any two adjacent sound incidence angles in Table A36-1 must not exceed the tolerance limit for the greater angle.
ER08JY02.000
A36.3.6
Recording and reproducing systems.
A36.3.6.1 A recording and reproducing system, such as a digital or analog magnetic tape recorder, a computer-based system or other permanent data storage device, must be used to store sound pressure signals for subsequent analysis. The sound produced by the aircraft must be recorded in such a way that a record of the complete acoustical signal is retained. The recording and reproducing systems must meet the specifications in sections A36.3.6.2 to A36.3.6.9 at the recording speeds and/or data sampling rates used for the noise certification tests. Conformance must be demonstrated for the frequency bandwidths and recording channels selected for the tests.
A36.3.6.2 The recording and reproducing systems must be calibrated as described in section A36.3.9.
(a) For aircraft noise signals for which the high frequency spectral levels decrease rapidly with increasing frequency, appropriate pre-emphasis and complementary de-emphasis networks may be included in the measurement system. If pre-emphasis is included, over the range of nominal one-third octave midband frequencies from 800 Hz to 10 kHz inclusive, the electrical gain provided by the pre-emphasis network must not exceed 20 dB relative to the gain at 800 Hz.
A36.3.6.3 For steady sinusoidal electrical signals applied to the input of the entire measurement system including all parts of the microphone system except the microphone at a selected signal level within 5 dB of that corresponding to the calibration sound pressure level on the reference level range, the time-average signal level indicated by the readout device at any one-third octave nominal midband frequency from 50 Hz to 10 kHz inclusive must be within ±1.5 dB of that at the calibration check frequency. The frequency response of a measurement system, which includes components that convert analog signals to digital form, must be within ±0.3 dB of the response at 10 kHz over the frequency range from 10 kHz to 11.2 kHz.

# Note:
Microphone extension cables as configured in the field need not be included for the frequency response determination. This
allowance does not eliminate the requirement of including microphone extension cables when performing the pink noise recording in section A36.3.9.5.
A36.3.6.4 For analog tape recordings, the amplitude fluctuations of a 1 kHz sinusoidal signal recorded within 5 dB of the level corresponding to the calibration sound pressure level must not vary by more than ±0.5 dB throughout any reel of the type of magnetic tape used. Conformance to this requirement must be demonstrated using a device that has time-averaging properties equivalent to those of the spectrum analyzer.
A36.3.6.5 For all appropriate level ranges and for steady sinusoidal electrical signals applied to the input of the measurement system, including all parts of the microphone system except the microphone, at one-third-octave nominal midband frequencies of 50 Hz, 1 kHz and 10 kHz, and the calibration check frequency, if it is not one of these frequencies, the level non-linearity must not exceed ±0.5 dB for a linear operating range of at least 50 dB below the upper boundary of the level range.

# Note 1:
Level linearity of measurement system components may be tested according to the methods described in IEC 61265 as amended.

# Note 2:
Microphone extension cables configured in the field need not be included for the level linearity determination.
A36.3.6.6 On the reference level range, the level corresonding to the calibration sound pressure level must be at least 5 dB, but no more than 30 dB less than the upper boundary of the level range.
A36.3.6.7 The linear operating ranges on adjacent level ranges must overlap by at least 50 dB minus the change in attenuation introduced by a change in the level range controls.

# Note:
It is possible for a measurement system to have level range controls that permit attenuation changes of either 10 dB or 1 dB, for example. With 10 dB steps, the minimum overlap required would be 40 dB, and with 1 dB steps the minimum overlap would be 49 dB.
A36.3.6.8 An overload indicator must be included in the recording and reproducing systems so that an overload indication will occur during an overload condition on any relevant level range.
A36.3.6.9 Attenuators included in the measurement system to permit range changes must operate in known intervals of decibel steps.
A36.3.7
Analysis systems.
A36.3.7.1 The analysis system must conform to the specifications in sections A36.3.7.2 to A36.3.7.7 for the frequency bandwidths, channel configurations and gain settings used for analysis.
A36.3.7.2 The output of the analysis system must consist of one-third octave band sound pressure levels as a function of time, obtained by processing the noise signals (preferably recorded) through an analysis system with the following characteristics:
(a) A set of 24 one-third octave band filters, or their equivalent, having nominal midband frequencies from 50 Hz to 10 kHz inclusive;
(b) Response and averaging properties in which, in principle, the output from any one-third octave filter band is squared, averaged and displayed or stored as time-averaged sound pressure levels;
(c) The interval between successive sound pressure level samples must be 500 ms ±5 milliseconds(ms) for spectral analysis with or without slow time-weighting, as defined in section A36.3.7.4;
(d) For those analysis systems that do not process the sound pressure signals during the period of time required for readout and/or resetting of the analyzer, the loss of data must not exceed a duration of 5 ms; and
(e) The analysis system must operate in real time from 50 Hz through at least 12 kHz inclusive. This requirement applies to all operating channels of a multi-channel spectral analysis system.
A36.3.7.3 The minimum standard for the one-third octave band analysis system is the class 2 electrical performance requirements of IEC 61260 as amended, over the range of one-third octave nominal midband frequencies from 50 Hz through 10 kHz inclusive (incorporated by reference, see § 36.6).

# Note:
IEC 61260 specifies procedures for testing of one-third octave band analysis systems for relative attenuation, anti-aliasing filters, real time operation, level linearity, and filter integrated response (effective bandwidth).
A36.3.7.4 When slow time averaging is performed in the analyzer, the response of the one-third octave band analysis system to a sudden onset or interruption of a constant sinusoidal signal at the respective one-third octave nominal midband frequency, must be measured at sampling instants 0.5, 1, 1.5 and 2 seconds(s) after the onset and 0.5 and 1s after interruption. The rising response must be −4 ±1 dB at 0.5s, −1.75 ±0.75 dB at 1s, −1 ±0.5 dB at 1.5s and −0.5 ±0.5 dB at 2s relative to the steady-state level. The falling response must be such that the sum of the output signal levels, relative to the initial steady-state level, and the corresponding rising response reading is −6.5 ±1 dB, at both 0.5 and 1s. At subsequent times the sum of the rising and falling responses must be −7.5 dB or less. This equates to an exponential averaging process (slow time-weighting) with a nominal 1s time constant (
i.e.,
2s averaging time).
A36.3.7.5 When the one-third octave band sound pressure levels are determined from
the output of the analyzer without slow time-weighting, slow time-weighting must be simulated in the subsequent processing. Simulated slow time-weighted sound pressure levels can be obtained using a continuous exponential averaging process by the following equation:
L
s
(i,k) = 10 log [(0.60653) 10
0.1 Ls[i, (k−1)]
+ (0.39347) 10
0.1 L (i, k)
]
where L
s
(i,k) is the simulated slow time-weighted sound pressure level and L(i,k) is the as-measured 0.5s time average sound pressure level determined from the output of the analyzer for the k-th instant of time and i-th one-third octave band. For k = 1, the slow time-weighted sound pressure L
s
[i, (k − 1 = 0)] on the right hand side should be set to 0 dB. An approximation of the continuous exponential averaging is represented by the following equation for a four sample averaging process for k ≥4:
L
s
(i,k) = 10 log [(0.13) 10
0.1 L[i,(k−3)]
+ (0.21) 10
0.1 L[i, (k−2)]
+ (0.27) 10
0.1 L[i, (k−1)]
+ (0.39) 10
0.1 L[i, k]
]
where L
s
(i, k) is the simulated slow time-weighted sound pressure level and L (i, k) is the as measured 0.5s time average sound pressure level determined from the output of the analyzer for the k-th instant of time and the i-th one-third octave band.
The sum of the weighting factors is 1.0 in the two equations. Sound pressure levels calculated by means of either equation are valid for the sixth and subsequent 0.5s data samples, or for times greater than 2.5s after initiation of data analysis.

# Note:
The coefficients in the two equations were calculated for use in determining equivalent slow time-weighted sound pressure levels from samples of 0.5s time average sound pressure levels. The equations do not work with data samples where the averaging time differs from 0.5s.
A36.3.7.6 The instant in time by which a slow time-weighted sound pressure level is characterized must be 0.75s earlier than the actual readout time.

# Note:
The definition of this instant in time is needed to correlate the recorded noise with the aircraft position when the noise was emitted and takes into account the averaging period of the slow time-weighting. For each 0.5 second data record this instant in time may also be identified as 1.25 seconds after the start of the associated 2 second averaging period.
A36.3.7.7 The resolution of the sound pressure levels, both displayed and stored, must be 0.1 dB or finer.
A36.3.8
Calibration systems.
A36.3.8.1 The acoustical sensitivity of the measurement system must be determined using a sound calibrator generating a known sound pressure level at a known frequency. The minimum standard for the sound calibrator is the class 1L requirements of IEC 60942 as amended (incorporated by reference, see § 36.6).
A36.3.9
Calibration and checking of system.
A36.3.9.1 Calibration and checking of the measurement system and its constituent components must be carried out to the satisfaction of the FAA by the methods specified in sections A36.3.9.2 through A36.3.9.10. The calibration adjustments, including those for environmental effects on sound calibrator output level, must be reported to the FAA and applied to the measured one-third-octave sound pressure levels determined from the output of the analyzer. Data collected during an overload indication are invalid and may not be used. If the overload condition occurred during recording, the associated test data are invalid, whereas if the overload occurred during analysis, the analysis must be repeated with reduced sensitivity to eliminate the overload.
A36.3.9.2 The free-field frequency response of the microphone system may be determined by use of an electrostatic actuator in combination with manufacturer's data or by tests in an anechoic free-field facility. The correction for frequency response must be determined within 90 days of each test series. The correction for non-uniform frequency response of the microphone system must be reported to the FAA and applied to the measured one-third octave band sound pressure levels determined from the output of the analyzer.
A36.3.9.3 When the angles of incidence of sound emitted from the aircraft are within ±30° of grazing incidence at the microphone (see Figure A36-1), a single set of free-field corrections based on grazing incidence is considered sufficient for correction of directional response effects. For other cases, the angle of incidence for each 0.5 second sample must be determined and applied for the correction of incidence effects.
A36.3.9.4 For analog magnetic tape recorders, each reel of magnetic tape must carry at least 30 seconds of pink random or pseudo-random noise at its beginning and end. Data obtained from analog tape-recorded signals will be accepted as reliable only if level differences in the 10 kHz one-third-octave-band are not more than 0.75 dB for the signals recorded at the beginning and end.
A36.3.9.5 The frequency response of the entire measurement system while deployed in the field during the test series, exclusive of the microphone, must be determined at a level within 5 dB of the level corresponding to the calibration sound pressure level on the level range used during the tests for each one-third octave nominal midband frequency from 50 Hz to 10 kHz inclusive, utilizing pink random or pseudo-random noise. Within six months of each test series the output of the
noise generator must be determined by a method traceable to the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology or to an equivalent national standards laboratory as determined by the FAA. Changes in the relative output from the previous calibration at each one-third octave band may not exceed 0.2 dB. The correction for frequency response must be reported to the FAA and applied to the measured one-third octave sound pressure levels determined from the output of the analyzer.
A36.3.9.6 The performance of switched attenuators in the equipment used during noise certification measurements and calibration must be checked within six months of each test series to ensure that the maximum error does not exceed 0.1 dB.
A36.3.9.7 The sound pressure level produced in the cavity of the coupler of the sound calibrator must be calculated for the test environmental conditions using the manufacturer's supplied information on the influence of atmospheric air pressure and temperature. This sound pressure level is used to establish the acoustical sensitivity of the measurement system. Within six months of each test series the output of the sound calibrator must be determined by a method traceable to the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology or to an equivalent national standards laboratory as determined by the FAA. Changes in output from the previous calibration must not exceed 0.2 dB.
A36.3.9.8 Sufficient sound pressure level calibrations must be made during each test day to ensure that the acoustical sensitivity of the measurement system is known at the prevailing environmental conditions corresponding with each test series. The difference between the acoustical sensitivity levels recorded immediately before and immediately after each test series on each day may not exceed 0.5 dB. The 0.5 dB limit applies after any atmospheric pressure corrections have been determined for the calibrator output level. The arithmetic mean of the before and after measurements must be used to represent the acoustical sensitivity level of the measurement system for that test series. The calibration corrections must be reported to the FAA and applied to the measured one-third octave band sound pressure levels determined from the output of the analyzer.
A36.3.9.9 Each recording medium, such as a reel, cartridge, cassette, or diskette, must carry a sound pressure level calibration of at least 10 seconds duration at its beginning and end.
A36.3.9.10 The free-field insertion loss of the windscreen for each one-third octave nominal midband frequency from 50 Hz to 10 kHz inclusive must be determined with sinusoidal sound signals at the incidence angles determined to be applicable for correction of directional response effects per section A36.3.9.3. The interval between angles tested must not exceed 30 degrees. For a windscreen that is undamaged and uncontaminated, the insertion loss may be taken from manufacturer's data. Alternatively, within six months of each test series the insertion loss of the windscreen may be determined by a method traceable to the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology or an equivalent national standards laboratory as determined by the FAA. Changes in the insertion loss from the previous calibration at each one-third-octave frequency band must not exceed 0.4 dB. The correction for the free-field insertion loss of the windscreen must be reported to the FAA and applied to the measured one-third octave sound pressure levels determined from the output of the analyzer.
A36.3.10 Adjustments for ambient noise.
A36.3.10.1 Ambient noise, including both an acoustical background and electrical noise of the measurement system, must be recorded for at least 10 seconds at the measurement points with the system gain set at the levels used for the aircraft noise measurements. Ambient noise must be representative of the acoustical background that exists during the flyover test run. The recorded aircraft noise data is acceptable only if the ambient noise levels, when analyzed in the same way, and quoted in PNL (see A36.4.1.3 (a)), are at least 20 dB below the maximum PNL of the aircraft.
A36.3.10.2 Aircraft sound pressure levels within the 10 dB-down points (see A36.4.5.1) must exceed the mean ambient noise levels determined in section A36.3.10.1 by at least 3 dB in each one-third octave band, or must be adjusted using a method approved by the FAA; one method is described in the current advisory circular for this part.

# Section A36.4 Calculation of Effective Perceived Noise Level From Measured Data
A36.4.1
General.
A36.4.1.1 The basic element for noise certification criteria is the noise evaluation measure known as effective perceived noise level, EPNL, in units of EPNdB, which is a single number evaluator of the subjective effects of airplane noise on human beings. EPNL consists of instantaneous perceived noise level, PNL, corrected for spectral irregularities, and for duration. The spectral irregularity correction, called “tone correction factor”, is made at each time increment for only the maximum tone.
A36.4.1.2 Three basic physical properties of sound pressure must be measured: level, frequency distribution, and time variation. To determine EPNL, the instantaneous sound pressure level in each of the 24 one-third octave bands is required for each 0.5 second increment of time during the airplane noise measurement.
A36.4.1.3 The calculation procedure that uses physical measurements of noise to derive the EPNL evaluation measure of subjective response consists of the following five steps:
(a) The 24 one-third octave bands of sound pressure level are converted to perceived noisiness (noy) using the method described in section A36.4.2.1 (a). The noy values are combined and then converted to instantaneous perceived noise levels, PNL(k).
(b) A tone correction factor C(k) is calculated for each spectrum to account for the subjective response to the presence of spectral irregularities.
(c) The tone correction factor is added to the perceived noise level to obtain tone-corrected perceived noise levels PNLT(k), at each one-half second increment:
PNLT(k) = PNL(k) + C(k)
The instantaneous values of tone-corrected perceived noise level are derived and the maximum value, PNLTM, is determined.
(d) A duration correction factor, D, is computed by integration under the curve of tone-corrected perceived noise level versus time.
(e) Effective perceived noise level, EPNL, is determined by the algebraic sum of the maximum tone-corrected perceived noise level and the duration correction factor:
EPNL = PNLTM + D
A36.4.2
Perceived noise level.
A36.4.2.1 Instantaneous perceived noise levels, PNL(k), must be calculated from instantaneous one-third octave band sound pressure levels, SPL(i, k) as follows:
(a) Step 1: For each one-third octave band from 50 through 10,000 Hz, convert SPL(i, k) to perceived noisiness n(i, k), by using the mathematical formulation of the noy table given in section A36.4.7.
(b) Step 2: Combine the perceived noisiness values, n(i, k), determined in step 1 by using the following formula:
ER08JY02.001
where n(k) is the largest of the 24 values of n(i, k) and N(k) is the total perceived noisiness.
(c) Step 3: Convert the total perceived noisiness, N(k), determined in Step 2 into perceived noise level, PNL(k), using the following formula:
ER08JY02.002

# Note:
PNL(k) is plotted in the current advisory circular for this part.
A36.4.3
Correction for spectral irregularities.
A36.4.3.1 Noise having pronounced spectral irregularities (for example, the maximum discrete frequency components or tones) must be adjusted by the correction factor C(k) calculated as follows:
(a) Step 1: After applying the corrections specified under section A36.3.9, start with the sound pressure level in the 80 Hz one-third octave band (band number 3), calculate the changes in sound pressure level (or “slopes”) in the remainder of the one-third octave bands as follows:
s
(3,
k
) = no value
s(4,
k
) = SPL(4,
k
)−SPL(3,
k
)
•
•
s(
i,k
) = SPL(
i,k
)−SPL(
i
−1,
k
)
•
•
s(24,
k
) = SPL(24,
k
)−SPL(23,
k
)
(b) Step 2: Encircle the value of the slope, s(i, k), where the absolute value of the change in slope is greater than five; that is where:
|Δ
s
(
i,k
)| = |
s
(
i,k
)−
s
(
i
−1,
k
)|
5
(c) Step 3:
(1) If the encircled value of the slope s(i, k) is positive and algebraically greater than the slope s(i−1, k) encircle SPL(i, k).
(2) If the encircled value of the slope s(i, k) is zero or negative and the slope s(i−1, k) is positive, encircle SPL(i−1, k).
(3) For all other cases, no sound pressure level value is to be encircled.
(d) Step 4: Compute new adjusted sound pressure levels SPL′(i, k) as follows:
(1) For non-encircled sound pressure levels, set the new sound pressure levels equal to the original sound pressure levels, SPL′(i, k) = SPL(i, k).
(2) For encircled sound pressure levels in bands 1 through 23 inclusive, set the new sound pressure level equal to the arithmetic average of the preceding and following sound pressure levels as shown below:
SPL′(
i,k
) =
1/2
[SPL(
i
−1,
k
) + SPL(
i
+ 1,
k
)]
(3) If the sound pressure level in the highest frequency band (i = 24) is encircled, set the new sound pressure level in that band equal to:
SPL′(24,
k
) = SPL(23,
k
) +
s
(23,
k
)
(e) Step 5: Recompute new slope s′(i, k), including one for an imaginary 25th band, as follows:
s
′(3,
k
) =
s
′(4,
k
)
s
′(4,
k
) = SPL′(4,
k
)−SPL′(3,
k
)
•
•
s
′(
i,k
) = SPL′(
i,k
)−SPL′(
i
−1,
k
)
•
•
s
′(24,
k
) = SPL′(24,
k
)−SPL′(23,
k
)
s
′(25,
k
) =
s
′(24,
k
)
(f) Step 6: For i, from 3 through 23, compute the arithmetic average of the three adjacent slopes as follows:
s
(
i,k
) =
1/3
[
s
′(
i,k
) +
s
′(
i
+ 1,
k
) +
s
′(
i
+ 2,
k
)]
(g) Step 7: Compute final one-third octave-band sound pressure levels, SPL′ (i,k), by beginning with band number 3 and proceeding to band number 24 as follows:
SPL′(3,
k
) = SPL(3,k)
SPL′(4,
k
) = SPL′(3,k) +
s
(3,
k
)
•
•
SPL′(
i,k
) = SPL′(i−1,k) +
s
(i−1,k)
•
•
SPL′(24,
k
) = SPL′(23,k) +
s
(23,k)
(h) Setp 8: Calculate the differences, F (i,k), between the original sound pressure level and the final background sound pressure level as follows:
F
(
i,k
) = SPL(
i,k
)-SPL′(
i,k
)
and note only values equal to or greater than 1.5.
(i) Step 9: For each of the relevant one-third octave bands (3 through 24), determine tone correction factors from the sound pressure level differences F (i, k) and Table A36-2.
ER08JY02.003
(j) Step 10: Designate the largest of the tone correction factors, determined in Step 9, as C(k). (An example of the tone correction procedure is given in the current advisory circular for this part). Tone-corrected perceived noise levels PNLT(k) must be determined by adding the C(k) values to corresponding PNL(k) values, that is:
PNLT(
k
) = PNL(
k
) +
C
(
k
)
For any i-th one-third octave band, at any k-th increment of time, for which the tone correction factor is suspected to result from something other than (or in addition to) an actual tone (or any spectral irregularity other than airplane noise), an additional analysis may be made using a filter with a bandwidth narrower than one-third of an octave. If the narrow band analysis corroborates these suspicions, then a revised value for the background sound pressure level
SPL′(i,k), may be determined from the narrow band analysis and used to compute a revised tone correction factor for that particular one-third octave band. Other methods of rejecting spurious tone corrections may be approved.
A36.4.3.2 The tone correction procedure will underestimate EPNL if an important tone is of a frequency such that it is recorded in two adjacent one-third octave bands. An applicant must demonstrate that either:
(a) No important tones are recorded in two adjacent one-third octave bands; or
(b) That if an important tone has occurred, the tone correction has been adjusted to the value it would have had if the tone had been recorded fully in a single one-third octave band.
A36.4.4 Maximum tone-corrected perceived noise level
A36.4.4.1 The maximum tone-corrected perceived noise level, PNLTM, must be the maximum calculated value of the tone-corrected perceived noise level PNLT(k). It must be calculated using the procedure of section A36.4.3. To obtain a satisfactory noise time history, measurements must be made at 0.5 second time intervals.

# Note 1:
Figure A36-2 is an example of a flyover noise time history where the maximum value is clearly indicated.

# Note 2:
In the absence of a tone correction factor, PNLTM would equal PNLM.
ER08JY02.004
A36.4.4.2 After the value of PNLTM is obtained, the frequency band for the largest tone correction factor is identified for the two preceding and two succeeding 500 ms data samples. This is performed in order to identity the possibility of tone suppression at PNLTM by one-third octave band sharing of that tone. If the value of the tone correction factor C(k) for PNLTM is less than the average value of C(k) for the five consecutive time intervals, the average value of C(k) must be used to compute a new value for PNLTM.
A36.4.5
Duration correction.
A36.4.5.1 The duration correction factor D determined by the integration technique is defined by the expression:
ER08JY02.005
where T is a normalizing time constant, PNLTM is the maximum value of PNLT, t(1) is the first point of time after which PNLT becomes greater than PNLTM-10, and t(2) is the point of time after which PNLT remains constantly less than PNLTM-10.
A36.4.5.2 Since PNLT is calculated from measured values of sound pressure level (SPL), there is no obvious equation for PNLT as a function of time. Consequently, the equation is to be rewritten with a summation sign instead of an integral sign as follows:
ER08JY02.006
where Δt is the length of the equal increments of time for which PNLT(k) is calculated and d is the time interval to the nearest 0.5s during which PNLT(k) remains greater or equal to PNLTM-10.
A36.4.5.3 To obtain a satisfactory history of the perceived noise level use one of the following:
(a) Half-Second time intervals for Δt; or
(b) A shorter time interval with approved limits and constants.
A36.4.5.4 The following values for T and Δt must be used in calculating D in the equation given in section A36.4.5.2:
T = 10 s, and
Δt = 0.5s (or the approved sampling time interval).
Using these values, the equation for D becomes:
ER08JY02.007
where d is the duration time defined by the points corresponding to the values PNLTM-10.
A36.4.5.5 If in using the procedures given in section A36.4.5.2, the limits of PNLTM-10 fall between the calculated PNLT(k) values (the usual case), the PNLT(k) values defining the limits of the duration interval must be chosen from the PNLT(k) values closest to PNLTM-10. For those cases with more than one peak value of PNLT(k), the applicable limits must be chosen to yield the largest possible value for the duration time.
A36.4.6
Effective perceived noise level.
The total subjective effect of an airplane noise event, designated effective perceived noise level, EPNL, is equal to the algebraic sum of the maximum value of the tone-corrected perceived noise level, PNLTM, and the duration correction D. That is:
EPNL = PNLTM + D
where PNLTM and D are calculated using the procedures given in sections A36.4.2, A36.4.3, A36.4.4. and A36.4.5.
A36.4.7
Mathematical formulation of noy tables.
A36.4.7.1 The relationship between sound pressure level (SPL) and the logarithm of perceived noisiness is illustrated in Figure A36-3 and Table A36-3.
A36.4.7.2 The bases of the mathematical formulation are:
(a) The slopes (M(b), M(c), M(d) and M(e)) of the straight lines;
(b) The intercepts (SPL(b) and SPL(c)) of the lines on the SPL axis; and
(c) The coordinates of the discontinuities, SPL(a) and log n(a); SPL(d) and log n = −1.0; and SPL(e) and log n = log (0.3).
A36.4.7.3 Calculate noy values using the following equations:
(a)
SPL ≥SPL (a)
n = antilog {(c)[SPL−SPL(c)]}
(b)
SPL(b) ≤SPL
SPL(a)
n = antilog {M(b)[SPL−SPL(b)]}
(c)
SPL(e) ≤SPL
SPL(b)
n = 0.3 antilog {M(e)[SPL−SPL(e)]}
(d)
SPL(d) ≤SPL
SPL(e)
n = 0.1 antilog {M(d)[SPL−SPL(d)]}
A36.4.7.4 Table A36-3 lists the values of the constants necessary to calculate perceived noisiness as a function of sound pressure level.

A36.5.3
Reporting of noise certification reference conditions.
A36.5.3.1 Airplane position and performance data and the noise measurements must be corrected to the noise certification reference conditions specified in the relevant sections of appendix B of this part. The applicant must report these conditions, including reference parameters, procedures and configurations.
A36.5.4
Validity of results.
A36.5.4.1 Three average reference EPNL values and their 90 percent confidence limits must be produced from the test results and reported, each such value being the arithmetical average of the adjusted acoustical measurements for all valid test runs at each measurement point (flyover, lateral, or approach). If more than one acoustic measurement system is used at any single measurement location, the resulting data for each test run must be averaged as a single measurement. The calculation must be performed by:
(a) Computing the arithmetic average for each flight phase using the values from each microphone point; and
(b) Computing the overall arithmetic average for each reference condition (flyover, lateral or approach) using the values in paragraph (a) of this section and the related 90 percent confidence limits.
A36.5.4.2 For each of the three certification measuring points, the minimum sample size is six. The sample size must be large enough to establish statistically for each of the three average noise certification levels a 90 percent confidence limit not exceeding ±1.5 EPNdB. No test result may be omitted from the averaging process unless approved by the FAA.

# Note:
Permitted methods for calculating the 90 percent confidence interval are shown in the current advisory circular for this part.
A36.5.4.3 The average EPNL figures obtained by the process described in section A36.5.4.1 must be those by which the noise performance of the airplane is assessed against the noise certification criteria.

# Section A36.7 Sound Attenuation in Air
A36.7.1 The atmospheric attenuation of sound must be determined in accordance with the procedure presented in section A36.7.2.
A36.7.2 The relationship between sound attenuation, frequency, temperature, and humidity is expressed by the following equations.
A36.7.2(a) For calculations using the English System of Units:
ER08JY02.010
and
ER08JY02.011
where

in Table A36-5;
α(i) is the attenuation coefficient in dB/1000 ft;
θ is the temperature in °F; and

# Section A36.8 [Reserved]

# Section A36.9 Adjustment of Airplane Flight Test Results.
A36.9.1 When certification test conditions are not identical to reference conditions, appropriate adjustments must be made to the measured noise data using the methods described in this section.
A36.9.1.1 Adjustments to the measured noise values must be made using one of the methods described in sections A36.9.3 and A36.9.4 for differences in the following:
(a) Attenuation of the noise along its path as affected by “inverse square” and atmospheric attenuation
(b) Duration of the noise as affected by the distance and the speed of the airplane relative to the measuring point
(c) Source noise emitted by the engine as affected by the differences between test and reference engine operating conditions
(d) Airplane/engine source noise as affected by differences between test and reference airspeeds. In addition to the effect on duration, the effects of airspeed on component noise sources must be accounted for as follows: for conventional airplane configurations, when differences between test and reference airspeeds exceed 15 knots (28 km/h) true airspeed, test data and/or analysis approved by the FAA must be used to quantify the effects of the airspeed adjustment on resulting certification noise levels.
A36.9.1.2 The “integrated” method of adjustment, described in section A36.9.4, must be used on takeoff or approach under the following conditions:
(a) When the amount of the adjustment (using the “simplified” method) is greater than 8 dB on flyover, or 4 dB on approach; or
(b) When the resulting final EPNL value on flyover or approach (using the simplified method) is within 1 dB of the limiting noise levels as prescribed in section B36.5 of this part.
A36.9.2
Flight profiles.
As described below, flight profiles for both test and reference conditions are defined by their geometry relative to the ground, together with the associated airplane speed relative to the ground, and the associated engine control parameter(s) used for determining the noise emission of the airplane.
A36.9.2.1
Takeoff Profile.

# Note:
Figure A36-4 illustrates a typical takeoff profile.
(a) The airplane begins the takeoff roll at point A, lifts off at point B and begins its first climb at a constant angle at point C. Where thrust or power (as appropriate) cut-back is used, it is started at point D and completed at point E. From here, the airplane begins a second climb at a constant angle up to point F, the end of the noise certification takeoff flight path.
(b) Position K
1
is the takeoff noise measuring station and AK
1
is the distance from start of roll to the flyover measuring point. Position K
2
is the lateral noise measuring station, which is located on a line parallel to, and the specified distance from, the runway center line where the noise level during takeoff is greatest.
(c) The distance AF is the distance over which the airplane position is measured and synchronized with the noise measurements, as required by section A36.2.3.2 of this part.
A36.9.2.2
Approach Profile.

# Note:
Figure A36-5 illustrates a typical approach profile.
(a) The airplane begins its noise certification approach flight path at point G and touches down on the runway at point J, at a distance OJ from the runway threshold.
(b) Position K
3
is the approach noise measuring station and K
3
O is the distance from the approach noise measurement point to the runway threshold.
(c) The distance GI is the distance over which the airplane position is measured and synchronized with the noise measurements, as required by section A36.2.3.2 of this part.
ER08JY02.015
The airplane reference point for approach measurements is the instrument landing system (ILS) antenna. If no ILS antenna is installed an alternative reference point must be approved by the FAA.
A36.9.3
Simplified method of adjustment.
A36.9.3.1
General.
As described below, the simplified adjustment method consists of applying adjustments (to the EPNL, which is calculated from the measured data) for the differences between measured and reference conditions at the moment of PNLTM.
A36.9.3.2
Adjustments to PNL and PNLT.
(a) The portions of the test flight path and the reference flight path described below, and illustrated in Figure A36-6, include the noise time history that is relevant to the calculation of flyover and approach EPNL. In figure A36-6:

(i) Form the same angle θ with their respective flight paths; and

# Note:
For the lateral noise measurement, sound propagation is affected not only by inverse square and atmospheric attenuation, but also by ground absorption and reflection effects which depend mainly on the angle ψ.

arithmetically to the EPNL calculated from the measured data.
A36.9.3.2.2 If, during a test flight, several peak values of PNLT that are within 2 dB of PNLTM are observed, the procedure defined in section A36.9.3.2.1 must be applied at each peak, and the adjustment term, calculated according to section A36.9.3.2.1, must be added to each peak to give corresponding adjusted peak values of PNLT. If these peak values exceed the value at the moment of PNLTM, the maximum value of such exceedance must be added as a further adjustment to the EPNL calculated from the measured data.
A36.9.3.3
Adjustments to duration correction.
A36.9.3.3.1 Whenever the measured flight paths and/or the ground velocities of the test conditions differ from the reference flight paths and/or the ground velocities of the reference conditions, duration adjustments must be applied to the EPNL values calculated from the measured data. The adjustments must be calculated as described below.

A36.9.3.4
Source noise adjustments.
A36.9.3.4.1 To account for differences between the parameters affecting engine noise as measured in the certification flight tests, and those calculated or specified in the reference conditions, the source noise adjustment must be calculated and applied. The adjustment is determined from the manufacturer's data approved by the FAA. Typical data used for this adjustment are illustrated in Figure A36-8 that shows a curve of EPNL versus the engine control parameter μ, with the EPNL data being corrected to all the other relevant reference conditions (airplane mass, speed and altitude, air temperature) and for the difference in noise between the test engine and the average engine (as defined in section B36.7(b)(7)). A sufficient number of data points over a range of values of μ
r
is required to calculate the source noise adjustments for lateral, flyover and approach noise measurements.

A36.9.3.5
Symmetry adjustments.
A36.9.3.5.1 A symmetry adjustment to each lateral noise value (determined at the section B36.4(b) measurement points), is to be made as follows:
(a) If the symmetrical measurement point is opposite the point where the highest noise level is obtained on the main lateral measurement line, the certification noise level is the arithmetic mean of the noise levels measured at these two points (see Figure A36-9(a));
(b) If the condition described in paragraph (a) of this section is not met, then it is assumed that the variation of noise with the altitude of the airplane is the same on both sides; there is a constant difference between the lines of noise versus altitude on both sides (see figure A36-9(b)). The certification noise level is the maximum value of the mean between these lines.

A36.9.4
Integrated method of adjustment
A36.9.4.1
General.
As described in this section, the integrated adjustment method consists of recomputing under reference conditions points on the PNLT time history corresponding to measured points obtained during the tests, and computing EPNL directly for the new time history obtained in this way. The main principles are described in sections A36.9.4.2 through A36.9.4.4.1.

For the lateral noise measurement, sound propagation is affected not only by “inverse square” and atmospheric attenuation, but also by ground absorption and reflection effects which depend mainly on the angle.

# Note:
For the flight paths described in paragraphs A36.9.4.2(a) and (b), the use of thrust or power cut-back will result in test and reference flight paths at full thrust or power and at cut-back thrust or power. Where the transient region between these thrust or power levels affects the final result, an interpolation must be made between them by an approved method such as that given in the current advisory circular for this part.

# Section B36.1 Noise measurement and evaluation
(a) The procedures of Appendix A of this part, or approved equivalent procedures, must be used to determine noise levels of an airplane. These noise levels must be used to show compliance with the requirements of this appendix.
(b) For Stage 4 airplanes, an acceptable alternative to paragraph (a) of this section for noise measurement and evaluation is Appendix 2 to ICAO Annex 16, Volume I, Amendment 7 (Incorporated by reference, see § 36.6).
(c) For Stage 5 airplanes, an acceptable alternative to paragraph (a) of this section for noise measurement and evaluation is Appendix 2 to ICAO Annex 16, Volume 1, Amendment 11-B (Incorporated by reference, see § 36.6).

# Section B36.2 Noise Evaluation Metric
The noise evaluation metric is the effective perceived noise level expressed in EPNdB, as calculated using the procedures of appendix A of this part.

# Section B36.3 Reference Noise Measurement Points
When tested using the procedures of this part, except as provided in section B36.6, an airplane may not exceed the noise levels specified in section B36.5 at the following points on level terrain:
(a) Lateral full-power reference noise measurement point:
(1) For jet airplanes: The point on a line parallel to and 1,476 feet (450 m) from the runway centerline, or extended centerline, where the noise level after lift-off is at a maximum during takeoff. For the purpose of showing compliance with Stage 1 or Stage 2 noise limits for an airplane powered by more than three jet engines, the distance from the runway centerline must be 0.35 nautical miles (648 m). For jet airplanes, when approved by the FAA, the maximum lateral noise at takeoff thrust may be assumed to occur at the point (or its approved equivalent) along the extended centerline of the runway where the airplane reaches 985 feet (300 meters) altitude above ground level. A height of 1427 feet (435 meters) may be assumed for Stage 1 or Stage 2 four engine airplanes. The altitude of the airplane as it passes the noise measurement points must be within + 328 to −164 feet (+100 to −50 meters) of the target altitude. For airplanes powered by other than jet engines, the altitude for maximum lateral noise must be determined experimentally.
(2) For propeller-driven airplanes: The point on the extended centerline of the runway above which the airplane, at full takeoff power, reaches a height of 2,133 feet (650 meters). For tests conducted before August 7, 2002, an applicant may use the measurement point specified in section B36.3(a)(1) as an alternative.
(b) Flyover reference noise measurement point: The point on the extended centerline of the runway that is 21,325 feet (6,500 m) from the start of the takeoff roll;
(c) Approach reference noise measurement point: The point on the extended centerline of the runway that is 6,562 feet (2,000 m) from the runway threshold. On level ground, this corresponds to a position that is 394 feet (120 m) vertically below the 3° descent path, which originates at a point on the runway 984 feet (300 m) beyond the threshold.

# Section B36.4 Test noise measurement points.
(a) If the test noise measurement points are not located at the reference noise measurement points, any corrections for the difference in position are to be made using the same adjustment procedures as for the differences between test and reference flight paths.
(b) The applicant must use a sufficient number of lateral test noise measurement points to demonstrate to the FAA that the maximum noise level on the appropriate lateral line has been determined. For jet airplanes, simultaneous measurements must be made at one test noise measurement point at its symmetrical point on the other side of the runway. Propeller-driven airplanes have an inherent asymmetry in lateral noise. Therefore, simultaneous measurements must
be made at each and every test noise measurement point at its symmetrical position on the opposite side of the runway. The measurement points are considered to be symmetrical if they are longitudinally within 33 feet (±10 meters) of each other.

# Section B36.5 Maximum Noise Levels
Except as provided in section B36.6 of this appendix, maximum noise levels, when determined in accordance with the noise evaluation methods of appendix A of this part, may not exceed the following:
(a) For acoustical changes to Stage 1 airplanes, regardless of the number of engines, the noise levels prescribed under § 36.7(c) of this part.
(b) For any Stage 2 airplane regardless of the number of engines:
(1) Flyover: 108 EPNdB for maximum weight of 600,000 pounds or more; for each halving of maximum weight (from 600,000 pounds), reduce the limit by 5 EPNdB; the limit is 93 EPNdB for a maximum weight of 75,000 pounds or less.
(2) Lateral and approach: 108 EPNdB for maximum weight of 600,000 pounds or more; for each halving of maximum weight (from 600,000 pounds), reduce the limit by 2 EPNdB; the limit is 102 EPNdB for a maximum weight of 75,000 pounds or less.
(c) For any Stage 3 airplane:
(1) Flyover.
(i) For airplanes with more than 3 engines: 106 EPNdB for maximum weight of 850,000 pounds or more; for each halving of maximum weight (from 850,000 pounds), reduce the limit by 4 EPNdB; the limit is 89 EPNdB for a maximum weight of 44,673 pounds or less;
(ii) For airplanes with 3 engines: 104 EPNdB for maximum weight of 850,000 pounds or more; for each halving of maximum weight (from 850,000 pounds), reduce the limit by 4 EPNdB; the limit is 89 EPNdB for a maximum weight of 63,177 pounds or less; and
(iii) For airplanes with fewer than 3 engines: 101 EPNdB for maximum weight of 850,000 pounds or more; for each halving of maximum weight (from 850,000 pounds), reduce the limit by 4 EPNdB; the limit is 89 EPNdB for a maximum weight of 106,250 pounds or less.
(2) Lateral, regardless of the number of engines: 103 EPNdB for maximum weight of 882,000 pounds or more; for each halving of maximum weight (from 882,000 pounds), reduce the limit by 2.56 EPNdB; the limit is 94 EPNdB for a maximum weight of 77,200 pounds or less.
(3) Approach, regardless of the number of engines: 105 EPNdB for maximum weight of 617,300 pounds or more; for each halving of maximum weight (from 617,300 pounds), reduce the limit by 2.33 EPNdB; the limit is 98 EPNdB for a maximum weight of 77,200 pounds or less.
(d) For any Stage 4 airplane, the flyover, lateral, and approach maximum noise levels are prescribed in Chapter 4, Paragraph 4.4, Maximum Noise Levels, and Chapter 3, Paragraph 3.4, Maximum Noise Levels, of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Annex 16, Environmental Protection, Volume I, Aircraft Noise, Third Edition, July 1993, Amendment 7, effective March 21, 2002. [Incorporated by reference, see § 36.6].
(e) For any Stage 5 airplane, the flyover, lateral, and approach maximum noise levels are prescribed in Chapter 14, Paragraph 14.4, Maximum Noise Levels of ICAO Annex 16, Volume I, Amendment 11-B (Incorporated by reference, see § 36.6).

# Section B36.6 Trade-Offs
Except when prohibited by sections 36.7(c)(1) and 36.7(d)(1)(ii), if the maximum noise levels are exceeded at any one or two measurement points, the following conditions must be met:
(a) The sum of the exceedance(s) may not be greater than 3 EPNdB;
(b) Any exceedance at any single point may not be greater than 2 EPNdB, and
(c) Any exceedance(s) must be offset by a corresponding amount at another point or points.

# Section B36.7 Noise Certification Reference Procedures and Conditions
(a) General conditions:
(1) All reference procedures must meet the requirements of section 36.3 of this part.
(2) Calculations of airplane performance and flight path must be made using the reference procedures and must be approved by the FAA.
(3) Applicants must use the takeoff and approach reference procedures prescribed in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
(4) [Reserved]
(5) The reference procedures must be determined for the following reference conditions. The reference atmosphere is homogeneous in terms of temperature and relative humidity when used for the calculation of atmospheric absorption coefficients.
(i) Sea level atmospheric pressure of 2116 pounds per square foot (psf) (1013.25 hPa);
(ii) Ambient sea-level air temperature of 77 °F (25 °C,
i.e.
, ISA + 10 °C);
(iii) Relative humidity of 70 per cent;
(iv) Zero wind.
(v) In defining the reference takeoff flight path(s) for the takeoff and lateral noise measurements, the runway gradient is zero.
(b) Takeoff reference procedure:
The takeoff reference flight path is to be calculated using the following:
(1) Average engine takeoff thrust or power must be used from the start of takeoff to the
point where at least the following height above runway level is reached. The takeoff thrust/power used must be the maximum available for normal operations given in the performance section of the airplane flight manual under the reference atmospheric conditions given in section B36.7(a)(5).
(i) For Stage 1 airplanes and for Stage 2 airplanes that do not have jet engines with a bypass ratio of 2 or more, the following apply:
(A): For airplanes with more than three jet engines—700 feet (214 meters).
(B): For all other airplanes—1,000 feet (305 meters).
(ii) For Stage 2 airplanes that have jet engines with a bypass ratio of 2 or more and for Stage 3 airplanes, the following apply:
(A): For airplanes with more than three engines—689 feet (210 meters).
(B): For airplanes with three engines—853 feet (260 meters).
(C): For airplanes with fewer than three engines—984 feet (300 meters).
(2) Upon reaching the height specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, airplane thrust or power must not be reduced below that required to maintain either of the following, whichever is greater:
(i) A climb gradient of 4 per cent; or
(ii) In the case of multi-engine airplanes, level flight with one engine inoperative.
(3) For the purpose of determining the lateral noise level, the reference flight path must be calculated using full takeoff power throughout the test run without a reduction in thrust or power. For tests conducted before August 7, 2002, a single reference flight path that includes thrust cutback in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section, is an acceptable alternative in determining the lateral noise level.
(4) The takeoff reference speed is the all-engine operating takeoff climb speed selected by the applicant for use in normal operation; this speed must be at least V2 + 10kt (V2 + 19km/h) but may not be greater than V2 + 20kt (V2 + 37km/h). This speed must be attained as soon as practicable after lift-off and be maintained throughout the takeoff noise certification test. For Concorde airplanes, the test day speeds and the acoustic day reference speed are the minimum approved value of V2 + 35 knots, or the all-engines-operating speed at 35 feet, whichever speed is greater as determined under the regulations constituting the type certification basis of the airplane; this reference speed may not exceed 250 knots. For all airplanes, noise values measured at the test day speeds must be corrected to the acoustic day reference speed.
(5) The takeoff configuration selected by the applicant must be maintained constantly throughout the takeoff reference procedure, except that the landing gear may be retracted. Configuration means the center of gravity position, and the status of the airplane systems that can affect airplane performance or noise. Examples include, the position of lift augmentation devices, whether the APU is operating, and whether air bleeds and engine power take-offs are operating;
(6) The weight of the airplane at the brake release must be the maximum takeoff weight at which the noise certification is requested, which may result in an operating limitation as specified in § 36.1581(d); and
(7) The average engine is defined as the average of all the certification compliant engines used during the airplane flight tests, up to and during certification, when operating within the limitations and according to the procedures given in the Flight Manual. This will determine the relationship of thrust/power to control parameters (e.g., N
1
or EPR). Noise measurements made during certification tests must be corrected using this relationship.
(c) Approach reference procedure:
The approach reference flight path must be calculated using the following:
(1) The airplane is stabilized and following a 3° glide path;
(2) For subsonic airplanes, a steady approach speed of V
ref
+ 10 kts (V
ref
+ 19 km/h) with thrust and power stabilized must be established and maintained over the approach measuring point. V
ref
is the reference landing speed, which is defined as the speed of the airplane, in a specified landing configuration, at the point where it descends through the landing screen height in the determination of the landing distance for manual landings. For Concorde airplanes, a steady approach speed that is either the landing reference speed + 10 knots or the speed used in establishing the approved landing distance under the airworthiness regulations constituting the type certification basis of the airplane, whichever speed is greater. This speed must be established and maintained over the approach measuring point.
(3) The constant approach configuration used in the airworthiness certification tests, but with the landing gear down, must be maintained throughout the approach reference procedure;
(4) The weight of the airplane at touchdown must be the maximum landing weight permitted in the approach configuration defined in paragraph (c)(3) of this section at which noise certification is requested, except as provided in § 36.1581(d) of this part; and
(5) The most critical configuration must be used; this configuration is defined as that which produces the highest noise level with normal deployment of aerodynamic control surfaces including lift and drag producing devices, at the weight at which certification is requested. This configuration includes all those items listed in section A36.5.2.5 of appendix A of this part that contribute to the
noisiest continuous state at the maximum landing weight in normal operation.

# Section B36.8 Noise Certification Test Procedures
(a) All test procedures must be approved by the FAA.
(b) The test procedures and noise measurements must be conducted and processed in an approved manner to yield the noise evaluation metric EPNL, in units of EPNdB, as described in appendix A of this part.
(c) Acoustic data must be adjusted to the reference conditions specified in this appendix using the methods described in appendix A of this part. Adjustments for speed and thrust must be made as described in section A36.9 of this part.
(d) If the airplane's weight during the test is different from the weight at which noise certification is requested, the required EPNL adjustment may not exceed 2 EPNdB for each takeoff and 1 EPNdB for each approach. Data approved by the FAA must be used to determine the variation of EPNL with weight for both takeoff and approach test conditions. The necessary EPNL adjustment for variations in approach flight path from the reference flight path must not exceed 2 EPNdB.
(e) For approach, a steady glide path angle of 3° ±0.5° is acceptable.
(f) If equivalent test procedures different from the reference procedures are used, the test procedures and all methods for adjusting the results to the reference procedures must be approved by the FAA. The adjustments may not exceed 16 EPNdB on takeoff and 8 EPNdB on approach. If the adjustment is more than 8 EPNdB on takeoff, or more than 4 EPNdB on approach, the resulting numbers must be more than 2 EPNdB below the limit noise levels specified in section B36.5.
(g) During takeoff, lateral, and approach tests, the airplane variation in instantaneous indicated airspeed must be maintained within ±3% of the average airspeed between the 10 dB-down points. This airspeed is determined by the pilot's airspeed indicator. However, if the instantaneous indicated airspeed exceeds ±3 kt (±5.5 km/h) of the average airspeed over the 10 dB-down points, and is determined by the FAA representative on the flight deck to be due to atmospheric turbulence, then the flight so affected must be rejected for noise certification purposes.

# Note:
Guidance material on the use of equivalent procedures is provided in the current advisory circular for this part.

# part b—noise measurement

# Sec. F36.101 General test conditions.
(a) The test area must be relatively flat terrain having no excessive sound absorption characteristics such as those caused by thick, matted, or tall grass, by shrubs, or by wooded areas. No obstructions which significantly influence the sound field from the airplane may exist within a conical space above the measurement position, the cone being defined by an axis normal to the ground and by a half-angle 75 degrees from this axis.
(b) The tests must be carried out under the following conditions:
(1) There may be no precipitation.
(2) Relative humidity may not be higher than 90 percent or lower than 30 percent.
(3) Ambient temperature may not be above 86 degrees F. or below 41 degrees F. at 33′ above ground. If the measurement site is within 1 n.m. of an airport thermometer the airport reported temperature may be used.
(4) Reported wind may not be above 10 knots at 33′ above ground. If wind velocities of more than 4 knots are reported, the flight direction must be aligned to within ±15 degrees of wind direction and flights with tail
wind and head wind must be made in equal numbers. If the measurement site is within 1 n.m. of an airport anemometer, the airport reported wind may be used.
(5) There may be no temperature inversion or anomalous wind conditions that would significantly alter the noise level of the airplane when the noise is recorded at the required measuring point.
(6) The flight test procedures, measuring equipment, and noise measurement procedures must be approved by the FAA.
(7) Sound pressure level data for noise evaluation purposes must be obtained with acoustical equipment that complies with section F36.103 of this appendix.
Sec. F36.103 Acoustical measurement system.
The acoustical measurement system must consist of approved equipment equivalent to the following:
(a) A microphone system with frequency response compatible with measurement and analysis system accuracy as prescribed in section F36.105 of this appendix.
(b) Tripods or similar microphone mountings that minimize interference with the sound being measured.
(c) Recording and reproducing equipment characteristics, frequency response, and dynamic range compatible with the response and accuracy requirements of section F36.105 of this appendix.
(d) Acoustic calibrators using sine wave or broadband noise of known sound pressure level. If broadband noise is used, the signal must be described in terms of its average and maximum root-mean-square (rms) value for nonoverload signal level.

# Sec. F36.105 Sensing, recording, and reproducing equipment.
(a) The noise produced by the airplane must be recorded. A magnetic tape recorder is acceptable.
(b) The characteristics of the system must comply with the recommendations in IEC 179 (incorporated by reference, see § 36.6).
(c) The response of the complete system to a sensibly plane progressive sinusoidal wave of constant amplitude must lie within the tolerance limits specified in IEC Publication No. 179, dated 1973, over the frequency range 45 to 11,200 Hz.
(d) If limitations of the dynamic range of the equipment make it necessary, high frequency pre-emphasis must be added to the recording channel with the converse de-emphasis on playback. The pre-emphasis must be applied such that the instantaneous recorded sound pressure level of the noise signal between 800 and 11,200 Hz does not vary more than 20 dB between the maximum and minimum one-third octave bands.
(e) If requested by the Administrator, the recorded noise signal must be read through an “A” filter with dynamic characteristics designated “slow,” as defined in IEC Publication No. 179, dated 1973. The output signal from the filter must be fed to a rectifying circuit with square law rectification, integrated with time constants for charge and discharge of about 1 second or 800 milliseconds.
(f) The equipment must be acoustically calibrated using facilities for acoustic freefield calibration and if analysis of the tape recording is requested by the Administrator, the analysis equipment shall be electronically calibrated by a method approved by the FAA.
(g) A windscreen must be employed with microphone during all measurements of aircraft noise when the wind speed is in excess of 6 knots.

# Sec. F36.107 Noise measurement procedures.
(a) The microphones must be oriented in a known direction so that the maximum sound received arrives as nearly as possible in the direction for which the microphones are calibrated. The microphone sensing elements must be approximately 4′ above ground.
(b) Immediately prior to and after each test; a recorded acoustic calibration of the system must be made in the field with an acoustic calibrator for the two purposes of checking system sensitivity and providing an acoustic reference level for the analysis of the sound level data.
(c) The ambient noise, including both acoustical background and electrical noise of the measurement systems, must be recorded and determined in the test area with the system gain set at levels that will be used for aircraft noise measurements. If aircraft sound pressure levels do not exceed the background sound pressure levels by at least 10 dB(A), approved corrections for the contribution of background sound pressure level to the observed sound pressure level must be applied.

# Sec. F36.109 Data recording, reporting, and approval.
(a) Data representing physical measurements or corrections to measured data must be recorded in permanent form and appended to the record except that corrections to measurements for normal equipment response deviations need not be reported. All other corrections must be approved. Estimates must be made of the individual errors inherent in each of the operations employed in obtaining the final data.
(b) Measured and corrected sound pressure levels obtained with equipment conforming to the specifications described in section F36.105 of this appendix must be reported.
(c) The type of equipment used for measurement and analysis of all acoustic, airplane performance, and meteorological data must be reported.
(d) The following atmospheric data, measured immediately before, after, or during each test at the observation points prescribed in section F36.101 of this appendix must be reported:
(1) Air temperature and relative humidity.

(e) Comments on local topography, ground cover, and events that might interfere with sound recordings must be reported.
(f) The following airplane information must be reported:
(1) Type, model and serial numbers (if any) of airplanes, engines, and propellers.
(2) Any modifications or nonstandard equipment likely to affect the noise characteristics of the airplane.
(3) Maximum certificated takeoff weights.
(4) Airspeed in knots for each overflight of the measuring point.
(5) Engine performance in terms of revolutions per minute and other relevant parameters for each overflight.
(6) Aircraft height in feet determined by a calibrated altimeter in the aircraft, approved photographic techniques, or approved tracking facilities.
(g) Aircraft speed and position and engine performance parameters must be recorded at an approved sampling rate sufficient to ensure compliance with the test procedures and conditions of this appendix.

# Sec. F36.111 Flight procedures.
(a) Tests to demonstrate compliance with the noise level requirements of this appendix must include at least six level flights over the measuring station at a height of 1,000′ ±30′ and ±10 degrees from the zenith when passing overhead.
(b) Each test over flight must be conducted:
(1) At not less than the highest power in the normal operating range provided in an Airplane Flight Manual, or in any combination of approved manual material, approved placard, or approved instrument markings; and
(2) At stabilized speed with propellers synchronized and with the airplane in cruise configuration, except that if the speed at the power setting prescribed in this paragraph would exceed the maximum speed authorized in level flight, accelerated flight is acceptable.

# part c—data correction

# Sec. F36.201 Correction of data.
(a) Noise data obtained when the temperature is outside the range of 68 degrees F. ±9 degrees F., or the relative humidity is below 40 percent, must be corrected to 77 degrees F. and 70 percent relative humidity by a method approved by the FAA.
(b) The performance correction prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section must be used. It must be determined by the method described in this appendix, and must be added algebraically to the measured value. It is limited to 5dB(A).
(c) The performance correction must be computed by using the following formula:
EC28SE91.113
Where:
D
50
= Takeoff distance to 50 feet at maximum certificated takeoff weight.
R/C = Certificated best rate of climb (fpm).
V
y
= Speed for best rate of climb in the same units as rate of climb.
(d) When takeoff distance to 50′ is not listed as approved performance information, the figures of 2000 for single-engine airplanes and 1600′ for multi-engine airplanes must be used.
Sec. F36.203
Validity of results.
(a) The test results must produce an average dB(A) and its 90 percent confidence limits, the noise level being the arithmetic average of the corrected acoustical measurements for all valid test runs over the measuring point.
(b) The samples must be large enough to establish statistically a 90 pecent confidence limit not to exceed ±1.5 dB(A). No test result may be omitted from the averaging process, unless omission is approved by the FAA.

# part d—noise limits

# Sec. F36.301 Aircraft noise limits.
(a) Compliance with this section must be shown with noise data measured and corrected as prescribed in Parts B and C of this appendix.
(b) For airplanes for which application for a type certificate is made on or after October 10, 1973, the noise level must not exceed 68 dB(A) up to and including aircraft weights of 1,320 pounds (600 kg.). For weights greater than 1,320 pounds up to and including 3,630
pounds (1.650 kg.) the limit increases at the rate of 1 dB/165 pounds (1 dB/75 kg.) to 82 dB(A) at 3,630 pounds, after which it is constant at 82 dB(A). However, airplanes produced under type certificates covered by this paragraph must also meet paragraph (d) of this section for the original issuance of standard airworthiness certificates or restricted category airworthiness certificates if those airplanes have not had flight time before the date specified in that paragraph.
(c) For airplanes for which application for a type certificate is made on or after January 1, 1975, the noise levels may not exceed the noise limit curve prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section, except that 80 dB(A) may not be exceeded.
(d) For airplanes for which application is made for a standard airworthiness certificate or for a restricted category airworthiness certificate, and that have not had any flight time before January 1, 1980, the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section apply, regardless of date of application, to the original issuance of the certificate for that airplane.

Section G36.1 Scope.
This appendix prescribes limiting noise levels and procedures for measuring noise and adjusting these data to standard conditions, for propeller driven small airplanes and propeller-driven, commuter category airplanes specified in §§ 36.1 and 36.501(c).

# part b—noise measurement

# Sec. G36.101 General Test Conditions.
(a) The test area must be relatively flat terrain having no excessive sound absorption characteristics such as those caused by thick, matted, or tall grass, by shrubs, or by wooded areas. No obstructions which significantly influence the sound field from the airplane may exist within a conical space above the measurement position, the cone being defined by an axis normal to the ground and by a half-angle 75 degrees from the normal ground axis.
(b) The tests must be carried out under the following conditions:
(1) No precipitation;
(2) Ambient air temperature between 36 and 95 degrees F (2.2 and 35 degrees C);
(3) Relative humidity between 20 percent and 95 percent, inclusively;
(4) Wind speed may not exceed 10 knots (19 km/h) and cross wind may not exceed 5 knots (9 km/h), using a 30-second average;
(5) No temperature inversion or anomalous wind condition that would significantly alter the noise level of the airplane when the nose is recorded at the required measuring point, and
(6) The meteorological measurements must be made between 4 ft. (1.2 m) and 33 ft. (10 m) above ground level. If the measurement site is within 1 n.m. of an airport meteorological station, measurements from that station may be used.
(c) The flight test procedures, measuring equipment, and noise measurement procedures must be approved by the FAA.
(d) Sound pressure level data for noise evaluation purposes must be obtained with acoustical equipment that complies with section G36.103 of this appendix.

# Sec. G36.103 Acoustical Measurement System.
The acoustical measurement system must consist of approved equipment with the following characteristics: (a) A microphone system with frequency response compatible with measurement and analysis system accuracy as prescribed in section G36.105 of this appendix.
(b) Tripods or similar microphone mountings that minimize interference with the sound being measured.
(c) Recording and reproducing equipment characteristics, frequency response, and dynamic range compatible with the response
and accuracy requirements of section G36.105 of this appendix.
(d) Acoustic calibrators using sine wave or broadband noise of known sound pressure level. If broadband noise is used, the signal must be described in terms of its average and maximum root-mean-square (rms) value for non-overload signal level.

# Sec. G36.105 Sensing, Recording, and Reproducing Equipment.
(a) The noise produced by the airplane must be recorded. A magnetic tape recorder, graphic level recorder, or sound level meter is acceptable when approved by the regional certificating authority.
(b) The characteristics of the complete system must comply with the requirements in IEC 651 and IEC 561 (incorporated by reference, see § 36.6). Sound level meters must comply with the requirements for Type 1 sound level meters as specified in IEC 651.
(c) The response of the complete system to a sensibly plane progressive sinusoidal wave of constant amplitude must be within the tolerance limits specified in IEC 651, over the frequency range 45 to 11,200 Hz.
(d) If equipment dynamic range limitations make it necessary, high frequency pre-emphasis must be added to the recording channel with the converse de-emphasis on playback. The pre-emphasis must be applied such that the instantaneous recorded sound pressure level of the noise signal between 800 and 11,200 Hz does not vary more than 20 dB between the maximum and minimum one-third octave bands.
(e) The output noise signal must be read through an “A” filter with dynamic characteristics designated “slow” as defined in IEC 651. A graphic recorder, sound level meter, or digital equipment may be used.
(f) The equipment must be acoustically calibrated using facilities for acoustic free-field calibration and if analysis of the tape recording is requested by the Administrator, the analysis equipment shall be electronically calibrated by a method approved by the FAA. Calibrations shall be performed, as appropriate, in accordance with paragraphs A36.3.8 and A36.3.9 of appendix A of this part.
(g) A windscreen must be employed with the microphone during all measurements of aircraft noise when the wind speed is in excess of 5 knots (9 km/hr).

# Sec. G36.107 Noise Measurement Procedures.
(a) The microphone must be a pressure type, 12.7 mm in diameter, with a protective grid, mounted in an inverted position such that the microphone diaphragm is 7 mm above and parallel to a white-painted metal circular plate. This white-painted metal plate shall be 40 cm in diameter and at least 2.5 mm thick. The plate shall be placed horizontally and flush with the surrounding ground surface with no cavities below the plate. The microphone must be located three-quarters of the distance from the center to the back edge of the plate along a radius normal to the line of flight of the test airplane.
(b) Immediately prior to and after each test, a recorded acoustic calibration of the system must be made in the field with an acoustic calibrator for the purposes of checking system sensitivity and providing an acoustic reference level for the analysis of the sound level data. If a tape recorder or graphic level recorder is used, the frequency response of the electrical system must be determined at a level within 10 dB of the full-scale reading used during the test, utilizing pink or pseudorandom noise.
(c) The ambient noise, including both acoustic background and electrical systems noise, must be recorded and determined in the test area with the system gain set at levels which will be used for aircraft noise measurements. If aircraft sound pressure levels do not exceed the background sound pressure levels by at least 10 dB(A), a takeoff measurement point nearer to the start of the takeoff roll must be used and the results must be adjusted to the reference measurement point by an approved method.

# Sec. G36.109 Data Recording, Reporting, and Approval.
(a) Data representing physical measurements and adjustments to measured data must be recorded in permanent form and appended to the record, except that corrections to measurements for normal equipment response deviations need not be reported. All other adjustments must be approved. Estimates must be made of the individual errors inherent in each of the operations employed in obtaining the final data.
(b) Measured and corrected sound pressure levels obtained with equipment conforming to the specifications in section G36.105 of this appendix must be reported.
(c) The type of equipment used for measurement and analysis of all acoustical, airplane performance, and meteorological data must be reported.
(d) The following atmospheric data, measured immediately before, after, or during each test at the observation points prescribed in section G36.101 of this appendix must be reported:
(1) Ambient temperature and relative humidity.
(2) Maximum and average wind speeds and directions for each run.
(e) Comments on local topography, ground cover, and events that might interfere with sound recordings must be reported.
(f) The aircraft position relative to the takeoff reference flight path must be determined by an approved method independent of normal flight instrumentation, such as radar
tracking, theodolite triangulation, or photographic scaling techniques.
(g) The following airplane information must be reported:
(1) Type, model, and serial numbers (if any) of airplanes, engines, and propellers;
(2) Any modifications or nonstandard equipment likely to affect the noise characteristics of the airplane;
(3) Maximum certificated takeoff weight;
(4) For each test flight, airspeed and ambient temperature at the flyover altitude over the measuring site determined by properly calibrated instruments;
(5) For each test flight, engine performance parameters, such as manifold pressure or power, propeller speed (rpm) and other relevant parameters. Each parameter must be determined by properly calibrated instruments. For instance, propeller RPM must be validated by an independent device accurate to within ±1 percent, when the airplane is equipped with a mechanical tachometer.
(6) Airspeed, position, and performance data necessary to make the corrections required in section G36.201 of this appendix must be recorded by an approved method when the airplane is directly over the measuring site.

# Sec. G36.111 Flight Procedures.
(a) The noise measurement point is on the extended centerline of the runway at a distance of 8200 ft (2500 m) from the start of takeoff roll. The aircraft must pass over the measurement point within ±10 degrees from the vertical and within 20% of the reference altitude. The flight test program shall be initiated at the maximum approved takeoff weight and the weight shall be adjusted back to this maximum weight after each hour of flight time. Each flight test must be conducted at the speed for the best rate of climb (V
y
) ±5 knots (±9 km/hour) indicated airspeed. All test, measurement, and data correction procedures must be approved by the FAA.
(b) The takeoff reference flight path must be calculated for the following atmospheric conditions:
(1) Sea level atmospheric pressure of 1013.25 mb (013.25 hPa);
(2) Ambient air temperature of 59 °F (15 °C);
(3) Relative humidity of 70 percent; and
(4) Zero wind.
(c) The takeoff reference flight path must be calculated assuming the following two segments:
(1) First segment.
(i) Takeoff power must be used from the brake release point to the point at which the height of 50 ft (15m) above the runway is reached.
(ii) A constant takeoff configuration selected by the applicant must be maintained through this segment.
(iii) The maximum weight of the airplane at brake-release must be the maximum for which noise certification is requested.
(iv) The length of this first segment must correspond to the airworthiness approved value for a takeoff on a level paved runway (or the corresponding value for seaplanes).
(2) Second segment.
(i) The beginning of the second segment corresponds to the end of the first segment.
(ii) The airplane must be in the climb configuration with landing gear up, if retractable, and flap setting corresponding to normal climb position throughout this second segment.
(iii) The airplane speed must be the speed for the best rate of climb (V
y
).
(iv) For airplanes equipped with fixed pitch propellers, takeoff power must be maintained throughout the second segment. For airplanes equipped with variable pitch or constant speed propellers, takeoff power and rpm must be maintained throughout the second segment. If airworthiness limitations do not allow the application of takeoff power and rpm up to the reference point, then takeoff power and rpm must be maintained for as long as is permitted by such limitations; thereafter, maximum continuous power and rpm must be maintained. Maximum time allowed at takeoff power under the airworthiness standards must be used in the second segment. The reference height must be calculated assuming climb gradients appropriate to each power setting used.

# part c—data corrections

# Sec. G36.201 Corrections to Test Results.
(a) These corrections account for the effects of:
(1) Differences in atmospheric absorption of sound between meteorological test conditions and reference conditions.
(2) Differences in the noise path length between the actual airplane flight path and the reference flight path.
(3) The change in the helical tip Mach number between test and reference conditions.
(4) The change in the engine power between test and reference conditions.
(b) Atmospheric absorption correction is required for noise data obtained when the test conditions are outside those specified in Figure G1. Noise data outside the applicable range must be corrected to 59 F and 70 percent relative humidity by an FAA approved method.
ER13OC99.001
(c) No corrections for helical tip Mach number variation need to be made if the propeller helical tip Mach number is:
(1) At or below 0.70 and the test helical tip Mach number is within 0.014 of the reference helical tip Mach number.
(2) Above 0.70 and at or below 0.80 and the test helical tip Mach number is within 0.007 of the reference helical tip Mach number.
(3) Above 0.80 and the test helical tip Mach number is within 0.005 of the reference helical tip Mach number. For mechanical tachometers, if the helical tip Mach number is above 0.8 and the test helical tip Mach number is within 0.008 of the reference helical tip Mach number.
(d) When the test conditions are outside those specified, corrections must be applied by an approved procedure or by the following simplified procedure:
(1) Measured sound levels must be corrected from test day meteorological conditions to reference conditions by adding an increment equal to
Delta (M) = (H
T
α—0.7 H
R
)/1000
where H
T
is the height in feet under test conditions, H
R
is the height in feet under reference conditions when the aircraft is directly over the noise measurement point and α is the rate of absorption for the test day conditions at 500 Hz as specified in SAE ARP 866A, entitled “Standard Values of Atmospheric Absorption as a function of Temperature and Humidity for use in Evaluating Aircraft Flyover Noise” as incorporated by reference under § 36.6.
(2) Measured sound levels in decibels must be corrected for height by algebraically adding an increment equal to Delta (1). When test day conditions are within those specified in figure G1:
Delta (1) = 22 log (H
T
/H
R
)
where H
T
is the height of the test aircraft when directly over the noise measurement point and H
R
is the reference height.
When test day conditions are outside those specified in figure G1:
Delta (1) = 20 log (H
T
/H
R
)
(3) Measured sound levels in decibels must be corrected for helical tip Mach number by algebraically adding an increment equal to:
Delta (2) = k log (M
R
/M
T
)
where M
T
and M
R
are the test and reference helical tip Mach numbers, respectively. The constant “k” is equal to the slope of the line obtained for measured values of the sound level in dB(A) versus helical tip Mach number. The value of k may be determined from approved data. A nominal value of k = 150 may be used when M
T
is smaller than M
R
. No correction may be
made using the nominal value of k when M
T
is larger than M
R
. The reference helical tip Mach number M
R
is the Mach number corresponding to the reference conditions (RPM, airspeed, temperature) above the measurement point.
(4) Measured sound levels in decibels must be corrected for engine power by algebraically adding an increment equal to
Delta (3) = K
3
log (P
R
/P
T
)
where P
R
and P
T
are the test and reference engine powers respectively obtained from the manifold pressure/torque gauges and engine rpm. The value of K
3
shall be determined from approved data from the test airplane. In the absence of flight test data and at the discretion of the Administrator, a value of K
3
= 17 may be used.

# Sec. G36.203 Validity of Results.
(a) The measuring point must be overflown at least six times. The test results must produce an average noise level (L
Amax
) value within a 90 percent confidence limit. The average noise level is the arithmetic average of the corrected acoustical measurements for all valid test runs over the measuring point.
(b) The samples must be large enough to establish statistically a 90 percent confidence limit not exceeding ±1.5 dB(A). No test results may be omitted from the averaging process unless omission is approved by the FAA.

# part d—noise limits

# Sec. G36.301 Aircraft noise limits.
(a) Compliance with this section must be shown with noise data measured and corrected as prescribed in Parts B and C of this appendix.
(b) For single-engine airplanes for which the original type certification application is received before February 3, 2006 and multi-engine airplanes, the noise level must not exceed 76 dB(A) up to and including aircraft weights of 1,320 pounds (600 kg). For aircraft weights greater than 1,320 pounds, the limit increases from that point with the logarithm of airplane weight at the rate of 9.83 dB (A) per doubling of weight, until the limit of 88 dB (A) is reached, after which the limit is constant up to and including 19,000 pounds (8,618 kg). Figure G2 shows noise level limits vs airplane weight.
(c) For single-engine airplanes for which the original type certification application is received on or after February 3, 2006, the noise level must not exceed 70dB(A) for aircraft having a maximum certificated takeoff weight of 1,257 pounds (570 kg) or less. For aircraft weights greater than 1,257 pounds, the noise limit increases from that point with the logarithm of airplane weight at the rate of 10.75dB(A) per doubling of weight, until the limit of 85dB(A) is reached, after which the limit is constant up to and including 19,000 pounds (8,618 kg). Figure G2 depicts noise level limits for airplane weights for single-engine airplanes.

Section H36.1 General.
This appendix prescribes noise requirements for helicopters specified under § 36.1, including:
(a) The conditions under which helicopter noise certification tests under Part H must be conducted and the measurement procedures that must be used under § 36.801 to measure helicopter noise during each test;
(b) The procedures which must be used under § 36.803 to correct the measured data to the reference conditions and to calculate the noise evaluation quantity designated as Effective Perceived Noise Level (EPNL); and
(c) The noise limits for which compliance must be shown under § 36.805.

# Section H36.3 Reference Test Conditions.
(a)
Meteorological conditions.
Aircraft position, performance data and noise measurements must be corrected to the following noise certification reference atmospheric conditions which shall be assumed to exist from the surface to the aircraft altitude:
(1) Sea level pressure of 2,116 psf (1,013.25 hPa).
(2) Ambient temperature of 77 degrees F (25 degrees C).
(3) Relative humidity of 70 percent.
(4) Zero wind.
(b)
Reference test site.
The reference test site is flat and without line-of-sight obstructions across the flight path that encompasses the 10 dB down points.
(c)
Takeoff reference profile.
(1) Figure H1 illustrates a typical takeoff profile, including reference conditions.
(2) The reference flight path is defined as a straight line segment inclined from the starting point (1,640 feet (500 meters) from the center microphone location and 65 feet (20 meters) above ground level) at a constant climb angle β defined by the certificated best rate of climb and V
y
for minimum engine performance. The constant climb angle β is derived from the manufacturer's data (approved by the FAA) to define the flight profile for the reference conditions. The constant climb angle β is drawn through C
r
and continues, crossing over station A, to the position corresponding to the end of the type certification takeoff path represented by position I
r
.
(d)
Level flyover reference profile.
The beginning of the level flyover reference profile is represented by helicopter position D
r
(Figure H2). The helicopter approaches position D
r
in level flight 492 feet above ground level as measured at Station A. Reference airspeed must be either 0.9V
H
; 0.9V
NE
; 0.45V
H
+ 65 kts (0.45V
H
+ 120km/h); or 0.45V
NE
+ 65kts (0.45V
NE
+ 120 km/h), whichever of the four speeds is least. The helicopter crosses directly overhead station A in level flight and proceeds to position J
r
.
(e) For noise certification purposes, V
H
is defined as the airspeed in level flight obtained using the minimum specified engine torque corresponding to maximum continuous power available for sea level pressure of 2,116 psf (1,013.25 hPa) at 77 °F (25 °C) ambient conditions at the relevant maximum certificated weight. The value of V
NE
is the never-exceed airspeed. The values of V
H
and V
NE
that are used for noise certification must be listed in the approved Rotorcraft Flight Manual.
(f)
Approach reference profile.
(1) Figure H3 illustrates approach profile, including reference conditions.
(i) The beginning of the approach profile is represented by helicopter position E. The position of the helicopter is recorded for a sufficient distance (EK) to ensure recording of the entire interval during which the measured helicopter noise level is within 10 dB of Maximum Tone Corrected Perceived Noise Level (PNLTM). The reference flight path, E
r
K
r
represents a stable flight condition in terms of torque, rpm, indicated airspeed, and rate of descent resulting in a 6° approach angle.
(ii) The test approach profile is defined by the approach angle η passing directly over the station A at a height of AH, to position K, which terminates the approach noise certification profile. The test approach angle η must be between 5.5° and 6.5°.
(2) The helicopter approaches position H along a constant 6° approach slope throughout the 10 dB down time period. The helicopter crosses position E and proceeds along the approach slope crossing over station A until it reaches position K.

# part b—noise measurement under § 36.801

# Section H36.101 Noise certification test and measurement conditions.
(a)
General.
This section prescribes the conditions under which aircraft noise certification tests must be conducted and the
measurement procedures that must be used to measure helicopter noise during each test.
(b)
Test site requirements.
(1) Tests to show compliance with established helicopter noise certification levels must consist of a series of takeoffs, level flyovers, and approaches during which measurement must be taken at noise measuring stations located at the measuring points prescribed in this section.
(2) Each takeoff test, flyover test, and approach test includes simultaneous measurements at the flight-track noise measuring station vertically below the reference flight path and at two sideline noise measuring stations, one on each side of the reference flight track 492 feet (150m) from, and on a line perpendicular to, the flight track of the noise measuring station.
(3) The difference between the elevation of either sideline noise measuring station may not differ from the flight-track noise measuring station by more than 20 feet.
(4) Each noise measuring station must be surrounded by terrain having no excessive sound absorption characteristics, such as might be caused by thick, matted, or tall grass, shrubs, or wooded areas.
(5) During the period when the takeoff, flyover, or approach noise/time record indicates the noise measurement is within 10 dB of PNLTM, no obstruction that significantly influences the sound field from the aircraft may exist—
(i) For any flight-track or sideline noise measuring station, within a conical space above the measuring position (the point on the ground vertically below the microphone), the cone being defined by an axis normal to the ground and by half-angle 80° from this axis; and
(ii) For any sideline noise measuring station, above the line of sight between the microphone and the helicopter.
(6) If a takeoff or flyover test series is conducted at weights other than the maximum takeoff weight for which noise certification is requested, the following additional requirements apply:
(i) At least one takeoff test and one flyover test must be conducted at, or above, the maximum certification weight.
(ii) Each test weight must be within + 5 percent or −10 percent of the maximum certification weight.
(7) Each approach test must be conducted with the aircraft stabilized and following a 6.0 degree ±0.5 degree approach angle and must meet the requirements of section H36.107 of this part.
(8) If an approach test series is conducted at weights other than the maximum landing weight for which certification is requested, the following additional requirements apply:
(i) At least one approach test must be conducted at a weight at, or above, the maximum landing weight.
(ii) Each test weight must be between + 5 percent and −10 percent of the maximum certification weight.
(c)
Weather restrictions.
The tests must be conducted under the following atmospheric conditions:
(1) No rain or other precipitation.
(2) Ambient air temperature between 14 °F and 95 °F (−10 °C and 35 °C), inclusively, at a point 33 feet (10 meters) above the ground at the noise measuring station and at the aircraft. The temperature and relative humidity measured at a point 33 feet (10 meters) above the ground at the noise measuring station must be used to adjust for propagation path absorption.
(3) Relative humidity and ambient temperature at a point 33 feet (10 meters) above the ground at the noise measuring station and at the aircraft, is such that the sound attenuation in the one-third octave band centered at 8 kHz is not greater than 12 dB/100 meters and the relative humidity is between 20 percent and 95 percent, inclusively.
(4) Wind velocity as measured at 10 meters above ground does not exceed 10 knots (19 km/h) and the crosswind component does not exceed 5 knots (9 km/h). The wind shall be determined using a continuous thirty-second averaging period spanning the 10dB down time interval.
(5) No anomalous meteorological conditions (including turbulence) that will significantly affect the noise level of the aircraft when the noise is recorded at each noise measuring station.
(6) The wind velocity, temperature, and relative humidity measurements required under the appendix must be measured in the vicinity of noise measuring stations 10 meters above the ground. The location of the meteorological measurements must be approved by the FAA as representative of those atmospheric conditions existing near the surface over the geographical area which aircraft noise measurements are made. In some cases, a fixed meteorological station (such as those found at airports or other facilities) may meet this requirement.
(7) Temperature and relative humidity measurements must be obtained within 30 minutes of each noise test.
(d)
Aircraft testing procedures.
(1) The aircraft testing procedures and noise measurements must be conducted and processed in a manner that yields the noise evaluation measure designated as Effective Perceived Noise Level (EPNL) in units of EPNdB, as prescribed in Appendix A of this part.
(2) The helicopter height and lateral position relative to the reference flight track (which passes through the flight track noise measuring station) must be determined using an FAA-approved method. The equipment used to make the determination must be independent of normal flight instrumentation. Applicable independent systems are
radar tracking, theodolite triangulation, laser trajectography, photo scaling, or differential global positioning system.
(3) The helicopter position along the flight path must be related to the noise recorded at the noise measuring stations by means of synchronized signals recorded at an approved sampling rate. The helicopter position must be recorded relative to the reference flight track during the entire time interval in which the recorded signal is within 10 dB of PNLTM. Measuring and sampling equipment must be approved by the FAA before testing.
(4) Aircraft performance data sufficient to make the corrections required under section H36.205 of this appendix must be recorded at an FAA-approved sampling rate using FAA-approved equipment.

Lateral position relative to the reference flight-track must be reported.
(c)
Data corrections.
(1) Aircraft position, performance data and noise measurement must be corrected to the noise certification reference conditions as prescribed in sections H36.3 and H36.205 of this appendix.
(2) The measured flight path must be corrected by an amount equal to the difference between the applicant's predicted flight path for the certification reference conditions and the measured flight path at the test conditions. Necessary corrections relating to helicopter flight path or performance may be derived from FAA-approved data for the difference between measured and reference conditions, together with appropriate allowances for sound attenuation with distance. The Effective Perceived Noise Level (EPNL) correction may not exceed 2.0 EPNdB except for takeoff flight condition, where the correction may not exceed 4.0 EPNdB, of which the arithmetic sum of Δ
1
(described in section H36.205(f)(1)) and the term −7.5 log (AL/AL
r
) from Δ
2
term (described in section H36.205(g)(1)(i)) may not exceed 2.0 EPNdB, for any combination of the following:
(i) The helicopter not passing vertically above the measuring station.

(3) Helicopter sound pressure levels within the 10 dB-down time interval must exceed the mean background sound pressure levels determined under section B36.3.9.11 by at least 3 dB in each one-third octave band, or must be corrected under an FAA-approved method.
(d)
Validity of results.
(1) The test results must produce three average EPNL values within the 90 percent confidence limits, each value consisting of the arithmetic average of the corrected noise measurements for all valid test runs at the takeoff, level flyovers, and approach conditions. The 90 percent confidence limit applies separately to takeoff, flyover, and approach.
(2) The minimum sample size acceptable for each takeoff, approach, and flyover certification measurements is six. The number of samples must be large enough to establish statistically for each of the three average noise certification levels a 90 percent confidence limit which does not exceed ±1.5 EPNdB. No test result may be omitted from the averaging process, unless otherwise specified by the FAA.
(3) To comply with this appendix, a minimum of six takeoffs, six approaches, and six level flyovers is required. To be counted toward this requirement, each flight event must be validly recorded at all three noise measuring stations.

Each correction must account for any differences in the atmospheric attenuation of sound between the test-day conditions and the reference-day conditions along the sound propagation path between the aircraft and the microphone. Unless the meteorological conditions are within the test window prescribed in this appendix, the test data are not acceptable.
(b)
Attenuation rates.
The procedure for determining the atmospheric attenuation rates of sound with distance for each one-third octave bands must be determined in accordance with SAE ARP 866A (Incorporated by reference, see § 36.6). The atmospheric attenuation equations are provided in both the International and English systems of units in section A36.7 of appendix A to this part.

(ii) The measured flight paths do not conform to the reference flight paths.
(iii) The temperature and relative humidity measured at 33 feet (10 meters) above the ground must be used to adjust for propagation path absorption.
(2) The mean attenuation rate over the complete sound propagation path from the aircraft to the microphone must be computed for each one-third octave band from 50 Hz to 10,000 Hz. These rates must be used in computing the corrections required in section H36.111(d) of this appendix.

# part c—noise evaluation and calculation under § 36.803

# Section H36.201 Noise Evaluation in EPNdB.
(a) Effective Perceived Noise Level (EPNL), in units of effective perceived noise decibels (EPNdB), shall be used for evaluating noise level values under § 36.803 of this part. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the procedures in appendix A of Part 36 must be used for computing EPNL. appendix A includes requirements governing determination of noise values, including calculations of:
(1) Perceived noise levels;
(2) Corrections for spectral irregularities;
(3) Tone corrections;
(4) Duration corrections;
(5) Effective perceived noise levels; and
(6) Mathematical formulation of noy tables.
(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of section A36.4.3.1(a), for helicopter noise certification, corrections for spectral irregularities shall start with the corrected sound pressure level in the 50 Hz one-third octave band.

# Section H36.203 Calculation of noise levels.
(a) To demonstrate compliance with the noise level limits of section H36.305, the noise values measured simultaneously at the three noise measuring points must be arithmetically averaged to obtain a single EPNdB value for each flight.
(b) The calculated noise level for each noise test series,
i.e.
, takeoff, flyover, or approach must be the numerical average of at least six separate flight EPNdB values. The 90 percent confidence limit for all valid test runs under section H36.111(d) of this appendix applies separately to the EPNdB values for each noise test series.

# Section H36.205 Detailed data correction procedures.
(a)
General.
If the test conditions do not conform to those prescribed as noise certification reference conditions under section H36.305 of this appendix, the following correction procedure shall apply:
(1) If there is any difference between measured test and reference conditions, an appropriate correction must be made to the EPNL calculated from the measured noise data. Conditions that can result in a different value include:
(i) Atmospheric absorption of sound under measured test conditions that are different from the reference test conditions; or
(ii) Measured flight path that is different from the reference flight path.
(2) The following correction procedures may produce one or more possible correction values which must be added algebraically to the calculated EPNL to bring it to reference conditions:
(i) The flight profiles must be determined for both reference and test conditions. The procedures require noise and flight path recording with a synchronized time signal from which the test profile can be delineated, including the aircraft position for which PNLTM is observed at the noise measuring station. For takeoff, the flight profile
corrected to reference conditions may be derived from FAA approved manufacturer's data.
(ii) The sound propagation paths to the microphone from the aircraft position corresponding to PNLTM must be determined for both the test and reference profiles. The SPL values in the spectrum of PNLTM must then be corrected for the effects of—
(A) Change in atmospheric sound absorption;
(B) Atmospheric sound absorption on the linear difference between the two sound path lengths; and
(C) Inverse square law on the difference in sound propagation path length. The corrected values of SPL must then be converted to a reference condition PNLTM value from which PNLTM must be subtracted. The resulting difference represents the correction which must be added algebraically to the EPNL calculated from the measured data.
(iii) As observed at the noise measuring station, the measured PNLTM distance is different from the reference PNLTM distance and therefore the ratio must be calculated and used to determine a noise duration correction factor. Effective perceived noise level, EPNL, is determined by the algebraic sum of the maximum tone corrected perceived noise level (PNLTM) and the duration correction factor.
(iv) For aircraft flyover, alternative source noise corrections require FAA approval and must be determined and adjusted to account for noise level changes caused by the differences between measured test conditions and reference conditions.
(b)
Takeoff profiles.
(1) Figure H1 illustrates a typical takeoff profile, including reference conditions.
(i) The reference takeoff flight path is described in section H36.3(c).
(ii) The test parameters are functions of the helicopter's performance and weight and the atmospheric conditions of temperature, pressure, wind velocity and direction.
(2) For the actual takeoff, the helicopter approaches position C in level flight at 65 feet (20 meters) above ground level at the flight track noise measuring station and at either V
y
±5 knots or the lowest approved speed for the climb after takeoff, whichever speed is greater.
ER02JN04.000
(3) Figure H1 illustrates the significant geometrical relationships influencing sound propagation. Position L represents the helicopter location on the measured takeoff path from which PNLTM is observed at station A, and L
r
is the corresponding position on the reference sound propagation path. Propagation paths AL and AL
r
both form the same
angle θ (theta) relative to their respective flight paths.
(c)
Level flyover profiles.
(1) The noise type certification level flyover profile is shown in Figure H2. Airspeed must be stabilized within ±5 knots of the reference airspeed determined using the procedures in section H36.3(d). The number of level flights made with a headwind component must be equal to the number of level flights made with a tailwind component.
ER02JN04.001
(2) Figure H2 illustrates comparative flyover profiles when test conditions do not conform to prescribed reference conditions. The position of the helicopter shall be recorded for a distance (DJ) sufficient to ensure recording of the entire interval during which the measured helicopter noise level is
within 10 dB of PNLTM, as required. The flyover profile is defined by the height AG which is a function of the operating conditions controlled by the pilot. Position M represents the helicopter location on the measured flyover flight path for which PNLTM is observed at station A, and M
r
is the corresponding position on the reference flight path.
(d)
Approach profiles.
(1) Figure H3 illustrates a typical approach profile, including reference conditions.
(2) The helicopter approaches position H along a 6° (±0.5°) average approach slope throughout the 10dB-down time interval. Deviation from the 6° average approach slope must be approved by the FAA before testing.

(3) Figure H3 illustrates portions of the measured and reference approach flight paths including the significant geometrical relationships influencing sound propagation. The measured approach path is represented by segment EK with an approach allowable angle θ. Reference positions, E
r
and K
r
, define an idealized reference approach angle of 6°.
Position N represents the helicopter location on the measured approach flight path for which PNLTM is observed at measuring station A, and N
r
is the corresponding position on the reference approach flight path. The measured and reference noise propagation paths are AN and AN
r
, respectively, both of which form the same angle, θ
APP
, corresponding to PNLTM relative to their approach flight paths.
(e)
Correction of noise at source during level flyover.
(1) For level overflight, if any combination of the following three factors, airspeed deviations from reference, rotor speed deviations from reference, and temperature deviations from reference, results in a noise correlating parameter whose value deviates from the reference value of this parameter, then source noise adjustments must be determined from the manufacturer's data that is approved by the FAA.
(2) Off-reference tip Mach number adjustments must be based upon a sensitivity curve of PNLTM versus advancing blade tip Mach number, deduced from overflights performed at different airspeeds surrounding the reference airspeed. If the test aircraft is unable to attain the reference value, then an extrapolation of the sensitivity curve is permitted if data cover at least a range of 0.03 Mach units. The advancing blade tip Mach number must be computed using true airspeed, onboard outside air temperature, and rotor speed. A separate PNLTM versus advancing blade tip Mach number function must be derived for each of the three certification microphone locations,
i.e.
, centerline, sideline left, and sideline right. Sideline left and right are defined relative to the direction of flight for each run. PNLTM adjustments are to be applied to each microphone datum using the appropriate PNLTM function.
(f)
PNLT corrections.
If the measured ambient atmospheric conditions of temperature and relative humidity differ from those prescribed as reference conditions under this appendix (77 degrees F and 70 percent, respectively), corrections to the EPNL values must be calculated from the measured data under paragraph (a) of this section as follows:
(1)
Takeoff flight path.
For the takeoff flight path shown in Figure H1, the spectrum of PNLTM observed at station A for the aircraft at position L is decomposed into its individual SPL(
i
) values.
(i) Step 1. A set of corrected values are then computed as follows:

where SPL(
i
) and SPL(

)
r
are the measured and corrected sound pressure levels, respectively, in the
i
-th one-third octave band. The first correction term adjusts for the effect of change in atmospheric sound absorption where α(
i
) and α(
i
)
o
are the sound attenuation coefficients for the test and reference atmospheric conditions, respectively, for the
i
-th one-third octave band, and AL is the measured takeoff sound propagation path. The conversion factor constant,
C
, is 0.001 for English System of Units and is 0.01 for International System of Units. The second correction term adjusts for the effects of atmospheric attenuation due to the difference in the sound propagation path length where AL
r
is the Reference takeoff sound propagation path. The third correction term, known as the “inverse square” law, adjusts for the effect of the difference in the sound propagation path lengths.
(ii) Step 2. The corrected values of the SPL(
i
)
r
are then converted to reference condition PNLT and a correction term calculated as follows:
Δ

= PNLT − PNLTM
which represents the correction to be added algebraically to the EPNL calculated from the measured data.

Sideline microphones.
(i) The procedure prescribed in paragraph (f)(1) of this section for takeoff paths is also used for the propagation to the sideline locations, with the values of SPL(

relating as follows to the measured sideline sound propagation path shown in Figure H3 as follows:

(ii) The remainder of the procedure is the same for the sideline paths as that prescribed in the paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section regarding takeoff flight paths.
(g)
Duration corrections.
(1) If the measured takeoff and approach flight paths do not conform to those prescribed as the corrected and reference flight paths, respectively, under section A36.5(d)(2) it will be necessary to apply duration corrections to the EPNL values calculated from the measured data. Such corrections must be calculated as follows:
(i)
Takeoff flight path.
For the takeoff path shown in Figure H1, the correction term is calculated using the formula—
Δ
2
= −7.5 log (AL/AL
r
) + 10 log (V/V
r
)
which represents the correction that must be added algebraically to the EPNL calculated from the measured data. The lengths AL and AL
r
are the measured and reference takeoff distances from the noise measuring station A to the measured and the reference takeoff paths, respectively. A negative sign indicates that, for the particular case of a duration correction, the EPNL calculated from the measured data must be reduced if the measured takeoff path is at greater altitude than the reference takeoff path.
(ii)
Level flyover flight paths.
For the level flyover flight path, the correction term is calculated using the formula—
Δ
2
= −7.5 log (AM/AM
r
) + 10 log (V/V
r
)
where AM is the measured flyover distance from the noise measuring station A to the measured flyover path, and AM
r
is the reference distance from station A to the reference flyover path.
(iii)
Approach flight path.
For the approach path shown in Figure H3, the correction term is calculated using the formula—
Δ
2
= −7.5 log (AN/AN
r
) + 10 log (V/V
r
)
where AN is the measured approach distance from the noise measuring station A to the measured approach path, and AN
r
is the reference distance from station A to the reference approach path.
(iv)
Sideline microphones.
For the sideline flight path, the correction term is calculated using the formula—
Δ
2
= −7.5 log (SX/SX
r
) + 10 log (V/V
r
)
where S is the sideline measuring station and based upon the flight condition, the helicopter positions, X and X
r
, correspond to:
X = L, and X
r
= L
r
for takeoff
X = M, and X
r
= M
r
for flyover
X = N, and X
r
= N
r
for approach
(2) The adjustment procedure described in this section shall apply to the sideline microphones in the take-off, overflight, and approach cases. Although the noise emission is strongly dependent on the directivity pattern, variable from one helicopter type to another, the propagation angle θ shall be the same for test and reference flight paths. The elevation angle ψ shall not be constrained but must be determined and reported. The certification authority shall specify the acceptable limitations on ψ. Corrections to data obtained when these limits are exceeded shall be applied using FAA approved procedures.

The reference flyover profile is a level flight, 492 feet (150 meters) above ground level as measured at the noise measuring station. The reference flyover profile has a linear flight track and passes directly over the noise
monitoring station. Airspeed is stabilized at 0.9V

# Section J36.5 [Reserved]

# Part B—Noise Measurement Procedure Under § 36.801

# Section J36.101 Noise certification test and measurement conditions.
(a)
General.
This section prescribes the conditions under which helicopter noise certification tests must be conducted and the measurement procedures that must be used to measure helicopter noise during each test.
(b)
Test site requirements.
(1) The noise measuring station must be surrounded by terrain having no excessive sound absorption characteristics, such as might be caused by thick, matted, or tall grass, shrubs, or wooded areas.
(2) During the period when the flyover noise measurement is within 10 dB of the maximum A-weighted sound level, no obstruction that significantly influences the sound field from the helicopter may exist within a conical space above the noise measuring position (the point on the ground vertically below the microphone), the cone is defined by an axis normal to the ground and by half-angle 80 degrees from this axis.
(c)
Weather restrictions.
The test must be conducted under the following atmospheric conditions:
(1) No rain or other precipitation;
(2) Ambient air temperature between 36 degrees and 95 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees and 35 degrees Celsius), inclusively, and relative humidity between 20 percent and 95 percent inclusively, except that testing may not take place where combinations of temperature and relative humidity result in a rate of atmospheric attenuation greater than 10 dB per 100 meters (30.5 dB per 1000 ft) in the one-third octave band centered at 8 kiloHertz.
(3) Wind velocity that does not exceed 10 knots (19 km/h) and a crosswind component that does not exceed 5 knots (9 km/h). The wind shall be determined using a continuous averaging process of no greater than 30 seconds;
(4) Measurements of ambient temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and wind direction must be made between 4 feet (1.2 meters) and 33 feet (10 meters) above the ground.

(d)
Helicopter testing procedures.
(1) The helicopter testing procedures and noise measurements must be conducted and processed in a manner which yields the noise evaluation measure designated Sound Exposure Level (SEL) as defined in section J36.109(b) of this appendix.
(2) The helicopter height relative to the noise measurement point sufficient to make corrections required under section J36.205 of this appendix must be determined by an FAA-approved method that is independent of normal flight instrumentation, such as radar tracking, theodolite triangulation, laser trajectography, or photographic scaling techniques.
(3) If an applicant demonstrates that the design characteristics of the helicopter would prevent flight from being conducted in accordance with the reference test conditions prescribed under section J36.3 of this appendix, then with FAA approval, the reference test conditions used under this appendix may vary from the standard reference test conditions, but only to the extent demanded by those design characteristics which make compliance with the reference test conditions impossible.

# Section J36.103 [Reserved]

# Section J36.105 Flyover test conditions.
(a) This section prescribes the flight test conditions and allowable random deviations for flyover noise tests conducted under this appendix.
(b) A test series must consist of at least six flights. The number of level flights made with a headwind component must be equal to

(3) Within ±10 degrees from the zenith.
(c) Each flyover noise test must be conducted:
(1) At the reference airspeed specified in section J36.3(c) of this appendix, with such airspeed adjusted as necessary to produce the same advancing blade tip Mach number as associated with the reference conditions;
(i) Advancing blade tip Mach number (M
AT
) is defined as the ratio of the arithmetic sum of blade tip rotational speed (V
R
) and the helicopter true air speed (V
T
) over the speed of sound (c) at 77 degrees Fahrenheit (1135.6 ft/sec or 346.13 m/sec) such that M
AT
= (V
R
+ V
T
)/c; and
(ii) The airspeed shall not vary from the adjusted reference airspeed by more than ±3 knots (±5 km/hr) or an equivalent FAA-approved variation from the reference advancing blade tip Mach number. The adjusted reference airspeed shall be maintained throughout the measured portion of the flyover.
(2) At rotor speed stabilized at the power on maximum normal operating rotor RPM (±1 percent); and
(3) With the power stabilized during the period when the measured helicopter noise level is within 10 dB of the maximum A-weighted sound level (L
AMAX
).
(d) The helicopter test weight for each flyover test must be within plus 5 percent or minus 10 percent of the maximum takeoff weight for which certification under this part is requested.
(e) The requirements of paragraph (b)(2) of this section notwithstanding, flyovers at an FAA-approved lower height may be used and the results adjusted to the reference measurement point by an FAA-approved method if the ambient noise in the test area, measured in accordance with the requirements prescribed in section J36.109 of this appendix, is found to be within 15 dB(A) of the maximum A-weighted helicopter noise level (L
AMAX
) measured at the noise measurement station in accordance with section J36.109 of this appendix.

# Section J36.107 [Reserved]

# Section J36.109 Measurement of helicopter noise received on the ground.
(a)
General.
(1) The helicopter noise measured under this appendix for noise certification purposes must be obtained with FAA-approved acoustical equipment and measurement practices.
(2) Paragraph (b) of this section identifies and prescribes the specifications for the noise evaluation measurements required under this appendix. Paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section prescribe the required acoustical equipment specifications. Paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section prescribe the calibration and measurement procedures required under this appendix.
(b)
Noise unit definition.
(1) The value of sound exposure level (SEL, or as denoted by symbol, L
AE
), is defined as the level, in decibels, of the time integral of squared ‘A’-weighted sound pressure (P
A
) over a given time period or event, with reference to the square of the standard reference sound pressure (P
O
) of 20 micropascals and a reference duration of one second.
(2) This unit is defined by the expression:
EC28SE91.118
Where T
O
is the reference integration time of one second and (t
2
-t
1
) is the integration time interval.
(3) The integral equation of paragraph (b)(2) of this section can also be expressed as:
EC28SE91.119
Where L
A
(t) is the time varying A-weighted sound level.
(4) The integration time (t
2
-t
1
) in practice shall not be less than the time interval during which L
A
(t) first rises to within 10 dB(A) of its maximum value (L
AMAX
) and last falls below 10 dB(A) of its maximum value.
(5) The SEL may be approximated by the following expression:
L
AE
= L
AMAX
+
delta
A
where
delta
A is the duration allowance given by:
delta
A = 10 log
10
(T)
where T = (t
2
-t
1
)/2 and L
AMAX
is defined as the maximum level, in decibels, of the A-weighted sound pressure (slow response) with reference to the square of the standard reference sound pressure (P
0
).
(c)
Measurement system.
The acoustical measurement system must consist of FAA-approved equipment equivalent to the following:
(1) A microphone system with frequency response that is compatible with the measurement and analysis system accuracy prescribed in paragraph (d) of this section;
(2) Tripods or similar microphone mountings that minimize interference with the sound energy being measured;
(3) Recording and reproducing equipment with characteristics, frequency response, and dynamic range that are compatible with the
response and accuracy requirements of paragraph (d) of this section; and
(4) The calibration and checking of measurement systems must use the procedures described in Section A36.3.9.
(d)
Sensing, recording, and reproducing equipment.
(1) The noise levels measured from helicopter flyovers under this appendix may be determined directly by an integrating sound level meter, or the A-weighted sound level time history may be written onto a graphic level recorder set at “slow” response from which the SEL value may be determined. With the approval of the FAA, the noise signal may be tape recorded for subsequent analysis.
(i) The SEL values from each flyover test may be directly determined from an integrating sound level meter complying with the standards of IEC 804 (Incorporated by reference, see § 36.6) for a Type 1 instrument set at “slow” response.
(ii) The acoustic signal from the helicopter, along with the calibration signals specified under paragraph (e) of this section and the background noise signal required under paragraph (f) of this section, may be recorded on a magnetic tape recorder for subsequent analysis for an integrating sound level meter identified in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section. The record/playback system (including the audio tape) of the tape recorder must conform to the requirements prescribed in section A36.3.6 of appendix A to this part. The tape recorder shall comply with the specifications of IEC 561 (Incorporated by reference, see § 36.6).
(iii) The characteristics of the complete system shall comply with the recommendations given in IEC 651 (Incorporated by reference, see § 36.6) with regard to the specifications concerning microphone, amplifier, and indicating instrument characteristics.
(iv) The response of the complete system to a sensibly plane progressive wave of constant amplitude shall lie within the tolerance limits specified in Table IV and Table V for Type 1 instruments in IEC 651 for weighting curve “A” over the frequency range of 45 Hz to 11500 Hz.
(2) [Reserved]
(v) A windscreen must be used with the microphone during each measurement of the helicopter flyover noise. Correction for any insertion loss produced by the windscreen, as a function of the frequency of the acoustic calibration required under paragraph (e) of this section, must be applied to the measured data and any correction applied must be reported.
(e)
Calibrations.
(1) If the helicopter acoustic signal is tape recorded for subsequent analysis, the measuring system and components of the recording system must be calibrated as prescribed under section A36.3.6 of appendix A of this part.
(2) If the helicopter acoustic signal is directly measured by an integrating sound level meter:
(i) The overall sensitivity of the measuring system shall be checked before and after the series of flyover tests and at intervals (not exceeding one-hour duration) during the flyover tests using an acoustic calibrator using sine wave noise generating a known sound pressure level at a known frequency.
(ii) The performance of equipment in the system will be considered satisfactory if, during each day's testing, the variation in the calibration value does not exceed 0.5 dB. The SEL data collected during the flyover tests shall be adjusted to account for any variation in the calibration value.
(iii) A performance calibration analysis of each piece of calibration equipment, including acoustic calibrators, reference microphones, and voltage insertion devices, must have been made during the six calendar months proceeding the beginning of the helicopter flyover series. Each calibration shall be traceable to the National Institute of Standards and Technology.
(f)
Noise measurement procedures.
(1) The microphone shall be of the pressure-sensitive capacitive type designed for nearly uniform grazing incidence response. The microphone shall be mounted with the center of the sensing element 4 feet (1.2 meters) above the local ground surface and shall be oriented for grazing incidence such that the sensing element, the diaphragm, is substantially in the plane defined by the nominal flight path of the helicopter and the noise measurement station.
(2) If a tape recorder is used, the frequency response of the electrical system must be determined at a level within 10 dB of the full-scale reading used during the test, utilizing pink or pseudorandom noise.
(3) The ambient noise, including both acoustical background and electrical noise of the measurement systems shall be determined in the test area and the system gain set at levels which will be used for helicopter noise measurements. If helicopter sound levels do not exceed the background sound levels by at least 15 dB(A), flyovers at an FAA-approved lower height may be used and the results adjusted to the reference measurement point by an FAA-approved method.
(4) If an integrating sound level meter is used to measure the helicopter noise, the instrument operator shall monitor the continuous A-weighted (slow response) noise levels throughout each flyover to ensure that the SEL integration process includes, at minimum, all of the noise signal between the maximum A-weighted sound level (L
AMAX
) and the 10 dB down points in the flyover time history. The instrument operator shall note the actual db(A) levels at the start and stop of the SEL integration interval and document these levels along with the value of
L
AMAX
and the integration interval (in seconds) for inclusion in the noise data submitted as part of the reporting requirements under section J36.111(b) of this appendix.

# Section J36.201 Noise Evaluation in SEL.
The noise evaluation measure shall be the sound exposure level (SEL) in units of dB(A) as prescribed under section J36.109(b) of this appendix. The SEL value for each flyover may be directly determined by use of an integrating sound level meter.

# Section J36.203 Calculation of Noise Levels.
(a) To demonstrate compliance with the noise level limits specified under section J36.305 of this appendix, the SEL noise levels from each valid flyover, corrected as necessary to reference conditions under section J36.205 of this appendix, must be arithmetically averaged to obtain a single SEL dB(A) mean value for the flyover series. No individual flyover run may be omitted from the averaging process, unless otherwise specified or approved by the FAA.
(b) The minimum sample size acceptable for the helicopter flyover certification measurements is six. The number of samples must be large enough to establish statistically a 90 percent confidence limit that does not exceed ±1.5 dB(A).
(c) All data used and calculations performed under this section, including the calculated 90 percent confidence limits, must be documented and provided under the reporting requirements of section J36.111 of this appendix.

# Section J36.205 Detailed Data Correction Procedures.
(a) When certification test conditions measured under part B of this appendix differ from the reference test conditions prescribed under section J36.3 of this appendix, appropriate adjustments shall be made to the measured noise data in accordance with the methods set out in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. At minimum, appropriate adjustments shall be made for off-reference altitude and for the difference between reference airspeed and adjusted reference airspeed.
(b) The adjustment for off-reference altitude may be approximated from:
delta
J

where
delta
J
1
is the quantity in decibels that must be algebraically added to the measured SEL noise level to correct for an off-reference flight path, H
T
is the height, in feet, of the test helicopter when directly over the noise measurement point, and the constant (12.5) accounts for the effects on spherical spreading and duration from the off-reference altitude.
(c) The adjustment for the difference between reference airspeed and adjusted reference airspeed is calculated from:
delta
J
3
= 10 log
10
(V
RA
/V

) dB;
Where
delta
J
3
is the quantity in decibels that must be algebraically added to the measured SEL noise level to correct for the influence of the adjustment of the reference airspeed on the duration of the measured flyover event as perceived at the noise measurement station, V
R
is the reference airspeed as prescribed under section J36.3.(c) of this appendix, and V
RA
is the adjusted reference airspeed as prescribed under section J36.105(c) of this appendix.
(d) No correction for source noise during the flyover other than the variation of source noise accounted for by the adjustment of the reference airspeed prescribed for under section J36.105(c) of this appendix need be applied.
(e) No correction for the difference between the reference ground speed and the actual ground speed need be applied.
(f) No correction for off-reference atmospheric attenuation need be applied.
(g) The SEL adjustments must be less than 2.0 dB(A) for differences between test and reference flight procedures prescribed under section J36.105 of this appendix unless a larger adjustment value is approved by the FAA.
(h) All data used and calculations performed under this section must be documented and provided under the reporting requirements specified under section J36.111 of this appendix.

(1) Stage 2 noise limit is constant at 82 decibels SEL for helicopters up to 1,737 pounds (787 kg) maximum certificated takeoff weight (mass) and increases linearly with the logarithm of the helicopter weight at a rate of 3.0 decibels SEL per the doubling of weight thereafter. The limit may be calculated by the equation:
L
AE
(limit) = 82 + 3.0 [log
10
(MTOW/1737)/log
10
(2)] dB,
where MTOW is the maximum takeoff weight, in pounds, for which certification under this appendix is requested.
(2) Stage 3 noise limit is constant at 82 decibels SEL for helicopters up to 3,125 pounds (1,417 kg) maximum certificated takeoff weight (mass) and increases linearly with the logarithm of the helicopter weight at a rate of 3.0 decibels SEL per the doubling of weight thereafter. The limit may be calculated using the equation:
L
AE
(limit) = 82 + 3.0 [log10(MTOW/3125)/log10(2)] dB,
where MTOW is the maximum takeoff weight, in pounds.

§ 38.19
Change criteria.
(a) For an airplane that has been shown to comply with § 38.17, any subsequent version of that airplane must demonstrate compliance with § 38.17 if the subsequent version incorporates a modification that either increases:
(1) The maximum takeoff mass; or
(2) The fuel efficiency metric value by a percentage that is more than the following calculated thresholds.
(i) For airplanes with a MTOM greater than or equal to 5,700 kg, the threshold decreases linearly from 1.35 percent
for an airplane with a MTOM of 5,700 kg to 0.75 percent for an airplane with a MTOM of 60,000 kg.
(ii) For airplanes with a MTOM greater than or equal to 60,000 kg, the threshold decreases linearly from 0.75 percent for an airplane with a MTOM of 60,000 kg to 0.70 percent for airplanes with a MTOM of 600,000 kg.
(iii) For airplanes with a MTOM greater than or equal to 600,000 kg, the threshold is 0.70 percent.
(b) For an airplane that has been shown to comply with § 38.17, and for any subsequent version of that airplane that incorporates modifications that do not increase the MTOM or the fuel efficiency metric value in excess of the levels shown in paragraph (a) of this section, the fuel efficiency metric value of the modified airplane may be reported to be the same as the value prior to modification.
(c) For an airplane that meets the criteria of § 38.1(a)(4) or (5), on or after January 1, 2023, and before January 1, 2028, the airplane must demonstrate compliance with § 38.17 if it incorporates any modification that increases the fuel efficiency metric value of the airplane prior to modification by more than 1.5 percent.
§ 38.21
Approval before compliance testing.
All procedures, weights, configurations, and other information or data that are used to establish a fuel efficiency level required by this part or in any appendix to this part (including any equivalent procedures) must be approved by the FAA prior to use in certification tests intended to demonstrate compliance with this part.
§ 38.23
Manual information and limitations.
(a)
Information in manuals.
The following information must be included in any FAA-approved section of a FAA-approved Airplane Flight Manual or combination of approved manual material:
(1) Fuel efficiency level established as required by this part; and

A38.1.2.1 SAR may be determined by either—
A38.1.2.1.1 Direct flight test measurement at the SAR test points, including any corrections of test data to reference specifications; or
A38.1.2.1.2 Use of a performance model.
A38.1.2.2 For any determination made under section A38.1.2.1.1 of this appendix, the SAR flight test data must have been acquired in accordance with the procedures defined in this appendix and approved by the FAA.
A38.1.2.3 For any determination made under section A38.1.2.1.2 of this appendix, the performance model must:
A38.1.2.3.1 Be verified that the model produces the values that are the same as FAA-approved SAR flight test data;
A38.1.2.3.2 Include a detailed description of any test and analysis method and any algorithm used so as to allow evaluation by the FAA; and
A38.1.2.3.3 Be approved by the FAA before use.

# A38.2 Reference Specifications for SAR Flight Tests
A38.2.1 The following reference specifications must be established when determining SAR values for an airplane. No reference specification may exceed any airworthiness limit approved for the airplane under this
chapter. See section A38.5 of this appendix for further information.
A38.2.1.1 Reference specifications at the airplane level:
A38.2.1.1.1 Airplane at the reference masses listed in § 38.13(b);
A38.2.1.1.2 A combination of altitude and airspeed selected by the applicant;
A38.2.1.1.3 Airplane in steady, unaccelerated, straight and level flight;
A38.2.1.1.4 Airplane in longitudinal and lateral trim;
A38.2.1.1.5 Airplane gravitational acceleration when travelling in the direction of true North in still air at the reference altitude and a geodetic latitude of 45.5 degrees, based on g
0
(g
0
is 9.80665 m/s
2
, which is the standard acceleration due to gravity at sea level and a geodetic latitude of 45.5 degrees);
A38.2.1.1.6 A reference airplane center of gravity (CG) position selected by the applicant to be representative of the mid-CG point relevant to design cruise performance at each of the three reference airplane masses; and
A38.2.1.1.7 A wing structural loading condition defined by the applicant that is representative of operations conducted in accordance with the airplane's maximum payload capability.
A38.2.1.2 Reference specifications at the engine level:
A38.2.1.2.1 Electrical and mechanical power extraction and bleed flow relevant to design cruise performance, as selected by the applicant;
Note 1 to A38.2.1.2.1
—Power extraction and bleed flow attributable to the use of optional equipment such as passenger entertainment systems need not be included.
A38.2.1.2.2 Engine stability bleeds operating according to the manufacturer's normal schedule for the engine; and
A38.2.1.2.3 Engines with at least 15 cycles or 50 engine flight hours.
A38.2.1.3 Other reference specifications:
A38.2.1.3.1 ICAO standard day atmosphere (Doc 7488/3, 3rd edition 1993, titled “Manual of the ICAO Standard Atmosphere (extended to 80 kilometres (262 500 feet))”) (incorporated by reference, see § 38.7); and
A38.2.1.3.2 Fuel lower heating value equal to 43.217 MJ/kg (18,−580 BTU/lb).
A38.2.2 If any test conditions are not the same as the reference specifications of this appendix, the test conditions must be corrected to the reference specifications as described in section A38.5 of this appendix.

# A38.3 Determination of Reference Geometric Factor (RGF)
A38.3.1 This section provides additional information for determining the RGF, as required by § 38.15.
A38.3.2 The area that defines RGF includes all pressurized space on a single or multiple decks including aisles, assist spaces, passageways, stairwells and areas that can accommodate cargo or auxiliary fuel containers. It does not include permanent integrated fuel tanks within the cabin, or any unpressurized fairings, crew rest or work areas, or cargo areas that are not on the main or upper deck (
e.g.,
`loft' or under floor areas). RGF does not include the flight deck crew zone.
A38.3.3 The aft boundary to be used for calculating RGF is the aft pressure bulkhead. The forward boundary is the forward pressure bulkhead, not including the flight deck crew zone.
A38.3.4 Areas that are accessible to both crew and passengers are not considered part of the flight deck crew zone. For an airplane that has a flight deck door, the aft boundary of the flight deck crew zone is the plane of the flight deck door. For an airplane that has no flight deck door or has optional interior configurations that include different locations of the flight deck door, the aft boundary is determined by the configuration that provides the smallest available flight deck crew zone. For airplanes certificated for single-pilot operation, the flight deck crew zone is measured as half the width of the flight deck.
A38.3.5 Figures A38-1 and A38-2 of this appendix provide a notional view of the RGF boundary conditions.

A38.4.2.2.3 Alternatives to the stable test condition criteria of section A38.4.2.2.2 of this appendix may be used provided that stability is sufficiently demonstrated to the FAA.
A38.4.2.2.4 Data obtained at test points that do not meet the stability criteria of section A38.4.2.2.2 may be acceptable as an equivalent procedure, subject to FAA approval.
A38.4.2.2.5 SAR measurements at the test points must be separated by either:

# A38.5 Measurement of Specific Air Range
A38.5.1 Measurement System
A38.5.1.1 The following parameters must be recorded at a minimum sampling rate of 1 Hertz (cycle per second):
A38.5.1.1.1 Airspeed;
A38.5.1.1.2 Ground speed;
A38.5.1.1.3 True airspeed;
A38.5.1.1.4 Fuel flow;
A38.5.1.1.5 Engine power setting;
A38.5.1.1.6 Pressure altitude;
A38.5.1.1.7 Temperature;
A38.5.1.1.8 Heading;
A38.5.1.1.9 Track; and
A38.5.1.1.10 Fuel used (for the determination of gross mass and CG position).
A38.5.1.2 The following parameters must be recorded:
A38.5.1.2.1 Latitude;
A38.5.1.2.2 Engine bleed positions and power off-takes; and
A38.5.1.2.3 Power extraction (electrical and mechanical load).
A38.5.1.3 The value of each parameter used for the determination of SAR (except for ground speed) is the simple arithmetic average of the measured values for that parameter obtained throughout the stable test condition described in section A38.4.2.2.2 of this appendix.
A38.5.1.4 For ground speed, the value is the rate of change of ground speed during the SAR test measurement. The rate of change of ground speed during the SAR measurement must be used to evaluate and correct any acceleration or deceleration that might occur during the SAR measurement.
A38.5.1.5 Each measurement device must have sufficient resolution to determine that the stability of a parameter defined in section A38.4.2.2.2 of this appendix is maintained during SAR measurement.
A38.5.1.6 The SAR measurement system consists of the combined instruments and devices, and any associated procedures, used to acquire the following parameters necessary to determine SAR:
A38.5.1.6.1 Fuel flow;
A38.5.1.6.2 Mach number;
A38.5.1.6.3 Altitude;
A38.5.1.6.4 Airplane mass;
A38.5.1.6.5 Ground speed;
A38.5.1.6.6 Outside air temperature;
A38.5.1.6.7 Fuel lower heating value; and
A38.5.1.6.8 CG.
A38.5.1.7 The SAR value is affected by the accuracy of each element that comprises the SAR measurement system. The cumulative error associated with the SAR measurement system is defined as the root sum of squares (RSS) of the individual accuracies.
A38.5.1.8 If the absolute value of the cumulative error of the overall SAR measurement system is greater than 1.5 percent, a penalty equal to the amount that the RSS value exceeds 1.5 percent must be applied to the SAR value that has been corrected to reference specifications (see section A38.5.2 of this appendix). If the absolute value of the cumulative error of the overall SAR measurement system is less than or equal to 1.5 percent, no penalty will be applied.
A38.5.2 Calculation of Specific Air Range from Measured Data
A38.5.2.1 Calculating SAR. SAR must be calculated using the following equation:
SAR = TAS/W
f
Where:
TAS is the true airspeed and W
f
is total airplane fuel flow.
A38.5.2.2 Correcting Measured SAR Values to Reference Specifications
A38.5.2.2.1 The measured SAR values must be corrected to the reference specifications listed in A38.2 of this appendix. Unless otherwise approved by the FAA, corrections to reference specifications must be applied for each of the following measured parameters:
A38.5.2.2.1.1
Acceleration/deceleration (energy).
Drag determination is based on an assumption of steady, unaccelerated flight. Acceleration or deceleration occurring during a test condition affects the assessed drag level. The reference specification is in section A38.2.1.1.3 of this appendix.
A38.5.2.2.1.2
Aeroelastics.
Wing aeroelasticity may cause a variation in drag as a function of airplane wing mass distribution. Airplane wing mass distribution will be affected by the fuel load distribution in the wings and the presence of any external stores. The reference specification is in section A38.2.1.1.7 of this appendix.
A38.5.2.2.1.3
Altitude.
The altitude at which the airplane is flown affects the fuel flow. The reference specification is in section A38.2.1.1.2 of this appendix.
A38.5.2.2.1.4
Apparent gravity.
Acceleration, caused by the local effect of gravity, and inertia, affect the test weight of the airplane. The apparent gravity at the test conditions varies with latitude, altitude, ground speed, and direction of motion relative to the Earth's axis. The reference gravitational acceleration is the gravitational acceleration for the airplane travelling in the direction of true North in still air at the reference altitude, a geodetic latitude of 45.5 degrees, and based on g
0
(see section A38.2.1.1.5 of this appendix).
A38.5.2.2.1.5
CG position.
The position of the airplane CG affects the drag due to longitudinal trim. The reference specification is in section A38.2.1.1.6 of this appendix.
A38.5.2.2.1.6
Electrical and mechanical power extraction and bleed flow.
Electrical and mechanical power extraction, and bleed flow affect the fuel flow. The reference specifications are in sections A38.2.1.2.1 and A38.2.1.2.2 of this appendix.
A38.5.2.2.1.7
Engine deterioration level.
The requirement in section A38.2.1.2.3 of this appendix addresses the minimum deterioration of an engine that is used to determine SAR. Since engine deterioration is rapid when an engine is new, when used for SAR determination:
A38.5.2.2.1.7.1 Subject to FAA approval, an engine having less deterioration than the reference deterioration level in section A38.2.1.2.3 of this appendix must correct the fuel flow to the reference deterioration using an approved method.
A38.5.2.2.1.7.2 An engine with greater deterioration than the reference deterioration level in section A38.2.1.2.3 of this appendix may be used, and no correction is permitted.
A38.5.2.2.1.8
Fuel lower heating value.
The fuel lower heating value defines the energy content of the fuel. The lower heating value directly affects the fuel flow at a given test condition. The reference specification is in section A38.2.1.3.2 of this appendix.
A38.5.2.2.1.9
Reynolds number.
The Reynolds number affects airplane drag. For a given test condition the Reynolds number is a function of the density and viscosity of air at the test altitude and temperature. The reference Reynolds number is derived from the density and viscosity of air from the ICAO standard atmosphere at the reference altitude (see sections A38.2.1.1.2 and A38.2.1.3.1 of this appendix, incorporated by reference see § 38.7).
A38.5.2.2.1.10
Temperature.
The ambient temperature affects the fuel flow. The reference temperature is the standard day temperature from the ICAO standard atmosphere at the reference altitude (see section A38.2.1.3.1 of this appendix, incorporated by reference see § 38.7).
Note 2 to A38.5.2.2.1.10
—Post-flight data analysis includes the correction of measured data for data acquisition hardware response characteristics (
e.g.,
system latency, lag, offset, buffering, etc.).
A38.5.2.2.2 Correction methods are subject to the approval of the FAA.
A38.5.2.3 Using Specific Air Range to Determine the Fuel Efficiency Metric Value
A38.5.2.3.1 Calculate the SAR values for each of the three reference masses as described in § 38.13, including any corrections to reference specifications, as required under this part. The final SAR value for each reference mass is the simple arithmetic average of all valid test points at the appropriate gross mass, or derived from a validated performance model. No data acquired from a valid test point may be omitted unless approved by the FAA.
A38.5.2.3.2 When an FAA-approved performance model is used, extrapolations to aircraft masses other than those tested may be approved when such extrapolations are consistent with accepted airworthiness practices. Since a performance model must be based on data covering an adequate range of lift coefficient, Mach number, and thrust specific fuel consumption, no extrapolation of those parameters is permitted.
A38.5.3 Validity of Results
A38.5.3.1 A 90 percent confidence interval must be calculated for each of the SAR values at the three reference masses.
A38.5.3.2 If the 90 percent confidence interval of the SAR value at any of the three reference airplane masses—
A38.5.3.2.1 Is less than or equal to ±1.5 percent, the SAR value may be used.
A38.5.3.2.2 Exceeds ±1.5 percent, a penalty equal to the amount that the 90 percent confidence interval exceeds ±1.5 percent must be applied to the SAR value, as approved by the FAA.
A38.5.3.3 If clustered data is acquired separately for each of the three gross mass reference points, the minimum sample size acceptable for each of the three gross mass SAR values is six.
A38.5.3.4 If SAR data is collected over a range of masses, the minimum sample size is 12 and the 90 percent confidence interval is calculated for the mean regression line through the data.

§ 39.1
Purpose of this regulation.
The regulations in this part provide a legal framework for FAA's system of Airworthiness Directives.
§ 39.3
Definition of airworthiness directives.
FAA's airworthiness directives are legally enforceable rules that apply to the following products: aircraft, aircraft engines, propellers, and appliances.
§ 39.5
When does FAA issue airworthiness directives?
FAA issues an airworthiness directive addressing a product when we find that:
(a) An unsafe condition exists in the product; and
(b) The condition is likely to exist or develop in other products of the same type design.
§ 39.7
What is the legal effect of failing to comply with an airworthiness directive?
Anyone who operates a product that does not meet the requirements of an applicable airworthiness directive is in violation of this section.
§ 39.9
What if I operate an aircraft or use a product that does not meet the requirements of an airworthiness directive?
If the requirements of an airworthiness directive have not been met, you violate § 39.7 each time you operate the aircraft or use the product.
§ 39.11
What actions do airworthiness directives require?
Airworthiness directives specify inspections you must carry out, conditions and limitations you must comply with, and any actions you must take to resolve an unsafe condition.
§ 39.13
Are airworthiness directives part of the Code of Federal Regulations?
Yes, airworthiness directives are part of the Code of Federal Regulations, but they are not codified in the annual edition. FAA publishes airworthiness directives in full in the
Federal Register
as amendments to § 39.13.

# Editorial Note:
For a complete list of citations to airworthiness directives published in the
Federal Register,
consult the following publications: For airworthiness directives published in the
Federal Register
since 2001, see the entries for 14 CFR 39.13 in the List of CFR Sections Affected, which appears in the “Finding Aids” section of the printed volume and at
www.govinfo.gov.
For citations to prior amendments, see the entries for 14 CFR 39.13 in the separate publications List of CFR Sections Affected, 1973-1985, List of CFR Sections Affected, 1964-1972, and List of CFR Sections Affected, 1986-2000, and the entries for 14 CFR 507.10 in the List of Sections Affected, 1949-1963. See also the annual editions of the Federal Register Index for subject matter references and citations to FAA airworthiness directives.
§ 39.15
Does an airworthiness directive apply if the product has been changed?
Yes, an airworthiness directive applies to each product identified in the airworthiness directive, even if an individual product has been changed by modifying, altering, or repairing it in the area addressed by the airworthiness directive.
§ 39.17
What must I do if a change in a product affects my ability to accomplish the actions required in an airworthiness directive?
If a change in a product affects your ability to accomplish the actions required by the airworthiness directive in any way, you must request FAA approval of an alternative method of compliance. Unless you can show the change eliminated the unsafe condition, your request should include the specific actions that you propose to address the unsafe condition. Submit your request in the manner described in § 39.19.
§ 39.19
May I address the unsafe condition in a way other than that set out in the airworthiness directive?
Yes, anyone may propose to FAA an alternative method of compliance or a change in the compliance time, if the proposal provides an acceptable level of safety. Unless FAA authorizes otherwise, send your proposal to your principal inspector. Include the specific actions you are proposing to address the unsafe condition. The principal inspector may add comments and will send your request to the manager of the office identified in the airworthiness directive (manager). You may send a copy to the manager at the same time you send it to the principal inspector. If you do not have a principal inspector send your proposal directly to the manager. You may use the alternative you propose only if the manager approves it.
§ 39.21
Where can I get information about FAA-approved alternative methods of compliance?
Each airworthiness directive identifies the office responsible for approving alternative methods of compliance. That office can provide information about alternatives it has already approved.
§ 39.23
May I fly my aircraft to a repair facility to do the work required by an airworthiness directive?
Yes, the operations specifications giving some operators authority to operate include a provision that allow them to fly their aircraft to a repair facility to do the work required by an
airworthiness directive. If you do not have this authority, the local Flight Standards District Office of FAA may issue you a special flight permit unless the airworthiness directive states otherwise. To ensure aviation safety, FAA may add special requirements for operating your aircraft to a place where the repairs or modifications can be accomplished. FAA may also decline to issue a special flight permit in particular cases if we determine you cannot move the aircraft safely.
§ 39.25
How do I get a special flight permit?
Apply to FAA for a special flight permit following the procedures in 14 CFR 21.199.
§ 39.27
What do I do if the airworthiness directive conflicts with the service document on which it is based?
In some cases an airworthiness directive incorporates by reference a manufacturer's service document. In these cases, the service document becomes part of the airworthiness directive. In some cases the directions in the service document may be modified by the airworthiness directive.
