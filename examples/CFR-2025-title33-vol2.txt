# Explanation
The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
Title 1 through Title 16
as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27
as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41
as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50
as of October 1
The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.

# LEGAL STATUS
The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

# HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, July 1, 2025), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

# EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.

# OMB CONTROL NUMBERS
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request.
Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.

# PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.

# “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.

# INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
What is incorporation by reference?
Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
What is a proper incorporation by reference?
The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
(b) The matter incorporated is adequately summarized in the preamble of the final rule and is available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?
If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or email fr.inspection@nara.gov.

# CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES
A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR
Index and Finding Aids.
This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.
An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

# REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

Challenges.
Within five days after receipt of the notice described in § 125.39 the applicant or holder may request disqualification of any member of the Hearing Board on the grounds of personal bias or other cause. The request shall be accompanied by an affidavit setting forth in detail the facts alleged to constitute grounds for disqualification. The affidavit may be supplemented by an oral presentation if desired. If after due consideration the Chairman believes a challenged member is qualified notwithstanding the challenge, he shall notify the person who made the challenge and arrange to proceed with the hearing. If the person who made the challenge takes exception to the ruling of the Chairman, the exception and data relating to the claim of disqualification shall be made a matter of record. If the Chairman finds that there is reasonable ground for disqualification he shall furnish the person who made the challenge with the name of an alternate in lieu of the challenged member and arrange to proceed with the hearing. In the event the Chairman is challenged, he shall forthwith notify the Commandant, furnishing the grounds for the claim of disqualification, and the Commandant shall act upon the challenge in accordance with the foregoing procedure. In addition to the right to challenge for cause, a person who has requested a hearing shall have two peremptory challenges, one challenge for the management member and one challenge for the labor member of the Hearing Board.

In addition, acceptance of any compensation from the Fund precludes the claimant from filing any subsequent action against any person to recover costs or damages which are the subject of the compensated claim. Acceptance of any compensation also constitutes an agreement by the claimant to assign to the Fund any rights, claims, and causes of action the claimant has against any person for the costs and damages which are the subject of the compensated claims and to cooperate reasonably with the Fund in any claim or action by the Fund against any person to recover the amounts paid by the Fund.

(b) Claimant's failure to accept an offer of settlement within 60 days after the date the offer was mailed to the claimant automatically voids the offer. The Director, NPFC, reserves the right to revoke an offer at any time.
(c) A claimant will be notified in writing sent by certified or registered mail whenever a claim against the Fund is denied. The failure of the Director, NPFC, to make final disposition of a claim within six months after it is filed shall, at the option of the claimant any time thereafter, be deemed a final denial of the claim.
(d) The Director, NPFC, upon written request of the claimant or of a person duly authorized to act on the claimant's behalf, reconsiders any claim denied. The request for reconsideration must be in writing and include the factual or legal grounds for the relief requested, providing any additional support for the claim. The request must be received by the Director, NPFC, within 60 days after the date the denial was mailed to the claimant or within 30 days after receipt of the denial by the claimant, whichever date is earlier. Reconsideration may only be requested once for each claim denied. The Director, NPFC will provide the claimant seeking reconsideration with written notification of the decision within 90 days after receipt of the request for reconsideration. This written decision is final. The failure of the Director, NPFC, to make final disposition of a reconsideration within 90 days after it is received shall, at the option of the claimant any time thereafter, be deemed a final denial of the reconsideration.

# Subpart A—Introduction
§ 137.1
Purpose and applicability.
(a) In general under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (33 U.S.C. 2701,
et seq.
), an owner or operator of a facility (as defined in § 137.10) that is the source of a discharge, or a substantial threat of discharge, of oil into the navigable waters or adjoining shorelines or the exclusive economic zone is liable for damages and removal costs resulting from the discharge or threat. However, if that person can demonstrate, among other criteria not addressed in this part, that they did not know and had no reason to know at the time of their acquisition of the real property on which the facility is located that oil was located on, in, or at the facility, the person may be eligible for the innocent landowner defense to liability under 33 U.S.C. 2703(d)(4). One element of the defense is that the person made all appropriate inquiries into the nature of the real property on which the facility is located before acquiring it. The purpose of this part is to prescribe standards and practices for making those inquiries.
(b) Under 33 U.S.C. 2703(d)(4)(E), this part does not apply to real property purchased by a non-governmental entity or non-commercial entity for residential use or other similar uses where a property inspection and a title search reveal no basis for further investigation. In those cases, the property inspection and title search satisfy the requirements of this part.
(c) This part does not affect the existing OPA 90 liability protections for State and local governments that acquire a property involuntarily in their functions as sovereigns under 33 U.S.C. 2703(d)(2)(B). Involuntary acquisition of properties by State and local governments fall under the provisions of 33 U.S.C. 2703(d)(2)(B), not under the all-appropriate-inquiries provision of 33 U.S.C. 2703(d)(4) and this part.
§ 137.5
Disclosure obligations.
(a) Under 33 U.S.C. 2703(c)(1), persons specified in § 137.1(a), including environmental professionals, must report the incident as required by law if they know or have reason to know of the incident.
(b) This part does not limit or expand disclosure obligations under any Federal, State, tribal, or local law. It is the obligation of each person, including environmental professionals, conducting inquiries to determine his or her respective disclosure obligations under Federal, State, tribal, and local law and to comply with them.
§ 137.10

§ 137.65
Visual inspections of the facility, the real property on which the facility is located, and adjoining properties.
(a) For the purpose of achieving the objectives and performance factors of § 137.30(a) and (b), the inquiry of the environmental professional must include the following:
(1) A visual on-site inspection of the facility and the real property on which the facility is located, and the improvements at the facility and real property, including a visual inspection of the areas where oil may be or may have been used, stored, treated, handled, or disposed. Physical limitations to the visual inspection must be noted.
(2) A visual inspection of adjoining properties, from the subject real property line, public rights-of-way, or other vantage point (e.g., aerial photography), including a visual inspection of areas where oil may be or may have been stored, treated, handled or disposed. A visual on-site inspection is recommended, though not required. Physical limitations to the inspection of adjacent properties must be noted.
(b) Except as in paragraph (c) of this section, a visual on-site inspection of the facility and the real property on which the facility is located must be conducted.
(c) An on-site inspection is not required if an on-site visual inspection of the facility and the real property on which the facility is located cannot be performed because of physical limitations, remote and inaccessible location, or other inability to obtain access to the facility and the real property on which the facility is located after good faith efforts have been taken to obtain access. The mere refusal of a voluntary seller to provide access to the facility and the real property on which the facility is located is not justification for not conducting an on-site inspection. The inquiry of the environmental professional must include—
(1) Visually inspecting the facility and the real property on which the facility is located using another method, such as aerial imagery for large properties, or visually inspecting the facility and the real property on which the facility is located from the nearest accessible vantage point, such as the property line or public road for small properties;
(2) Documenting the efforts undertaken to obtain access and an explanation of why such efforts were unsuccessful; and
(3) Documenting other sources of information regarding the presence or likely presence of oil at the facility and the real property on which the facility is located that were consulted according to § 137.30(a). The documentation should include comments, if any, by the environmental professional on the significance of the failure to conduct a visual on-site inspection of the facility and the real property on which the facility is located with regard to the ability to identify conditions indicative of the presence or likely presence of oil at the facility and the real property.
§ 137.70
Specialized knowledge or experience on the part of persons specified in § 137.1(a).
(a) For the purpose of identifying conditions indicative of the presence or likely presence of oil at the facility and the real property on which the facility is located, persons specified in § 137.1(a) must take into account their own specialized knowledge of the facility and the real property on which the facility is located, the area surrounding the facility and the real property on which the facility is located, and the conditions of adjoining properties and their experience relevant to the inquiry.
(b) The results of all appropriate inquiries under § 137.33 must take into account the relevant and applicable specialized knowledge and experience of the persons specified in § 137.1(a) responsible for undertaking the inquiry.

How to apply for a COFR.
To apply for a COFR of any type, the COFR Operator must—
(1) Submit, or cause to be submitted, to the Director, by one of the submission methods provided in § 138.60(c):
(i) An Application;
(A) For an Individual Certificate, list the name of the covered vessel, and the vessel's gross tonnage information, including the measurement system(s) used on the application;
(B) For a Fleet Certificate, instead of listing each individual barge, mark the box with the following statement: “This is an Application for a Fleet Certificate. The largest unmanned, non-self-propelled, non-tank barge to be covered by this Application is [INSERT APPLICABLE GROSS TONS] GT ITC and [INSERT GROSS TONNAGE] GRT”; and
(C) For a Master Certificate, instead of listing each individual vessel, mark the box with the following statement: “This is an Application for a Master Certificate. The largest tank vessel to be covered by this Application is [INSERT APPLICABLE GROSS TONS] GT ITC and [INSERT APPLICABLE GROSS TONS] GRT, as applicable. The largest vessel other than a tank vessel to be covered by this Application is [INSERT APPLICABLE GROSS TONS] GT ITC and [INSERT APPLICABLE GROSS TONS] GRT, as applicable.”
(ii) The evidence of financial responsibility using one of the guaranty methods provided in § 138.110;
(A) For a Fleet Certificate, the evidence of financial responsibility must be in the total applicable amount, determined as provided in § 138.100, for the largest unmanned, non-self-propelled, non-tank barge to be covered.
(B) For a Master Certificate, the evidence of financial responsibility must be in the total applicable amount determined as provided in § 138.100 for the largest tank vessel and largest non-tank vessel to be covered by the Master Certificate.
(iii) The agent for service of process designations required by § 138.130; and

(A) At the time of Application for a Master Certificate, the COFR Operator must submit a report to the Director, indicating: the name; previous name, if applicable; type; gross tonnage and measurement system(s) used, for each vessel covered by the Master Certificate, indicating which vessels, if any, are tank vessels. If a vessel has both a GT ITC and GRT tonnage, specify both gross tonnages.
(B) Six months after receiving a Master Certificate, and every 6 months thereafter, each COFR Operator must submit to the Director, an updated report, separately listing the vessels no longer covered by that Master Certificate. If a vessel has both a GT ITC and GRT, both gross tonnages must be specified. If a vessel has been transferred to another responsible party and the COFR Operator to whom the Master Certificate was issued ceases to be the vessel's operator, the COFR Operator must report the date and place of the transfer, and the name and contact information of the responsible party to whom the vessel was transferred. If the vessels covered by the Master Certificate have not changed from the previous report, the COFR Operator may submit an updated report that indicates no change from previous report.
(2) Pay, or cause to be paid, all fees required by § 138.120.
(b)
Application deadline.
The Director must receive the Application, evidence of financial responsibility, and other required supporting documentation, at least 21 days prior to the date the Certificate is required. The COFR Operator may seek an exception to the 21-day submission deadline only as provided in § 138.60(e)(3).
(c)
Where to obtain Application forms.
COFR Operators may create an Application using the online eCOFR web process (located at
https://npfc.uscg.mil/cofr/default.aspx
) or, if not using eCOFR, may obtain an “Application for Vessel Certificate of Financial Responsibility (Water Pollution)” at the same website.
(d)
Requirement to verify, or sign and date, the Application.
(1) The COFR Operator must complete and either verify the Application in eCOFR as provided in § 138.60(c)(1)(i) or, if not using eCOFR, sign and date the hard-copy signature page of the Application and submit the signed Application to the
Director, by one of the methods specified in § 138.60(c)(1)(ii) through (iv).
(2) The Application must include the title of the person signing it.
(3) If the person signing the Application is acting under a Power of Attorney, they must include a copy of the Power of Attorney with the Application.
(e)
Requirement to update Applications.
The COFR Operator must report any changes to the Application to the Director in writing, no later than 5 business days after discovery of the change. The Director may require that the COFR Operator submit a revised Application and provide additional evidence of financial responsibility, and pay any additional fees required by § 138.120.
(f)
Amending Fleet and Master Certificates.
Before operating a barge or vessel that exceeds the maximum gross tonnage indicated on the COFR, the COFR Operator must:
(1) Submit a new or amended Application, or a written request to supplement the Application, to reflect the new maximum gross tonnages on the COFR;
(2) Unless the COFR Operator qualifies as a self-insurer at the higher total applicable amount, submit, or cause to be submitted, evidence of financial responsibility using one of the guaranty methods provided in § 138.110 to the Director, demonstrating increased coverage based on the new maximum gross tonnage; and
(3) Pay a new certification fee, as required by § 138.120.
§ 138.90
Renewing COFRs.
(a) The COFR Operator must submit a request for COFR renewal to the NPFC at least 21 days, but no earlier than 90 days, before the expiration date of the current COFR.
(b) The COFR Operator may seek an exception to the 21-day request for COFR renewal submission deadline in paragraph (a) of this section only as provided in § 138.60(e)(3).
(c) The COFR Operator must identify in the request for COFR renewal all changes to the information contained in the initial Application, including the gross ton measurement system(s) used (if not previously provided), the evidence of financial responsibility, and all other supporting documentation previously submitted to the Director, as provided in § 138.150.
§ 138.100
How to calculate a total applicable amount.
The total applicable amount is the sum of the OPA 90 applicable amount determined under paragraph (a) of this section plus the CERCLA applicable amount determined under paragraph (b) of this section.
(a)
OPA 90 applicable amount.
The applicable amount under OPA 90 is equal to the applicable limit of liability determined as provided in subpart B of this part.
(b)
CERCLA applicable amount.
The applicable amount under CERCLA is determined as follows:
(1) For a vessel over 300 gross tons carrying a hazardous substance as cargo, and for any vessel covered under § 138.110(c)(3) or (d)(2)(ii) (calculation of CERCLA applicable amounts for financial guarantors and self-insurers), the greater of $5,000,000 or $300 per gross ton.
(2) For any other vessel over 300 gross tons, the greater of $500,000 or $300 per gross ton.
(c)
Amended applicable amounts.
If an applicable amount determined under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section is amended by statute or regulation, the COFR Operator must establish and maintain evidence of financial responsibility in an amount equal to or greater than the amended total applicable amount, as provided in § 138.240(a).
(d)
OPA 90 and CERCLA applicable amounts and limits of liability.
The responsible parties are strictly, jointly and severally liable, for the costs and damages resulting from an incident or a release, but together they need only establish and maintain an amount of financial responsibility equal to the single limit of liability per incident or release. Only that portion of the evidence of financial responsibility under this subpart with respect to—
(1) OPA 90 is required to be made available by a guarantor for the costs and damages related to an incident where there is not also a release; and
(2) CERCLA is required to be made available by a guarantor for the costs and damages related to a release where
there is not also an incident. A guarantor (or a self-insurer for whom the exceptions to a limitations of liability are not applicable), therefore, is not required to apply the entire amount of financial responsibility to an incident involving oil alone or a release involving a hazardous substance alone.
§ 138.110
How to establish and maintain evidence of financial responsibility.
(a)
General requirement; guaranty effective date and termination date.
The COFR Operator of each vessel must submit, or cause to be submitted, to the Director, the evidence of financial responsibility required by § 138.40(a) using one of the methods specified in this section.
(1) If submitted on behalf of the COFR Operator, the guarantor must provide evidence of financial responsibility to the Director.
(2) The effective and termination dates are as follows:

(3) Termination provisions:
(i) The guarantor must specify the reason for terminating the guaranty in the notice required by this paragraph, if known.
(ii) Termination of the guaranty as to any covered vessel will not affect the liability of the guarantor in connection with an incident or release commencing or occurring prior to the effective date of the guaranty termination.
(4) If, at any time, the information contained in the evidence of financial responsibility submitted under this section changes, or there is a material change in a guarantor or self-insurer's financial position, the guarantor or COFR Operator or self-insurer (as applicable), must report the change to the Director, as provided in § 138.150.
(b)
Insurance guaranty method.
The COFR Operator may establish and maintain evidence of financial responsibility using the insurance guaranty method by submitting an Insurance Guaranty Form to the Director.
(1) Each form must be executed by no more than four COFR insurance guarantors accepted by the Director. A lead underwriter is considered one of the COFR insurance guarantors.
(2) The process for establishing and maintaining the acceptability of a COFR insurance guarantor is as follows:
(i) The COFR insurance guarantor must request an initial determination by the Director of the COFR insurance guarantor's acceptability to serve as a COFR insurance guarantor under this subpart, at least 90 days before the date a COFR is required, by submitting information describing the COFR insurance guarantor's structure, business practices, history, and financial strength, and such other information as may be requested by the Director.
(ii) The Director reviews the continued acceptability of COFR insurance guarantors annually. Each COFR insurance guarantor must submit updates to the initial request submitted under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, annually, within 90 days after the close of the COFR insurance guarantor's fiscal year, describing any material changes to the COFR insurance guarantor's legal status, structure, business practices, history, and financial strength, since the previous year's submission, and providing such other information as may be requested by the Director.
(c)
Financial guaranty method.
The COFR Operator may establish and maintain evidence of financial responsibility using the financial guaranty method by submitting a Financial Guaranty Form to the Director.
(1) Each form must be executed by no more than four financial guarantors accepted by the Director, at least one of which must be a parent or affiliate of the COFR Operator. (
See
paragraph (g) of this section for additional requirements if more than one financial guarantor signs the form.)
(2) The process for establishing and maintaining the acceptability of a financial guarantor is as follows:
(i) The financial guarantor must comply with the self-insurance provisions in paragraph (d) of this section, and the periodic reporting requirements in paragraphs (e)(1) through (4) of this section.
(ii) The financial guarantor must also demonstrate that it maintains net worth and working capital, each in amounts equal to or greater than—
(A) The aggregate total applicable amounts, calculated for each COFR Operator vessel for which the financial guaranty is being provided, based on each such COFR Operator's vessel with the greatest total applicable amount, plus—
(B) The total applicable amount required to be demonstrated by a self-insurer under this subpart if the financial guarantor is also acting as a self-insurer.
(3) In the case of a vessel greater than 300 gross tons, calculate the CERCLA applicable amount under § 138.100(b)(1) based on a vessel carrying hazardous substances as cargo.
(d)
Self-insurance method.
The COFR Operator may establish and maintain evidence of financial responsibility using the self-insurance method as follows:
(1) Submit to the Director the financial statements specified in paragraphs (e)(1) through (4) of this section for the fiscal year preceding the date the COFR Operator signs the Application or request for COFR renewal.
(2) Demonstrate that the COFR Operator maintains, in the United States, working capital and net worth, each in amounts equal to or greater than the total applicable amount, calculated as follows:
(i) If the self-insurer has multiple vessels, calculate the total applicable amount based on the vessel with the greatest total applicable amount.
(ii) In the case of a vessel greater than 300 gross tons, calculate the CERCLA applicable amount under § 138.100(b)(1) based on a vessel carrying hazardous substances as cargo.
(e)
Reporting requirements for self-insurers and financial guarantors.
(1) Each self-insurer and financial guarantor must submit the following reports to the Director with the Application and annually thereafter, within the deadlines specified in paragraph (e)(4) of this section:
(i) Submit the self-insurer or financial guarantor's annual, current, and audited non-consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, and audited by an independent Certified Public Accountant in accordance with Generally Accepted Auditing Standards.
(ii) Accompany the financial statements with a declaration from the self-insurer or financial guarantor's chief financial officer, treasurer, or equivalent official, certifying the amount of the self-insurer or financial guarantor's current assets, and the amount of the self-insurer or financial guarantor's total assets included in the accompanying balance sheet, which are located in the United States.
(iii) If the financial statements cannot be submitted in non-consolidated form, submit a consolidated statement accompanied by an additional declaration prepared by the same Certified Public Accountant—
(A) Verifying the amount by which the total assets located in the United States exceed the self-insurer or financial guarantor's total (worldwide) liabilities, and the self-insurer or financial guarantor's current assets located in the United States exceed the self-insurer or financial guarantor's total (worldwide) current liabilities;
(B) Specifically naming the self-insurer or financial guarantor;
(C) Confirming that the amounts so verified relate only to the self-insurer
or financial guarantor, apart from any parent or other affiliated entity; and
(D) Identifying the consolidated financial statement to which it applies.
(2) When the self-insurer or financial guarantor's demonstrated net worth is not at least ten times the cumulative total applicable amounts, their chief financial officer, treasurer, or equivalent official must submit to the Director with the Application and semi-annually thereafter, within the deadline specified in paragraph (e)(4) of this section, an affidavit stating that neither their working capital nor net worth fell during the first 6 months of the self-insurer or financial guarantor's current fiscal year, below the cumulative total applicable amounts.
(3) All self-insurers and financial guarantors must—
(i) Submit, upon the Director's request, additional financial information within the time specified; and
(ii) Notify the Director in writing within 5 days following the date the self-insurer or financial guarantor knows, or has reason to know, that its working capital or net worth has fallen below the total applicable amounts.
(4) All required annual financial statements and declarations must be submitted to the Director within 90 days after the close of the self-insurer or financial guarantor's fiscal year. All required semi-annual financial statements and declarations must be submitted to the Director within 30 days after the close of the applicable 6-month period. The Director will grant an extension of the time limits for submissions under this paragraph only as provided in § 138.60(e).
(5) A failure by a self-insurer or financial guarantor to timely submit to the Director any statement, data, notification, or other submission required may result in the Director denying or revoking the COFR, and may prompt enforcement action as provided under § 138.170.
(6) The Director may waive the working capital requirement for any self-insurer or financial guarantor that—
(i) Is a regulated public utility, a municipal or higher-level governmental entity, or an entity operating solely as a charitable, non-profit organization qualifying under the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)), provided that the self-insurer or financial guarantor demonstrates in writing that the waiver would benefit a local public interest; or
(ii) Demonstrates in writing that working capital is not a significant factor in the self-insurer or financial guarantor's financial condition, in which case the self-insurer or financial guarantor's net worth in relation to the required cumulative total applicable amounts, and a history of stable operations, are the major elements considered by the Director.
(f)
Other guaranty methods for establishing evidence of financial responsibility.
(1) The COFR Operator may request that the Director accept a guaranty method for establishing evidence of financial responsibility that is different from one of the methods described in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section as follows:
(i) The COFR Operator must submit the request to the Director in writing, at least 90 days prior to the date the COFR is required.
(ii) The request must describe in detail: The method proposed; the reasons why the COFR Operator does not wish to (or is unable to) use one of the methods described in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section; and how the proposed guaranty method assures that the vessel's responsible parties have the financial ability to meet their potential liabilities under OPA 90 and CERCLA in the event of an incident or a release.
(iii) Each COFR Operator making a request under this paragraph must provide the Director a proposed guaranty form that includes all the elements described in paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section.
(2) The Director will not accept a self-insurance method other than the one described in paragraph (d) of this section. The Director also will not accept a guaranty method under this paragraph that merely deletes or alters a requirement or provision of one of the guaranty methods described in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section (for example, one that alters the termination clause of the Insurance Guaranty).
(3) A Director's decision to accept an alternative guaranty method of establishing evidence of financial responsibility under this paragraph is final agency action.
(g)
Additional rules regarding multiple guarantors.
If more than one guarantor executes the relevant guaranty form, the following rules apply:
(1) If a guarantor's percentage of vertical participation is specified on the relevant guaranty form, the guarantor is subject to direct action and is liable for the payment of costs and damages under OPA 90 or CERCLA, as applicable, only in accordance with the percentage of vertical participation so specified for that guarantor.
(2) Participation in the form of layering (tiers, one in excess of another) is not permitted. Only vertical participation on a percentage basis and participation with no specified percentage allocation is acceptable.
(3) If no percentage of vertical participation is specified for a guarantor on the relevant guaranty form, the guarantor's liability is joint and several for the total of the unspecified portion.
(4) The participating guarantors must designate a lead guarantor having authority to bind all of the participating guarantors for actions required of guarantors under OPA 90 or CERCLA and this subpart, including but not limited to reporting changes in the evidence of financial responsibility as provided in § 138.150(d), receipt of source designations, advertisement of source designations and the responsible party's claims procedures, and receipt and settlement of claims.
(h)
Direct action.
(1) Each guarantor providing evidence of financial responsibility must submit to the Director a written acknowledgment by the guarantor that a claimant (including a claimant by right of subrogation) may assert any claim for costs or damages arising under OPA 90, CERCLA, or both, directly against the guarantor, regardless of whether the claim is asserted in an action in court or other proceeding. The guarantor must also acknowledge that, in the event a claim is asserted directly against the guarantor under OPA 90, CERCLA, or both, the guarantor may invoke only the following rights and defenses—
(i) The incident, release, or both, were caused by the willful misconduct of a responsible party for whom the guaranty was provided;
(ii) All rights and defenses, which would be available to the responsible party under OPA 90, CERCLA, or both, as applicable;
(iii) A defense that the amount of the claim, or all claims asserted with respect to the same incident or release, whether asserted in court or in any other proceeding, exceeds the amount of the guaranty, except when the guaranty is based on the gross tonnage of the vessel (instead of the statutory minimums) and the guarantor knew or should have known that the applicable tonnage certificate was incorrect (see § 138.50(f)); and
(iv) The claim is not one made under OPA 90, CERCLA, or both.
(2) Except when the guaranty is based on the gross tonnage of the vessel (instead of the statutory minimums) and the guarantor knew or should have known that the evidence of financial responsibility or applicable tonnage certificate is incorrect (see § 138.50(f)), a guarantor who provides evidence of financial responsibility under this subpart will be liable, with respect to any one incident or release, or both, as applicable, only for the amount of costs and damages specified in the evidence of financial responsibility.
(3) A guarantor will not be considered to have consented to direct action under any law other than OPA 90 or CERCLA, or to unlimited liability under any law or in any venue, solely because the guarantor has provided evidence of financial responsibility under this subpart.
(4) In the event of any finding that the liability of a guarantor under OPA 90 or CERCLA exceeds the amount of the guaranty provided under this subpart, that guaranty is considered null and void with respect to that excess.
(i)
Process upon disapproval of guarantor.
If the Director intends to disapprove or revoke the approval of a guarantor (for example, due to the guarantor's change in financial position), the Director will notify the
COFR Operator of the need to establish new evidence of financial responsibility within a specified period.
(1) If the COFR Operator establishes, or causes to be established, new acceptable evidence of financial responsibility within the period specified by the Director in the notice, the Application if otherwise complete will be approved or the COFR will remain in effect, and the COFR Operator will not have to pay a new Application fee or certification fee.
(2) If the COFR Operator fails to establish, or cause to be established, new acceptable evidence of financial responsibility within the period specified by the Director in the notice, the Director may deny or revoke the COFR and, if revoked, the COFR Operator will have to apply for a new COFR and pay a new certification fee. The COFR Operator's failure to establish, or cause to be established, new acceptable evidence of financial responsibility within the period specified by the Director may also result in enforcement as provided under § 138.170.
§ 138.120
Fees.

Cash payments will not be accepted.
(i) For Applications and requests for COFR renewal submitted under § 138.60(c)(1)(ii) and (iii) (email and fax submissions, respectively), all fee payments must be received by the Director no later than 21 days following submission of the Application or request for COFR renewal.
(ii) For Applications and requests for COFR renewal submitted under § 138.60(c)(1)(iv) (mail submissions), all fee payments must be enclosed with the Application or request for COFR renewal.
(4) Any failure to timely pay the fees required by this section may result in COFR denial or revocation, debt collection (see 6 CFR part 11, 44 CFR part 11, and 31 CFR parts 285, and 900 through 904), and such other enforcement under § 138.170 as may be appropriate.
(b)
Application fee.
(1) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the COFR Operator must pay a non-refundable Application fee of $200 for each Application submitted under this subpart (for each Application for one or more Individual Certificates, for a Fleet Certificate, or for a Master Certificate).
(2) An Application fee is not required when the COFR Operator submits—
(i) A request for an additional Individual Certificate under an existing Application;
(ii) A request to amend an Application;
(iii) A request for Certificate renewal; or
(iv) A request to reinstate a Certificate, if submitted within 90 days following the Certificate's revocation.

(2) $100 for each Application for a Fleet Certificate or Master Certificate; and
(3) $100 for each request for renewal of an Individual Certificate, a Fleet Certificate or a Master Certificate.
(d)
Fee refunds.
(1) A certification fee will be refunded, upon receipt by the Director of a written request, if the Application or request for COFR renewal is denied by the Director, or if the Application is withdrawn by the COFR Operator before the Director issues the COFR.
(2) Overpayments of Application and certification fees will be refunded to the COFR Operator.
§ 138.130
Agents for Service of process.
(a)
Designation of U.S. agents for service of process.
Each COFR Operator and guarantor must designate on the forms submitted a person located in the United States as its U.S. agent for service of process and (in the event of an incident, a release, or both) for receipt of notices of source designation, claims presented under OPA 90, CERCLA, or both, and lawsuits brought under OPA 90, CERCLA, or both.
(b)
U.S. agent for service of process acknowledgment.
Each U.S. agent for service of process designated under paragraph (a) must acknowledge the agency designation in writing unless the agent has already submitted a written master (that is, blanket) agency acknowledgment to the Director showing that the agent has agreed in advance to act as the U.S. agent for service of process for the COFR Operator or guarantor in question.
(c)
How to change the U.S. agent for service of process.
A COFR Operator or guarantor may change a designated U.S. agent for service of process, at any time and for any reason, by submitting a new U.S. agent for service of process designation in accordance with the procedure in paragraph (a), and by causing the new U.S. agent for service of process to submit the agency acknowledgment required by paragraph (b) of this section.
(d)
Replacement of unavailable U.S. agent for service of process.
In the event a designated U.S. agent for service of process becomes unavailable at any time, for any reason, the COFR Operator or guarantor must designate a new U.S. agent for service of process in accordance with the procedures in paragraph (a), within 5 days of the COFR Operator or guarantor becoming aware of such unavailability. In addition, the new U.S. agent for service of process must submit to the Director the agency acknowledgment required by paragraph (b) of this section.
(e)
Service on the Director.
If a designated U.S. agent for service of process cannot be served, then service of process on the Director, as provided in this paragraph, will constitute valid service of process on the COFR Operator or guarantor. Service of process on the Director will not be effective unless the server—
(1) Has sent a copy of each document served on the Director to the COFR Operator or guarantor, as applicable, by registered mail, at the COFR Operator or guarantor's last known address on file with the Director;
(2) Indicates, at the time process is served upon the Director, that the purpose of the mailing is to effect service of process on the COFR Operator or guarantor; and
(3) Provides evidence acceptable to the Director at the time process is served upon the Director, that service was attempted on the designated U.S. agent for service of process but failed, stating the reasons why service on the U.S. agent for service of process was not possible, and that the document was sent to the COFR Operator or guarantor, as required by paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
§ 138.140
Application withdrawals, COFR denials and revocations.
(a)
Application withdrawal.
A COFR Operator, or anyone authorized to act on their behalf, may withdraw an Application at any time prior to issuance of the COFR.
(b)
Application denials and COFR revocations.
The Director may deny an Application or revoke a COFR, and the United States may initiate enforcement under § 138.170, for any failure to comply with the requirements of this subpart, including—
(1) If the COFR Operator, or other person acting on the COFR Operator's behalf, makes a false statement in, or in connection with, any submission required by this subpart;
(2) If the COFR Operator, or other person acting on the COFR Operator's behalf, fails to establish or maintain acceptable evidence of financial responsibility, as required by this subpart;
(3) If the COFR Operator fails to pay the Application and certification fees required by § 138.120;
(4) If the COFR Operator or guarantor fails to designate and maintain a U.S. agent for service of process as required by § 138.130;
(5) If the COFR Operator, or other person acting on the COFR Operator's
behalf, fails to comply with, or respond to, lawful inquiries, regulations, or orders of the U.S. Coast Guard pertaining to the activities subject to this subpart;
(6) If the COFR Operator, or other person acting on the COFR Operator's behalf, fails to timely report information required to be reported to the Director under this subpart, including failing to timely submit to the Director statements, data, financial information, notifications, affidavits, or other submissions required by this subpart; or
(7) If the Director obtains information indicating that the Application should be denied or that a new COFR is required (for example, a permanent vessel transfer, new COFR Operator, vessel renaming, guaranty termination, disapproval of a guarantor).
(c)
Procedure for reinstating COFRs following termination of guaranties.
If a COFR is revoked by the Director under paragraph (b)(2) of this section based on the expiration of 30 days following the date the Director receives a guarantor's notice of termination as provided under §§ 138.110(a)(3) and 138.150(d), the Director may reinstate the COFR if the guarantor promptly notifies the Director following the revocation that the guarantor rescinded the termination and that there was no gap in guarantor coverage.
(d)
Notice to COFR Operator of intent to deny an Application or revoke a COFR.
If the Director obtains information indicating that an Application should be denied or that a COFR should be revoked for reasons that the COFR Operator may not be aware of, the Director will notify the COFR Operator, in writing, stating the reason for the intended action.
(1) A notice from the Director that an Application is incomplete will be considered a denial unless the Application is completed by the COFR Operator within the period specified in the notice. A COFR subject to revocation remains valid until the COFR is revoked as provided in § 138.140(d)(2) and (3).
(2) If the Director issues a notice of intent to deny an Application or revoke a COFR due to a violation under paragraph (b) of this section, the COFR Operator may demonstrate compliance to the Director in writing by no later than the date specified by the Director in the notice. If the COFR Operator demonstrates compliance by that date, the Application will remain under consideration, and any current COFR will remain in effect, unless and until the Director issues a written decision denying the Application or revoking the COFR, as applicable. Otherwise, the Application denial or COFR revocation is effective as of the date specified by the notice.
(3) The denial of an Application or revocation of a COFR does not terminate the guaranty.
(e)
Request for reconsideration.
(1) A COFR Operator may ask the Director to reconsider a denial of the COFR Operator's Application or the revocation of a COFR as follows:
(i) The COFR Operator must submit the request for reconsideration, in writing, to the Director no later than 21 days after the date of the denial or revocation.
(ii) The submission must state the COFR Operator's reasons for requesting reconsideration and include all supporting documentation.
(2) A decision by the Director on reconsideration of an Application denial or a COFR revocation is final agency action. If the Director does not issue a written decision on the request for reconsideration within 30 days after its submission, the request for reconsideration will be deemed to have been denied, and the Application denial or COFR revocation will be deemed to have been affirmed as a matter of final agency action. Unless the Director issues a decision reversing the revocation, the COFR revocation remains in effect.
(f)
Duty to remedy violations.
If the COFR for a vessel expires or is revoked while the vessel is located in the navigable waters, at any port or other place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, or in the Exclusive Economic Zone, the COFR Operator and the vessel's other responsible parties will be deemed in violation of this subpart. In such event, the COFR Operator or, if unavailable or no longer operating the vessel, the vessel's current
responsible parties, must notify the Director within 24 hours, by email or other electronic means. The notice must include the information required by § 138.150(b) and must establish new evidence of financial responsibility, designate a new COFR Operator if applicable, and cure any other violation of this subpart.
§ 138.150
Reporting requirements.
(a)
Report changes of submitted information.
When there is a change in any of the facts contained in an Application, a request for COFR renewal, evidence of financial responsibility, or other submission made under this subpart, the change must be reported, in writing, to the Director. The reports required by this section may be submitted with, but are in addition to, other submissions required by this subpart (for example, Applications, requests for COFR renewal, semi-annual and annual financial reports, Master Certificate reports).
(b)
A 21-day prior reporting requirement of permanent vessel transfers and other changes requiring issuance of a new COFR.
Current COFR Operators of vessels, and owners or operators of vessels not currently in U.S. navigable waters or the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone, must report to the Director, and (if applicable) to the guarantor, the following information, no later than 21 business days before the new COFR is required:
(1) The number of the current COFR;

# Subpart B—OPA 90 Limits of Liability (Vessels, Deepwater Ports and Onshore Facilities)

# Source:
80 FR 72355, Nov. 19, 2015, unless otherwise noted.
§ 138.200
Scope.
This subpart sets forth the limits of liability under Title I of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, as amended (33 U.S.C. 2701,
et seq.
) (OPA 90), for vessels, deepwater ports, and onshore facilities, as adjusted under OPA 90 (33 U.S.C. 2704(d)). This subpart also sets forth the method and procedure the Coast Guard uses to periodically adjust the OPA 90 limits of liability by regulation under OPA 90 (33 U.S.C. 2704(d)(4)), to reflect significant increases in the Consumer Price Index (CPI), and to update
the limits of liability when they are amended by statute. In addition, this subpart cross-references the U.S. Department of the Interior regulation setting forth the OPA 90 limit of liability applicable to offshore facilities, as adjusted under OPA 90 (33 U.S.C. 2704(d)(4)) to reflect significant increases in the CPI.
§ 138.210
Applicability.
This subpart applies to you if you are a responsible party for a vessel, a deepwater port, or an onshore facility (including, but not limited to, motor vehicles, rolling stock and onshore pipelines), unless your liability is unlimited under OPA 90 (33 U.S.C. 2704(c)).

[80 FR 72355, Nov. 19, 2015, as amended at 84 FR 39974, Aug. 13, 2019; 87 FR 78864, Dec. 23, 2022]
§ 138.240
Procedure for updating limits of liability to reflect significant increases in the Consumer Price Index (Annual CPI-U) and statutory changes.
(a)
Update and publication.
The Director, NPFC, will periodically adjust the limits of liability set forth in § 138.230(a) through (c) to reflect significant increases in the Annual CPI-U, according to the procedure for calculating limit of liability inflation adjustments set forth in paragraphs (b)-(d) of this section, and will publish the inflation-adjusted limits of liability and any statutory amendments to those limits of liability in the
Federal Register
as amendments to § 138.230. Updates to the limits of liability under this paragraph are effective on the 90th day after publication in the
Federal Register
of the amendments to § 138.230, unless otherwise specified by statute (in the event of a statutory amendment to the limits of liability) or in the
Federal Register
notice amending § 138.230.
(b)
Formula for calculating a cumulative percent change in the Annual CPI-U.
(1) The Director, NPFC, calculates the cumulative percent change in the Annual CPI-U from the year the limit of liability was established, or last adjusted by statute or regulation, whichever is later (
i.e.,
the previous period), to the most recently published Annual CPI-U (
i.e.,
the current period), using the following escalation formula:
Percent change in the Annual CPI-U = [(Annual CPI-U for Current Period−Annual CPI-U for Previous Period) ÷ Annual CPI-U for Previous Period] × 100.
(2) The cumulative percent change value calculated using the formula in paragraph (b)(1) of this section is rounded to one decimal place.
(c)
Significance threshold.
Not later than every three years from the year the limits of liability were last adjusted for inflation, the Director, NPFC, will evaluate whether the cumulative percent change in the Annual CPI-U since that date has reached a significance threshold of 3 percent or greater. For any three-year period in which the cumulative percent change in the Annual CPI-U is less than 3 percent, the Director, NPFC, will publish a notice of no inflation adjustment to the limits of liability in the
Federal Register.
If this occurs, the Director, NPFC, will recalculate the cumulative percent change in the Annual CPI-U since the year in which the limits of liability were last adjusted for inflation each year thereafter until the cumulative percent change equals or exceeds the threshold amount of 3 percent. Once the 3-percent threshold is reached, the Director, NPFC, will increase the limits of liability, by regulation using the procedure set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, for all source categories (including any new limit of liability established by statute or regulation since the last time the limits of liability were adjusted for inflation) by an amount equal to the cumulative percent change in the Annual CPI-U from the year each limit was established, or last adjusted by statute or regulation, whichever is later. Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent the Director, NPFC, in the Director's sole discretion, from adjusting the limits of liability for inflation by regulation issued more frequently than every three years.
(d)
Formula for calculating inflation adjustments.
The Director, NPFC, calculates adjustments to the limits of liability in § 138.230 for inflation using the following formula:
New limit of liability = Previous limit of liability + (Previous limit of liability × percent change in the Annual CPI-U calculated under paragraph (b) of this section), then rounded to the closest $100.

Lifesaving and fire fighting equipment subsequently determined to be unrepairable must be similarly mutilated in the presence of the person making that determination.
(b) Any deficiency or hazard discovered during an inspection by a Coast Guard marine inspector or a BSEE inspector is reported to the unit's owner or operator, who shall have the deficiency or hazard corrected or eliminated as soon as practicable and within the period of time specified by the inspector.
(c) Deficiencies and hazards discovered during an inspection of a fixed OCS facility under § 140.103(a) must be corrected or eliminated, if practicable, before the form CG-5432 is completed. Deficiencies and hazards that are not corrected or eliminated by the time the form is completed must be indicated on the form as “outstanding” and the form submitted to the appropriate BSEE District office. Upon receipt of a form CG-5432 indicating outstanding deficiencies or hazards, BSEE informs, by letter, the owner or operator of the fixed OCS facility of the deficiencies or hazards and the time period specified to correct or eliminate the deficiencies or hazards.
(d) For lifesaving and fire fighting equipment deficiencies on fixed OCS facilities that cannot be corrected before the submission of form CG-5432, the owner or operator must contact the appropriate BSEE District Supervisor to request a time period for repair of the item.

§ 147.1
Purpose of safety zones.
Safety zones may be established around OCS facilities being constructed, maintained, or operated on the Outer Continental Shelf to promote the safety of life and property on the facilities, their appurtenances and attending vessels, and on the adjacent waters within the safety zones. Regulations adopted for safety zones may extend to the prevention or control of specific activities and access by vessels or persons, and include measures to protect the living resources of the sea from harmful agents. The regulations do not encompass the operating equipment or procedures used in the drilling for and production of oil, gas, or other minerals, or the transportation of oil, gas, or other minerals by pipeline except as they relate to the safety of life and property on OCS facilities and on the waters adjacent to OCS facilities or to the protection of the living resources of the sea within a safety zone from harmful agents.

# Effective Date Note:
By USCG-2023-0985, 89 FR 20854, Mar. 26, 2024, § 147.T01-0985 was added, effective May 1, 2024, through May 1, 2027.
§ 147.5
Delegation of authority.
The authority to establish safety zones and to issue and enforce safety zone regulations in accordance with the provisions of this part is delegated to District Commanders.
§ 147.10
Establishment of safety zones.
(a) Whenever it comes to the attention of the District Commander that a safety zone and regulations may be required concerning any OCS facility being constructed, maintained, or operated on the Outer Continental Shelf or its appurtenances and attending vessels, or the adjacent waters, the District Commander may initiate appropriate inquiry to determine whether a safety zone and regulations should be established. In making this determination, the District Commander considers all relevant safety factors, including existing or reasonably foreseeable congestion of vessels, the presence of unusually harmful or hazardous substances, and any obstructions within 500 meters of the OCS facility. If the District Commander determines that
the circumstances warrant the establishment of a safety zone and regulations the District Commander takes action as necessary consistent with the provisions of this part.
(b) For purposes of establishing safety zones under this part, OCS facility includes non-mineral energy resource permanent or temporary structures.
(c) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, a safety zone and necessary regulations may be established concerning any OCS facility being constructed, maintained or operated on the Outer Continental Shelf, following publication of a notice of proposed rule making in the
Federal Register
and after interested parties have been given the opportunity to submit comments. A zone and necessary regulations may be in effect during any period when construction equipment and materials are within 500 meters of the construction site until the removal of all portions of the facility.
(d) A safety zone and necessary regulations may be established without public rule making procedures when the District Commander determined that imminent danger exists with respect to the safety of life and property on an OCS facility constructed, maintained, or operated on the Outer Continental Shelf, its appurtenances and attending vessels or adjacent waters. A safety zone and regulations may be made effective on the date the rule is published in the
Federal Register.
However, if circumstances require, they may be placed into effect immediately, followed promptly by publication in the
Federal Register.
The District Commander may utilize, in addition to broadcast Notices to Mariners, Local Notices to Mariners, and Notices to Mariners, newspapers, and broadcasting stations to disseminate information concerning a safety zone and regulations pertaining thereto. The public may comment concerning the establishment of a safety zone or regulations under this paragraph. A safety zone or regulations may be modified or withdrawn, as appropriate, based on the comments received.
(e) Geographic coordinates expressed in terms of latitude or longitude, or both, are not intended for plotting on maps or charts whose referenced horizontal datum is the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD 83), unless such geographic coordinates are expressly labeled NAD 83. Geographic coordinates without the NAD 83 reference may be plotted on maps or charts reference to NAD 83 only after application of the appropriate corrections that are published on the particular map or chart being used.

§ 147.15
Extent of safety zones.
A safety zone establishment under this part may extend to a maximum distance of 500 meters around the OCS facility measured from each point on its outer edge or from its construction site, but may not interfere with the use of recognized sea lanes essential to navigation.
§ 147.20
Definitions.
Unless otherwise stated, the term “attending vessel” refers to any vessel which is operated by the owner or operator of an OCS facility located in the safety zone, which is used for the purpose of carrying supplies, equipment or personnel to or from the facility, which is engaged in construction, maintenance, alteration, or repair of the facility, or which is used for further exploration, production, transfer or storage of natural resources from the seabed beneath the safety zone.

# Subpart J—Safety Zones, No Anchoring Areas, and Areas To Be Avoided
§ 150.900
What does this subpart do?
(a) This subpart provides requirements for the establishment, restrictions, and location of safety zones, no anchoring areas (NAAs), and areas to be avoided (ATBAs) around deepwater ports.
(b) Subpart D of this part, concerning vessel navigation and activities permitted and prohibited at deepwater ports, applies to safety zones, NAAs, ATBAs, and their adjacent waters; and supplements the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea.
(c) Recommended shipping safety fairways associated with deepwater ports are described in part 166 of this chapter.
§ 150.905
Why are safety zones, no anchoring areas, and areas to be avoided established?
(a) Safety zones, no anchoring areas (NAAs) and areas to be avoided (ATBAs) under this subchapter are established to promote safety of life and property, marine environmental protection, and navigational safety at deepwater ports and adjacent waters.
(b) Safety zones are the only federally regulated navigation areas. They accomplish these objectives by preventing or controlling specific activities, limiting access by vessels or persons, and by protecting the living resources of the sea from harmful agents.
(c) The NAAs and ATBAs are established via the International Maritime Organization (IMO). An NAA, specifically established to protect vessels in transit and sub-surface deepwater port components, will be mandatory. An ATBA will be a recommendatory routing measure.
(d) The sizes of restricted areas will be the minimum size needed to ensure safety, while at the same time considering potential impacts on other activities, including recreational boating, fishing, and Outer Continental Shelf activity.
[USCG-1998-3884, 71 FR 57651, Sept. 29, 2006, as amended by USCG-2013-0397, 78 FR 39183, July 1, 2013]
§ 150.910
What installations, structures, or activities are prohibited in a safety zone?
No installations, structures, or activities that are incompatible with or that present an unacceptable risk to safety of the deepwater port's operations or activity are allowed in the safety zone of a deepwater port.
§ 150.915
How are safety zones, no anchoring areas, and areas to be avoided established and modified?
(a) Safety zones are developed and designated during the application process for a deepwater port license, and may be established or modified through rulemaking. Rulemakings will afford prior public notice and comment, except when there is good cause not to do so, for example due to an imminent threat to the safety of life and property.
(b) Before a safety zone, no anchoring area (NAA), or area to be avoided (ATBA) is established, all factors detrimental to safety are considered, including but not limited to:
(1) The scope and degree of the risk or hazard involved;
(2) Vessel traffic characteristics and trends, including traffic volume, the sizes and types of vessels involved, potential interference with the flow of commercial traffic, the presence of any unusual cargoes, and other similar factors;
(3) Port and waterway configurations and variations in local conditions of geography, climate and other similar factors;
(4) The need for granting exemptions for the installation and use of equipment or devices for use with vessel traffic services for certain classes of small vessels, such as self-propelled fishing vessels and recreational vessels;
(5) The proximity of fishing grounds, oil and gas drilling and production operations, or other potential or actual conflicting activity;
(6) Environmental factors;
(7) Economic impact and effects;
(8) Existing vessel traffic services; and
(9) Local practices and customs, including voluntary arrangements and agreements within the maritime community.
(c) The Executive Branch, acting through the Secretary of State and Commandant (CG-5P) proposes NAAs and ATBAs for deepwater ports to the International Maritime Organization (IMO) for approval. The ATBAs will be implemented after IMO approval is granted and announced in an IMO Circular, and after publication of a notice in the
Federal Register.
[USCG-1998-3884, 71 FR 57651, Sept. 29, 2006, as amended by USCG-2013-0397, 78 FR 39183, July 1, 2013]
§ 150.920
How can I find notice of new or proposed safety zones?
In addition to documents published in the
Federal Register
under § 150.915 of this part, the District Commander may provide public notice of new or proposed safety zones by Broadcast Notices to Mariners, Notices to Mariners, Local Notices to Mariners, newspapers, broadcast stations, or other means.
[USCG-1998-3884, 71 FR 57651, Sept. 29, 2006, as amended by USCG-2013-0397, 78 FR 39183, July 1, 2013]
§ 150.925
How long may a safety zone, no anchoring area, or area to be avoided remain in place?
A safety zone, no anchoring area, or area to be avoided may go into effect as early as initial delivery of construction equipment and materials to the deepwater port site, and may remain in place until the deepwater port is removed.
§ 150.930
What datum is used for the geographic coordinates in this subpart?
The geographic coordinates used in this subpart have been revised to enable plotting using the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD 83) and no longer
require the use of any further conversion factors for correction.

§ 151.26
Shipboard oil pollution emergency plans.
(a)
Language of the plan.
The shipboard oil pollution emergency plan must be available on board in English and in the working language of the master and the officers of the ship, if other than English.
(b)
Plan format.
The plan must contain the following six sections. A seventh non-mandatory section may be included at the shipowner's discretion:
(1)
Introduction.
This section must contain the following:
(i)
Introductory text.
The introductory text of the plan must contain the following language (For ships operating in Antarctica, the introductory text of the plan must contain the following language
and
explain that they are in accordance with the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty):
This plan is written in accordance with the requirements of Regulation 37 of Annex I of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973, as modified by the Protocol of 1978 relating thereto (MARPOL 73/78).
The purpose of the plan is to provide guidance to the master and officers on board the ship with respect to the steps to be taken when a pollution incident has occurred or is likely to occur.
The plan contains all information and operational instructions required by the guidelines (Resolution MEPC.54(32) as amended by Resolution MEPC.86(44)). The appendices contain names, telephone numbers, telex numbers, etc. of all contacts referenced in the plan, as well as other reference material.
This plan has been approved by the Coast Guard and, except as provided below, no alteration or revision may be made to any part
of it without the prior approval of the Coast Guard.
Changes to the seventh section of the plan and the appendices do not require approval by the Coast Guard. The appendices must be maintained up-to-date by the owners, operators, and managers.
(ii) General information.
(A) The ship's name, call sign, official number, International Maritime Organization (IMO) international number, and principal characteristics.
(B) [Reserved]
(2)
Preamble.
The plan must be realistic, practical, and easy to use, and the Preamble section of the plan must reflect these three features of the plan. The use of flowcharts, checklists, and appendices within the plan will aid in addressing this requirement. This section must contain an explanation of the purpose and use of the plan and indicate how the shipboard plan relates to other shore-based plans. Additionally, the Preamble section of the plan must clearly recognize coastal States' rights to approve oil pollution response in their waters by stating the following:
Without interfering with shipowner's liability, some coastal States consider that it is their responsibility to define techniques and means to be taken against an oil pollution incident and approve such operations that might cause further pollution,
i.e.
, lightening. States are entitled to do so under the International Convention relating to Intervention on the High Seas in Cases of Oil Pollution Casualties, 1969 (Intervention Convention).
(3)
Reporting Requirements.
This section of the plan must include information relating to the following:
(i)
When to report.
A report shall be made whenever an incident involves—
(A) A discharge of oil above the permitted level for any reason, including those for the purpose of securing the safety of the ship or saving life at sea;
(B) A discharge of oil or oily mixture during the operation of the ship in excess of the quantities or instantaneous rate permitted in § 151.10 of this subpart or in § 157.37 of this subchapter; or
(C) A probable discharge. Factors to be considered in determining whether a discharge is probable include, but are not limited to: ship location and proximity to land or other navigational hazards, weather, tide, current, sea state, and traffic density. The master must make a report in cases of collision, grounding, fire, explosion, structural failure, flooding or cargo shifting, or an incident resulting in failure or breakdown of steering gear, propulsion, electrical generating system, or essential shipborne navigational aids.
(ii)
Information required.
This section of the plan must include a notification form, such as the one depicted in Table 151.26(b)(3)(ii), that includes all the data elements required in Resolution A.851(20) and contains information to be provided in the initial and follow-up notifications. The official number of the vessel and current conditions of the vessel are to be included. In addition, the initial notification should include as much of the information on the form as possible, and supplemental information, as appropriate. However, the initial notification must not be delayed pending collection of all information. Copies of the form must be placed at the location(s) on the ship from which notification may be made.
ER07OC94.020
ER07OC94.021
(iii)
Whom to contact.
(A) This section of the plan must make reference to the appendices listing coastal state contacts, port contacts, and ship interest contacts. In order to expedite response and minimize damage from a pollution incident, it is essential that appropriate coastal States should be notified without delay. This process begins with the initial report required by article 8 and Protocol I of MARPOL 73/78.
(B) For actual or probable discharges of oil, or oily mixtures the reports must comply with the procedures described in MARPOL Protocol I. The reports shall be directed to either the nearest Captain of the Port (COTP) or to the National Response Center (NRC),
toll free telephone number:
800-424-8802,
direct telephone:
202-267-2675, or
Fax:
202-267-1322.
(C) For Antarctica, in addition to compliance with paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B) of this section, reports shall also be directed to any Antarctic station that may be affected.
(D) The plan must clearly specify who will be responsible for informing the necessary parties from the coastal State contacts, the port contacts, and the ship interest contacts.
(4)
Steps to control a discharge.
This section of the plan must contain a discussion of procedures to address the following scenarios:
(i) Operational spills: The plan must outline procedures for safe removal of oil spilled and contained on deck. The plan must also provide guidance to ensure proper disposal of recovered oil and cleanup materials;
(ii) Spills resulting from casualties: Casualties should be treated in the plan as a separate section. The plan should include various checklists or other means that will ensure the master considers all appropriate factors when addressing the specific casualty
(Reference is made here to the International Safety Management (ISM) Code, Section 8). These checklists must be tailored to the specific ship and to the specific product or product types. In addition to the checklists, specific personnel assignments for anticipated tasks must be identified. Reference to existing fire control plans and muster lists is sufficient to identify personnel responsibilities. The following are examples of casualties that must be considered—
(A) Grounding;
(B) Fire or explosion;
(C) Collision/Allision;
(D) Hull failure;
(E) Excessive list;
(F) Containment system failure;
(G) Submerged/Foundered;

(iii) In addition to the checklist and personnel duty assignments required by paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section, the plan must include—
(A) Priority actions to ensure the safety of personnel and the ship, assess the damage to the ship, and take appropriate further action;
(B) Stability and strength considerations: The plan should provide the master with detailed guidance to ensure that great care in casualty response must be taken to consider stability and strength when taking actions to mitigate the spillage of oil or to free the vessel if aground. Information for making damage stability and longitudinal strength assessments, or contacting classification societies to acquire such information, should be included. Where appropriate, the plan should provide a list of information for making damage stability and damage longitudinal strength assessments. The damage stability information for oil tankers and offshore oil barges in 33 CFR 155.240 is required to be provided in the SOPEP;
(C) Lightening procedures to be followed in cases of extensive structural damage: The plan must contain information on procedures to be followed for ship-to-ship transfer of cargo. Reference may be made in the plan to existing company guides. A copy of such company procedures for ship-to-ship transfer operations must be kept in the plan. The plan must address the coordination of this activity with the coastal or port state, as appropriate;
(D) Mitigating activities: The spill mitigation requirements of 33 CFR 155.1035(c) must be met for tankships, the requirements of 33 CFR 155.1040(c) must be met for unmanned vessels, and the requirements of 33 CFR 155.5035(c) must be met for nontank vessels. Additionally, the following personnel safety mitigation strategies must be addressed for all personnel involved—
(1) Assessment and monitoring activities;
(2) Personnel protection issues;
(3) Protective equipment;
(4) Threats to health and safety;
(5) Containment and other response techniques;

This exchange must occur prior to entry into
the Snell Lock at Massena, NY, or navigating on the Hudson River, north of the George Washington Bridge. An alternative management system (AMS) that meets the requirements of 33 CFR 151.2026 may also be used, so long as it was installed on the vessel prior to the date that the vessel is required to comply with the ballast water discharge standard in accordance with § 151.1512(b) of this subpart. If using an AMS, the master, owner, operator, agent, or person in charge of the vessel subject to this subpart may employ the AMS for no longer than 5 years from the date they would otherwise be required to comply with the ballast water discharge standard in accordance with § 151.1512(b) of this subpart.
(2) Retain the vessel's ballast water on board the vessel. If this method of ballast water management is employed, the COTP may seal any tank or hold containing ballast water on board the vessel for the duration of the voyage within the waters of the Great Lakes or the Hudson River, north of the George Washington Bridge.
(3) Install and operate a BWMS that has been approved by the Coast Guard under 46 CFR part 162, in accordance with § 151.1512(b) of this subpart. Following installation of a BWMS, the master, owner, operator, agent, or person in charge of the vessel must maintain the BWMS in accordance with all manufacturer specifications.
(i) Requirements for approval of BWMS are found in 46 CFR part 162.060.
(ii) Requests for approval of BWMS must be submitted to the Commanding Officer (MSC), Attn: Marine Safety Center, U.S. Coast Guard Stop 7430, 2703 Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue SE., Washington, DC 20593-7430, or by email to
msc@uscg.mil.
(4) Use only water from a U.S. public water system (PWS), as defined in 40 CFR 141.2 and that meets the requirements of 40 CFR parts 141 and 143, as ballast water. Vessels using water from a PWS as ballast must maintain a record of which PWS they received the water and a receipt, invoice, or other documentation from the PWS indicating that water came from that system. Furthermore, they must certify that they have met the conditions in paragraphs (a)(4)(i) or (ii) of this section, as applicable. Vessels using water from a PWS must use such water exclusively for all ballast water unless the usage is in accordance with § 151.1515 of this subpart. Vessels using PWS water as ballast must have either—
(i) Previously cleaned the ballast tanks (including removing all residual sediments) and not subsequently introduced ambient water; or
(ii) Never introduced ambient water to those tanks and supply lines.
(b) No master of a vessel subject to this subpart shall separately discharge sediment from tanks or holds containing ballast water unless it is disposed of ashore in accordance with local requirements.
(c) Nothing in this subpart authorizes the discharge of oil or noxious liquid substances (NLSs) in a manner prohibited by United States or international laws or regulations. Ballast water carried in any tank containing a residue of oil, NLSs, or any other pollutant must be discharged in accordance with the applicable regulations. Nothing in this subpart affects or supersedes any requirement or prohibitions pertaining to the discharge of ballast water into the waters of the United States under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251
et seq.
).
(d) Unless otherwise expressly provided for in this subpart, the master, owner, operator, agent, or person in charge of vessels employing a Coast Guard-approved BWMS must meet the applicable ballast water discharge standard, found in § 151.1511 of this subpart, at all times of ballast water discharge into the waters of the United States.

§ 151.1513
Extension of compliance date.
The Coast Guard may grant an extension to the implementation schedule in § 151.1512(b) of this subpart only in those cases where the master, owner, operator, agent, or person in charge of a vessel subject to this subpart can document that, despite all efforts, compliance with the requirement under § 151.1510 is not possible. Any extension request must be made no later than 12 months before the scheduled implementation date listed in § 151.1512(b) of this subpart and submitted in writing by email to
environmental_standards@uscg.mil,
or to the Commandant (CG-OES), Attn: Office of Operating and Environmental Standards, U.S. Coast Guard Stop 7509, 2703 Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue SE., Washington, DC 20593-7509. Summary information concerning all extension decisions, including the name of the vessel and vessel owner, the term of the extension, and the basis for the extension will be promptly posted on the Internet. Extensions will be for no longer than the minimum time needed, as determined by the Coast Guard, for the vessel to comply with the requirements of § 151.1510.

§ 151.1515
Ballast water management alternatives under extraordinary conditions.
(a) As long as ballast water exchange (BWE) remains an option under the schedule in § 151.1512(b) of this subpart, the master of any vessel subject to this
subpart who uses BWE to meet the requirements of this subpart and, due to weather, equipment failure, or other extraordinary conditions, is unable to effect a BWE before entering the Exclusive Economic Zone, and intends to discharge ballast water into the waters of the United States, must request permission from the Captain of the Port (COTP) to exchange the vessel's ballast water within an area agreed to by the COTP at the time of the request and then discharge the vessel's ballast water within that designated area.
(b) Once BWE is no longer an option under the schedule in § 151.1512(b) of this subpart, if the ballast water management system required by this subpart stops operating properly during a voyage or the vessel's BWM method is unexpectedly unavailable, the master, owner, operator, agent, or person in charge of the vessel must ensure that the problem is reported to the COTP as soon as practicable. The vessel may continue to the next port of call, subject to the directions of the COTP or the Ninth District Commander, as provided by 33 CFR part 160.
