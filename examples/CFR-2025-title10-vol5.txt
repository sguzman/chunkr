# Explanation
The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
Title 1 through Title 16
as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27
as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41
as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50
as of October 1
The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.

# LEGAL STATUS
The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

# HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, January 1, 2025), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

# EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.

# OMB CONTROL NUMBERS
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request.
Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.

# PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.

# “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.

# INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
What is incorporation by reference?
Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
What is a proper incorporation by reference?
The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
(b) The matter incorporated is adequately summarized in the preamble of the final rule and is available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?
If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or email fr.inspection@nara.gov.

# CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES
A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR
Index and Finding Aids.
This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.
An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

# REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

§ 500.1
Purpose and scope.
Unless otherwise expressly provided or the context clearly indicates otherwise, this section defines the terms used in these regulations. The use of the male gender is to include female; the use of singular to include plural.
§ 500.2
General definitions.

et seq.
Action
means a prohibition by rule or order, in accordance with sections 301(b) and (c) of FUA; any order granting or denying an exemption in accordance with sections 211, 212, 311 and 312 of FUA; a modification or rescission of any such order, or rule; an interpretation; a notice of violation; a remedial order; an interpretive ruling; or a rulemaking undertaken by DOE.
Affiliate,
when used in relation to person, means another person who controls, is controlled by, or is under common control, with such person.
Aggrieved,
for purposes of administrative proceedings, describes and means a person (with an interest sought to be protected under FUA) who is adversely affected by an action proposed or undertaken by DOE.
Air pollution control agency
means any of the following:
(1) A single State agency designated as the official State air pollution control agency;
(2) An agency established by two or more States and having substantial powers or duties pertaining to the prevention and control of air pollution;
(3) A city, county, or other local government health authority or, in the case of any city, county, or other local unit of government in which there is an agency other than the health authority charged with responsibility for enforcing ordinances or laws relating to the prevention and control of air pollution, such other agency; or
(4) An agency or two or more municipalities located in the same State or in different States and having substantial powers or duties pertaining to the prevention and control of air pollution.
Alternate fuel
means electricity or any fuel, other than natural gas or petroleum. The term includes, but is not limited to :
(1) Coal;
(2) Solar energy;
(3) Petroleum coke; shale oil; uranium; biomass, tar sands, oil-impregnated diatomaceous earth; municipal, industrial, or agricultural wastes; wood; and renewable and geothermal energy sources (For purposes of this paragraph (3), the term
industrial
does not include refineries.);
(4) Liquid, solid or gaseous waste by-products of refinery or industrial operations which are commercially unmarketable, either by reason of quality or quantity. (For purposes of this paragraph (4), the term
waste by-product
is defined as an unavoidable by-product of the industrial or refinery operation.) A waste by-product of a refinery or industrial operation is commercially unmarketable if it meets the criteria listed in the definition of “commercial unmarketability,” set forth below;
(5) Any fuel derived from an alternate fuel; and
(6) Waste gases from industrial operations. (For purposes of this subsection, the term
industrial
does not include refineries.)
Applicable environmental requirements
includes:
(1) Any standard, limitation, or other requirement established by or pursuant to Federal or State law (including any final order of any Federal or State Court) applicable to emissions of environmental pollutants (including air and water pollutants) or disposal of solid waste residues resulting from the use of coal or other alternate fuels, natural gas, or petroleum as a primary energy source or from the operation of pollution control equipment in connection with such use, taking into account any variance of law granted or issued in accordance with Federal law or in accordance with State law to the extent consistent with Federal law; and
(2) Any other standard, limitation, or other requirement established by, or pursuant to, the Clean Air Act, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, the Solid Waste Disposal Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, or the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969.
Base load powerplant
means a powerplant, the electrical generation of which in kilowatt hours exceeds, for any 12-calendar-month period, such powerplant's design capacity multiplied by 3,500 hours.
Boiler
means a closed vessel in which water is heated electrically or by the combustion of a fuel to produce steam of one percent or more quality.
Btu
means British thermal unit.
Capability to use alternate fuel,
for the purposes of Title II prohibitions relating to construction of new powerplants, means the powerplant to be constructed:
(1) Has sufficient inherent design characteristics to permit the addition of equipment (including all necessary pollution devices) necessary to render such electric powerplant capable of using coal or another alternate fuel as its primary energy source; and
(2) Is not physically, structurally, or technologically precluded from using coal or another alternate fuel as its primary energy source.
Capability to use coal or another alternate fuel shall not be interpreted to require any such powerplant to be immediately able to use coal or another alternate fuel as its primary energy source on its initial day of operation. In addition, the owner or operator of a baseload powerplant need not have adequate on-site space for either a coal gasifier or any facilities for handling coal or related fuels.
Certification
means a document, signed by an official of the owner or operator, notarized, and submitted to OFE, which declares that a new powerplant will have the “capability to use alternate fuel” (as defined herein).
Certifying powerplant
means an existing powerplant whose owner or operator seeks to obtain a prohibition order against the use of natural gas or petroleum either totally or in a mixture with coal or an alternate fuel by filing a certification as to both the technical capability and financial feasibility of conversion to coal or another alternate fuel pursuant to section 301 of FUA, as amended.
Clean Air Act
means the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7401
et seq.
(1970), as amended by Public Law 93-319, 88 Stat. 246, and Public Law 95-91, 91 Stat. 685.
Coal
means anthracite, bituminous and sub-bituminous coal, lignite, and any fuel derivative thereof.
Cogeneration facility
means an electric powerplant that produces:
(1) Electric power; and
(2) Any other form of useful energy (such as steam, gas or heat) that is, or will be used, for industrial, commercial, or space heating purposes. In addition, for purposes of this definition, electricity generated by the cogeneration facility must constitute more than five (5) percent and less than ninety (90) percent of the useful energy output of the facility.

# Note:
Any cogeneration facility selling or exchanging less than fifty percent (50%) of the facility's generated electricity is considered an industrial cogenerator and is exempt from the fuel use prohibitions of FUA.
Combined cycle unit
means an electric power generating unit that consists of a combination of one or more combustion turbine units and one or more steam turbine units with a substantial portion of the required energy input of the steam turbine unit(s) provided by the exhaust gas from the combustion turbine unit(s).
Substantial amounts of supplemental firing for a steam turbine or waste heat
boiler to improve thermal efficiency will not affect a unit's classification as a combined cycle unit.
Combustion turbine
means a unit that is a rotary engine driven by a gas under pressure that is created by the combustion of any fuel.
Commercial unmarketability
as used in the definitions of “alternate fuel,” “natural gas” and “petroleum” shall be determined as follows:
(1) A waste by-product of industrial or refinery operations is commercially unmarketable by reason of:
(i) Quality, where the cost of processing (limited to upgrading the waste by-product to commercial quality), storing, and distributing the waste by-product would not be covered by reasonably expected revenues from its sale;
(ii) Quantity, where the cost of aggregating the waste by-product into commercial quantities through storing and distributing the waste by-product would not be covered by reasonably expected revenues from its sale.
(2) A fuel will not be classified as “natural gas” when it is commercially unmarketable by reason of:
(i) Quality, where the cost of producing, upgrading to commercial quality, storing, and distributing the fuel would not be covered by reasonably expected revenues from its sale; or
(ii) Quantity, where the quantities of the fuel are so small that the revenues to be reasonably expected from its sale would not cover the cost of its production, distribution or storage.
(3) Costs associated with upgrading, storing, distributing, and aggregating a by-product or other fuel (to determine if such fuel is natural gas) may properly include a reasonable rate of return on any capital investment required to overcome the problems posed by the quality or quantity of a fuel because the return on investment is a normal aspect of any investment decision. A firm may account for this reasonable rate of return by using its customary discount rate for an investment of similar risk.
(4) As part of any consideration of the rate of return on investment, the cost of replacing the Btu's lost if the by-product or other fuel were upgraded and sold instead of used as a fuel may be taken into consideration. The actual expense that would result from burning a replacement fuel in lieu of the by-product or other fuel in question may therefore be considered. The costs associated with using a replacement fuel are indirect costs that result from upgrading and selling the fuel, instead of burning it. These indirect costs as well as the direct costs associated with the upgrading, storing, distributing, and aggregating of by-products or other fuel may be considered in any assessment of commercial unmarketability.
Conference
means an informal meeting incident to any proceeding, between DOE and any interested person.
Construction
means substantial physical activity at the unit site and includes more than clearance of a site or installation of foundation pilings.
Costs
means total costs, both operating and capital, incurred over the estimated remaining useful life of an electric powerplant, discounted to the present, pursuant to rules established in parts 503 and 504 of these regulations.
DEOA
means the Department of Energy Organization Act (Pub. L. 95-91) (42 U.S.C. 7101
et seq.
) as implemented by Executive Order 12009 (42 FR 46267, September 15, 1977).
Design capability
defined in section 103(a)(7) of FUA, shall be determined as follows:
(1)
Boiler and associated generator turbines.
The design fuel heat input rate of a steam-electric generating unit (Btu/hr) shall be the product of the generator's nameplate rating, measured in kilowatts, and 3412 (Btu/kWh), divided by the overall boiler-turbine-generator unit design efficiency (decimal); or if the generator's nameplate does not have a rating measured in kilowatts, the product of the generator's kilovolt-amperes nameplate rating, and the power factor nameplate rating; and 3412 (Btu/kWh), divided by the boiler turbine-generator unit's design efficiency (decimal). (The number 3412 converts kilowatt-hours (absolute) into Btu's (mean).)
(2)
Combustion turbine and associated generator.
The design fuel heat input rate of a combustion turbine (Btu/hr) shall be the product of its nameplate rating, measured in kilowatts, and 3412
(Btu/kWh), divided by the combustion turbine-generator unit's design efficiency (decimal), adjusted for peaking service at an ambient temperature of 59 degrees Fahrenheit (15 degrees Celsius) at the unit's elevation. (The number 3412 converts kilowatt-hours (absolute) into Btu's (mean).)
(3)
Combined cycle unit.
The design fuel heat input rate of a combined cycle unit (Btu/hr) shall be the summation of the product of its generator's nameplate rating, measured in kilowatts, and 3412 (Btu/kWh), divided by the overall combustion turbine-generator unit's efficiency (decimal), adjusted for peaking service at an ambient temperature of 59 degrees Fahrenheit (15 degrees Celsius) and at the unit's evaluation, plus the product of the maximum fuel heat input to any supplemental heat recovery steam generator/boiler in gallons or pounds per hour and the fuel's heat content. If the generator's nameplate does not have a rating measured in kilowatts, the product of the generator's kilowatt-amperes nameplate rating and power factor nameplate rating must be substituted for kilowatts. (The number 3412 converts kilowatt-hours (absolute) into Btu's (mean).)
Design capacity
of a powerplant pursuant to section 103(a)(18) of FUA, is determined according to 18 CFR 287.101.
DOE
or
the Department
means the United States Department of Energy, as defined in sections 201 and 301(a) of the DEOA, including the Secretary of Energy or his designee.
Duly authorized representative
means a person who is authorized to appear before DOE in connection with a proceeding on behalf of a person interested in or aggrieved by that proceeding. Such appearance may include the submission of applications, petitions, requests, statements, memoranda of law, other documents, or of a personal appearance, oral communication, or any other participation in a proceeding.
Electing powerplant
means an existing powerplant, which (1) has been issued a proposed prohibition order under former section 301 (b) or (c) of FUA prior to August 13, 1981, the date of enactment of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981, Public Law 97-35 (OBRA); and (2) files an election to continue the current prohibition order proceeding under provisions of the former section 301 of FUA, rather than under amended section 301 of FUA.
1
Under the election provisions, an existing powerplant which has an order pending against it under section 2 of the Energy Supply and Environmental Coordination Act of 1974, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 791
et seq.
(ESECA), as of August 13, 1981, may also elect to continue the current proceeding under section 2 of ESECA. Electing powerplants under ESECA are not included in the FUA definition of “electing powerplant”. Relevant regulations governing ESECA proceedings are found at 10 CFR part 303 and 305. These elections must have been filed with DOE by November 30, 1981 in the case of FUA orders and by January 14, 1982 in the case of ESECA orders.
1
The election provisions are published at 46 FR 48118 (October 1, 1981) and will not be codified in the Code of Federal Regulations.
Electric generating unit
does not include:
(1) Any electric generating unit subject to the licensing jurisdiction of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC); and
(2) Any cogeneration facility from which less than 50 percent of the net annual electric power generation is sold or exchanged for resale. Excluded from ‘sold or exchanged for resale’ are sales or exchanges to or with an electric utility for resale by the utility to the cogenerating supplier, and sales or exchanges among owners of the cogeneration facility.

# Note:
For purposes of subparagraph (1) of this definition, OFE will not consider any unit located at a site subject to NRC's licensing authority to be jurisdictional for purposes of FUA.
Electric powerplant
means any stationary electric generating unit consisting of (a) a boiler, (b) a gas turbine, or (c) a combined cycle unit which employs a generator to produce electric power for purposes of sale or exchange and has the design capabilityf consuming any fuel (or mixture thereof) at a fuel heat input rate of 100 million Btu's per hour or greater. In accordance with section 103(a)(7)(C) of FUA, the Secretary has determined that it is
appropriate to exclude from this definition any unit which has a design capability to consume any fuel (including any mixture thereof) that does not equal or exceed 100 million Btu's per hour.
Electric Region
is as defined in § 500.3 of this part.

§ 501.51
Prohibitions by order—electing powerplants.
(a) OFE may prohibit by order the use of petroleum or natural gas as a primary energy source or in amounts in excess of the minimum amount necessary to maintain reliability of operation consistent with reasonable fuel efficiency in an electing powerplant, if:
(1) That facility has not been identified as a member of a category subject to a final rule at the time of the issuance of such order; and
(2) The requirements of § 504.6 have been met.
(b)
Notice of order and public participation.
(1) OFE may hold a conference with the proposed order recipient prior to issuing the proposed order.
(2) Pursuant to section 701 of FUA, prior to the issuance of a final order to an electing powerplant, OFE shall publish a proposed order in the
Federal Register
together with a statement of the reasons for the order. In the case of a proposed order that would prohibit the use of petroleum or natural gas as a primary energy source, the finding required by former section 301(b)(1) of the Act shall be published with such proposed order.
(3) OFE shall provide a period for the submission of written comments of at least three months after the date of the proposed order. During this period, the recipient of the proposed order and any other interested person must submit any evidence that they have determined at that time to support their respective positions as to each of the findings that OFE is required to make under section 301(b) of the Act. A proposed order recipient may submit additional new evidence at any time prior to the close of the public comment period which follows publication of the Tentative Staff Analysis or prior to the close of the record of any public hearing, whichever occurs later. A request by the proposed order recipient for an extension of the three-month period may be granted at OFE's discretion.
(4) Subsequent to the end of the comment period, OFE will issue a notice of whether OFE intends to proceed with the prohibition order proceeding.
(5) An owner or operator of a facility that may be subject to an order may demonstrate prior to issuance of a final prohibition order that the facility would qualify for an exemption if the prohibition had been established by rule. OFE will not delay the issuance of a final prohibition order or stay the effective date of such an order for the purpose of determining whether a proposed order recipient qualifies for a particular exemption unless the demonstration or qualification is submitted prior to or during the second three-month comment period, commencing after issuance of a notice of intention to proceed, or unless materials submitted after the period (i) could not have been submitted during the period through the exercise of due diligence, (ii) address material changes in fact or law occurring after the close of the period, or (iii) consist of amplification or rebuttal occasioned by the subsequent course of the proceeding. A request by the proposed order recipient for an extension of this time period may be granted at OFE's discretion.
(6) Subsequent to the end of the second three (3) month period, OFE will, if it intends to issue a final prohibition order, prepare and issue a Notice of Availability of a Tentative Staff Analysis. Interested persons wishing a hearing must request a hearing within forty-five (45) day after issuance of the Notice of Availability of the Tentative Staff Analysis. During this forty-five (45) days period, interested persons may also submit written comments on the Tentative Staff Analysis.
(7) If a hearing has been requested, OFE shall provide interested persons with an opportunity to present oral data, views and arguments at a public hearing held in accordance with subpart C of this part. The hearing will consider the findings which OFE must make in order to issue a final prohibition order and any exemption for which the proposed order recipient submitted
its demonstration in accordance with paragraph (b)(5) of this section.
(8) Upon request by the recipient of the proposed prohibition order, the combined public comment periods provided for in this section may be reduced to a minimum of forty-five (45) days from the time of publication of the proposed order.
(9) OFE may terminate a prohibition order proceeding at any time prior to the date upon which a final order shall become effective. Should OFE terminate the proceeding, it will notify the proposed order recipient, and publish a notice in the
Federal Register.
(c)
Decision to issue a final order.
(1) OFE will base its determination to issue an order on consideration of the whole record or those parts thereof cited by a party and supported by and in accordance with reliable, probative and substantial evidence.
(2) OFE shall include in the final order a written statement of the pertinent facts, a statement of the basis upon which the final order is issued, a recitation of the conclusions regarding the required findings and qualifications for exemptions. The final order shall state the effective date of the prohibition contained therein. If it is demonstrated that the facility would have been granted a temporary exemption, the effective date of the prohibition contained in the final order shall be delayed until such time as the temporary exemption would have terminated. If it is demonstrated that a facility will need a period of time to comply with the final order, the effective date of the prohibition contained in the final order may be delayed, in OFE's discretion, so as to allow an order recipient to comply with the final order.
(3) OFE will enclose with a copy of the final order, where appropriate, a schedule of steps that should be taken by a stated date (a compliance schedule) to ensure that the affected facility will be able to comply with the prohibitions stated in the order by the effective date of the prohibition contained in the final order. The compliance schedule may require the affected person to take steps with regard to a unit 60 days after service of the final order.
(4) A copy of the final order and a summary of the basis therefore will be published in the
Federal Register.
The order will become effective 60 days after publication in the
Federal Register.
(d)
Request for order.
(1) A proceeding for issuance of a prohibition order to a specific unit may be commenced by OFE, in its sole discretion, in response to a request for an order filed by the owner or operator of a facility.
(2) A petition requesting OFE to commence a prohibition order proceeding should include the following information for all units to be covered by the prohibition order:
(i) A statement of the reasons the owner or operator is seeking the issuance of a prohibition order; and
(ii) Sufficient information for OFE to make the findings required by section 301(b) of FUA.

§ 501.52
Prohibitions by order—certifying powerplants.
(a) OFE may prohibit by order the use of petroleum or natural gas as a primary energy source or in amounts in excess of the minimum amount necessary to maintain reliability of operation consistent with maintaining reasonable fuel efficiency in an existing powerplant if the owner or operator of the powerplant certifies, and OFE concurs in such certification in accordance with the requirements of §§ 504.5, 504.6 and 504.8.
(b)
Notice of order and participation.
(1) OFE may hold a conference with the
proposed order recipient, at the recipient's election, prior to issuing the proposed order. The conference may resolve any questions regarding the certification required by section 301 of the Act, as amended, and §§ 504.5, 504.6, and 504.8, and OFE's review and concurrence therein.
(2) Pursuant to section 701(b) of FUA, prior to the issuance of a final order to a certifying powerplant owner or operator, OFE must publish in the
Federal Register,
a proposed prohibition order stating the reasons for such order. OFE will review all of the information submitted by a proposed order recipient within 60 days after receipt by OFE. If the certification is complete, OFE will, within 30 days after the end of the 60 day review period, publish in the
Federal Register
a Notice of Acceptance of certification together with a proposed prohibition order stating therein the reasons for such order. This commences the prohibition order proceeding. If OFE does not believe it is able to concur in the certification, OFE shall notify the proposed order recipient and shall publish a Notice of Proposed Non-Concurrence in the
Federal Register
within 30 days after the end of the 60 day review period. If OFE finds that the certification with compliance schedule is incomplete, OFE will notify the proposed prohibition order recipient as to the deficiencies, and provide an additional period of 30 days for the certification to be amended and resubmitted. If a complete certification is not submitted within this period, the proceeding shall be terminated in accordance with § 501.52(b)(5). OFE will notify the proposed order recipient and other parties to the proceeding of the termination and publish a notice in the
Federal Register.
OFE, on its own motion, may extend any period of time by publishing a notice to that effect in the
Federal Register.
(3) The publication of the Notice of Acceptance or Notice of Proposed Non-Concurrence commences a period of 45 days during which interested persons may submit written comments or request a public hearing. During this period, the recipient of the proposed order and any other interested person may submit any evidence that they have available relating to the proposed order, the certification or the concurrence that OFE must make. A proposed order recipient may submit additional new evidence at any time prior to the close of the public comment period which follows the commencement of the proceeding or prior to the close of the record of any public hearing, whichever occurs later. A request for an extension of the 45 day period may be granted at OFE's discretion. In the case of a Notice of Acceptance, as set forth in § 504.9, no final prohibition order can be issued until any necessary environmental review pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, 42 U.S.C 4321
et seq.
(NEPA) has been completed. Upon completion of the NEPA review and unless OFE determines on the basis of the record of the proceeding that the certification fails to meet the requirements of §§ 504.5, 504.6, and 504.8, OFE shall publish a final prohibition order, together with the information required by paragraph (c) of this section. In the case of a Notice of Proposed Non-Concurrence, at the end of the 45 day comment period, OFE will notify the proposed order recipient and parties to the proceeding and publish a final Notice of Non-Concurrence in the
Federal Register,
if OFE determines it cannot concur in the certification based upon additional information submitted during the proceeding. If, at the end of the 45 day period, OFE believes it can concur in the certification, OFE will notify the proposed order recipient and parties to the proceeding and publish a Notice of Acceptance followed by a new 45 day comment period.
(4) If a hearing has been requested, OFE shall provide interested persons with an opportunity to present oral data, views and arguments at a public hearing held in accordance with subpart C of this part. The hearing may consider, among other matters, the sufficiency of the certification of the owner or operator of the powerplant required by section 301 of FUA, as amended, and §§ 504.5, 504.6, and 504.8 of these regulations.
(5) OFE may terminate a prohibition order proceeding at any time prior to the date upon which a final prohibition order is issued whenever OFE believes,
from any information contained in the record of the proceeding, that the certification does not meet the requirements of section 301 of the Act, as amended, or §§ 504.5, 504.6, and 504.8 of these regulations. If OFE terminates the proceeding or publishes a final Notice of Non-Concurrence, or the proposed order recipient fails to submit a complete certification, OFE will notify the proposed order recipient and other parties to the proceeding and publish a notice in the
Federal Register.
In such event, the proposed order recipient may submit a new certification under any provision of section 301 of the Act, as amended, at a later date. Specifically, a Notice of Non-Concurrence under either section 301(b) or 301(c) shall not affect a proposed order recipient's ability to make a certification under the other subsection.
(c)
Record and decision to issue a final order.
(1) OFE will base its determination to issue an order on consideration of the whole record or those parts thereof cited by a party and supported by and in accordance with reliable, probative and substantial evidence.
(2) OFE shall include in the final order a written statement of the basis upon which the final order is issued, and its concurrence in the required certification. A copy of the final order and a summary of the basis therefor will be published in the
Federal Register.
While the prohibition order is final for purposes of judicial review under section 702 of FUA, the prohibitions contained in the final order shall not become effective for purposes of amendment under section 301(d) of FUA, as amended, and § 501.52(d) of these regulations until the effective date of the prohibitions stated in the order, or, where the order is subject to one or more conditions subsequent listed in the prohibition order compliance schedule, until all its conditions are met.
(d)
Amendment to certifications under §§ 504.5 and 504.6.
The proposed prohibition order recipient may amend its compliance schedule under § 504.5(d), or its certification under section 301 of FUA, as amended, and §§ 504.5, 504.6 and 504.8 of these regulations in order to take into account changes in relevant facts and circumstances at any time prior to the effective date of the prohibitions contained in the final prohibition order.
(e)
Rescission of prohibition orders.
The rescission or modification of final prohibition orders issued to existing electric powerplants will be governed by the procedure in § 501.101 of these regulations.

§ 501.63
Notice of the commencement of an administrative proceeding on an exemption petition.
(a)(1) When a petition is accepted, OFE will publish in the
Federal Register
a Notice of Acceptance, or, in the case of a certification exemption, a Notice of Acceptance and Availability of Certification, signifying that an exemption proceeding has commenced. The notice will include a summary of the exemption petition, and publication will commence a public comment period of no less than forty-five (45) days during which interested parties may file written comments concerning the petition. In the case of a certification exemption, interested persons may request a public hearing during this period, pursuant to § 501.33.
(2) OFE will notify the appropriate State agency having apparent primary authority to permit or regulate the construction or operation of a powerplant that an exemption proceeding has commenced and will consult with this agency to the maximum extent practicable. Copies of all accepted petitions also will be forwarded to EPA, as provided in § 501.14(a).
(b) In processing an exemption petition, OFE shall comply with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), the Council on Environmental Quality's implementing regulations, and the DOE guidelines implementing those regulations (45 FR 20694, Mar. 28, 1980). Compliance with NEPA may involve the preparation of (1) an environmental impact statement (EIS) evaluating the grant or denial of an exemption petition, (2) an environmental assessment (EA), or (3) a memorandum to the file finding that the grant of the requested petition would not be considered a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. If an EIS is required, OFE will publish in the
Federal Register
a Notice of Intent (NOI) to prepare an EIS as soon as practicable after commencement of the proceeding. A public meeting may be held pursuant to 40 CFR 1501.7 to solicit comments or suggestions on the structure and content of the EIS.
[46 FR 59889, Dec. 7, 1981, as amended at 54 FR 52893, Dec. 22, 1989]

§ 501.66
OFE evaluation of the record, decision and order.
(a) The administrative record in a proceeding under this part will consist of the proposed prohibition order and/or petition and related documents, all relevant evidence presented at the public hearing, all written comments, and any other information in the possession of OFE and made a part of the public record of the proceeding. OFE will base its determination to issue a rule or order on consideration of the whole record, or those parts thereof cited by a party and supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence.
(b) OFE may investigate and corroborate any statement in any petition, document, or public comments submitted to it. OFE also may use any relevant facts it possesses in its evaluation and may request submissions from third persons relevant to the petition or other documents. OFE also may request additional information, data, or analyses following a public hearing, if any, if this information is necessary to resolve disputed issues in the record. Any relevant information received by OFE following the hearing that is not declared to be confidential under § 501.7(a)(11) shall be made part of the public record with opportunity provided for rebuttal.
(c) OFE will notify all participants if, after the close of any public hearing or comment period, it receives or obtains any relevant information or evidence. Participants may respond to such information or evidence in writing within fourteen (14) days of such notification. If OFE finds that the additional information or evidence relates to material issues of disputed fact and may significantly influence the outcome of the proceeding, OFE shall reopen the hearing on the issue or issues to which the additional information or evidence relates.
§ 501.67
Petition redesignations.
OFE, with the petitioner's approval, will redesignate an exemption petition if the petitioner qualifies for an exemption other than the one originally requested, even though he may not qualify for the specific exemption originally requested, or be entitled to the full exemption period provided by requested exemption. OFE shall give public notice of any redesignation of an exemption petition, and where a public hearing has been requested notice shall be given at least thirty (30) days prior to such hearing.
§ 501.68
Decision and order.
(a)(1) OFE shall issue an order either granting or denying the petition for an exemption or permit within six (6) months after the end of the period for public comment and hearing applicable to any petition.
(2) OFE may extend the six (6) month period for decision to a date certain by publishing notice in the
Federal Register,
and stating the reasons for such extension.
(3) OFE will publish a final EIS at least thirty (30) days prior to take issuance of the final order in all cases where an EIS is required.
(b)(1) OFE shall serve a copy of the order granting or denying a petition for exemption to the petitioner and all persons on the service list in cases involving a public hearing.
(2) OFE shall publish any order granting or denying a petition under this subpart in the
Federal Register
together with a statement of the reasons for the grant or denial.
(c)(1) Any order granting or denying a petition for exemption shall be based upon consideration of the whole record or those parts thereof cited by a party and supported by, and in accordance with, reliable, probative and substantive evidence.
(2) The denial of a petition for exemption shall be without prejudice to the petitioner's right to submit an amended petition. OFE may, however, reject the amended petition if it is not materially different from the denied petition.
(d) OFE may design any terms and conditions included in any temporary exemption issued or extended under section 211 of FUA, to ensure, among other things, that upon expiration of the exemption the persons and powerplant covered by the exemption will comply with the applicable prohibitions under FUA. For purposes of the provision, the subsequent grant of a permanent exemption to the subject unit shall be deemed compliance with applicable prohibitions.

§ 501.69
Judicial review.
Any person aggrieved by any order issued by OFE under this subpart, must file, within sixty (60) days of publication of the final order in the
Federal Register,
a petition for judicial review in the United States Court of Appeals for the Circuit wherein he resides, or has his principal place of business. Exhaustion of administrative remedies for purposes of judicial review does not require filing a petition pursuant to subpart G for modification or rescission of the order to be reviewed.

# Subpart G—Requests for Modification or Rescission of a Rule or Order
§ 501.100
Purpose and scope.
(a) Anyone may request that OFE commence a rulemaking proceeding pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(e); however, this subpart provides the procedures to be followed by—
(1) An interested person seeking the modification or rescission of a prohibition by rule applicable to a new facility;
(2) An owner or operator of a facility named in a prohibition by rule requesting the modification or rescission of that rule; or
(3) An owner or operator subject to an exemption order or a specific prohibition imposed by order requesting the modification or a rescission of that order.
(b) OFE also may commence a modification or rescission proceeding on its own initiative.
§ 501.101
Proceedings to modify or rescind a rule or order.
(a) In response to a request duly filed by an interested person, OFE may commence a proceeding to modify or rescind a rule or order. If OFE determines that a request to modify or rescind a rule or order does not warrant commencement of a proceeding, it will deny the request and issue a brief statement of the reason(s) for the denial.
(b) A request for modification or rescission of a rule or order must comply with the requirements of § 501.7 and must be filed at the address set forth in § 501.11.
(c) Notice of the request for modification or rescission of an order must be given by the requester to each party to the original proceeding that resulted in the issuance of the original order for which modification or rescission is sought. If the number of parties to the original proceeding is too large to allow actual notice at a reasonable cost or within a reasonable time, a requester may ask that OFE give notice to the parties by publication in the
Federal Register
; however, this alternate notice does not bind OFE to
commence a proceeding, if it subsequently determines that the request is not warranted.
(d) If OFE determines to grant a request to commence a proceeding to rescind or modify a rule or order, or OFE on its own initiative, commences a proceeding for the modification or rescission of a rule or order, it will give notice, either by service of a written notice or by oral communication (which communication must be promptly confirmed in writing) to each person upon whom the order was served that OFE proposes to modify or rescind, or, alternatively, by publication of notice in the
Federal Register.
OFE will give a reasonable period of time for each person notified to file a written response.
(e)(1) A copy of any written comments submitted to OFE under this subpart by a party to the original proceeding must also be sent to the requester. The party submitting such comments must certify to OFE that he has sent a copy of such comments to the requester.
(2) OFE may notify other persons participating in the proceeding of the comments and provide an opportunity for those notified to respond.
(f) A request for modification or rescission of a rule or order must contain a complete statement of all facts relevant to the action sought. The request must also include the names and addresses of all reasonably ascertainable persons who will be affected. Pertinent provisions contained in any documents believed to support a request may be briefly described, however, OFE reserves the right to obtain copies of any significant documents that will assist in making a determination on the merits of a request. The request must identify the specific order or rule for which modification or rescission is sought. A request should also indicate whether an informal conference will facilitate OFE's determination to commence, or not to commence a proceeding, or will assist OFE in making any determinations on material issues raised by the request.
(g) A decision by OFE to commence a proceeding under this subpart does not entitle the requester to a public hearing on the request for modification or rescission. A public hearing may be held, however, if, in its discretion, OFE considers that a public hearing will advance its evaluation of the request.
§ 501.102
OFE evaluation of the record, decision and order for modification or rescission of a rule or order.
(a) OFE will consider the entire administrative record in its evaluation of the decision and order for modification or rescission of a rule or order. OFE may investigate and corroborate any statement in the petition or related documents and may utilize in its evaluation any relevant facts obtained by its investigations. OFE may solicit or accept submissions from third persons relevant to any request under this subpart and all interested persons will be afforded an opportunity to respond to these submissions. OFE may, in its discretion and on its own initiative, convene a conference, if it considers that a conference will advance its evaluation of the request.
(b)
Criteria.
Except where modification or rescission of a rule or order is initiated by OFE, OFE's decision to rescind or modify a rule or order will be based on a determination that there are significantly changed circumstances with respect to the applicability of a particular prohibition or exemption to the requester. OFE believes that there may be “significantly changed circumstances”, if:
(1) Significant material facts are subsequently discovered which were not known and could not have been known to the petitioner or to OFE at the time of the original proceeding;
(2) A law, regulation, interpretation, ruling, order or decision on appeal that was in effect at the time of the proceeding upon which the rule or order is based and which, if it had been made known to OFE, would have been relevant to the proceeding and would have substantially altered the outcome is subsequently discovered; or
(3) There has been a substantial change in the facts or circumstances upon which an outstanding and continuing order was based, which change occurred during the interval between issuance of the order and the date of filing of the request under this subpart,
and was caused by force or circumstances beyond the requester's control.
§ 501.103
OFE decision.
(a) OFE shall issue an appropriate rule or order after considering the request for modification or rescission of a rule or order and other relevant information received during the proceeding.
(b) OFE will either grant or deny the request for modification or rescission and will briefly state the pertinent facts and legal basis for the decision.
(c) OFE will serve the rule or order granting or denying the request for modification or rescission upon the requester, or, if the action was initiated by OFE, upon the owner or operator of the affected powerplant or installation. OFE will publish a notice of the issuance of a rule or order modifying or rescinding a rule or order in the
Federal Register.

# Subpart H—Requests for Stay
§ 501.120
Purpose and scope.
(a) This subpart sets forth the procedures for the request and issuance of a stay of a rule or order or other requirement issued or imposed by OFE or these regulations but does not apply to the mandatory stays provided for in sections 202(b) and 301(a) of FUA. The application for a stay under this subpart will only be considered incidental to a proceeding on a request for modification or rescission of a final prohibition rule or order.
(b) The petitioner must comply with all final and effective OFE orders, regulations, rulings, and generally applicable requirements unless a petition for a stay is granted or is applicable under FUA.
§ 501.121
Filing and notice of petitions for stays.
(a)(1) The petition for a stay must be in writing and comply with the general filing requirements stated in § 501.7, in addition to any other requirements set forth in this subpart, and must be filed at the address provided in § 501.11.
(2) A claim for confidential treatment of any information contained in the petition for stay and supporting documents must be in accordance with § 501.7(a)(11), and filed at the address provided in § 501.11.
(b) OFE will publish notice of receipt of a petition for a stay under this subpart in the
Federal Register.
§ 501.122
Contents.
(a) A petition for a stay shall contain a full and complete statement of all facts believed to be pertinent to the act or transaction for which a stay is sought. The facts shall include, but not be limited to, the criteria listed below in § 501.123(b).
(b) The petitioner may request a conference regarding the application. If the request is not made at the time the application is filed, it must be made as soon thereafter as possible. The request and OFE's determination regarding it will be made in accordance with subpart C of this part.
§ 501.123
Evaluation of the record.
(a) The record in a proceeding on a petition for stay shall consist of the petition and any related documents, evidence submitted at any public proceedings and any other information in the possession of OFE and made part of the record. OFE may investigate and corroborate any statement in the petition or any other document submitted to it and may utilize in its evaluation any relevant facts obtained by its investigations. OFE may solicit or accept submissions from third persons relevant to the petition for stay or other document and any interested person will be afforded an opportunity to respond to these submissions. OFE, on its initiative, may convene a conference, if, in its discretion, it considers that the conference will advance its evaluation of the petition.
(b)
Criteria.
(1) OFE may grant a stay incident to a proceeding on a petition for modification of a rule or order if the petitioner shows:
(i) Irreparable injury will result if the stay is denied;
(ii) There is a strong likelihood of success on the merits;
(iii) The denial of a stay will result in a more immediate hardship or inequity to the petitioner than to other persons affected by the proceeding; and
(iv) It would be desirable for reasons of public policy to grant the stay.
§ 501.124
Decision and order.
(a) OFE will issue an order granting or denying the petition for a stay upon consideration of the request and other relevant information received or obtained during the proceeding.
(b) OFE will include in the order a brief written statement setting forth the relevant facts and the basis of the decision, including any appropriate terms and conditions of the stay.

# Subpart I—Requests for Interpretation
§ 501.130
Purpose and scope.
This subpart establishes procedures for filing a formal request for and the issuance of an interpretation of a rule, order or other action by DOE. Any response, whether oral or written, to a general inquiry, or to other than a formal written request for interpretation filed with DOE, is not an interpretation and merely provides general information that may not be relied upon in any proceeding to determine compliance with the applicable requirements of FUA.
§ 501.131
Filing a request for interpretation.
A proceeding to request an interpretation is commenced by the filing of a “Request for Interpretation (FUA).” The request must be in writing and must also comply with the general filing requirements stated in § 501.7. Any claims for confidential treatment for any information contained in the request or other related documents must be made pursuant to § 501.7(a)(11). A request for interpretation should be filed with the Assistant General Counsel for Interpretations and Rulings at the address provided in § 501.11.
§ 501.132
Contents of a request for interpretation.
(a) A request for an interpretation must contain a complete statement of all the facts believed to be relevant to the circumstances, acts or transactions that are the subject of the request. The facts must include the names and addresses of all potentially affected persons (if reasonably ascertainable) and a full discussion of the pertinent provisions and relevant facts contained in any documents submitted with the request. Copies of relevant contracts, agreements, leases, instruments, and other documents relating to the request must be submitted if DOE believes they are necessary for determination of any issue pending in the proceeding under this subpart. When the request pertains to only one step in a larger integrated transaction, the requesting party must also submit the facts, circumstances, and other relevant information pertaining to the entire transaction.
(b) The requesting party must include in the request a discussion of all relevant legal authorities, rulings, regulations, interpretations and decisions on appeal relied upon to support the particular interpretation sought.
(c) DOE may refuse to issue an interpretation if it determines that there is insufficient information upon which to base an interpretation.
§ 501.133
DOE evaluation.
(a)(1) The record shall consist of the request for an interpretation and any supporting documents, all relevant evidence presented at any public proceedings, written comments and any information in the possession of DOE that has been made part of the record.
(2) DOE may investigate and corroborate any statement in a request or related documents and may utilize in its evaluation any relevant facts obtained by the investigation. DOE may solicit or accept submissions from third persons relevant to the request for interpretation, or any other document submitted under this subpart, and the person requesting the interpretation will be afforded an opportunity to respond to these submissions.
(3) The General Counsel or his delegate will issue an interpretation on the basis of the information provided in the request, unless that information is supplemented by other information brought to the attention of DOE during the proceeding. DOE's interpretation will, therefore, depend on the accuracy of the factual statements, and the requesting party may rely upon it only
to the extent that the facts of the actual situation correspond to those upon which the interpretation is based.
(b)
Criteria.
(1) DOE will base its FUA interpretations on the DEOA and FUA, as applicable, and the regulations and published rulings of DOE as applied to the specific factual situation presented.
(2) DOE will take into consideration previously issued interpretations dealing with the same or a related issue.
§ 501.134
Issuance and effect of interpretations.
(a) DOE may issue an interpretation after consideration of the request for interpretation and other relevant information received or obtained during the proceeding.
(b) The interpretation will contain a written statement of the information upon which it is based and a legal analysis of and conclusions regarding the application of rulings, regulations and other precedent to the situation presented in the request.
(c) Only those persons to whom an interpretation is specifically addressed, and other persons upon whom the DOE serves the interpretation and who are directly involved in the same transaction or act, are entitled to rely upon it. No person entitled to rely upon an interpretation shall be subject to civil or criminal penalties stated in title VII of FUA for any act taken in reliance upon the interpretation, notwithstanding that the interpretation shall thereafter be declared by judicial or other competent authority to be invalid.
(d) DOE may at any time rescind or modify an interpretation on its own initiative. Rescission or modification shall be made by notifying persons entitled to rely on the interpretation that it is rescinded or modified. This notification will include a statement of the reasons for the rescission or modification and, in the case of a modification, a restatement of the interpretation as modified.
(e) An interpretation is modified by a subsequent amendment to the regulations or ruling to the extent that it is inconsistent with the amended regulation or ruling.
(f) Any person who believes he is directly affected by an interpretation issued by DOE, and who believes that he will be aggrieved by its implementation, may submit a petition for reconsideration of that interpretation to the General Counsel. DOE will acknowledge receipt of all requests for reconsideration; however, this acknowledgement in no way binds DOE to commence any proceeding on the request. If within sixty (60) days of DOE's acknowledgement of the receipt of a request for reconsideration, DOE has not issued either a notice of intent to commence a proceeding to reconsider the interpretation or a modification, revision or rescission of the original interpretation, the request for reconsideration will be deemed denied. DOE may, in its discretion, issue a formal denial of a request for reconsideration if:
(1) The request has not been filed in a timely manner, and good cause therefor has not been shown;
(2) The person requesting reconsideration is not aggrieved or otherwise injured substantially by the interpretation; or
(3) The request is defective because it fails to state and to present facts and legal argument that the interpretation was erroneous in fact or in law, or that it was arbitrary or capricious.

OFE may solicit or accept submissions from third persons relevant to the complaint or other related documents.
(b)
Confidentiality of information.
OFE will treat as confidential information received in any investigation of a complaint, including the identity of the complainant and the identity of any other persons who provide information to the extent such information is exempt from public disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552. OFE reserves the right to make disclosures that would be in the public interest.
§ 501.164
Decision to initiate enforcement proceedings.
After investigation of a specific complaint or based on any relevant information received or obtained during an investigation, OFE may issue a notice of violation, determine that no violation has occurred, or take such other actions as it deems appropriate. Prior to issuance of a notice of violation, and before commencement of an enforcement proceeding, OFE may transmit a draft of the notice of violation to the potentially affected person in order to promote an informal resolution of the violation.
§ 501.165
Commencement of enforcement proceedings.
(a) Whenever, on the basis of any information available, OFE determines that a person is in violation or about
to be in violation of any provision of these regulations, OFE may issue a notice of violation stating, in writing and with reasonable specificity, the nature of the violation. An enforcement proceeding commences with the issuance of a notice of violation.
(b)
Contents of the notice of violation.
OFE will set forth in the notice of violation the nature of the violation, the relevant facts that OFE believes establish the violation and the legal basis for the conclusions reached therein. OFE may also include with the notice of violation a copy of a proposed order. The notice of violation will also state whether or not OFE proposes to assess civil penalties.
(1) If OFE proposes to assess a civil penalty, a notice of violation will be issued to the violator with an opportunity for a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge, as set forth in § 501.166(a)(1) of this part, before any final determination on the violation and penalty are made by OFE. The recipient of the notice will also be informed of his right to elect to have the procedures of § 501.166(a)(2) apply, in lieu of the hearing, with respect to a final determination on the assessment of any civil penalty.
(2) If OFE does not propose to assess a civil penalty, the violator will be provided the opportunity for a conference, as set forth in § 501.166(b), before a final determination on the violation is made by OFE. OFE may, in its discretion, also provide the violator an opportunity for a hearing pursuant to § 501.166(a)(1).
(c)
Service.
OFE will serve the notice of violation in accordance with provisions set forth in § 501.6.
(d)
Rescission.
If, after issuance of a notice of violation and any related investigation, OFE finds no basis for the belief that a violation has occurred, is continuing to occur, or is about to occur, OFE may rescind the notice of violation by giving written notice to that effect to the recipient.
§ 501.166
Hearings and conferences.
(a)
When a civil penalty is proposed
—(1)
Hearing alternative in civil penalty assessment proceedings.
Unless the recipient of a notice of violation elects in writing to have the provisions of paragraph (a)(2) of this section apply, OFE will commence a proceeding to assess a penalty and, prior to a final determination on the violation and assessment of a penalty, provide an opportunity for a hearing pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 554 before an Administrative Law Judge.
(2)
Election alternative in civil penalty assessment proceedings.
The recipient of a notice of violation in which a civil penalty assessment has been proposed may elect, in writing, within thirty (30) days of receipt of the notice, to waive the administrative proceedings described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. OFE will make a determination on the proposed civil penalty assessment and issue a final order to that effect within forty-five (45) days after receiving notice of the exercise of this election.
(b)
When a civil penalty is not proposed—opportunity to request a conference.
If a person has received a notice of violation in which a civil penalty has not been proposed, he may, within thirty (30) days after receipt of the notice, request a conference with OFE to discuss the notice. In order to request a conference he must comply with the instructions set forth in the notice.
§ 501.167
Fuel use order.
(a)
General.
OFE will issue a Fuel Use Order if, after considering all the information received during the proceeding, OFE determines that a person has committed, is committing, or is about to commit a violation of FUA or of an order or rule thereunder.
(b)
Contents.
Any Fuel Use Order issued under this section shall set forth the relevant facts and legal basis for the order and where appropriate, the final penalty assessment and the basis therefor. When an administrative hearing is requested under § 501.166(a) of this part, the Fuel Use Order will include the recommended findings and conclusions of the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) and the basis for the penalty assessment. OFE will make a final determination as to any penalty assessment or other appropriate remedy based upon the recommended findings and conclusions of the ALJ and other information in the record of the enforcement proceeding. The order will
be effective upon service, unless otherwise provided therein, or stayed pursuant to § 501.120.
(c)
Service.
OFE will serve a copy of the Fuel Use Order upon any person who was served a copy of the notice of violation and upon all parties to any public proceeding on the notice of violation. OFE will place a copy of each final order on file in the Public Information Office described in § 501.12.
(d)
Judicial review.
Any person against whom a penalty is assessed pursuant to § 501.167(b) after a hearing before an ALJ may, within sixty (60) calendar days after the date of issuance of the order assessing such penalty, institute an action in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate judicial circuit for judicial review of such order in accordance with the provisions of section 723 of FUA.

§ 503.3
[Reserved]

# Subpart B—General Requirements for Exemptions
§ 503.4
Purpose and scope.
This subpart establishes the general requirements necessary to qualify for either a temporary or permanent exemption under this part and sets out the methodology for calculating the cost of using an alternate fuel and the cost of using imported petroleum.
§ 503.5
Contents of petition.
Before OFE will accept a petition for either a temporary or permanent exemption under this part, the petition must include all of the evidence and information required in this part and part 501 of this chapter.
§ 503.6
Cost calculations for new powerplants and installations.
(a)
General.
(1) This calculation compares the cost of using alternate fuel to the cost of using imported petroleum. It must be performed for each alternate fuel and/or alternate site that the petitioner is required to examine.
(2) The cost of using an alternate fuel as a primary energy source will be deemed to substantially exceed the cost of using imported petroleum if the difference between the cost of using alternate fuel and the cost of using imported oil is greater than zero.
(3) There are two comparative cost calculations—a general cost test and a special cost test. Both take into consideration cash outlays for capital investments, annual expenses, and the effect of depreciation and taxes on cash flow. To demonstrate eligibility for a permanent exemption, a petitioner must use the procedures specified in the general cost test (paragraph (b) of this section). To demonstrate eligibility for a temporary exemption, the petitioner may apply the procedures specified in either the general cost test or the special cost test (paragraph (c) of this section).
(b)
Cost calculation—general cost test.
(1) A petitioner may be eligible for a permanent exemption if he can demonstrate that the cost of using an alternate fuel from the first year of operation substantially exceeds the cost of using imported petroleum. Unless the best practicable cost estimates as prescribed below will not materially change during the first ten years of operation of the unit (given the best information available at the time the petition is filed), the petitioner must also demonstrate that the cost of using an alternate fuel beginning at any time within the first ten years of operation and using imported petroleum or natural gas until such time (
i.e.,
delayed use of alternate fuel) would substantially exceed the cost of using only imported petroleum.
(2) The petitioner would only be eligible for a temporary exemption if the computed costs of delayed alternate fuel use, commencing at the start of the second through eleventh years of operation, do not always substantially exceed the cost of using only imported petroleum. The length of the temporary exemption would be the minimum period from the start of operation in which the cost of using alternate fuel substantially exceeds the cost of using imported petroleum.
(3) To conduct the general cost test, calculate the difference (DELTA) between the cost of using an alternate fuel (COST(ALTERNATE)) and the cost of using imported petroleum (COST(OIL)) using Equations 1 through 3 below and the comparison procedures in paragraph (b)(5) of this section.
EC01OC91.000
(4) The terms in Equations 2 and 3 are defined as follows:
i = Year. i is a specified year either before year 0 or after year 0. Year 0 is the year before the unit becomes operational. For example, in the third year before the unit becomes operational, i would equal −2, and in the third year following commencement of operations of the unit, i would equal + 3. Years are represented by 52 week periods prior to or following the date on which the unit becomes operational. Outlays before the unit becomes operational are future valued to the year before the unit becomes operational (year 0), and outlays after the unit becomes operational are present valued to the year before the unit becomes operational. Year 0 must be the same for the units being compared.
g = The number of years prior to the year before the unit becomes operational (year 0) that (1) a cash outlay is first made for capital investments, or (2) an investment tax credit is first used—whichever occurs first.
N = The useful life of the unit (see paragraph (d)(5) of this section).
I
i
= Yearly cash outlay (in dollars) from the year outlays first occur to the last year of the unit's useful life for capital investments. (See paragraph (d)(2) of this section for the items that must be included.)
OM
i
= Annual cash outlay in year i (in dollars) for all operations and maintenance expenses except fuel (
i.e.,
all non-capital and non-fuel cash outlays caused by putting the capital investments (I) into service). This may include labor, materials, insurance, taxes (except income taxes), etc. (See paragraph (d)(3) of this section.)
S
i
= Salvage value of capital investment (in dollars) in year i.
FL
i
= Annual cash outlay for delivered fuel expenses (in dollars) in year i. (See paragraph (d)(3) of this section for FL
i
calculation instructions and appendix II of these regulations for the procedures to determine fuel price.)
k = The discount rate expressed as a fraction (see paragraph (d)(4) of this section).
ITC
i
= Federal investment tax credit used in year i resulting from capital investments (see paragraph (d)(6) of this section).
DPR
i
= Depreciation in year i resulting from capital investments (see paragraph (d)(6) of this section).
t
i
= Marginal income tax rate in year i (see paragraph (d)(6) of this section).
IX
i
= Inflation index value for year i (see appendix II to part 504 for method of computation).
IX
e
= Inflation index value for the year e, the year before the asset is placed in service.
(5) The step-by-step procedure that follows shows the comparison that the petitioner must make.
(i) Compute the cost of using an alternate fuel (COST(ALTERNATE)) unit throughout the useful life of the unit using Equations 2 and 3.
(ii) Compute the cost of using oil or natural gas (COST(OIL)) throughout the useful life of the unit using Equations 2 and 3.
(iii) Using Equation 1, compute the difference (DELTA) between COST (ALTERNATE) and COST (OIL). If the difference (DELTA) is less than or equal to zero, a petitioner is not eligible for a permanent or temporary exemption using the general cost test and need not complete the remainder of the general cost test calculation. However, he still may be eligible for a temporary exemption using the special cost test (paragraph (c) of this section). If the difference (DELTA) is greater than zero and if the best practicable cost estimates will not materially change during the first ten years of operation (given the best information available at the time the petition is filed), the petitioner has completed the test and is eligible for a permanent exemption. However, if the best practicable cost estimate will materially change during the first ten years, the petitioner must complete the remainder of the general cost test—the delayed use calculations which follow.
(iv) Recompute COST (ALTERNATE) with Equations 2 and 3, assuming that an alternate fuel is not used as the primary energy source until the start of the second year of operation and that imported petroleum or natural gas is used for the first year of operation. All cash outlays should reflect postponed use of alternate fuel.
(v) Successively recompute COST (ALTERNATE) with Equations 2 and 3, assuming that the alternate fuel use is postponed until the start of the third year, fourth year, and so on, through the beginning of the eleventh year of operation (with imported petroleum or natural gas used in the years preceding alternate fuel use).
(vi) Compute the difference (DELTA) between each of the ten COST(ALTERNATE)s calculated in paragraph (b)(5) (iv) and (v) of this section and the COST(OIL) calculated in paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section.
(vii) If
all
the DELTAs computed in paragraph (b)(5) (iii) and (vi) of this section are greater than zero, the petitioner is eligible for a permanent exemption. If one or more of the DELTAs is less than or equal to zero, he is eligible for a temporary exemption for the period beginning at the start of the first year of operation and terminating at the beginning of the first year in which a DELTA is zero or less.
(c)
Cost calculations—special cost test.
(1) A petitioner may be eligible for a temporary exemption if he demonstrates that the cost of using an alternate fuel will substantially exceed the cost of using imported petroleum or (natural gas) over the period of the proposed exemption. The period of the proposed temporary exemption may not exceed ten years.
The petitioner must demonstrate that the cost of using an alternate fuel substantially exceeds the cost of using imported petroleum for the first year of operation, the first two years of operation, and so forth, through the period of the proposed exemption. OFE will limit the duration of a temporary exemption to the shortest time possible.
(2) To conduct the test, calculate the difference (DELTA) between the cost of using an alternate fuel (COST (ALTERNATE)) and the cost of using imported petroleum (COST (OIL)) using Equations 4 and 5 below, Equation 3 (paragraph (b)(3) of this section), and the comparison procedures in paragraph (c)(4) of this section.
EC01OC91.001
Capital investment (I) is calculated with Equation 3 (paragraph (b)(3) of this section).
(3) The terms in Equation 5 are the same as those in Equation 2 with the addition of P, the length of the proposed temporary exemption in years. (See paragraph (b)(4) of this section for other terms.)
(4) The step-by-step procedure that follows shows the comparisons which must be made.
(i) Using Equation 5, compute the cost of using an alternate fuel (COST(ALTERNATE)) assuming the length of the proposed exemption is one year.
(ii) Likewise, compute the cost of using imported petroleum or natural gas (COST(OIL)) assuming the length of the proposed exemption is one year.
(iii) Compute the difference (DELTA) between COST (ALTERNATE) and COST (OIL) using Equation 4.
(iv) Repeat the calculations made in (i), (ii), and (iii) above, assuming the length of the proposed exemption is two years, three years, four years, and so on, up through the period of the proposed exemption.
(v) A petitioner is eligible for a temporary exemption for the period beginning at the start of the first year of operation and terminating at the beginning of the first year in which a DELTA is zero or less.
(d)
Information on parameters used in the calculations.
(1) All estimated expenditures, except fuel, shall be expressed in real terms (unadjusted for inflation) by using the prices in effect at the time the petition is submitted. Instructions for fuel price calculations are contained in appendix II.
(2) Capital investment yearly cash outlays (I
i
) must include all items that are capital investments for Federal income tax purposes. All purchased equipment that has a useful life greater than one year, capitalized engineering costs, land, construction, environmental offsets, fuel inventory, transmission facilities, piping, etc., that are necessary for the operation of the unit must be included. However, an item must only be included if a cash outlay is required after the decision has been made to build the unit; sunk costs must not be included (
e.g.,
if the firm owns the land, its purchase price may not be included).

# Note:
The guidelines for the fuel inventory for powerplants not using natural gas shall be: (a) All powerplants with only steam driven turbines—78 days, (b) all powerplants with only combustion turbines—142 days, (c) all powerplants with combined cycles—both steam driven turbines and combustion turbines—142 days. The guidelines for the fuel inventory for installations not using natural gas shall be the greater of: (1) 21 days fuel supply, or (2) sufficient fuel to fill sixty (60) percent of the storage volume. The guidelines for the fuel inventory for all facilities using natural gas shall be zero unless the gas supply is interruptible in which case an appropriate inventory of back-up fuel must be included. Other inventory levels may be used if they are more appropriate than these guidelines; however, the source or derivation of these levels must be discussed in the evidential summary.
(3)(i) The annual cash outlays for operations and maintenance expense (OM
i
) and fuel expense (FL
i
) for a powerplant may be computed by one of the following three methods; however, the one chosen must be consistently applied throughout the analysis.
(A) Assume the energy produced by the powerplant equals seventy (70) percent of design capacity times 8760 hours for each year during the life of the powerplant, and compute cash outlays for operations, maintenance, and fuel expenses for the powerplant.
(B)
Economically dispatch the new powerplant.
The cash outlays for operations, maintenance, and fuel expenses of all powerplants being dispatched (where oil and natural gas are priced according to the procedures of appendix II
1
) are the corresponding expenses for the purpose of the cost calculation. The dispatch analysis area must be that area with which the firm currently dispatches, anticipates dispatching, and will be interconnected. It must also include all anticipated exchanges of energy with other utilities or powerpools. The outlays for operations, maintenance, and fuel may also be estimated using a methodology that incorporates the benefits of economically dispatching units and provides consistent treatment in the alternate fuel and oil or natural gas cases being compared.
(C) Use a dispatch analysis to project the energy produced by the powerplant for a representative (not atypical) year of operation when consuming an alternate fuel. Compute the cash outlays for operations, maintenance, and fuel expenses for the powerplant based upon the level of energy production estimated for the representative year. The dispatch analysis and fuel expenses for the cost calculation must include oil and natural gas priced according to the procedures of appendix II.
1
(ii) When computing the annual cash outlays for operations and maintenance expense (OM
i
) and fuel expense (FL
i
) for an installation, specify the firing rates and the length of time each firing rate will be maintained.
(4) The discount rate (k) for analyses is 2.9 percent or that which is computed as specified in appendix I. The method of computing the inflation index (IX) is shown in appendix II to part 504. OFE will modify these specified rates from time to time as required by changed conditions after public notice and an opportunity to comment. However, the relevant set of specified rates for a specific petition for exemption will be the set in effect at the time the petition is submitted or the set in effect at the time a decision is rendered, whichever set is more favorable to the petitioner.
(5)(i) The guidelines for the useful life (N) of all powerplants except nuclear will be thirty-five (35) years. The guidelines for the useful life of a nuclear powerplant will be forty (40) years. The guidelines for the useful life of major fuel burning installations will be forty (40) years. Other useful life projections may be used if they are more appropriate than these guidelines; however, the source or derivation of these projections must be contained in the evidential summary. The summary should include a discussion of engineering, economic historical or other evidence.
(ii) If the units being compared have different useful lives, the petitioner will have to modify his calculation so that the two cash flows being compared have the length of the shorter useful life. To do this, (A) use the shorter of the two useful lives in Equations 2 and 5 for both units, and (B) multiply capital investment (I) of the unit with the longer life (computed with Equation 3) by the following adjustment factor (A):
EC01OC91.002
where:
R = The useful life of the facility with the longer life.
Q = The useful life of the facility with the shorter life.
k = The discount rate (see paragraph (d)(4) above).
(6) All Federal investment tax credits (ITC
i
) and depreciation (PR
i
) values are those used for Federal income tax purposes and must be applied consistently throughout the analysis and in a manner consistent with the Federal tax
laws. All investment tax credits allowed under Federal tax law must be reflected in the computations. The petitioner must use the method of depreciation which results in the greatest present value of the cash flow due to the tax and depreciation effect. The marginal income tax rate (t
i
) is the firm's anticipated marginal Federal income tax rate in year i. The relevant investment tax credits, depreciation methodology, and marginal Federal income tax rates for a specific exemption petition will be those prescribed by Federal law in effect (or those tax parameters which are known with certainty will be in effect) at the time a decision is rendered. (However, if an investment tax credit expires in a certain year under the law which is in effect at the time the petition is submitted, the petitioner must assume that it will in fact expire in that year.)
(7) If powerplants are being compared, the design capacities or the maximum sustained energy per unit of time that could be produced must be the same. If installations are being compared, the maximum sustained energy per unit of time that could be produced must be the same.
(8) All estimated cash outlays must be computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied.
(9) The scope of the estimates of relevant costs (as discussed above) of units being compared must be the same.
(10) All allowances for uncertainty and risk in the cost estimates must be explicit.
(11) All cash outlays must be net of any government subsidies or grants.
(e)
Evidence in support of the cost calculation.
Petitioners for an exemption which requires the use of the cost calculation shall certify that the cost of using alternate fuel substantially exceeds the cost of using oil as primary energy source as calculated in this section. A brief summary of the petitioner's supporting calculations and estimates shall be submitted with the certification. The summary should include the following:
(1) Cash outlays, Investment tax credits, depreciation methodologies, and anticipated salvage for capital investments including a description of all major construction and equipment;
(2) Annual cash outlays for operations and maintenance expenses including the formulas used to compute them; and
(3) Annual cash outlays for delivered fuel expenses including the formulas used to compute them.

§ 503.7
State approval—general requirement for new powerplants.
(a) Where approvals by the appropriate State regulatory authority are required prior to the construction or use of a new powerplant, a petition for an exemption for consideration by OFE may be submitted to OFE prior to obtaining such approvals from the State regulatory authority.
(b) An exemption granted for a powerplant shall not become effective until an adequate demonstration has been made to OFE that all applicable approvals required by the State regulatory authorities have been obtained.
§ 503.8
No alternate power supply—general requirement for certain exemptions for new powerplants.
(a)
Application.
To qualify for an exemption, except in the case of an exemption for cogeneration units, section 213(c) of the Act requires a demonstration that, despite reasonable good faith efforts, there is no alternative supply of electric power available within a reasonable distance at a reasonable cost without impairing short-run or long-run reliability of service. If a petitioner is unable to demonstrate that there is no alternate supply during the first year of operation, OFE will conclude that the absence of the proposed powerplant will not impair short-term reliability of service, and as a result will not grant the exemption. Such action would not impair long-term reliability of service, since a petition may be submitted for a powerplant that would begin operation in a subsequent year.
(b)
Criteria.
To meet the demonstration required under paragraph (a) of this section, a petitioner must certify that:
(1) A diligent effort has been made to purchase firm power for the first year of operation to cover all or part of the projected shortfall at a cost that is less than ten (10) percent above the annualized cost of generating power from the proposed plant (including the capital, operation and maintenance expenses, and fuel prices); and
(2)(i) Despite these efforts, the reserve margin in the petitioner's electric region, normal dispatch area, or service area, in the absence of the proposed plant, would fall below twenty (20) percent during the first year of proposed operation; or
(ii) Despite these efforts, the reserve margin will be greater than twenty (20) percent but reliability of service would be impaired. In such case, the certification must be related to factors not included in the calculation of reserve margin, such as transmission constraints.
(c)
Evidence.
The petition must include the following evidence in order to make the demonstration required by this section:
(1) Duly executed certification required under paragraph (b) of this section; and
(2) Exhibits containing the basis for the certification submitted under this section (including those factual and analytical materials deemed by the petitioner to be sufficient to support its certification to this general requirement).
(d)
FERC consultation.
OFE will forward a copy of any petition for which a showing is required under this section to FERC promptly after it is filed with OFE, and OFE will consult with FERC before making the no alternate supply of power finding.
[46 FR 59903, Dec. 7, 1981, as amended at 47 FR 15314, Apr. 9, 1982; 54 FR 52894, Dec. 22, 1989]
§ 503.9
Use of mixtures—general requirement for certain permanent exemptions.
(a)
Criteria.
To qualify for a permanent exemption, except in the case of an exemption for fuel mixtures, section 213(a)(1) of the Act requires a demonstration that the use of a mixture of natural gas and petroleum and an alternate fuel for which an exemption under 10 CFR 503.38 (Fuel mixtures) would be available, would not be economically or technically feasible.
(b)
Evidence.
The petition must include the following evidence in order to make the demonstration required by this section:
(1) Duly executed certifications to the criteria set forth in paragraph (a) of this section; and
(2) Exhibits containing the basis for the certifications submitted under this section (including those factual and analytical materials deemed by the petitioner to be sufficient to support its certifications to this general requirement.)

# Note:
In meeting this general requirement, OFE will require a petitioner to examine only mixtures of oil and coal and natural gas and coal, or, where petitioner wishes to examine an additional or substitute mixture, such other alternate fuels as OFE and the petitioner agree are reasonable to petitioner's circumstances.
[46 FR 59903, Dec. 7, 1981, as amended at 54 FR 52894, Dec. 22, 1989]
§ 503.10
Use of fluidized bed combustion not feasible—general requirement for permanent exemptions.
(a)
OFE finding.
Except in the case of an exemption for fuel mixtures, OFE may deny permanent exemptions authorized under section 212 of the Act if OFE finds on a site-specific or generic basis that use of a method of fluidized bed combustion of an alternate fuel is economically and technically feasible.
(b)
Demonstration.
If OFE has made such a finding, OFE will deny a petitioner's request for exemption unless the petitioner demonstrated that the use of a method of fluidized bed combustion is not economically or technically feasible. The petition or any supplement thereto required by OFE must include the following evidence:
(1) If use of a method of fluidized bed combustion were to be required, evidence that the petitioner would be eligible for a permanent exemption for lack of alternate fuel supply, site limitations, environmental requirements, lack of adequate capital, or State or local requirements; or
(2) Use of a method of fluidized bed combustion is not technically or economically feasible due to design or special circumstances.
[46 FR 59903, Dec. 7, 1981, as amended at 54 FR 52894, Dec. 22, 1989]
§ 503.11
Alternative sites—general requirement for permanent exemptions for new powerplants.
(a)
Criteria.
To qualify for permanent exemption due to lack of alternate fuel supply, site limitations, environmental requirements, or inadequate capital, section 212(a) of the Act requires a demonstration that one of these exemptions would be available for any reasonable alternative site for the facility.
(b)
Evidence.
The petition must include the following evidence in order to make the demonstration required by this section:
(1) Duly executed certifications to the criteria set forth in paragraph (a) of this section; and
(2) Exhibits containing the basis for the certifications submitted under this section (including those factual and analytical materials deemed by the petitioner to be sufficient to support its certifications to this general requirement).
[46 FR 59903, Dec. 7, 1981, as amended at 54 FR 52894, Dec. 22, 1989]
§ 503.12
Terms and conditions; compliance plans.
(a)
Terms and conditions generally.
A petitioner must comply with any terms and conditions imposed upon the grant of an exemption petition. OFE will limit any such terms and conditions to the unit(s) which is the subject of the petition.
(b)
Compliance plans for temporary exemptions.
(1) Any compliance plan required to accompany a petition for a temporary exemption shall include the following:
(i) A detailed schedule of progressive events and the dates upon which the events are to take place, indicating how compliance with the applicable prohibitions of the Act will occur;
(ii) Evidence of binding contracts for fuel, or for facilities for the production of fuel, which are required for compliance with the applicable prohibitions of the Act;
(iii) A schedule indicating how any necessary permits and approvals required to burn an alternate fuel will be obtained; and
(iv) Any other documentary evidence which indicates an ability to comply with the applicable prohibitions of the Act.
(2) Any exemption for which a compliance plan is required shall not be effective until the compliance plan is approved by DOE.
(3) If the petition is granted, an updated, duly executed plan must be submitted to OFE within one (1) month of an alteration of any milestone in the compliance plan, together with the reasons for the alteration and its impact upon the scheduling of all other milestones in the plan.
§ 503.13
Environmental impact analysis.
In order to enable OFE to comply with NEPA, a petitioner must include the information indicated in this section if a permanent exemption is requested. Material which has been prepared pursuant to any Federal, State or local requirement for environmental information for this unit or site may be incorporated by reference and appended to the petition. Guidelines issued by OFE for environmental reports should be used in preparing this analysis (44 FR 63740, November 5, 1979). These guidelines, which are also available in the OFE public document room, have been designed to insure that environmental reports follow the format prescribed by Council on Environmental Quality final regulations implementing NEPA. The guidelines are subject to discussion at a prepetition conference and to modification according to the facts of a particular case.
(a) All petitions for permanent exemptions must contain the following information:
(1) A description of the facility, including site location, and surroundings, alternative site(s), the facility's current proposed operations, its
fuel capability, and its pollution abatement systems and equipment (including those systems and equipment necessary for all fuel scenarios considered);
(2) A description of the existing environment, including air, water, and land resources;
(3) Direct and indirect environmental impacts of the proposed action including impacts of alternative fuel scenarios, and no build alternatives.
(4) Regulatory requirements governing the facility, including a description of Federal, State and local requirements for air, water, noise and solid waste disposal which must be met for each fuel considered.
(b) For exemptions for cogeneration, the information enumerated below is to be submitted in lieu of the information required by paragraph (a) of this section. However, submission of the following information merely establishes a rebuttable presumption that the grant or denial of the exemption would have no significant environmental impact. OFE may, in individual cases, during the course of the administrative proceeding, determine that additional environmental information is required. In such cases, the petitioner will be required to submit the information described in paragraph (a) of this section.
(1) A certification that the petitioner will, prior to operating the unit under the exemption, secure all applicable environmental permits and approvals pursuant to, but not limited to, the following: Clean Air Act, Rivers and Harbors Act, Coastal Zone Management Act, Safe Drinking Water Act, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; and
(2) Information required by the following environmental checklist must be provided and certified as accurate:

§ 503.14
Fuels search.
Prior to submitting a petition for a permanent exemption for lack of alternate fuel supply, site limitations, inadequate capital, or state or local requirements, a petitioner must examine the use of conventional solid coal as a primary energy source at the site under consideration, and at reasonable alternative sites. Where a petitioner believes that its use of such coal would be infeasible, however, and where OFE and the petitioner can reach accord, it may evaluate use of a different alternate fuel in lieu of solid coal. A petitioner of these exemptions must demonstrate for any fuel examined that he would qualify for an exemption.

[46 FR 59903, Dec. 7, 1981, as amended at 54 FR 52894, Dec. 22, 1989]
§ 503.23
Inability to comply with applicable environmental requirements.
(a)
Eligibility.
Section 211(a)(3) of the Act provides for a temporary exemption due to an inability to comply with applicable environmental requirements. To qualify a petitioner must demonstrate that despite diligent good faith efforts:
(1) The petitioner will be unable, as of the projected date of commencement of operation, to comply with the applicable prohibitions of the Act without violating applicable Federal or State environmental requirements; and
(2) The petitioner will be able to comply with the applicable prohibitions of the Act and with applicable environmental requirements by the end of the temporary exemption period.

# Note:
(1) For purposes of considering an exemption under this section, OFE's decision will be based solely on an analysis of the petitioner's capacity to physically achieve applicable environmental requirements. The petition should be directed toward those conditions or circumstances which make it physically impossible to comply during the temporary exemption period. The cost of compliance is not relevant, but cost-related considerations may be presented as part of a demonstration submitted under § 503.21.
(2) Prior to submitting an exemption petition, it is recommended that a meeting be requested with OFE and EPA or the appropriate State or local regulatory agency to discuss options for operating an alternate fuel fired facility in compliance with applicable environmental requirements.
(b)
Evidence required in support of a petition.
The petition must include the following evidence in order to make the demonstration required by this section:
(1) Where the petitioner has applied for a construction permit from EPA or an appropriate State agency prior to petitioning for an exemption under this section, a copy of that application and synopsis of supporting documents filed with or subsequent to that application must be submitted to OFE with the petition or at the time filed with the permitting agency;
(2) To the extent applicable, a copy of the EPA or State denial of the construction permit application;
(3) To the extent applicable, a synopsis of the administrative record of the EPA or State or local permit proceedings;
(4) To the extent applicable, a summary of the technology upon which the denial was based, including a performance comparison between the proposed technology and that technology which would provide the maximum possible reduction of pollution;
(5) An examination of the environmental compliance of the facility, including an analysis of its ability to meet applicable standards and criteria when using both the proposed fuel and the alternate fuel(s) which would provide the basis for exemption. All such analysis must be based on accepted analytical techniques, such as air quality
modeling, and reflect current conditions of the area which would be affected by the facility. The petitioner is responsible for obtaining the necessary data to accurately characterize these conditions. Environmental compliance must be examined in the context of available pollution control equipment which would provide the maximum possible reduction of pollution. The analysis must contain: (i) Requests for bids and other inquiries made and responses received by the petitioner concerning the availability and performance of pollution control equipment; (ii) contracts signed, if any, for an alternate fuel supply and for the purchase and installation of pollution control equipment; or (iii) other comparable evidence such as technical studies documenting the efficacy of equipment to meet applicable requirements;
(6) An examination of any regulatory options available to the petitioner in seeking to achieve environmental compliance (such as offsets, variances, and State Implementation Plan revisions);
(7) Any other documentation which demonstrates an inability to comply with applicable environmental requirements;
(8) No alternate power supply exists, as required under § 503.8 of these regulations.
(c)
Duration.
This temporary exemption, taking into account any extension and renewals, may not exceed 5 years.
(d)
Certification alternative.
(1) To qualify for this exemption, in lieu of meeting the evidentiary requirements of paragraph (b) of this chapter, a petitioner may certify that, for the period of the exemption:
(i) The site for the facility is or will be located in a Class I area or Class II area in which the allowable increment established by law has been consumed, as defined in part C of the Clean Air Act; the use of an alternate fuel will cause or contribute to concentrations of pollutants which would exceed the maximum allowable increases in a Class I or Class II area even with the application of best available control technology; the site for the facility is or will be located in a non-attainment area as defined in part D of the Clean Air Act for any pollutant which would be emitted by the facility; or, even with the application of the lowest achievable emission rate, the use of an alternate fuel will cause or contribute to concentrations in an air quality control region, of a pollutant for which any national ambient air quality standard is or would be exceeded; and
(ii) No alternate power supply exists, as required under § 503.8 of these regulations.
(2) A petition by certification under this paragraph must include:
(i) Duly executed certifications required under paragraph (d)(1) of this section;
(ii) Exhibits containing the basis for the certifications required under paragraph (d)(1) of this section (including those factual and analytical materials deemed by the petitioner to be sufficient to support the granting of this exemption); and
(iii) The anticipated duration of the circumstances which constitute the basis for the exemption.

Data are based upon 1987 oil, natural gas and electricity statistics published by DOE's Energy Information Administration.

# Example:
The proposed cogeneration project is to be located in Massachusetts and is to use distillate oil. It will have a capacity of 50 MW, an average annual heat rate of 7600 BTU/KWHR, and be operated at a capacity factor of 90%. The annual fuel consumption is therefore calculated to be 2,996 × 10
9
Btu/yr. (50,000 KW × 7600 BTU/KWHR × .9 × 8760 HR/YR) The oil and gas backed off the grid would be calculated to be .2070 × 10
9
BTU/YR. (50,000 KW × 5250 BTU/KWHR × .9 × 8760 HR/YR) since the proposed unit would consume more oil that would be “backed off” the grid, the unit would not be eligible for a permanent exemption based on savings of oil and natural gas.

In the case of electing powerplants, OFP must make the following findings required by § 504.6 (c), (d), (e), and (f), in order to issue a prohibition order to the unit, pursuant to former section 301 (b) or (c):
(1) The unit currently has, or previously had, the technical capability to use an alternate fuel as a primary energy source;
(2) The unit has this technical capability now, or it could have the technical capability without:
(i) A substantial physical modification of the unit; or
(ii) A substantial reduction in the rated capacity of the unit; and
(3) It is financially feasible for the unit to use an alternate fuel as its primary energy source.
(b) In the case of electing powerplants, OFP must make a proposed finding regarding the technical capability of a unit to use alternate fuel as identified in paragraph (a) (1) of this section prior to the date of publication of the notice of the proposed prohibition. OFP will publish this finding in
The
Federal Register
along with the notice of the proposed prohibition.
(c)
Technical capability.
(1) In the case of electing and certifying powerplants, OFP will consider “technical capability” on a case-by-case basis in order to make the required finding. In the case of a certifying powerplant, the powerplant should present information to support the certification relevant to the considerations set forth below. OFP will consider the ability of the unit, from the point of fuel intake to physically sustain combustion of a given fuel and to maintain heat transfer.
2
2
OFP will not ordinarily consider the nature or absence of appurtenances outside the unit. For example, OFP will examine the furnace configuration and ash removal capability but will not normally consider the need to install pollution control equipment as a measure of technical capability. Furthermore, OFP will not normally conclude that the absence of fuel handling equipment, such as conveyor belts, pulverizers, or unloading facilities, bears on the issue of a unit's “technical capability” to burn an alternate fuel.
(2) OFP considers that a unit “had” the technical capability to use an alternate fuel if the unit was once able to burn that fuel (regardless of whether the unit was expressly designed to burn that fuel or whether it ever actually did burn it), but is no longer able to do so at the present due to temporary or permanent alterations to the unit itself.
3
3
For example, a unit which at one time burned solid coal but which could no longer do so because its coal firing ports and sluicing channels had been cemented over, would be classified as having “had” the technical capability to use coal. (The question of whether it again “could have” such capability without “substantial physical modification” is a separate and additional question.)
(3) A unit “has” the technical capability to use an alternate fuel if it can burn an alternate fuel, notwithstanding the fact that adjustments must be made to the unit beforehand or that pollution control equipment may be required to meet air quality requirements.
4
4
A unit designed to burn natural gas shall be presumed to have the technical capability to burn a synthetic fuel such as medium Btu gas from coal (assuming such gas is available unless convincing evidence to the contrary is submitted in rebuttal). Also a unit designed to burn oil may, depending upon the chemical characteristics, be a unit that “has” the technical capability to burn liquefied coal. The fact that certain adjustments may be necessary does not render this a “hypothetical” as opposed to a “real” capability. Even an oil fired unit converting from the use of #2 distillate to #6 residual oil may be required to adjust or replace burner nozzles and add soot blowers.
(d)
Substantial physical modification.
In the case of electing and certifying powerplants, OFP will make its determination on whether a physical modification to a unit is “substantial” on a case-by-case basis. In the case of certifying powerplants, OFP will consider the factors set forth below for the purpose of concurrence in the certification. OFP will consider physical modifications made to the unit as “substantial” where warranted by the magnitude and complexity of the engineering task or where the modification would impact severely upon operations at the site.
5
OFP will not, however, assess physical modification on the basis of cost.
5
Generally, modification of a unit to burn coal or an alternate fuel will be considered insubstantial if significant alterations to the boiler, such as a change to the furnace configuration or a complete respacing of the tubes, are not required. Minor alterations such as replacement of burners or additions of soot blowers, and additions or alterations outside the boiler, shall not cause the modification to be substantial.
(e)
Substantial reduction in rated capacity.
In the case of electing and certifying powerplants, OFP will make this determination on the basis of the following factors. A certifying powerplant should present information to support its certification regarding these factors in order for OFP to make its review for concurrence.
(1) OFP regards a unit's derating of 25 percent or more, as a result of converting a unit from oil or gas to an alternate fuel, as substantial.
(2) OFP will presume that a derating of less than 10 percent, as a result of converting a unit from oil or gas to an alternate fuel, is not substantial unless
convincing evidence to the contrary is submitted in rebuttal.
6
6
For example, units that are the subject of a prohibition order will not have installed any operating air pollution control equipment sufficient to burn coal in compliance with applicable environmental equipments. The installation and use of air pollution control equipment alone can, in many cases, produce a derating. Moreover, the shift to coal itself will, because of differences in energy density and fuel flow characteristics, typically involve some derating.
(3) OFP will assess units for which a derating is claimed of 10 percent or more, but less than 25 percent, on a case-by-case.
(4) In assessing whether a unit's derating is not substantial, OFP will consider the impact of a reduction in rated capacity of the unit taking into consideration all necessary appurtenances such as air pollution control equipment required to burn an alternate fuel in compliance with environmental requirements expected to be applicable at the date the prohibitions contained in the final prohibition order become effective. However, the potential order recipient may raise in rebuttal the impact of derating on the site at which the unit is located and on the system as well as on the unit itself, if under paragraph (e)(2), or case-by-case, if under paragraph (e)(3) of this section.
(f)
Financial feasibility.
In the case of certifying and electing powerplants, OFP will make this finding based on the following considerations. A certifying powerplant should present information to support its certification relevant to these considerations in order for OFP to make its review for concurrence. Conversion of a unit to burn coal or an alternate fuel shall be deemed financially feasible if the firm has the actual ability to obtain sufficient capital to finance the conversion, including all necessary land, coal and ash handling equipment, pollution control equipment, and all other necessary expenditures, without violating legal restrictions on its ability to raise debt or equity capital, unreasonably diluting shareholder equity, or unreasonably adversely affecting its credit rating. OFP will consider any economic or financial factors presented by the proposed order recipient in determining the firm's ability or inability to finance the conversion including, but not limited to, the following:
(1) The required coverage ratios on the firm's debt and preferred stock;
(2) The firm's investment program; and
(3) The financial impact of the conversion, including other conversions which are or may be undertaken voluntarily by the proposed order recipient or imposed upon the recipient's system by the Act, and including pending or planned construction or reconstruction of alternate-fuel-fired plants and plants exempt from FUA prohibitions.
7
Where helpful in clarifying the long-term financial feasibility of a conversion, DOE may analyze the economic benefits anticipated from operation of the converted unit or units using coal or other alternate fuel relative to those from continued operation using petroleum or natural gas.
7
OFP will not require the proposed order recipient to cancel or defer construction or reconstruction of any alternate-fuel-fired facility, or any facility exempt from the prohibitions of the Act, for which a decision to finance such facility has been made by the appropriate company official before the publication of the prohibition order. The proposed order recipient may choose to cancel or defer any such facility.

§ 504.7
Prohibition against excessive use of petroleum or natural gas in mixtures—electing powerplants.
(a) In the case of electing powerplants, if OFP finds that it is technically and financially feasible for a unit to use a mixture of petroleum or natural gas and an alternate fuel as its primary energy source, OFP may prohibit, by order, the use in that unit of
petroleum or natural gas, or both, in amounts exceeding the minimum amount necessary to maintain reliability of operation consistent with maintaining reasonable fuel efficiency of the mixture.
(b) In making the technical feasibility finding required by former section 301 (b) and (c) of the Act and paragraph (a) of this section, OFP may weigh “physical modification” or “derating of the unit,” but these considerations, by themselves, will not control the technical feasibility finding. A technical feasibility finding might be made notwithstanding the need for substantial physical modification. The economic consequences of a substantial physical modification are taken into account in determining financial feasibility.

§ 504.8
Prohibitions against excessive use of petroleum or natural gas in mixtures—certifying powerplants.
(a) In the case of certifying powerplants, OFP may prohibit the use of petroleum or natural gas in such powerplant in amounts exceeding the minimum amount necessary to maintain reliability of operation consistent with maintaining the reasonable fuel efficiency of the mixture. This authority is contained in section 301(c) of the Act, as amended. The owner or operator of the powerplant may certify at any time to OFP that it is technically capable and financially feasible for the unit to use a mixture of petroleum or natural gas and coal or another alternate fuel as a primary energy source. In assessing whether the unit is technically capable of using a mixture of petroleum or natural gas and coal or another alternate fuel as a primary energy source, for purposes of this section, the extent of any physical modification necessary to convert the unit and any concomitant reduction in rated capacity are not relevant factors. So long as a unit as proposed to be modified would be technically capable of using the mixture as a primary energy source under § 504.6(c), this certification requirement shall be deemed met. The criteria for certification of financial feasibility are found at § 504.6(f). In addition, the powerplant's owner or operator must submit a prohibition compliance schedule, which meets the requirements of § 504.5(d).
(b) If OFP concurs with the certification, a prohibition order against the unit's excessive use of petroleum or natural gas in the mixture will be issued following the procedure outlined in § 501.52 of these regulations.
(c) The petitioner may seek to amend its certification in order to take into account changes in relevant facts and circumstances by following the procedure contained in § 501.52(d).

# Note:
The authority of OFP implemented under this section should not be confused with the other two fuel mixture provisions of these regulations. One is the general requirement that petitioners for permanent exemptions demonstrate that the use of a mixture of natural gas or petroleum and an alternate fuel is not economically or technically feasible (See § 504.15). The second is the permanent fuel mixtures exemption itself (See § 504.56).

§ 504.9
Environmental requirements for certifying powerplants.
Under §§ 501.52, 504.5 and 504.6 of these regulations, OFP may prohibit, in accordance with section 301 and section 303 (a) or (b) of FUA, as amended, the use of natural gas or petroleum, or both, as a primary energy source in any certifying powerplant. Under sections 301(c) and 303(a) of FUA, as amended, and §§ 501.52, 504.6, and 504.8 of
these regulations, OFP may prohibit the excessive use of natural gas or petroleum in a mixture with an alternate fuel as a primary energy source in a certifying powerplant.
(a)
NEPA compliance.
Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, where the owner or operator of a powerplant seeks to obtain an OFP prohibition order through the certification procedure, and did not hold either a proposed prohibition order under former section 301 of FUA or pending order under section 2 of ESECA, it will be responsible for the costs of preparing any necessary Environmental Assessment (EA) or Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) arising from OFP's obligation to comply with NEPA. The powerplant owner or operator shall enter into a contract with an independent party selected by OFP, who is qualified to conduct an environmental review and prepare an EA or EIS, as appropriate, and who does not have a financial or other interest in the outcome of the proceedings, under the supervision of OFP. The NEPA process must be completed and approved before OFP will issue a final prohibition order based on the certification.
(b)
Environmental review procedure.
Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, environmental documents, including the EA and EIS, where necessary, will be prepared utilizing the process set forth above. OFP, the powerplant owner or operator and the independent third party shall enter into an agreement for the owner or operator to engage and pay directly for the services of the qualified third party to prepare the necessary documents. The third party will execute an OFP prepared disclosure document stating that he does not have any conflict of interest, financial or otherwise, in the outcome of either the environmental process or the prohibition order proceeding. The agreement shall outline the responsibilities of each party and his relationship to the other two parties regarding the work to be done or supervised. OFP shall approve the information to be developed and supervise the gathering, analysis and presentation of the information. In addition, OFP will have the authority to approve and modify any statement, analysis, and conclusion contained in the third party prepared environmental documents.
(c)
Financial hardship.
Whenever the bona fide estimate of the costs associated with NEPA compliance, if borne by the powerplant owner or operator, would make the conversion financially infeasible, OFP may waive the requirement set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section and perform the necessary environmental review.

EC01OC91.003
The terms in equation 1 are defined as follows:
W
d
= Fraction of existing capital structure which is debt.
W
p
= Fraction of existing capital structure which is preferred equity.
W
e
= Fraction of existing capital structure which is common equity and retained earnings.
R

= Flotation cost of common stock expressed as a fraction.
t = Marginal federal income tax rate for the current year.
(b)
Information on parameters used in Equation 1.
(1) The parameters used in equation 1 will be the best practicable estimates. They will be obtained from the firm, accepted rating services (e.g., Standard
Poors, Moody's), government publications, accepted financial publications, annual financial reports and statements of firms, and investment bankers.
(2) The predicted nominal cost of debt (R
d
) may be estimated by determining the current average yield on newly issued bonds—industrial or utility as appropriate—which have the same rating as the firm's most recent debt issue.
(3) The predicted nominal cost of preferred stock (R
p
) may be estimated by determining the current average yield on newly issued preferred stock—industrial or utility as appropriate—which has the same rating as the firm's most recent preferred stock issue.
(4)(A) The predicted nominal cost of common stock (R
e
) is computed with equation 2.
Eq 2 R
e
= R
f
+ B × R

where:
R
f
= The risk free interest rate—the average of the most recent auction rates of U.S. Government 13-week Treasury Bills,
B = The “beta” coefficient—the relationship between the excess return on common stock and the excess return on the S

= The mean excess return on the S
P 500 composite index—the mean of the difference between the return on the S
P 500 composite index and the risk free interest rate for the years 1926-1976 as computed by Ibbotson and Sinquefield(

P 500 composite index at the end of month t.
D
sp,t
= The estimated monthly income received from holding “one share” of the S
P 500 in month t.
The regression analysis is done with sixty months of data. The first month (t = 1) is sixty months before the month in which the firm's current fiscal year started. The last month (t = 60) is the last month of the past fiscal year.
(5) Where the parameters specified above are not obtainable, alternate parameters that closely correspond to those above may be used. This may include substituting a bond yield for nominal cost of preferred stock where the former is not available. Where the capital structure does not consist of any debt, preferred equity, or common equity, an alternate methodology to predict the firm's real after-tax marginal cost of capital may be used.
Example of using alternate parameters that closely correspond to those above are:
(A) In the case of industrials, who do not typically issue preferred stock, the predicted nominal cost of preferred stock (R
P
) can be estimated by determining the current average yield on newly issued industrial bonds which have the same rating as the firm's most recent debt issue.
(B) If necessary, the following assumptions can be made to determine the nominal cost of debt or preferred stock and their flotation costs.
(i) Where a company issued privately placed debt that was not rated, the rating, applied to preferred stock could be used to
determine the cost of debt and its flotation cost.
(ii) Where a company issued privately placed preferred stock that was not rated, the rating applied to debt could be used to determine the cost of preferred stock and its flotation costs.
(iii) In the case where all issues were privately placed, the current average yield on all newly issued debt or preferred could be used to determine the cost of debt or preferred respectively, and an average flotation cost, for debt or preferred, could be used.
(C)
Evidence Requirements.
Copies of this calculation with notations as to the source of the data must be submitted.

# Appendix II to Part 504—Fuel Price Computation
(a)
Introduction.
This appendix provides the equations and parameters needed to specify the price of the delivered fuels to be used in the cost calculations associated with parts 503 and 504 of these regulations. The delivered price of the fuel to be used to calculate delivered fuel expenses must reflect (1) the price of each fuel at the time of the petition, and (2) the effects of future real price increases for each fuel. The delivered price of an alternate fuel used to calculate delivered fuel expenses must reflect the petitioner's delivered price of the alternate fuel and the effects of real increases in the price of that alternate fuel. Paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) below provide the procedure to: (1) Calculate fuel price and inflation indices; (2) account for projected real increases in fuel prices when planning to burn one or more than one fuel; and (3) account for projected real increases in the price of the alternate fuel. Table II-1 of this appendix (See paragraph (b)) contains example fuel price and inflation indices based on the latest data appearing in the Energy Information Administration's (EIA)
Annual Energy Outlook
(AEO).
The fuel price and inflation indices will change yearly with the publication of the
AEO.
Revisions shall become effective after final publication. However, the relevant set of parameters for a specific petition for exemption will be the set in effect at the time the petition is submitted or the set in effect at the time a decision is rendered, whichever is more favorable to the petitioner.
(b)
Computation of Fuel Price and Inflation Indices.
(1) the Petitioner is responsible for computing the annual fuel price and inflation indices by using Equation II-1 and Equation II-2, respectively. The petitioner may compute the fuel price index specified in Equation II-1 or use his own price index. However, if he uses his own price index, the source or the derivation of the index must be fully documented and be contained in the evidential summary.
EQ II-2 is:
EC01OC91.007
where:
PXV
i
= The fuel price index for each fuel in year i. P
i
= Price of fuel in year i.
P
o
= Price of fuel in base year.
EQ II-2 is:
EC01OC91.008
where:
IX
i
= The inflation index in year i.
GX
i
= The NIPA GNP price deflator for year i.
GX
o
= The NIPA GNP price deflator for the base year.
(2) The parameters to be used in EQ II-1 are the Base Case fuel price projections found in EIA's current
AEO.
(3) When computing annual inflation indices, the petitioner is to use the Base Case National Macroeconomic Indicators (NIPA GNP Price Deflator) contained in EIA's current
AEO.
If necessary, the petitioner must rebase the projection to the same year used for the fuel price projections. For example, in 1989
AEO
projects the price deflator in 1982 dollars; this must be rebased to the year in which the petition is filed. The methodology used to rebase the inflation indices must follow standard statistical procedures and must be fully documented within the petition. This index will remain frozen at the last year of the
AEO
's projection for the remainder of the unit'(s) useful life.
(4) Table II-1 is provided as an example of the application of equations II-1 and II-2. This table contains annual fuel price indices
for distillate oil, residual oil, natural gas, and coal. It also contains annual inflation indices. These values were computed from information contained in Table A3 and Table A11 of EIA's
AEO, 1989.

(C)
Fuel Price Computation.
(1) The delivered price of the proposed fuel to be burned (FPB
i
) must reflect the real escalation rate of the proposed fuel, and must be computed with Equation EQ II-3.
EQ-II-3 is: FPB
i
= MPB [PX
i
]
where:
FPB
i
= Price of the proposed fuel (distillate oil, residual oil, or natural gas) in year i.
MPB = The current delivered market price of the proposed fuel.
PX
i
= The fuel price index value in year i, computed with Equation II-1.
or:
(2) When planning to use more than one fuel in the proposed unit(s), the petitioner must use Equation II-1 and Equation II-3 to calculate the annual fuel price of each fuel to be used. The petitioner then must estimate the proportion of each fuel to be burned annually over the useful life of the unit(s). With these proportions and the respective annual fuel prices for each fuel, the petitioner must compute an annual weighted average fuel price. The methodology used to calculate the weighted average fuel price must follow standard statistical procedures and be fully documented within the petition.
(d)
Fuel Price Computation—Alternate Fuel.
The delivered price of alternate fuel (PFA
i
) must reflect the real escalation rate of alternate fuel and must be computed with Equation II-4.
Equation II-4 is:
PFA
i
= APF × apx
i
where:
PFA = The price of the alternate fuel in year i.
APF
−i
= The current market price of the alternate fuel f.o.b. the facility).
APX
i
= The alternate fuel price index value for year i, computed with Equation II-1.
In most cases the alternate fuel will be coal. The petitioner must use Equation II-1 (paragraph (b)) to compute the escalation rate (APX
i
). If an alternate fuel other than coal is proposed the source or the derivation of the index must be fully documented and be contained in the evidential summary.

(c) After written notice to FE and service upon the parties of that notice an applicant may withdraw an application. Such withdrawal shall be effective thirty (30) days after notice to FE if the Assistant Secretary does not issue an order to the contrary within that time period.
§ 590.205
Notice of applications.
(a) Upon receipt of an application, the FE shall publish a notice of application in the
Federal Register.
The notice shall summarize the proposal. Except in emergency circumstances, generally the notice shall provide a time limit of not less than thirty (30) days from the notice's date of publication in the
Federal Register
for persons to file protests, comments, or a motion to intervene or notice of intervention, as applicable. The notice may also request comments on specific issues or matters of fact, law, or policy raised by the application.
(b) The notice of application shall advise the parties of their right to request additional procedures, including the opportunity to file written comments and to request that a conference, oral presentation, or trial-type hearing be convened. Failure to request additional procedures at this time shall be deemed a waiver of any right to additional procedures should the Assistant Secretary decide to grant the application and authorize the import or export by issuing a final opinion and order in accordance with § 590.316.
(c) Where negotiations between the DOE, including FE, and a foreign government have resulted in a formal policy agreement or statement affecting a particular import or export proceeding, FE shall include in the notice of application a description of the terms or policy positions of that agreement or statement to the extent they apply to the proceeding, and invite comment. A formal policy agreement or statement affecting a particular import or export proceeding that is arrived at after publication of the notice of application shall be placed on the record in that proceeding and the parties given an opportunity to comment thereon.
§ 590.206
Notice of procedures.
In all proceedings where, following a notice of application and the time specified in the notice for the filing of responses thereto, the Assistant Secretary determines to have additional procedures, which may consist of the filing of supplemental written comments, written interrogatories or other discovery procedures, a conference, oral presentation, or trial-type hearing, the Assistant Secretary shall provide the parties with notice of the procedures the Assistant Secretary has determined to follow in the proceeding and advise the parties of their right to request any additional procedures in accordance with the provisions of § 590.310. The notice of procedures may
identify and request comments on specific issues of fact, law, or policy relevant to the proceeding and may establish a time limit for requesting additional procedures.
§ 590.207
Filing fees.
A non-refundable filing fee of fifty dollars ($50) shall accompany each application filed under § 590.201. Checks shall be made payable to “Treasury of the United States.”
§ 590.208
Small volume exports.
(a)
Small-scale natural gas exports.
Small-scale natural gas exports are deemed to be consistent with the public interest under section 3(a) of the Natural Gas Act, 15 U.S.C. 717b(a). DOE will issue an export authorization upon receipt of any complete application to conduct small-scale natural gas exports. DOE's regulations regarding notice of applications, 10 CFR 590.205, and procedures applicable to application proceedings, 10 CFR part 590, subpart C (10 CFR 590.303 to 10 CFR 590.317), are not applicable to small-scale natural gas exports.
(b)
Scientific, experimental, or other non-utility natural gas exports.
Any person may export up to 100,000 cubic feet of natural gas (14.73 pounds per square inch at 60 degrees Fahrenheit) or the liquefied or compressed equivalent thereof, in a single shipment for scientific, experimental, or other non-utility gas use without prior authorization of the Assistant Secretary.
[83 FR 35119, July 25, 2018]
§ 590.209
Exchanges by displacement.
Any importer of natural gas may enter into an exchange by displacement agreement without the prior authorization of the Assistant Secretary when the net effect of the exchange is no different than under the importer's existing authorization. An exchange by displacement is an arrangement whereby authorized imported volumes are displaced by other gas for purposes of storage or flexibility. The term of the exchange agreement may not exceed five (5) years, the volumes imported may not exceed the importer's existing import authorization, and no actual natural gas may flow across the United States border under the terms of the exchange agreement. Any importer who enters into an exchange agreement pursuant to this section shall file with FE within fifteen (15) days after the start up of the exchange, a written description of the transaction, the exact volume of natural gas to be displaced, the name of the purchaser, and the import authorization under which the exchange is being carried out.

# Subpart C—Procedures
§ 590.301
General.

§ 590.302
Motions and answers.
(a) Motions for any procedural or interlocutory ruling shall set forth the ruling or relief requested and state the grounds and the statutory or other authority relied upon. All written motions shall comply with the filing requirements of § 590.103. Motions made during conferences, oral presentations or trial-type hearings may be stated orally upon the record, unless the Assistant Secretary or the presiding official determines otherwise.
(b) Any party may file an answer to any written motion within fifteen (15) days after the motion is filed, unless another period of time is established by the Assistant Secretary or the presiding official. Answers shall be in writing and shall detail each material allegation of the motion being answered. Answers shall state clearly and concisely the facts and legal authorities relied upon.
(c) Any motion, except for motions seeking intervention or requesting that a conference, oral presentation or trial-type hearing be held, shall be deemed to have been denied, unless the Assistant Secretary or presiding official acts within thirty (30) days after the motion is filed.
§ 590.303
Interventions and answers.
(a) A state commission may intervene in a proceeding under this part as a matter of right and become a party to the proceeding by filing a notice of intervention no later than the date fixed for filing motions to intervene in the applicable FE notice or order. If the period for filing the notice has expired, a state commission may be permitted to intervene by complying with the filing and other requirements applicable to any other person seeking to become a party to the proceeding as provided in this section.
(b) Any other person who seeks to become a party to a proceeding shall file a motion to intervene, which sets out clearly and concisely the facts upon which the petitioner's claim of interest is based.
(c) A motion to intervene shall state, to the extent known, the position taken by the movant and the factual and legal basis for such positions in order to advise the parties and the Assistant Secretary as to the specific issues of policy, fact, or law to be raised or controverted.
(d) Motions to intervene may be filed at any time following the filing of an application, but no later than the date fixed for filing such motions or notices in the applicable FE notice or order, unless a later date is permitted by the Assistant Secretary for good cause shown and after considering the impact of granting the late motion of the proceeding. Each motion or notice shall list the names, titles, and mailing addresses of a maximum of two persons for the official service list.
(e) Any party may file an answer to a motion to intervene, but such answer shall be made within fifteen (15) days after the motion to intervene was filed, unless a later date is permitted by the Assistant Secretary for good cause shown. Answers shall be in writing. Answers shall detail each material allegation of the motion to intervene being answered and state clearly and concisely the facts and legal authorities relied upon. Failure to answer is deemed a waiver of any objection to the intervention. This paragraph does not prevent the Assistant Secretary from ruling on a motion to intervene and issuing a final opinion and order in accordance with § 590.316 prior to the expiration of the fifteen (15) days in which a party has to answer a motion to intervene.
(f) If an answer in opposition to a motion to intervene is timely filed or if the motion to intervene is not timely filed, then the movant becomes a party only after the motion to intervene is expressly granted.
(g) If no answer in opposition to a motion to intervene is filed within the period of time prescribed in paragraph (e) of this section, the motion to intervene shall be deemed to be granted, unless the Assistant Secretary denies the motion in whole or in part or otherwise limits the intervention prior to the expiration of the time allowed in paragraph (e) for filing an answer to the motion to intervene. Where the motion to intervene is deemed granted, the participation of the intervenor shall be limited to matters affecting asserted rights and interests specifically set forth in the motion to intervene, and the admission of such intervenor to party status shall not be construed as recognition by FE that the intervenor might be aggrieved because of any order issued.
(h) In the event that a motion for late intervention is granted, an intervenor shall accept the record of the proceeding as it was developed prior to the intervention.
§ 590.304
Protests and answers.
(a) Any person objecting to an application filed under § 590.201 of this part or to any action taken by FE under this part may file a protest. No particular form is required. The protest shall identify the person filing the protest, the application or action being objected to, and provide a concise statement of the reasons for the protest.
(b) The filing of a protest, without also filing a motion to intervene or a notice of intervention, shall not make the person filing the protest a party to the proceeding.
(c) A protest shall be made part of the official FE docket file in the proceeding and shall be considered as a statement of position of the person filing the protest, but not as establishing
the validity of any assertion upon which the decision would be based.
(d) Protests shall be served on the applicant and all parties by the person filing the protest. If the person filing the protest is unable to provide service on any person identified as a party to the proceeding after a good faith effort, then FE shall effect service. However, when the parties are not known, service requirements may be met by serving a copy on the applicant and on FE as provided in § 590.107(b).
(e) Protests may be filed at any time following the filing of an application, but no later than the date fixed for filing protests in the applicable FE notice or order, unless a later date is permitted by the Assistant Secretary for good cause shown.
(f) Any party may file an answer to a protest but such answer must be filed within fifteen (15) days after the protest was filed, unless a later date is permitted by the Assistant Secretary for good cause shown.

Subpoenas.
(a) Subpoenas for the attendance of witnesses at a trial-type hearing or for the production of documentary evidence may be issued upon the initiative of the Assistant Secretary or presiding official, or upon written motion of a party or oral motion of a party during a conference, oral presentation, or trial-type hearing, if the Assistant Secretary or presiding official determines that the evidence sought is relevant and material.

(c) If service of a subpoena is made by a United States Marshal or a Deputy United States Marshal, service shall be evidenced by their return. If made by another person, that person shall affirm that service has occurred and file an affidavit to that effect with the original subpoena. A witness who is subpoenaed shall be entitled to witness fees as provided in § 590.315(c).
§ 590.307
Depositions.
(a) Upon motion filed by a party, the Assistant Secretary or presiding official may authorize the taking of testimony of any witness by deposition. Unless otherwise directed in the authorization issued, a witness being deposed may be examined regarding any matter which is relevant to the issues involved in the pending proceeding.
(b) Parties authorized to take a deposition shall provide written notice to the witness and all other parties at least ten (10) days in advance of the deposition unless such advance notice is waived by mutual agreement of the parties.
(c) The requesting motion and notice shall state the name and mailing address of the witness, delineate the subject matters on which the witness is expected to testify, state the reason why the deposition should be taken, indicate the time and place of the deposition, and provide the name and mailing address of the person taking the deposition.
(d) A witness whose testimony is taken by deposition shall be sworn in or shall affirm concerning the matter about which the witness has been called to testify before any questions are asked or testimony given. A witness deposed shall be entitled to witness fees as provided in § 590.315(c).
(e) The moving party shall file the entire deposition with FE after it has been subscribed and certified. No portion of the deposition shall constitute a part of the record in the proceedings unless received in evidence, in whole or
in part, by the Assistant Secretary or presiding official.
§ 590.308
Admissions of facts.
(a) At any time prior to the end of a trial-type hearing, or, if there is no trial-type hearing, prior to the issuance of a final opinion and order under § 590.404, any party, the Assistant Secretary, or the presiding official may serve on any party a written request for admission of the truth of any matters at issue in the proceeding that relate to statements or opinions of fact or of the application of law to fact.
(b) A matter shall be considered admitted and conclusively established for the purposes of any proceeding in which a request for admission is served unless, within fifteen (15) days of such time limit established by the Assistant Secretary or presiding official, the party to whom the request is directed answers or objects to the request. Any answer shall specifically admit or deny the matter, or set forth in detail the reasons why the answering party cannot truthfully admit or deny the matter. An answering party may not give lack of information or knowledge as a reason for failure to admit or deny, unless the answering party states that, after reasonable inquiry, the answering party has been unable to obtain sufficient information to admit or deny. If an objection is made, the answering party shall state the reasons for the objection.
(c) If the Assistant Secretary or presiding official determines that an answer to a request for admission does not comply with the requirements of this section, the Assistant Secretary or presiding official may order either that the matter is admitted or that an amended answer be served.
(d) A copy of all requests for admission and answers thereto shall be filed with FE in accordance with § 590.103. Copies of any documents referenced in the request shall be served with the request unless they are known to be in the possession of the other parties.
(e) The Assistant Secretary or presiding official may limit the number of requests for admission of facts in order to expedite a proceeding through elimination of duplicative requests.
§ 590.309
Settlements.
The parties may conduct settlement negotiations. If settlement negotiations are conducted during a conference, at the request of one of the parties, the Assistant Secretary or presiding official may order that the discussions be off-the-record with no transcript of such settlement negotiations being prepared for inclusion in the official record of the proceeding. No offer of settlement, comment or discussion by the parties with respect to an offer of settlement shall be subject to discovery or admissible into evidence against any parties who object to its admission.
§ 590.310
Opportunity for additional procedures.
Any party may file a motion requesting additional procedures, including the opportunity to file written comments, request written interrogatories or other discovery procedures, or request that a conference, oral presentation or trial-type hearing be held. The motion shall describe what type of procedure is requested and include the information required by §§ 590.311, 590.312 and 590.313, as appropriate. Failure to request additional procedures within the time specified in the notice of application or in the notice of procedure, if applicable, shall constitute a waiver of that right unless the Assistant Secretary for good cause shown grants additional time for requesting additional procedures. If no time limit is specified in the notice or order, additional procedures may be requested at any time prior to the issuance of a final opinion and order. At any time during a proceeding, the Assistant Secretary or presiding official may on his or her own initiative determine to provide additional procedures.

§ 590.311
Conferences.
(a) Upon motion by a party, a conference of the parties may be convened to adjust or settle the proceedings, set schedules, delineate issues, stipulate certain issues of fact or law, set procedures, and consider other relevant matters where it appears that a conference

The party may submit material supporting the existence of substantial issues.

The motion shall identify the factual issues in dispute and the evidence that will be presented. The party must demonstrate that the issues are genuinely in dispute, relevant and material to the decision and that a trial-type hearing is necessary for a full and true disclosure of the facts. The Assistant Secretary or presiding official shall grant a party's motion for a trial-type hearing, if the Assistant Secretary or presiding official determines that there is a relevant and material factual issue genuinely in dispute and that a trial-type hearing is necessary for a full and true disclosure of the facts.
(b) In trial-type hearings, the parties shall have the right to be represented by counsel, to request discovery, to present the direct and rebuttal testimony of witnesses, to cross-examine witnesses under oath, and to present documentary evidence.
(c) The Assistant Secretary or presiding official upon his or her own initiative or upon the motion of any party may consolidate any proceedings involving common questions of fact in whole or in part for a trial-type hearing. The Assistant Secretary or presiding official may also place appropriate limitations on the number of intervenors who may participate if two or more intervenors have substantially like interests.
(d) The Assistant Secretary or presiding official may make such rulings for trial-type hearings, including delineation of the issues and limitation of cross-examination of a witness, as are
necessary to obtain a full and true disclosure of the facts and to limit irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence.

§ 590.316
Shortened proceedings.
In any proceeding where, in response to a notice of application or notice of procedures, if applicable, no party files a motion requesting additional procedures, including the right to file written comments, or the holding of a conference, oral presentation, or trial-type hearing, or where the Assistant Secretary determines that such requested additional procedures are not required pursuant to §§ 590.310, 590.311, 590.312 and 590.313, the Assistant Secretary may issue a final opinion and order on the basis of the official record, including the application and all other filings. In any proceeding in which the Assistant Secretary intends to deny the application or grant the application with the attachment of material conditions unknown to, or likely to be opposed by, the applicant, solely on the basis of the application and responses to the notice of application or notice of procedures, if applicable, without additional procedures, the Assistant Secretary shall advise the parties in writing generally of the issues of concern to the Assistant Secretary upon which the denial or material conditions would be based and provide them with an opportunity to request additional procedures pursuant to §§ 590.310, 590.311, 590.312 and 590.313.
§ 590.317
Complaints.

(b) A complaint concerning an existing import or export authorization shall be served on all parties to the original import or export authorization proceeding either by the complainant or by FE if the complainant has made a good faith effort but has been unable to effect service.
(c) The Assistant Secretary may issue an order to show cause under § 590.401, or may provide opportunity for additional procedures pursuant to §§ 590.310, 590.311, 590.312, or § 590.313, in order to determine what action should be taken in response to the complaint.

A proceeding under this part may commence upon the initiative of the Assistant Secretary or in response to an application by any person requesting FE action against any other person alleged to be in contravention or violation of any authorization, statute, rule, order, or law administered by FE applicable to the import or export of natural gas, or for any other alleged wrong involving importation or exportation of natural gas over which FE has jurisdiction. Any show cause order issued shall identify the matters of interest or the matters complained of that the Assistant Secretary is inquiring about, and shall be deemed to be tentative and for the purpose of framing issues for consideration and decision. The respondent named in the order shall respond orally or in writing, or both, as required by the order. A show cause order is not a final opinion and order.
§ 590.402
Conditional orders.
The Assistant Secretary may issue a conditional order at any time during a proceeding prior to issuance of a final opinion and order. The conditional order shall include the basis for not issuing a final opinion and order at that time and a statement of findings and conclusions.

§ 590.403
Emergency interim orders.
Where consistent with the public interest, the Assistant Secretary may waive further procedures and issue an emergency interim order authorizing the import or export of natural gas.

The Assistant Secretary may attach necessary or appropriate terms and conditions to the emergency interim order to ensure that the authorized action will be consistent with the public interest.
§ 590.404
Final opinions and orders.
The Assistant Secretary shall issue a final opinion and order and attach such conditions thereto as may be required by the public interest after completion and review of the record.

§ 590.405
Transferability.
Authorizations by the Assistant Secretary to import or export natural gas shall not be transferable or assignable, unless specifically authorized by the Assistant Secretary.
§ 590.406
Compliance with orders.
Any person required or authorized to take any action by a final opinion and order of the Assistant Secretary shall file with FE, within thirty (30) days after the requirement or authorization becomes effective, a notice, under oath,

§ 590.407
Reports of changes.
Any person authorized to import or export natural gas has a continuing obligation to give the Assistant Secretary written notification, as soon as practicable, of any prospective or actual changes to the information submitted during the application process upon which the authorization was based, including, but not limited to, changes to: The parties involved in the import or export arrangement, the terms and conditions of any applicable contracts, the place of entry or exit, the transporters, the volumes accepted or offered, or the import or export price. Any notification filed under this section shall contain the FE docket number(s) to which it relates. Compliance with this section does not relieve an importer or exporter from responsibility to file the appropriate application to amend a previous import or export authorization under this part whenever such changes are contrary to or otherwise not permitted by the existing authorization.

# Subpart E—Applications for Rehearing
§ 590.501
Filing.

If an order is sought to be vacated, reversed, or modified by reason of matters that have arisen since the issuance of the final opinion and order, conditional order, or emergency interim order, the matters relied upon shall be set forth with specificity in the application. The application shall also comply with the filing requirements of § 590.103.
§ 590.502
Application is not a stay.
The filing of an application for rehearing does not operate as a stay of the Assistant Secretary's order, unless specifically ordered by the Assistant Secretary.
§ 590.503
Opinion and order on rehearing.
Upon application for rehearing, the Assistant Secretary may grant or deny rehearing or may abrogate or modify the final opinion and order, conditional order, or emergency interim order with or without further proceedings.
§ 590.504
Denial by operation of law.
Unless the Assistant Secretary acts upon the application for rehearing within thirty (30) days after it is filed, it is deemed to be denied. Such denial shall constitute final agency action for the purpose of judicial review.
§ 590.505
Answers to applications for rehearing.
No answers to applications for rehearing shall be entertained. Prior to the issuance of any final opinion and order on rehearing, however, the Assistant Secretary may afford the parties an opportunity to file briefs or answers and may order that a conference, oral presentation, or trial-type hearing be held on some or all of the issues presented by an application for rehearing.

§ 600.4
Deviations.
(a)
General.
(1) A deviation is the use of any policy, procedure, form, standard, term, or condition which varies from a requirement of this part, or the waiver of any such requirement, unless such use or waiver is authorized or precluded by Federal statute. The use of optional or discretionary provisions of this part, including special restrictive conditions used in accordance with §§ 600.114, 600.212, and 600.304 are not deviations. Awards to foreign entities
and the waiver of the cost sharing requirements in § 600.30 are not subject to this section.
(2) A single-case deviation is a deviation which applies to one financial assistance transaction and one applicant, recipient, or subrecipient only.
(3) A class deviation is a deviation which applies to more than one financial assistance transaction, applicant, recipient, or subrecipient.
(b) The DOE officials specified in paragraph (c) of this section may authorize a deviation only upon a written determination that the deviation is—
(1) Necessary to achieve program objectives;
(2) Necessary to conserve public funds;
(3) Otherwise essential to the public interest; or
(4) Necessary to achieve equity.
(c)
Approval procedures.
(1) A deviation request must be in writing and must be submitted to the responsible DOE Contracting Officer. An applicant for a subaward or a subrecipient shall submit any such request through the recipient.
(2) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section—
(i) A single-case deviation may be authorized by the responsible HCA.
(ii) A class deviation may be authorized by the Director, Procurement and Assistance Management or designee.
(3) Whenever the approval of OMB, other Federal agency, or other DOE office is required to authorize a deviation, the proposed deviation must be submitted to the Director, Procurement and Assistance Management or designee for concurrence prior to submission to the authorizing official.
(d)
Notice.
Whenever a request for a class deviation is approved, DOE shall publish a notice in the
Federal Register
at least 15 days before the class deviation becomes effective. Whenever a class deviation is contained in a proposed program rule, the preamble to the proposed rule shall describe the purpose and scope of the deviation.
(e)
Subawards.
A recipient may use a deviation in a subaward only with the prior written approval of a DOE Contracting Officer.
[61 FR 7166, Feb. 26, 1996, as amended at 64 FR 56420, Oct. 20, 1999; 68 FR 50650, Aug. 21, 2003; 74 FR 44275, Aug. 28, 2009]
§ 600.5
Selection of award instrument.
(a) If DOE has administrative discretion in the selection of the award instrument, the DOE decision as to whether the relationship is principally one of procurement or financial assistance shall be made pursuant to the Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act as codified at 31 U.S.C. 6301-6306. A grant or cooperative agreement shall be the appropriate instrument, in accordance with this part, when the principal purpose of the relationship is the transfer of money or property to accomplish a public purpose of support or stimulation authorized by Federal statute. In selecting the type of financial assistance instrument, DOE shall limit involvement between itself and the recipient in the performance of a project to the minimum necessary to achieve DOE program objectives.
(b) When it is anticipated that substantial involvement will be necessary between DOE and the recipient during performance of the contemplated activity, the award instrument shall be a cooperative agreement rather than a grant. Every cooperative agreement shall explicitly state the substantial involvement anticipated between DOE and the recipient during the performance of the project. Substantial involvement exists if:
(1) Responsibility for the management, control, or direction of the project is shared by DOE and the recipient; or
(2) Responsibility for the performance of the project is shared by DOE and the recipient.
(c) Providing technical assistance or guidance of a programmatic nature to a recipient does not constitute substantial involvement if:
(1) the recipient is not required to follow such guidance;
(2) the technical assistance or guidance is not expected to result in continuing DOE involvement in the performance of the project; or
(3) The technical assistance or guidance pertains solely to the administrative requirements of the award.
(d) In cooperative agreements, DOE has the right to intervene in the conduct or performance of project activities for programmatic reasons. Intervention includes the interruption or modification of the conduct or performance of project activities. Suspension or termination of the cooperative agreement under §§ 600.162, 600.243 and 600.352 does not constitute intervention in the conduct or performance of project activities.
[61 FR 7166, Feb. 26, 1996, as amended at 74 FR 44275, Aug. 28, 2009]
§ 600.6
Eligibility.
(a)
General.
DOE shall solicit applications for financial assistance in a manner which provides for the maximum amount of competition feasible.
(b)
Restricted eligibility.
If DOE restricts eligibility, an explanation of why the restriction of eligibility is considered necessary shall be included in the funding opportunity announcement, program rule, or published notice.
(1) If the aggregate amount of DOE funds available for award under a funding opportunity announcement or published notice is $1million or more, unless authorized by statute or program rule, such restriction of eligibility shall be:
(i) Supported by a written determination initiated by the program office;
(ii) Concurred in by legal counsel and the Contracting Officer; and
(iii) Approved by an official no less than one level below the responsible program Assistant Secretary, Deputy Administrator, or other official of equivalent authority.
(2) Where the amount of DOE funds is less than $1 million, the cognizant HCA and the Contracting Officer may approve the determination.
(c)
Noncompetitive financial assistance.
DOE may award a grant or cooperative agreement or technology investment agreement on a noncompetitive basis only if the application satisfies one or more of the follow selection criteria:.
(1) The activity to be funded is necessary to the satisfactory completion of, or is a continuation or renewal of, an activity presently being funded by DOE or another Federal agency, and for which competition for support would have a significant adverse effect on continuity or completion of the activity.
(2) The activity is being or would be conducted by the applicant using its own resources or those donated or provided by third parties; however, DOE support of that activity would enhance the public benefits to be derived and DOE knows of no other entity which is conducting or is planning to conduct such an activity.
(3) The applicant is a unit of government and the activity to be supported is related to performance of a governmental function within the subject jurisdiction, thereby precluding DOE provision of support to another entity.
(4) The applicant has exclusive domestic capability to perform the activity successfully, based upon unique equipment, proprietary data, technical expertise, or other such unique qualifications.
(5) The award implements an agreement between the United States Government and a foreign government to fund a foreign applicant.
(6) Time constraints associated with a public health, safety, welfare or national security requirement preclude competition.
(7) The proposed project was submitted as an unsolicited proposal and represents a unique or innovative idea, method, or approach that would not be eligible for financial assistance under a recent, current, or planned funding opportunity announcement, and if, as determined by DOE, a competitive funding opportunity announcement would not be appropriate.
(8) The responsible program Assistant Secretary, Deputy Administrator, or other official of equivalent authority determines that a noncompetitive award is in the public interest. This authority may not be delegated.
(d)
Approval requirements.
(1) Where the amount of DOE funds is $1 million or greater, determinations of noncompetitive awards shall be:
(i) Documented in writing;
(ii) Concurred in by the responsible program technical official and local legal counsel; and
(iii) Approved, prior to award, by the responsible program Assistant Secretary, Deputy Administrator, or official of equivalent authority and the Contracting Officer. The approval authority may be delegated to one organizational level below the Assistant Secretary, Deputy Administrator, or official of equivalent authority.
(2) Where the amount of DOE funds is less than $1 million, determinations of noncompetitive awards shall be:
(i) Documented in writing;
(ii) Concurred in by local legal counsel, unless for a particular award or class of awards of $1 million or less, review is waived by legal counsel; and
(iii) Approved by the cognizant HCA and the Contracting Officer.
[74 FR 44275, Aug. 28, 2009, as amended at 74 FR 48850, Sept. 25, 2009]
§ 600.7
Small and disadvantaged and women-owned business participation.
(a) DOE encourages the participation in financial assistance awards of small businesses, including those owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals and women, of historically black colleges, and of colleges and universities with substantial minority enrollments.
(b) For definitions of the terms in paragraph (a) of this section, see the Higher Education Act of 1965, and 15 U.S.C. 644, as amended by the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act (FASA), and implementing regulations under FASA issued by the Office of Federal Procurement Policy.
(c) When entering into contracts under financial assistance awards, recipients and subrecipients shall comply with the requirements of §§ 600.144, 600.236 and 600.331, as applicable.
[61 FR 7166, Feb. 26, 1996, as amended at 74 FR 44276, Aug. 28, 2009]
§ 600.8
Funding Opportunity Announcement.
(a)
General.
Funding Opportunity Announcements (FOA) include any issuance used to announce funding opportunities that would result in the award of a discretionary grant, cooperative agreement, or technology investment agreement, whether it is called a program announcement, program notice, solicitation, broad agency announcement, research announcement, notice of program interest, or something else.
(1) A Program Assistant Secretary (or official of equivalent authority) may annually issue a program notice describing research areas in which financial assistance is being made available. Such notice shall also state whether the research areas covered by the notice are to be added to those listed in a previously issued program rule. If they are to be included, then applications received as a result of the notice may be treated as having been in response to that previously published program rule. If they are not to be included, then applications received in response to the notice are to be treated as unsolicited applications. FOAs may be issued by a DOE Contracting Officer or program office with prior concurrence of the contracting office.
(2) DOE must post synopses of its FOAs and modifications to the announcements at the Grants.gov Internet site, using the standard data elements/format, except for:
(i) Announcements of funding opportunities for awards less than $25,000 for which 100 percent of eligible applicants live outside of the United States.
(ii) Single source announcements of funding opportunities which are specifically directed to a known recipient.
(b)
Subawards.
In accordance with the provisions of the applicable statute and program rules, if a DOE financial assistance program involves the award of financial assistance by a recipient to a subrecipient, the recipient shall provide sufficient advance notice so that potential subrecipients may prepare timely applications and secure prerequisite reviews and approvals.
(c)
Announcement format.
DOE must use the government-wide standard format to publish program announcements of funding opportunities.
[61 FR 7166, Feb. 26, 1996, as amended at 69 FR 7867, Feb. 20, 2004; 70 FR 69254, Nov. 15, 2005; 74 FR 44276, Aug. 28, 2009]

§ 600.10
Form and content of applications.
(a)
General.
Applications shall be required for all financial assistance projects or programs.
(b)
Forms.
Applications shall be on the form specified in a program rule, the program announcement, or these regulations. (See also §§ 600.112 and 600.210.)

[61 FR 7166, Feb. 26, 1996, as amended at 64 FR 56420, Oct. 20, 1999; 69 FR 7867, Feb. 20, 2004; 74 FR 44276, Aug. 28, 2009]
§§ 600.11-600.12
[Reserved]
§ 600.13
Merit review.
(a) It is the policy of DOE that discretionary financial assistance be awarded through a merit-based selection process. A merit review means a thorough, consistent, and objective examination of applications based on pre-established criteria by persons who are independent of those submitting the applications and who are knowledgeable in the field of endeavor for which support is requested.
(b) Each program office must establish a merit review system covering the financial assistance programs it administers. Merit review of financial assistance applications is intended to be advisory and is not intended to replace the authority of the project/program official with responsibility for deciding whether an award will be made.

§ 600.14
[Reserved]
§ 600.15
Authorized uses of information.
(a)
General.
Information contained in applications shall be used only for evaluation purposes unless such information is generally available to the public or is already the property of the Government. The Trade Secrets Act, 18 U.S.C. 1905, prohibits the unauthorized disclosure by Federal employees of trade secret and confidential business information.
(b)
Treatment of application information.
(1) An application or other document, including any unsolicited information, may include technical data and other data, including trade secrets and commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential, which the applicant does not want disclosed to the public or used by the Government for any purpose other than application evaluation.
(i) To protect such data, the submitter must mark the cover sheet of the application or other document with the following Notice:

# Notice of Restriction on Disclosure and Use of Data
Pages [____] of this document may contain trade secrets or commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential and is exempt from public disclosure. Such information shall be used or disclosed only for evaluation purposes or in accordance with a financial assistance or loan agreement between the submitter and the Government. The Government may use or disclose any information that is not appropriately marked or otherwise restricted, regardless of source.
(ii)(A) To further protect such data, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, each page containing trade secrets or commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential must be specifically identified and marked with text similar to the following:
May contain trade secrets or commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential and exempt from public disclosure.
(B) In addition, each line or paragraph containing trade secrets or commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential must be marked with brackets or other clear identification, such as highlighting.
(iii) (A) In the case where a form for data submission is unalterable, such as certain forms submitted through Grants.gov, submitters must include in a cover letter or the project narrative a notice like the following:
Forms [
____] may contain trade secrets or commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential and exempt from public disclosure. Such information shall be used or disclosed only for evaluation purposes or in accordance with a financial assistance or loan agreement between the submitter and the Government. The Government may use or disclose any information that is not appropriately marked or otherwise restricted, regardless of source.
(B) The cover letter or project narrative must also specify the particular information on such forms that the submitter believes contains trade secrets or commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential.
(2) Unless DOE specifies otherwise, DOE shall not refuse to consider an application or other document solely on the basis that the application or other document is restrictively marked in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(3) Data (or abstracts of data) specifically marked in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall be used by DOE or its designated representatives solely for the purpose of evaluating the proposal.

§ 600.31
Research misconduct.
(a) A recipient is responsible for maintaining the integrity of research of any kind under an award from DOE including the prevention, detection, and remediation of research misconduct, and the conduct of inquiries, investigations, and adjudication of allegations of research misconduct in accordance with the requirements of this section.
(b) For purposes of this section, the following definitions are applicable:
Adjudication
means a formal review of a record of investigation of alleged research misconduct to determine whether and what corrective actions and sanctions should be taken.
Fabrication
means making up data or results and recording or reporting them.
Falsification
means manipulating research materials, equipment, or processes, or changing or omitting data or results such that the research is not accurately represented in the research record.
Finding of Research Misconduct
means a determination, based on a preponderance of the evidence, that research misconduct has occurred. Such a finding requires a conclusion that there has been a significant departure from accepted practices of the relevant research community and that it be knowingly, intentionally, or recklessly committed.
Inquiry
means information gathering and initial fact-finding to determine whether an allegation or apparent instance of misconduct warrants an investigation.
Investigation
means the formal examination and evaluation of the relevant facts.
Plagiarism
means the appropriation of another person's ideas, processes, results, or words without giving appropriate credit.
Research
means all basic, applied, and demonstration research in all fields of science, medicine, engineering, and
mathematics, including, but not limited to, research in economics, education, linguistics, medicine, psychology, social sciences statistics, and research involving human subjects or animals.
Research misconduct
means fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism in proposing, performing, or reviewing research, or in reporting research results, but does not include honest error or differences of opinion.
Research record
means the record of all data or results that embody the facts resulting from scientists' inquiries, including, but not limited to, research proposals, laboratory records, both physical and electronic, progress reports, abstracts, theses, oral presentations, internal reports, and journal articles.
(c) Unless otherwise instructed by the Contracting Officer, the recipient must conduct an initial inquiry into any allegation of research misconduct. If the recipient determines that there is sufficient evidence to proceed to an investigation, it must notify the Contracting Officer and, unless otherwise instructed, the recipient must:
(1) Conduct an investigation to develop a complete factual record and an examination of such record leading to either a finding of research misconduct and an identification of appropriate remedies or a determination that no further action is warranted;
(2) Inform the Contracting Officer if an initial inquiry supports an investigation and, if requested by the Contracting Officer thereafter, keep the Contracting Officer informed of the results of the investigation and any subsequent adjudication. When an investigation is complete, the recipient will forward to the Contracting Officer a copy of the evidentiary record, the investigative report, any recommendations made to the recipient's adjudicating official, and the adjudicating official's decision and notification of any corrective action taken or planned, and the subject's written response to the recommendations (if any).
(3) If the investigation leads to a finding of research misconduct, conduct an adjudication by a responsible official who was not involved in the inquiry or investigation and is separated organizationally from the element which conducted the investigation. The adjudication must include a review of the investigative record and, as warranted, a determination of appropriate corrective actions and sanctions.
(d) The Department may elect to act in lieu of the recipient in conducting an inquiry or investigation into an allegation of research misconduct if the Contracting Officer finds that:
(1) The research organization is not prepared to handle the allegation in a manner consistent with this section;
(2) The allegation involves an entity of sufficiently small size that it cannot reasonably conduct the inquiry;
(3) DOE involvement is necessary to ensure the public health, safety, and security, or to prevent harm to the public interest; or,
(4) The allegation involves possible criminal misconduct.
(e) DOE reserves the right to pursue such remedies and other actions as it deems appropriate, consistent with the terms and conditions of the award instrument and applicable laws and regulations. However, the recipient's good faith administration of this section and the effectiveness of its remedial actions and sanctions shall be positive considerations and shall be taken into account as mitigating factors in assessing the need for such actions. If DOE pursues any such action, it will inform the subject of the action of the outcome and any applicable appeal procedures.
(f) In conducting the activities in paragraph (c) of this section, the recipient and the Department, if it elects to conduct the inquiry or investigation, shall adhere to the following guidelines:
(1)
Safeguards for information and subjects of allegations.
The recipient shall provide safeguards to ensure that individuals may bring allegations of research misconduct made in good faith to the attention of the recipient without suffering retribution. Safeguards include: protection against retaliation; fair and objective procedures for examining and resolving allegations; and diligence in protecting positions and reputations. The recipient shall also provide the subjects of allegations confidence that their rights are protected
and that the mere filing of an allegation of research misconduct will not result in an adverse action. Safeguards include timely written notice regarding substantive allegations against them, a description of the allegation and reasonable access to any evidence submitted to support the allegation or developed in response to an allegation and notice of any findings of research misconduct.
(2)
Objectivity and expertise.
The recipient shall select individual(s) to inquire, investigate, and adjudicate allegations of research misconduct who have appropriate expertise and have no unresolved conflict of interest. The individual(s) who conducts an adjudication must not be the same individual(s) who conducted the inquiry or investigation, and must be separate organizationally from the element that conducted the inquiry or investigation.
(3)
Timeliness.
The recipient shall coordinate, inquire, investigate and adjudicate allegations of research misconduct promptly, but thoroughly. Generally, an investigation should be completed within 120 days of initiation, and adjudication should be complete within 60 days of receipt of the record of investigation.
(4)
Confidentiality.
To the extent possible, consistent with fair and thorough processing of allegations of research misconduct and applicable law and regulation, knowledge about the identity of the subjects of allegations and informants should be limited to those with a need to know.
(5)
Remediation and sanction.
If the recipient finds that research misconduct has occurred, it shall assess the seriousness of the misconduct and its impact on the research completed or in process. The recipient must take all necessary corrective actions. Such action may include but are not limited to, correcting the research record and as appropriate imposing restrictions, controls, or other parameters on research in process or to be conducted in the future. The recipient must coordinate remedial actions with the Contracting Officer. The recipient must also consider whether personnel sanctions are appropriate. Any such sanction must be consistent with any applicable personnel laws, policies, and procedures, and must take into account the seriousness of the misconduct and its impact, whether it was done knowingly or intentionally, and whether it was an isolated event or pattern of conduct.
(g) By executing this agreement, the recipient provides its assurance that it has established an administrative process for performing an inquiry, mediating if possible, investigating, and reporting allegations of research misconduct; and that it will comply with its own administrative process and the requirements and definitions of 10 CFR part 733 for performing an inquiry, possible mediation, investigation and reporting of allegations of research misconduct.
(h) The recipient must insert or have inserted the substance of this section, including paragraph (g), in subawards at all tiers that involve research.

For reports prepared on a cash basis, outlays are the sum of cash disbursements for direct charges for goods and services, the amount of indirect expense charged, the value of third party in-kind contributions applied and the amount of cash advances and payments made to subrecipients. For reports prepared on an accrual basis, outlays are the sum of cash disbursements for direct charges for goods and services, the amount of indirect expense incurred, the value of in-kind contributions applied, and the net increase (or decrease) in the amounts owed by the recipient for goods and other property received, for services performed by employees, contractors, subrecipients and other payees and other amounts becoming owed under programs for which no current services or performance are required.
Personal property
means property of any kind except real property. It may be tangible, having physical existence, or intangible, having no physical existence, such as copyrights, patents, or securities.

Program income includes, but is not limited to, income from fees for services performed, the use or rental of real or personal property acquired under federally-funded projects, the sale of commodities or items fabricated under an award, license fees and royalties on patents and copyrights, and interest on loans made with award funds. Interest earned on advances of DOE funds is not program income. Except as otherwise provided in this subpart, program regulations, or the terms and conditions of the award, program income does not include the receipt of principal on loans, rebates, credits, discounts, etc., or interest earned on any of them.
Project costs
means all allowable costs, as set forth in the applicable Federal cost principles, incurred by a recipient and the value of the contributions made by third parties in accomplishing the objectives of the award during the project period.

The term includes public and private institutions of higher education, public and private hospitals, and other quasi-public and private non-profit organizations such as, but not limited to, community action agencies,
research institutes, educational associations, and health centers. The term shall include commercial organizations which are recipients, subrecipients, or contractors or subcontractors of recipients or subrecipients. The term does not include government-owned contractor-operated facilities or research centers providing continued support for mission-oriented, large-scale programs that are government-owned or controlled, or are designated as federally-funded research and development centers.
Research and development
means all research activities, both basic and applied, and all development activities that are supported at universities, colleges, and other non-profit institutions. “Research” is defined as a systematic study directed toward fuller scientific knowledge or understanding of the subject studied. “Development” is the systematic use of knowledge and understanding gained from research directed toward the production of useful materials, devices, systems, or methods, including design and development of prototypes and processes. The term research also includes activities involving the training of individuals in research techniques where such activities utilize the same facilities as other research and development activities and where such activities are not included in the instruction function.
Small award
means a grant or cooperative agreement not exceeding the small purchase threshold fixed at 41 U.S.C. 403(11) (currently $25,000).
Subaward
means an award of financial assistance in the form of money, or property in lieu of money, made under an award by a recipient to an eligible subrecipient or by a subrecipient to a lower tier subrecipient. The term includes financial assistance when provided by any legal agreement, even if the agreement is called a contract, but does not include procurement of goods and services nor does it include any form of assistance which is excluded from the definition of “award” above.
Subrecipient
means the legal entity to which a subaward is made and which is accountable to the recipient for the use of the funds provided. The term may include foreign or international organizations (such as agencies of the United Nations).

Suspension
means an action by DOE that temporarily withdraws DOE sponsorship under an award, pending corrective action by the recipient or pending a decision to terminate the award by the DOE. Suspension of an award is a separate action from suspension under DOE regulations implementing E.O.'s 12549 and 12689, “Debarment and Suspension” (see 10 CFR part 1036).
Termination
means the cancellation of DOE sponsorship, in whole or in part, under an agreement at any time prior to the date of completion.
Third party in-kind contributions
means the value of non-cash contributions provided by non-Federal third parties. Third party in-kind contributions may be in the form of real property, equipment, supplies and other expendable property, and the value of goods and services directly benefiting and specifically identifiable to the project or program.
Unliquidated obligations,
for financial reports prepared on a cash basis, means the amount of obligations incurred by the recipient that have not been paid. For reports prepared on an accrued expenditure basis, they represent the amount of obligations incurred by the recipient for which an outlay has not been recorded.

means a procedure whereby funds are advanced to the recipient to cover its estimated disbursement needs for a given initial period.
§ 600.102
Effect on other issuances.
For awards subject to this subpart, all administrative requirements of codified program regulations, program manuals, handbooks and other nonregulatory materials which are inconsistent with the requirements of this subpart shall be superseded, except to the extent they are required by statute, or authorized in accordance with the deviations provision in § 600.4.
§ 600.103
Deviations.
The deviation provisions of § 600.4 apply to this subpart.
§ 600.104
Subawards.
Unless sections of this subpart specifically exclude subrecipients from coverage, all DOE recipients, including State, local and Indian tribal governments, shall apply the provisions of this subpart to subrecipients performing work under awards if such subrecipients are institutions of higher education, hospitals, or other non-profit organizations organizations. Thus, this subpart is applicable to those types of organizations regardless of the type of recipient receiving the primary award. State and local government subrecipients are subject to the provisions of 10 CFR part 600, subpart C, “Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Cooperative Agreements to State and Local Governments.” For-profit subrecipients are subject to the provisions of 10 CFR part 600, subpart D, Administrative Requirements for Grants and Cooperative Agreements with For-Profit Organizations.

# Pre-Award Requirements
§ 600.110
Purpose.
Sections 600.111 through 600.117 prescribe forms and instructions and other pre-award matters to be used in applying for DOE awards.
§ 600.111
Pre-award policies.
(a)
Use of Grants and Cooperative Agreements, and Contracts.
In each instance, the DOE shall decide on the appropriate award instrument (i.e., grant, cooperative agreement, or contract). The Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act (31 U.S.C. 6301-08) governs the use of grants, cooperative agreements and contracts. A grant or cooperative agreement shall be used only when the principal purpose of a transaction is to accomplish a public purpose of support or stimulation authorized by Federal statute. The statutory criterion for choosing between grants and cooperative agreements is that for the latter, “substantial involvement is expected between the executive agency and the State, local government, or other recipient when carrying out the activity contemplated in the agreement.” Contracts shall be used when the principal purpose is acquisition of property or services for the direct benefit or use of the Federal Government.
(b)
Public Notice and Priority Setting.
DOE will, whenever practical, notify the public of its intended funding priorities for discretionary grant programs, unless funding priorities are established by Federal statute.
§ 600.112
Forms for applying for Federal assistance.
(a)
General.
An application for an award shall be on the form or in the format specified in a program rule or in the funding opportunity announcement. When a version of the Standard Form 424 is not used, DOE shall indicate whether the application is subject to review by the State under Executive Order 12372.
(b)
Budgetary information.
DOE may request and the applicant shall submit the minimum budgetary information necessary to evaluate the costs of the proposed project.
(c) DOE may, subsequent to receipt of an application, request additional information from an applicant when necessary for clarification or to make informed preaward determinations.
(d)
Continuation and renewal applications.
DOE may require that an application for a continuation or renewal award be made in the format or on the
forms authorized by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
[74 FR 44278, Aug. 28, 2009]
§ 600.113
Debarment and suspension.
Recipients shall comply with the nonprocurement debarment and suspension common rule implementing E.O.'s 12549 and 12689, “Debarment and Suspension,” 2 CFR 180 and 901. This common rule restricts subawards and contracts with certain parties that are debarred, suspended or otherwise excluded from or ineligible for participation in Federal assistance programs or activities.
[59 FR 53266, Oct. 21, 1994, as amended at 74 FR 44278, Aug. 28, 2009]
§ 600.114
Special award conditions.
(a) If an applicant or recipient has a history of poor performance, is not financially stable, has a management system that does not meet the standards prescribed in this subpart, has not conformed to the terms and conditions of a previous award, or is not otherwise responsible, DOE may impose additional requirements as needed, without regard to the deviation provisions of § 600.4. Such applicant or recipient will be notified in writing as to the nature of the additional requirements, the reason why the additional requirements are being imposed, the nature of the corrective action needed, and the time allowed for completing the corrective actions. Reconsideration of the additional requirements may be requested at any time. Any special conditions shall be promptly removed once the conditions that prompted them have been corrected.
(b) A recipient may place a special restrictive condition, as specified in paragraph (a) of this section, in a subaward. In any such case, the recipient must notify DOE in writing within 15 days of the subaward. DOE shall decide whether to notify OMB and other interested parties.
§ 600.115
Metric system of measurement.
The Metric Conversion Act, as amended by the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act (15 U.S.C. 205) declares that the metric system is the preferred measurement system for U.S. trade and commerce. The Act requires each Federal agency to establish a date or dates in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, when the metric system of measurement will be used in the agency's procurements, grants, and other business-related activities. Metric implementation may take longer where the use of the system is initially impractical or likely to cause significant inefficiencies in the accomplishment of federally-funded activities. DOE will follow the provisions of E.O. 12770, “Metric Usage in Federal Government Programs.”
§ 600.116
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.
Under the Act (Pub. L. 94-580 codified at 42 U.S.C. 6962), any State agency or agency of a political subdivision of a State which is using appropriated Federal funds must comply with section 6002. Section 6002 requires that preference be given in procurement programs to the purchase of specific products containing recycled materials identified in guidelines developed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (40 CFR parts 247-254). Accordingly, State and local institutions of higher education, hospitals, and non-profit organizations that receive direct Federal awards or other Federal funds shall give preference in their procurement programs funded with Federal funds to the purchase of recycled products pursuant to the EPA guidelines.
§ 600.117
[Reserved]

# Post-Award Requirements

# Financial and Program Management
§ 600.120
Purpose of financial and program management.
Sections 600.121 through 600.128 prescribe standards for financial management systems, methods for making payments and rules for satisfying cost sharing and matching requirements, accounting for program income, budget revision approvals, making audits, determining allowability of cost, and establishing fund availability.
§ 600.121
Standards for financial management systems.
(a) Recipients shall relate financial data to performance data and develop unit cost information whenever practical. For awards that support research, it should be noted that it is generally not appropriate to develop unit cost information.
(b) Except for the provisions of 600.121(f) and 600.181, recipients' financial management systems shall provide for the following:
(1) Accurate, current and complete disclosure of the financial results of each federally-sponsored project or program in accordance with the reporting requirements set forth in § 600.152. If a DOE award requires reporting on an accrual basis from a recipient that maintains its records on other than an accrual basis, the recipient shall not be required to establish an accrual accounting system. These recipients may develop such accrual data for their reports on the basis of an analysis of the documentation on hand.
(2) Records that identify adequately the source and application of funds for federally-sponsored activities. These records shall contain information pertaining to Federal awards, authorizations, obligations, unobligated balances, assets, outlays, income and interest.
(3) Effective control over and accountability for all funds, property and other assets. Recipients shall adequately safeguard all such assets and assure they are used solely for authorized purposes.
(4) Comparison of outlays with budget amounts for each award. Whenever appropriate, financial information should be related to performance and unit cost data. As discussed in paragraph (a) of this section, unit cost data is generally not appropriate for awards that support research.
(5) Written procedures to minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds to the recipient from the U.S. Treasury and the issuance or redemption of checks, warrants or payments by other means for program purposes by the recipient. To the extent that the provisions of the Cash Management Improvement Act (CMIA) (Pub. L. 101-453) govern, payment methods of State agencies, instrumentalities, and fiscal agents shall be consistent with CMIA Treasury-State Agreements or the CMIA default procedures codified at 31 CFR part 205, “Withdrawal of Cash from the Treasury for Advances under Federal Grant and Other Programs.”
(6) Written procedures for determining the reasonableness, allocability and allowability of costs in accordance with the provisions of the applicable Federal cost principles and the terms and conditions of the award.
(7) Accounting records including cost accounting records that are supported by source documentation.
(c) Where the Federal Government guarantees or insures the repayment of money borrowed by the recipient, the Contracting Officer, at his or her discretion, may require adequate bonding and insurance if the bonding and insurance requirements of the recipient are not deemed adequate to protect the interest of the Federal Government.
(d) The Contracting Officer may require adequate fidelity bond coverage where the recipient lacks sufficient coverage to protect the Federal Government's interest.
(e) Where bonds are required in the situations described in §§ 600.121 (c) and (d), the bonds shall be obtained from companies holding certificates of authority as acceptable sureties, as prescribed in 31 CFR part 223, “Surety Companies Doing Business with the United States.”
(f) Individuals whose financial management systems do not meet the minimum standards of § 600.121 (b) shall maintain a separate bank account for deposit of award or subaward funds. Disbursements by the recipient or subrecipient from this account shall be supported by source documentation such as canceled checks, paid bills, receipts, payrolls, etc.
§ 600.122
Payment.
(a) Payment methods shall minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds from the United States Treasury and the issuance or redemption of checks, warrants, or payment by other means by the recipients. Payment methods of State agencies or instrumentalities shall be consistent with Treasury-State CMIA agreements or
default procedures codified at 31 CFR part 205.
(b) Recipients will be paid in advance, provided they maintain or demonstrate the willingness to maintain:
(1) Written procedures that minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds and disbursement by the recipient, and
(2) Financial management systems that meet the standards for fund control and accountability as established in § 600.121. Cash advances to a recipient organization shall be limited to the minimum amounts needed and be timed to be in accordance with the actual, immediate cash requirements of the recipient organization in carrying out the purpose of the approved program or project. The timing and amount of cash advances shall be as close as is administratively feasible to the actual disbursements by the recipient organization for direct program or project costs and the proportionate share of any allowable indirect costs.
(c) Whenever possible, advances shall be consolidated to cover anticipated cash needs for all awards made by the DOE to the recipient.
(1) Advance payment mechanisms include, but are not limited to, Treasury check and electronic funds transfer.
(2) Advance payment mechanisms are subject to 31 CFR part 205.
(3) Recipients may submit requests for advances and reimbursements at least monthly when electronic fund transfers are not used.
(d) Requests for Treasury check advance payment shall be submitted on SF-270, “Request for Advance or Reimbursement,” or other forms as may be authorized by OMB. This form is not to be used when Treasury check advance payments are made to the recipient automatically through the use of a predetermined payment schedule or if precluded by special DOE instructions for electronic funds transfer.
(e) Reimbursement is the preferred method when the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section cannot be met. DOE may also use this method on any construction agreement, or if the major portion of the construction project is accomplished through private market financing or Federal loans, and the Federal assistance constitutes a minor portion of the project.
(1) When the reimbursement method is used, DOE shall make payment within 30 days after receipt of the billing, unless the billing is improper.
(2) Recipients are authorized to submit requests for reimbursement at least monthly when electronic funds transfers are not used.
(f) If a recipient cannot meet the criteria for advance payments and DOE has determined that reimbursement is not feasible because the recipient lacks sufficient working capital, DOE may provide cash on a working capital advance basis. Under this procedure, DOE advances cash to the recipient to cover its estimated disbursement needs for an initial period generally geared to the recipient's disbursing cycle. Thereafter, DOE reimburses the recipient for its actual cash disbursements. The working capital advance method of payment will not be used for recipients unwilling or unable to provide timely advances to their subrecipient to meet the subrecipient's actual cash disbursements.
(g) To the extent available, recipients shall disburse funds available from repayments to and interest earned on a revolving fund, program income, rebates, refunds, contract settlements, audit recoveries and interest earned on such funds before requesting additional cash payments.
(h) Unless otherwise required by statute, DOE will not withhold payments for proper charges made by recipients at any time during the project period unless paragraph (h)(1) or (h)(2) of this section apply.
(1) A recipient has failed to comply with the project objectives, the terms and conditions of the award, or DOE reporting requirements.
(2) The recipient or subrecipient is delinquent in a debt to the United States. Under such conditions, the Federal awarding agency may, upon reasonable notice, inform the recipient that payments shall not be made for obligations incurred after a specified date until the conditions are corrected or the indebtedness to the Federal Government is liquidated. Before withholding any payment, DOE shall notify the recipient that payments shall not
be made for obligations incurred after a specified date, which shall ordinarily be no sooner than 30 days from the date of the notice, until the recipient corrects the noncompliance or pays the indebtedness to the Federal government.
(i) Standards governing the use of banks and other institutions as depositories of funds advanced under awards are as follows.
(1) Except for situations described in paragraph (i)(2) of this section, DOE shall not require separate depository accounts for funds provided to a recipient or establish any eligibility requirements for depositories for funds provided to a recipient. However, recipients must be able to account for the receipt, obligation and expenditure of funds.
(2) Advances of Federal funds shall be deposited and maintained in insured accounts whenever possible.
(j) Consistent with the national goal of expanding the opportunities for women-owned and minority-owned business enterprises, recipients are encouraged to use women-owned and minority-owned banks (a bank which is owned at least 50 percent by women or minority group members).
(k) Recipients shall maintain advances of Federal funds in interest bearing accounts, unless paragraph (k) (1), (2) or (3) of this section apply.
(1) The recipient receives less than $120,000 in Federal awards per year.
(2) The best reasonably available interest bearing account would not be expected to earn interest in excess of $250 per year on Federal cash balances.
(3) The depository would require an average or minimum balance so high that it would not be feasible within the expected Federal and non-Federal cash resources.
(l) For those entities where CMIA and its implementing regulations do not apply, interest earned on Federal advances deposited in interest bearing accounts shall be remitted annually to the HHS Payment Management System through an electronic medium such as the FEDWIRE Deposit system. Recipients which do not have this capability should use a check. The address is the Department of Health and Human Services, Payment Management System, P.O. Box 6021, Rockville, MD 20852. Interest amounts up to $250 per year may be retained by the recipient for administrative expense. State universities and hospitals shall comply with CMIA, as it pertains to interest. If an entity subject to CMIA uses its own funds to pay pre-award costs for discretionary awards without prior written approval from the Federal awarding agency, it waives its right to recover the interest under CMIA.
(m) Except as noted elsewhere in this subpart, only the following forms shall be authorized for the recipients in requesting advances and reimbursements. Federal agencies shall not require more than an original and two copies of these forms.
(1) SF-270, Request for Advance or Reimbursement. Each Federal awarding agency shall adopt the SF-270 as a standard form for all nonconstruction programs when electronic funds transfer or predetermined advance methods are not used. Federal awarding agencies, however, have the option of using this form for construction programs in lieu of the SF-271, “Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs.”
(2) SF-271, Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs. Each Federal awarding agency shall adopt the SF-271 as the standard form to be used for requesting reimbursement for construction programs. However, a Federal awarding agency may substitute the SF-270 when the Federal awarding agency determines that it provides adequate information to meet Federal needs.
(n) The DOE may convert a recipient from advance payment to reimbursement whenever the recipient no longer meets the criteria for advance payment specified in paragraph (b) of this section. Any such conversion may be accomplished only after the DOE has advised the recipient in writing of the reasons for the proposed action and has provided a period of at least 30 days within which the recipient may take corrective action or provide satisfactory assurances of its intention to take such action.
(o) With prior DOE approval and in accordance with written DOE instructions, a recipient may assign to a bank,
trust company or other financing institution, including any Federal lending agency, reimbursement by Treasury check due from DOE under the following conditions:
(1) The award provides for reimbursement totaling $1,000 or more;
(2) The assignment covers all amounts payable under the award that have not already been paid;
(3) Reassignment is prohibited; and
(4) The assignee files a written notice of award payment assignment and a true copy of the instrument of assignment with DOE. Any interest costs resulting from a loan obtained on the basis of an assignment are unallowable charges to DOE award funds or any required cost sharing.
(p) Recipients shall observe the requirements of this section in making or withholding payments to subrecipients except that the forms used by recipients are not required to be used by subrecipients when requesting advances or reimbursement.
§ 600.123
Cost sharing or matching.
(a) All cost sharing or matching contributions, including cash and third party in-kind, shall meet all of the following criteria.
(1) Are verifiable from the recipient's records.
(2) Are not included as contributions for any other federally-assisted project or program.
(3) Are necessary and reasonable for proper and efficient accomplishment of project or program objectives.
(4) Are allowable under the applicable cost principles.
(5) Are not paid by the Federal Government under another award, except where authorized by Federal statute to be used for cost sharing or matching.
(6) Are provided for in the approved budget.
(7) Conform to other provisions of this subpart, as applicable.
(b) Unrecovered indirect costs may be included as part of cost sharing or matching.
(c) Values for recipient contributions of services and property shall be established in accordance with the applicable cost principles. If DOE authorizes recipients to donate buildings or land for construction/facilities acquisition projects or long-term use, the value of the donated property for cost sharing or matching shall be the lesser of either paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section.
(1) The certified value of the remaining life of the property recorded in the recipient's accounting records at the time of donation.
(2) The current fair market value. However, when there is sufficient justification, DOE may approve the use of the current fair market value of the donated property, even if it exceeds the certified value at the time of donation to the project.
(d) Volunteer services furnished by professional and technical personnel, consultants, and other skilled and unskilled labor may be counted as cost sharing or matching if the service is an integral and necessary part of an approved project or program. Rates for volunteer services shall be consistent with those paid for similar work in the recipient's organization. In those instances in which the required skills are not found in the recipient organization, rates shall be consistent with those paid for similar work in the labor market in which the recipient competes for the kind of services involved. In either case, paid fringe benefits that are reasonable, allowable, and allocable may be included in the valuation.
(e) When an employer other than the recipient furnishes the services of an employee, these services shall be valued at the employee's regular rate of pay (plus an amount of fringe benefits that are reasonable, allowable, and allocable, but exclusive of overhead costs), provided these services are in the same skill for which the employee is normally paid.
(f) Donated supplies may include such items as office supplies, laboratory supplies or workshop and classroom supplies. Value assessed to donated supplies included in the cost sharing or matching share shall be reasonable and shall not exceed the fair market value of the property at the time of the donation.
(g) The method used for determining cost sharing or matching for donated equipment, buildings and land for which title passes to the recipient may differ according to the purpose of the
award, if either paragraph (g)(1) or (2) of this section apply.
(1) If the purpose of the award is to assist the recipient in the acquisition of equipment, buildings or land, the total value of the donated property may be claimed as cost sharing or matching.
(2) If the purpose of the award is to support activities that require the use of equipment, buildings or land, normally only depreciation or use charges for equipment and buildings may be made. However, the full value of equipment or other capital assets and fair rental charges for land may be allowed, provided that DOE has approved the charges.
(h) The value of donated property shall be determined in accordance with the usual accounting policies of the recipient, with the following qualifications.
(1) The value of donated land and buildings shall not exceed its fair market value at the time of donation to the recipient as established by an independent appraiser (e.g., certified real property appraiser or General Services Administration representative) and certified by a responsible official of the recipient.
(2) The value of donated equipment shall not exceed the fair market value of equipment of the same age and condition at the time of donation.
(3) The value of donated space shall not exceed the fair rental value of comparable space as established by an independent appraisal of comparable space and facilities in a privately-owned building in the same locality.
(4) The value of loaned equipment shall not exceed its fair rental value.
(i) The following requirements pertain to the recipient's supporting records for in-kind contributions from third parties.
(1) Volunteer services shall be documented and, to the extent feasible, supported by the same methods used by the recipient for its own employees.
(2) The basis for determining the valuation for personal service, material, equipment, buildings and land shall be documented.
(j) DOE shall specify in the solicitation or in the program rule, if any, any cost sharing requirement. The award document shall be specific as to whether the cost sharing is based on a minimum amount for the recipient or on a percentage of total costs.
(k) If DOE requires that a recipient provide cost sharing which is not required by statute or which exceeds a statutory minimum, DOE shall state in the program rule or solicitation the reasons for requiring such cost sharing, recommended or required levels of cost sharing, and the circumstances under which the requirement for cost sharing may be waived or adjusted during any negotiation.
(l) Whenever DOE negotiates the amount of cost sharing, DOE may take into account such factors as the use of program income (see § 600.124), patent rights, and rights in data. Foregone fee or profit shall not be considered in establishing the extent of cost sharing.
§ 600.124
Program income.
(a) The standards set forth in this section shall be used to account for program income related to projects financed in whole or in part with DOE funds.
(b) Except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section, program income earned during the project period shall be retained by the recipient and, in accordance with program regulations or the terms and conditions of the award, shall be used in one or more of the following ways.
(1) Added to funds committed to the project and used to further eligible project objectives.
(2) Used to finance the non-DOE share of the project.
(3) Deducted from the total project allowable cost in determining the net allowable costs on which the share of costs is based.
(c) When DOE authorizes the disposition of program income as described in paragraphs (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section, program income in excess of any limits stipulated shall be used in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
(d) In the event that the program regulations or the terms and conditions of the award do not specify how program income is to be used, paragraph (b)(3) of this section shall apply
automatically to all projects or programs except research. For awards that support research, paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall apply automatically unless the award indicates another alternative in the terms and conditions, the recipient is subject to special award conditions, as indicated in § 600.114, or the recipient is a commercial organization.
(e) Unless program regulations or the terms and conditions of the award provide otherwise, recipients shall have no obligation to the Federal Government regarding program income earned after the end of the project period.
(f) Unless program regulations or the terms and conditions of the award provide otherwise, costs incident to the generation of program income may be deducted from gross income to determine program income, provided these costs have not been charged to the award.
(g) Proceeds from the sale of property shall be handled in accordance with the requirements of the Property Standards (See §§ 600.130 through 600.137).
(h) Unless program regulations or the terms and condition of the award provide otherwise, recipients shall have no obligation to the Federal Government with respect to program income earned from license fees and royalties for copyrighted material, patents, patent applications, trademarks, and inventions produced under an award. However, Patent and Trademark Amendments (35 U.S.C. Chapter 18) apply to inventions made under an experimental, developmental, or research award.
§ 600.125
Revision of budget and program plans.
(a) The budget plan is the financial expression of the project or program as approved during the award process. It includes the sum of the Federal and non-Federal share when there are cost sharing requirements. It shall be related to performance for program evaluation purposes whenever appropriate.
(b) Recipients are required to report deviations from budget and program plans, and request prior approvals for budget and program plan revisions, in accordance with this section.
(c) For nonconstruction awards, recipients shall request prior approvals from the DOE for one or more of the following program or budget related reasons.
(1) Change in the scope or the objective of the project or program (even if there is no associated budget revision requiring prior written approval).
(2) Change in a key person specified in the application or award document.
(3) The absence for more than three months, or a 25 percent reduction in time devoted to the project, by the approved project director or principal investigator.
(4) The need for additional Federal funding.
(5) If required by program regulations, the transfer of amounts budgeted for indirect costs to absorb increases in direct costs, or vice versa.
(6) The inclusion, unless waived by program regulations or the terms and conditions of award, of costs that require prior approval in accordance with OMB Circular A-21, “Cost Principles for Institutions of Higher Education,” OMB Circular A-122, “Cost Principles for Non-Profit Organizations,” or 45 CFR part 74 Appendix E, “Principles for Determining Costs Applicable to Research and Development under Grants and Contracts with Hospitals,” or 48 CFR part 31, “Contract Cost Principles and Procedures,” as applicable.
(7) The transfer of funds allotted for training allowances (direct payment to trainees) to other categories of expense.
(8) Unless described in the application and funded in the approved awards, the subaward, transfer or contracting out of any work under an award. This provision does not apply to the purchase of supplies, material, equipment or general support services.
(d) No other prior approval requirements for specific items may be imposed unless a deviation has been approved in accordance with § 600.4.
(e) Except for requirements listed in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(4) of this section, program regulations may waive cost-related and administrative prior written approvals required by this subpart and its Appendices. Such waivers may include authorizing recipients to do any one or more of the following.
(1) Incur pre-award costs 90 calendar days prior to award without prior approval or more than 90 calendar days with the prior approval of DOE. All pre-award costs are incurred at the recipient's risk (i.e., DOE is under no obligation to reimburse such costs if for any reason the recipient does not receive an award or if the award is less than anticipated and inadequate to cover such costs).
(2) Initiate a one-time extension of the expiration date of the final budget period of the project of up to 12 months unless one or more of the following conditions apply.
(i) The terms and conditions of award prohibit the extension.
(ii) The extension requires additional Federal funds.
(iii) The extension involves any change in the approved objectives or scope of the project.
(iv) The extension is being exercised merely for the purpose of using unobligated balances. For one-time extensions, the recipient must notify the DOE in writing with the supporting reasons and revised expiration date at least 10 days before the expiration date specified in the award.
(3) Carry forward unobligated balances to subsequent funding periods.
(4) For awards that support research, unless the terms and conditions of award provide otherwise, the prior approval requirements described in paragraph (e) of this section are automatically waived (i.e., recipients need not obtain such prior approvals) unless one of the conditions included in § 600.125(e)(2) applies.
(5) For continuation awards within a multiple year project in support of research, prior to receipt of continuation funding, preaward expenditures by recipients are not subject to the limitation or approval requirements of § 600.125(e)(1). Nevertheless, incurrence by the recipient does not impose any obligation on DOE if a continuation award is not subsequently made, or if an award is made for a lesser amount than the recipient expected.
(f) Program regulations may restrict the transfer of funds among direct cost categories or programs, functions and activities for awards in which DOE's share of the project exceeds $100,000 and the cumulative amount of such transfers exceeds or is expected to exceed 10 percent of the total budget as last approved by DOE. However, no program regulation shall permit a transfer that would cause any Federal appropriation or part thereof to be used for purposes other than those consistent with the original intent of the appropriation.
(g) All other changes to nonconstruction budgets, except for the changes described in paragraph (j) of this section, do not require prior approval.
(h) For construction awards, recipients shall request prior written approval promptly from the Contracting Officer for budget revisions whenever paragraph (h) (1), (2) or (3) of this section apply.
(1) The revision results from changes in the scope or the objective of the project or program.
(2) The need arises for additional Federal funds to complete the project.
(3) A revision is desired which involves specific costs for which prior written approval requirements may be imposed consistent with applicable OMB cost principles listed in § 600.127.
(i) Except in accordance with the deviation procedures in 600.4 or as may be provided for in program regulations, no other prior approval requirements for specific items will be imposed by DOE.
(j) When DOE makes an award that provides support for both construction and nonconstruction work, DOE may require the recipient to request prior approval from DOE before making any fund or budget transfers between the two types of work supported.
(k) For both construction and nonconstruction awards, recipients shall notify DOE in writing promptly whenever the amount of Federal authorized funds is expected to exceed the needs of the recipient for the project period by more than $5000 or five percent of the Federal award, whichever is greater. This notification shall not be required if an application for additional funding is submitted for a continuation award.
(l) Requests for budget revisions may be made by letter.
(m) Within 30 calendar days from the date of receipt of the request for budget revisions, DOE shall review the request and notify the recipient whether
the budget revisions have been approved. If the revision is still under consideration at the end of 30 calendar days, DOE shall inform the recipient in writing of the date when the recipient may expect the decision.
(n) DOE approval or disapproval of a request for a budget or project revision shall be in writing and signed by a DOE Contracting Officer.
(o) A request by a subrecipient for prior approval shall be addressed in writing to the recipient. The recipient shall promptly review such request and shall approve or disapprove the request in writing within 30 days from the date of the recipient's request for the revision. A recipient shall not approve any budget or project revision which is inconsistent with the purpose or terms and conditions of the DOE award. If the revision requested by the subrecipient would result in a change to the recipient's approved budget or approved project which requires DOE prior approval, the recipient shall obtain DOE approval before approving such revision.
§ 600.126
Non-Federal audits.
(a) Recipients and subrecipients that are institutions of higher education or other non-profit organizations (including hospitals) shall be subject to the audit requirements contained in the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 (31 U.S.C. 7501-7507) and revised OMB Circular A-133, “Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations.”
(b) State and local governments shall be subject to the audit requirements contained in the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 (31 U.S.C. 7501-7507) and revised OMB Circular A-133, “Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations.”
(c) For-profit organizations that are subrecipients are subject to the audit requirements specified in 10 CFR 600.316.
[59 FR 53266, Oct. 21, 1994, as amended at 62 FR 45939, 45940, Aug. 29, 1997; 68 FR 50650, Aug. 21, 2003]
§ 600.127
Allowable costs.
(a)
General.
For each kind of recipient, there is a set of Federal principles for determining allowable costs. Allowability of costs shall be determined in accordance with the cost principles applicable to the entity incurring the costs. Thus, allowability of costs incurred by State, local or federally-recognized Indian tribal governments is determined in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A-87, “Cost Principles for State and Local Governments.” The allowability of costs incurred by non-profit organizations is determined in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A-122, “Cost Principles for Non-Profit Organizations.” The allowability of costs incurred by institutions of higher education is determined in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A-21, “Cost Principles for Educational Institutions.” The allowability of costs incurred by hospitals is determined in accordance with the provisions of Appendix E of 45 CFR part 74, “Principles for Determining Costs Applicable to Research and Development Under Grants and Contracts with Hospitals.” The allowability of costs incurred by commercial organizations and those non-profit organizations listed in Attachment C to Circular A-122 is determined in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) at 48 CFR part 31.
(b)
Indirect costs.
Unless restricted by Federal statute or program rule, DOE shall provide for the reimbursement of appropriate indirect costs.
(1) DOE shall include an amount for indirect costs in an award only if the applicant requests reimbursement of such costs and—
(i) Submits evidence that a cognizant Federal agency has been assigned to establish indirect cost rates for the applicant and indicates or provides evidence that—
(A) A current agreement containing an applicable approved indirect cost rate(s) covering all or part of the budget period for which DOE may provide funding has been established; or
(B) An indirect cost proposal has been submitted to the cognizant agency in order to establish an applicable approved indirect cost rate(s) covering all or part of the budget period for which DOE may provide funding; or
(C) An indirect cost proposal covering all or part of the budget period
and applicable to the activities for which DOE may provide funding will be submitted to the cognizant agency for approval no later than three months after the beginning date of the initial budget period of the DOE award or, for subsequent budget periods, in accordance with any schedule established by the cognizant agency; or
(ii) If not assigned to a cognizant agency, the applicant includes, in the application, data that is current, complete, accurate, and sufficient to allow the Contracting Officer to determine a rate(s) for indirect costs. If the total approved budget will not exceed $100,000 or if the amount requested for indirect costs does not exceed $5,000, DOE may waive the requirement for negotiation of a rate and, in lieu thereof, provide a reasonable allowance for such costs.
(2) Indirect cost proposals shall be prepared and submitted in accordance with the applicable Federal cost principles and instructions from the cognizant agency or from DOE, as appropriate.
(3) If a subaward under an award or subaward provides for the payment of indirect costs, the recipient or subrecipient shall be responsible for negotiating appropriate indirect costs, using the cost principles applicable to the subrecipient or contractor, unless the subrecipient or contractor has negotiated an applicable rate directly with DOE or another Federal department or agency. DOE may review and audit the procedures a recipient or subrecipient uses in conducting indirect cost negotiations.
(c)
Fee or profit.
No increment above cost may be paid to a recipient or subrecipient under a DOE award or subaward. A fee or profit may be paid to a contractor providing goods or services under a contract with a recipient or subrecipient.
[59 FR 53266, Oct. 21, 1994, as amended at 68 FR 50650, Aug. 21, 2003]
§ 600.128
Period of availability of funds.
Where a funding period is specified, a recipient may charge to the award only allowable costs resulting from obligations incurred during the funding period and any pre-award costs authorized by DOE.

# Property Standards
§ 600.130
Purpose of property standards.
Sections 600.131 through 600.137 set forth uniform standards governing management and disposition of property furnished by the Federal Government or whose cost was charged to a project supported by a Federal award. Recipients shall observe these standards under awards and shall not impose additional requirements, unless specifically required by Federal statute or program regulations. The recipient may use its own property management standards and procedures provided it observes the provisions of §§ 600.131 through 600.137.
§ 600.131
Insurance coverage.
Recipients shall, at a minimum, provide the equivalent insurance coverage for real property and equipment acquired with DOE funds as provided to property owned by the recipient. Federally-owned property need not be insured unless required by the terms and conditions of the award.
§ 600.132
Real property.
Unless otherwise provided by statute or program regulations, the requirements concerning the use and disposition of real property acquired in whole or in part under awards are as follows.
(a) Title to real property shall vest in the recipient subject to the condition that the recipient shall use the real property for the authorized purpose of the project as long as it is needed and shall not encumber the property without approval of DOE.
(b) The recipient shall obtain written approval by DOE for the use of real property in other federally-sponsored projects when the recipient determines that the property is no longer needed for the purpose of the original project. Use in other projects shall be limited to those under federally-sponsored projects (i.e., awards) or programs that have purposes consistent with those authorized for support by DOE.
(c) When the real property is no longer needed as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the recipient shall request disposition instructions from DOE or its successor Federal awarding agency. DOE will give one or more of the following disposition instructions.
(1) The recipient may be permitted to retain title without further obligation to the Federal Government after it compensates the Federal Government for that percentage of the current fair market value of the property attributable to the Federal participation in the project.
(2) The recipient may be directed to sell the property under guidelines provided by DOE and pay the Federal Government for that percentage of the current fair market value of the property attributable to the Federal participation in the project (after deducting actual and reasonable selling and fix-up expenses, if any, from the sales proceeds). When the recipient is authorized or required to sell the property, proper sales procedures shall be established that provide for competition to the extent practicable and result in the highest possible return.
(3) The recipient may be directed to transfer title to the property to the Federal Government or to an eligible third party provided that, in such cases, the recipient shall be entitled to compensation for its attributable percentage of the current fair market value of the property.
§ 600.133
Federally-owned and exempt property.
(a)
Federally-owned property.
(1) Title to federally-owned property remains vested in the Federal Government. Recipients shall submit annually an inventory listing of federally-owned property in their custody to DOE. Upon completion of the award or when the property is no longer needed, the recipient shall report the property to DOE for further Federal agency utilization.
(2) If DOE has no further need for the property, it shall be declared excess and reported to the General Services Administration, unless DOE has statutory authority to dispose of the property by alternative methods (e.g., the authority provided by the Federal Technology Transfer Act (15 U.S.C. 3710 (i)) to donate research equipment to educational and non-profit organizations in accordance with E.O. 12821, “Improving Mathematics and Science Education in Support of the National Education Goals.”) Appropriate instructions shall be issued to the recipient by DOE.
(b)
Exempt property.
When statutory authority exists, DOE may vest title to property acquired with Federal funds in the recipient without further obligation to the Federal Government and under conditions DOE considers appropriate. For example, under 31 U.S.C. 6306, DOE may so vest title to tangible personal property under a grant or cooperative agreement for basic or applied research in a nonprofit institution of higher education or in a nonprofit organization whose primary purpose is conducting scientific research. Such property is “exempt property.” Program regulations or the terms and conditions of award may establish provisions for vesting title to exempt property. Should such conditions not be established and the recipient has no need for the equipment, the recipient shall request disposition instructions from DOE. If DOE does not issue disposition instructions within 120 calendar days of receipt of the request, title to the property shall vest in the recipient without further obligation to the Federal Government. If, at the end of the project, DOE fails to issue disposition instructions within 120 calendar days of the receipt of a final inventory, title to the property shall vest in the recipient without further obligation to the Federal Government.
§ 600.134
Equipment.
(a) Title to equipment acquired by a recipient with Federal funds shall vest in the recipient, subject to conditions of this section.
(b) The recipient shall not use equipment acquired with Federal funds to provide services to non-Federal outside organizations for a fee that is less than private companies charge for equivalent services, unless specifically authorized by Federal statute, for as long as the Federal Government retains an interest in the equipment.
(c) The recipient shall use the equipment in the project or program for which it was acquired as long as needed, whether or not the project or program continues to be supported by Federal funds and shall not encumber the property without approval of DOE. When no longer needed for the original project or program, the recipient shall use the equipment in connection with its other federally-sponsored activities, in the following order of priority:
(1) Activities sponsored by DOE, then
(2) Activities sponsored by other Federal agencies.
(d) During the time that equipment is used on the project or program for which it was acquired, the recipient shall make it available for use on other projects or programs if such other use will not interfere with the work on the project or program for which the equipment was originally acquired. First preference for such other use shall be given to other projects or programs sponsored by DOE that financed the equipment; second preference shall be given to projects or programs sponsored by other Federal awarding agencies. If the equipment is owned by the Federal Government, use on other activities not sponsored by the Federal Government shall be permissible if authorized by DOE. User charges shall be treated as program income.
(e) When acquiring replacement equipment, the recipient may use the equipment to be replaced as trade-in or sell the equipment and use the proceeds to offset the costs of the replacement equipment subject to the approval of DOE.
(f) The recipient's property management standards for equipment acquired with Federal funds and federally-owned equipment shall include all of the following.
(1) Equipment records shall be maintained accurately and shall include the following information.
(i) A description of the equipment.
(ii) Manufacturer's serial number, model number, Federal stock number, national stock number, or other identification number.
(iii) Source of the equipment, including the award number.
(iv) Whether title vests in the recipient or the Federal Government.
(v) Acquisition date (or date received, if the equipment was furnished by the Federal Government) and cost.
(vi) Information from which one can calculate the percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the equipment (not applicable to equipment furnished by the Federal Government).
(vii) Location and condition of the equipment and the date the information was reported.
(viii) Unit acquisition cost.
(ix) Ultimate disposition data, including date of disposal and sales price or the method used to determine current fair market value where a recipient compensates DOE for its share.
(2) Equipment owned by the Federal Government shall be identified to indicate Federal ownership.
(3) A physical inventory of equipment shall be taken and the results reconciled with the equipment records at least once every two years. Any differences between quantities determined by the physical inspection and those shown in the accounting records shall be investigated to determine the causes of the difference. The recipient shall, in connection with the inventory, verify the existence, current utilization, and continued need for the equipment.
(4) A control system shall be in effect to insure adequate safeguards to prevent loss, damage, or theft of the equipment. Any loss, damage, or theft of equipment shall be investigated and fully documented; if the equipment was owned by the Federal Government, the recipient shall promptly notify DOE.
(5) Adequate maintenance procedures shall be implemented to keep the equipment in good condition.
(6) Where the recipient is authorized or required to sell the equipment, proper sales procedures shall be established which provide for competition to the extent practicable and result in the highest possible return.
(g) When the recipient no longer needs the equipment, the equipment may be used for other activities in accordance with the following standards. Equipment with a current per-unit fair market value of less than $5000 may be retained, sold or otherwise disposed of with no further obligation to the awarding agency. For equipment with
a current per unit fair market value of $5000 or more, the recipient may retain the equipment for other uses provided that compensation is made to the original Federal awarding agency or its successor. The amount of compensation shall be computed by applying the percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the original project or program to the current fair market value of the equipment. If the recipient has no need for the equipment, the recipient shall request disposition instructions from DOE. DOE shall determine whether the equipment can be used to meet DOE's requirements. If no requirement exists within DOE, the availability of the equipment shall be reported to the General Services Administration by DOE to determine whether a requirement for the equipment exists in other Federal agencies. DOE will issue instructions to the recipient no later than 120 calendar days after the recipient's request and the following procedures shall govern.
(1) If so instructed or if disposition instructions are not issued within 120 calendar days after the recipient's request, the recipient shall sell the equipment and reimburse DOE an amount computed by applying to the sales proceeds the percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the original project or program. However, the recipient shall be permitted to deduct and retain from the Federal share $500 or ten percent of the proceeds, whichever is less, for the recipient's selling and handling expenses.
(2) If the recipient is instructed to ship the equipment elsewhere, the recipient shall be reimbursed by the Federal Government by an amount which is computed by applying the percentage of the recipient's participation in the cost of the original project or program to the current fair market value of the equipment, plus any reasonable shipping or interim storage costs incurred.
(3) If the recipient is instructed to otherwise dispose of the equipment, the recipient shall be reimbursed by DOE for such costs incurred in its disposition.
(h) DOE reserves the right, at the end of a project, to transfer the title to the Federal Government or to a third party named by DOE when such third party is otherwise eligible under existing statutes. Such transfer shall be subject to the following standards.
(1) The equipment shall be appropriately identified in the award or otherwise made known to the recipient in writing.
(2) DOE shall issue disposition instructions within 120 calendar days after receipt of a final inventory. The final inventory shall list all equipment acquired with award funds and federally-owned equipment. If DOE fails to issue disposition instructions within the 120 calendar day period, the provisions of § 600.134(g)(1) apply.
(3) When DOE exercises its right to take title, the equipment shall be subject to the provisions for federally-owned equipment.
§ 600.135
Supplies and other expendable property.
(a) Title to supplies and other expendable property shall vest in the recipient upon acquisition. If there is a residual inventory of unused supplies exceeding $5000 in total aggregate value upon termination or completion of the project or program and the supplies are not needed for any other federally-sponsored project or program, the recipient shall retain the supplies for use on non-Federal sponsored activities or sell them, but shall, in either case, compensate the Federal Government for its share. The amount of compensation shall be computed in the same manner as for equipment.
(b) The recipient shall not use supplies acquired with Federal funds to provide services to non-Federal outside organizations for a fee that is less than private companies charge for equivalent services, unless specifically authorized by Federal statute as long as the Federal Government retains an interest in the supplies.
§ 600.136
Intangible property.
(a) Recipients may copyright any work that is subject to copyright and was developed, or for which ownership was purchased, under an award. DOE reserves a royalty-free, nonexclusive and irrevocable right to reproduce, publish or otherwise use the work for
Federal purposes and to authorize others to do so.
(b) Recipients are subject to applicable regulations governing patents and inventions, including government-wide regulations issued by the Department of Commerce at 37 CFR part 401, “Rights to Inventions Made by Nonprofit Organizations and Small Business Firms Under Government Grants, Contracts and Cooperative Agreements.”
(c) The DOE has the right to:
(1) Obtain, reproduce, publish or otherwise use the data first produced under an award; and
(2) Authorize others to receive, reproduce, publish, or otherwise use such data for Federal purposes.
(d)(1) In addition, in response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request for research data relating to published research findings produced under an award that were used by the Federal Government in developing an agency action that has the force and effect of law, the DOE shall request, and the recipient shall provide, within a reasonable time, the research data so that they can be made available to the public through the procedures established under the FOIA. If the DOE obtains the research data solely in response to a FOIA request, the agency may charge the requester a reasonable fee equaling the full incremental cost of obtaining the research data. This fee should reflect costs incurred by the agency, the recipient, and applicable subrecipients. This fee is in addition to any fees the agency may assess under the FOIA (5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(A)).
(2) The following definitions apply for purposes of this paragraph (d):
(i)
Research data
is defined as the recorded factual material commonly accepted in the scientific community as necessary to validate research findings, but not any of the following: preliminary analyses, drafts of scientific papers, plans for future research, peer reviews, or communications with colleagues. This “recorded” material excludes physical objects (e.g., laboratory samples).
Research data
also do not include:
(A) Trade secrets, commercial information, materials necessary to be held confidential by a researcher until they are published, or similar information which is protected under law; and
(B) Personnel and medical information and similar information the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, such as information that could be used to identify a particular person in a research study.
(ii)
Published
is defined as either when:
(A) Research findings are published in a peer-reviewed scientific or technical journal; or
(B) A Federal agency publicly and officially cites the research findings in support of an agency action that has the force and effect of law.
(iii)
Used by the Federal Government in developing an agency action that has the force and effect of law
is defined as when an agency publicly and officially cites the research findings in support of an agency action that has the force and effect of law.
(e) Title to intangible property and debt instruments acquired under an award or subaward vests upon acquisition in the recipient. The recipient shall use that property for the originally-authorized purpose, and the recipient shall not encumber the property without approval of DOE. When no longer needed for the originally authorized purpose, disposition of the intangible property shall occur in accordance with the provisions of § 600.134(g).
[61 FR 7165, Feb. 26, 1996, as amended at 65 FR 14407, 14408, Mar. 16, 2000; 68 FR 50650, Aug. 21, 2003]
§ 600.137
Property trust relationship.
Real property, equipment, intangible property and debt instruments that are acquired or improved with Federal funds shall be held in trust by the recipient as trustee for the beneficiaries of the project or program under which the property was acquired or improved. Recipients shall record liens or other appropriate notices of record to indicate that personal or real property has been acquired or improved with Federal funds and that use and disposition conditions apply to the property.

# Procurement Standards
§ 600.140
Purpose of procurement standards.
Sections 600.141 through 600.148 set forth standards for use by recipients in establishing procedures for the procurement of supplies and other expendable property, equipment, real property and other services with Federal funds. These standards are furnished to ensure that such materials and services are obtained in an effective manner and in compliance with the provisions of applicable Federal statutes and executive orders. No additional procurement standards or requirements shall be imposed by DOE upon recipients, unless specifically required by Federal statute or executive order or in accordance with the deviation procedures of § 600.4.
§ 600.141
Recipient responsibilities.
The standards contained in this section do not relieve the recipient of the contractual responsibilities arising under its contract(s). The recipient is the responsible authority, without recourse to DOE regarding the settlement and satisfaction of all contractual and administrative issues arising out of procurements entered into in support of an award or other agreement. This includes disputes, claims, protests of award, source evaluation or other matters of a contractual nature. Matters concerning violation of statute are to be referred to such Federal, State or local authority as may have proper jurisdiction.
§ 600.142
Codes of conduct.
The recipient shall maintain written standards of conduct governing the performance of its employees engaged in the award and administration of contracts. No employee, officer, or agent shall participate in the selection, award, or administration of a contract supported by Federal funds if a real or apparent conflict of interest would be involved. Such a conflict would arise when the employee, officer, or agent, any member of his or her immediate family, his or her partner, or an organization which employs or is about to employ any of the parties indicated herein, has a financial or other interest in the firm selected for an award. The officers, employees, and agents of the recipient shall neither solicit nor accept gratuities, favors, or anything of monetary value from contractors, or parties to subagreements. However, recipients may set standards for situations in which the financial interest is not substantial or the gift is an unsolicited item of nominal value. The standards of conduct shall provide for disciplinary actions to be applied for violations of such standards by officers, employees, or agents of the recipient.
§ 600.143
Competition.
All procurement transactions shall be conducted in a manner to provide, to the maximum extent practical, open and free competition. The recipient shall be alert to organizational conflicts of interest as well as noncompetitive practices among contractors that may restrict or eliminate competition or otherwise restrain trade. In order to ensure objective contractor performance and eliminate unfair competitive advantage, contractors that develop or draft specifications, requirements, statements of work, invitations for bids and/or requests for proposals shall be excluded from competing for such procurements. Awards shall be made to the bidder or offeror whose bid or offer is responsive to the solicitation and is most advantageous to the recipient, price, quality and other factors considered. Solicitations shall clearly set forth all requirements that the bidder or offeror shall fulfill in order for the bid or offer to be evaluated by the recipient. Any and all bids or offers may be rejected when it is in the recipient's interest to do so.
§ 600.144
Procurement procedures.
(a) All recipients shall establish written procurement procedures. These procedures shall provide for, at a minimum, that paragraphs (a)(1), (2) and (3) of this section apply.
(1) Recipients avoid purchasing unnecessary items.
(2) Where appropriate, an analysis is made of lease and purchase alternatives to determine which would be the most economical and practical procurement.
(3) Solicitations for goods and services provide for all of the following.
(i) A clear and accurate description of the technical requirements for the material, product or service to be procured. In competitive procurements, such a description shall not contain features which unduly restrict competition.
(ii) Requirements which the bidder/offeror must fulfill and all other factors to be used in evaluating bids or proposals.
(iii) A description, whenever practicable, of technical requirements in terms of functions to be performed or performance required, including the range of acceptable characteristics or minimum acceptable standards.
(iv) The specific features of “brand name or equal” descriptions that bidders are required to meet when such items are included in the solicitation.
(v) The acceptance, to the extent practicable and economically feasible, of products and services dimensioned in the metric system of measurement.
(vi) Preference, to the extent practicable and economically feasible, for products and services that conserve natural resources and protect the environment and are energy efficient.
(b) Positive efforts shall be made by recipients to utilize small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises, whenever possible. Recipients of DOE awards shall take all of the following steps to further this goal.
(1) Ensure that small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises are used to the fullest extent practicable.
(2) Make information on forthcoming opportunities available and arrange time frames for purchases and contracts to encourage and facilitate participation by small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises.
(3) Consider in the contract process whether firms competing for larger contracts intend to subcontract with small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises.
(4) Encourage contracting with consortiums of small businesses, minority- owned firms and women's business enterprises when a contract is too large for one of these firms to handle individually.
(5) Use the services and assistance, as appropriate, of such organizations as the Small Business Administration and the Department of Commerce's Minority Business Development Agency in the solicitation and utilization of small businesses, minority-owned firms and women's business enterprises.
(c) The type of procuring instruments used (e.g., fixed price contracts, cost reimbursable contracts, purchase orders, and incentive contracts) shall be determined by the recipient but shall be appropriate for the particular procurement and for promoting the best interest of the program or project involved. The “cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost” or “percentage of construction cost” methods of contracting shall not be used.
(d) Contracts shall be made only with responsible contractors who possess the potential ability to perform successfully under the terms and conditions of the proposed procurement. Consideration shall be given to such matters as contractor integrity, record of past performance, financial and technical resources or accessibility to other necessary resources. In certain circumstances, contracts with certain parties are restricted by DOE's implementation, in 10 CFR part 1036, of E.O.'s 12549 and 12689, “Debarment and Suspension.”
(e) Recipients shall, on request, make available for DOE, pre-award review and procurement documents, such as request for proposals or invitations for bids, independent cost estimates, etc., when any of the following conditions apply.
(1) A recipient's procurement procedures or operation fails to comply with the procurement standards in this subpart.
(2) The procurement is expected to exceed the small purchase threshold fixed at 41 U.S.C. 403 (11) (currently $25,000) and is to be awarded without competition or only one bid or offer is received in response to a solicitation.
(3) The procurement, which is expected to exceed the small purchase threshold, specifies a “brand name” product.
(4) The proposed award over the small purchase threshold is to be awarded to other than the apparent low bidder under a sealed bid procurement.
(5) A proposed contract modification changes the scope of a contract or increases the contract amount by more than the amount of the small purchase threshold.
(f) By agreement of the recipient or subrecipient and the contractor, if consistent with the recipient's or subrecipient's usual business practices and applicable state and local law, any contract to which this section applies may provide for the payment of interest penalties on amounts overdue under such contract except that—
(1) In no case shall any obligation to pay such interest penalties be construed to be an obligation of the Federal government, and
(2) Any payment of such interest penalties may not be made from DOE funds nor be counted toward meeting a cost sharing requirement of a DOE award.
§ 600.145
Cost and price analysis.
Some form of cost or price analysis shall be made and documented in the procurement files in connection with every procurement action. Price analysis may be accomplished in various ways, including the comparison of price quotations submitted, market prices and similar indicia, together with discounts. Cost analysis is the review and evaluation of each element of cost to determine reasonableness, allocability and allowability.
§ 600.146
Procurement records.
Procurement records and files for purchases in excess of the small purchase threshold shall include the following at a minimum:
(a) Basis for contractor selection,
(b) Justification for lack of competition when competitive bids or offers are not obtained, and
(c) Basis for award cost or price.
§ 600.147
Contract administration.
A system for contract administration shall be maintained to ensure contractor conformance with the terms, conditions and specifications of the contract and to ensure adequate and timely follow up of all purchases. Recipients shall evaluate contractor performance and document, as appropriate, whether contractors have met the terms, conditions and specifications of the contract.
§ 600.148
Contract provisions.
The recipient shall include, in addition to provisions to define a sound and complete agreement, the following provisions in all contracts. The following provisions shall also be applied to subcontracts.
(a) Contracts in excess of the small purchase threshold shall contain contractual provisions or conditions that allow for administrative, contractual, or legal remedies in instances in which a contractor violates or breaches the contract terms, and provide for such remedial actions as may be appropriate.
(b) All contracts in excess of the small purchase threshold shall contain suitable provisions for termination by the recipient, including the manner by which termination shall be effected and the basis for settlement. In addition, such contracts shall describe conditions under which the contract may be terminated for default as well as conditions where the contract may be terminated because of circumstances beyond the control of the contractor.
(c) Except as otherwise required by statute, an award that requires the contracting (or subcontracting) for construction or facility improvements shall provide for the recipient to follow its own requirements relating to bid guarantees, performance bonds, and payment bonds unless the construction contract or subcontract exceeds $100,000. For those contracts or subcontracts exceeding $100,000, DOE may accept the bonding policy and requirements of the recipient, provided the DOE has made a determination that the Federal Government's interest is adequately protected. If such a determination has not been made, the minimum requirements shall be as follows.
(1) A bid guarantee from each bidder equivalent to five percent of the bid price. The “bid guarantee” shall consist of a firm commitment such as a
bid bond, certified check, or other negotiable instrument accompanying a bid as assurance that the bidder shall, upon acceptance of his bid, execute such contractual documents as may be required within the time specified.
(2) A performance bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent of the contract price. A “performance bond” is one executed in connection with a contract to secure fulfillment of all the contractor's obligations under such contract.
(3) A payment bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent of the contract price. A “payment bond” is one executed in connection with a contract to assure payment as required by statute of all persons supplying labor and material in the execution of the work provided for in the contract.
(4) Where bonds are required in the situations described herein, the bonds shall be obtained from companies holding certificates of authority as acceptable sureties pursuant to 31 CFR part 223, “Surety Companies Doing Business with the United States.”
(d) All negotiated contracts (except those for less than the small purchase threshold) awarded by recipients shall include a provision to the effect that the recipient, DOE, the Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their duly authorized representatives, shall have access to any books, documents, papers and records of the contractor which are directly pertinent to a specific program for the purpose of making audits, examinations, excerpts and transcriptions.
(e) All contracts, including small purchases, awarded by recipients and their contractors shall contain the procurement provisions of appendix A to this subpart, as applicable.
§ 600.149
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA).
Recipients' procurements shall comply with applicable requirements of RCRA, as described at § 600.116 of this subpart.

# Reports and Records
§ 600.150
Purpose of reports and records.
Sections 600.151 through 600.153 set forth the procedures for monitoring and reporting on the recipient's financial and program performance and the necessary standard reporting forms. They also set forth record retention requirements.
§ 600.151
Monitoring and reporting program performance.
(a) Recipients are responsible for managing and monitoring each project, program, subaward, function or activity supported by the award. Recipients shall monitor subawards to ensure subrecipients have met the audit requirements as delineated in § 600.126.
(b) The terms and conditions of the award will prescribe the frequency with which the performance reports shall be submitted. Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, performance reports shall not be required more frequently than quarterly or less frequently than annually. Annual reports shall be due 90 calendar days after the award year; quarterly or semi-annual reports shall be due 30 days after the reporting period. DOE may require annual reports before the anniversary dates of multiple year awards in lieu of these requirements. The final performance reports are due 90 calendar days after the expiration or termination of the award.
(c) If inappropriate, a final technical or performance report shall not be required after completion of the project.
(d) When required, performance reports shall generally contain, for each award, brief information on each of the following.
(1) A comparison of actual accomplishments with the goals and objectives established for the period, the findings of the investigator, or both. Whenever appropriate and the output of programs or projects can be readily quantified, such quantitative data should be related to cost data for computation of unit costs.
(2) Reasons why established goals were not met, if appropriate.
(3) Other pertinent information including, when appropriate, analysis
and explanation of cost overruns or high unit costs.
DOE may specify in the award that the recipient provide this information on the Federal Assistance Program/Project Status Report (DOE F 4600.6), the technical reporting formats, or the Federal Assistance Management Summary Report. DOE may require that the Federal Assistance Management Summary Report be used as a performance report only when such use is authorized by program rule or the need for this form is explained in the solicitation. The requirements of this section concerning reporting frequency and deadlines shall apply to the Federal Assistance Management Summary Report. (See also § 600.112 with regard to use of this form as part of the award application.)
(e) Recipients shall not be required to submit more than the original and two copies of performance reports.
(f) Recipients shall immediately notify DOE of developments that have a significant impact on the award-supported activities. Also, notification shall be given in the case of problems, delays, or adverse conditions which materially impair the ability to meet the objectives of the award. This notification shall include a statement of the action taken or contemplated, and any assistance needed to resolve the situation.
(g) DOE may make site visits, as needed.
(h) DOE shall comply with applicable clearance requirements of 5 CFR part 1320 when requesting performance data from recipients.
(i) Recipients may place performance reporting requirements on subawards consistent with the provisions of this section and shall require interim reporting in accordance with § 600.151(f).
§ 600.152
Financial reporting.
(a) The following forms or such other forms as may be approved by OMB are authorized for obtaining financial information from recipients.
(1) SF-269 or SF-269A, Financial Status Report.
(i) Recipients shall use the SF-269 or SF-269A to report the status of funds for all nonconstruction projects or programs, except that DOE has the option of not requiring the SF-269 or SF-269A when the SF-270, Request for Advance or Reimbursement, or SF-272, Report of Federal Cash Transactions, is determined to provide adequate information to meet DOE needs. However, a final SF-269 or SF-269A shall be required at the completion of the project when the SF-270 is used only for advances.
(ii) The terms and conditions of award shall prescribe whether the report shall be on a cash or accrual basis. DOE may require accrual reporting only if such reporting is required by program statute or rule. If the award requires accrual information and the recipient's accounting records are not normally kept on the accrual basis, the recipient shall not be required to convert its accounting system, but shall develop such accrual information through best estimates based on an analysis of the documentation on hand.
(iii) DOE shall determine the frequency of the Financial Status Report for each project or program, considering the size and complexity of the particular project or program. However, the report shall not be required more frequently than quarterly or less frequently than annually. A final report shall be required at the completion of the agreement.
(iv) DOE shall require recipients to submit the SF-269 or SF-269A (an original and no more than two copies) no later than 30 days after the end of each specified reporting period for quarterly and semi-annual reports, and 90 calendar days for annual and final reports. Extensions of reporting due dates may be approved by the DOE upon request of the recipient.
(2) SF-272, Report of Federal Cash Transactions.
(i) When funds are advanced, each recipient shall submit the SF-272 and, when necessary, its continuation sheet, SF-272a. DOE will use this report to monitor cash advanced to recipients and to obtain disbursement information for each agreement with the recipients.
(ii) Recipients shall forecast Federal cash requirements in the “Remarks” section of the report.
(iii) When practical and deemed necessary, DOE may require recipients to report in the “Remarks” section the
amount of cash advances received in excess of three days. Recipients shall provide short narrative explanations of actions taken to reduce the excess balances.
(iv) Recipients shall be required to submit not more than the original and two copies of the SF-272 15 calendar days following the end of each quarter. DOE may require a monthly report from those recipients receiving advances totaling $1 million or more per year.
(v) DOE may waive the requirement for submission of the SF-272 for any one of the following reasons:
(A) When monthly advances do not exceed $25,000 per recipient, provided that such advances are monitored through other forms contained in this section;
(B) If, in the contracting officer's opinion, the recipient's accounting controls are adequate to minimize excessive Federal advances; or,
(C) When electronic payment mechanisms provide adequate data.
(b) When DOE needs additional information or more frequent reports, the following shall be observed:
(1) When additional information is needed to comply with legislative requirements, DOE shall issue instructions to require recipients to submit such information under the “Remarks” section of the reports.
(2) When DOE determines that a recipient's accounting system does not meet the standards in § 600.121, additional pertinent information to further monitor awards may be obtained upon written notice to the recipient until such time as the system is brought up to standard. DOE, in obtaining this information, shall comply with report clearance requirements of 5 CFR part 1320.
(3) Contracting officers are encouraged to shade out any line item on any report if not necessary.
(4) DOE may accept the identical information from the recipients in machine readable format or computer printouts or electronic outputs in lieu of prescribed formats.
(5) Computer or electronic outputs may be provided to recipients when that expedites or contributes to the accuracy of reporting.
§ 600.153
Retention and access requirements for records.
(a) This section sets forth requirements for record retention and access to records for awards to recipients. DOE shall not impose any other record retention or access requirements upon recipients, unless such requirements are established in program regulations.
(b) Financial records, supporting documents, statistical records, and all other records pertinent to an award shall be retained for a period of three years from the date of submission of the final expenditure report or, for awards that are renewed quarterly or annually, from the date of the submission of the quarterly or annual financial report, as authorized by DOE. The only exceptions are the following:
(1) If any litigation, claim, or audit is started before the expiration of the 3-year period, the records shall be retained until all litigation, claims or audit findings involving the records have been resolved and final action taken.
(2) Records for real property and equipment acquired with Federal funds shall be retained for 3 years after final disposition.
(3) When records are transferred to or maintained by DOE, the 3-year retention requirement is not applicable to the recipient.
(4) Indirect cost rate proposals, cost allocations plans, and related records, for which retention requirements are specified in § 600.153(g).
(c) Copies of original records may be substituted for the original records if authorized by DOE.
(d) DOE shall request transfer of certain records to its custody from recipients when it determines that the records possess long term retention value. However, in order to avoid duplicate recordkeeping, DOE may make arrangements for recipients to retain any records that are continuously needed for joint use.
(e) DOE, the Inspector General, Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their duly authorized representatives, have the right of timely and unrestricted access to any books, documents, papers, or other records of recipients that are pertinent to the awards, in order to make audits,
examinations, excerpts, transcripts and copies of such documents. This right also includes timely and reasonable access to a recipient's personnel for the purpose of interview and discussion related to such documents. The rights of access in this paragraph are not limited to the required retention period, but shall last as long as records are retained.
(f) Unless required by statute, DOE shall place no restrictions on recipients that limit public access to the records of recipients that are pertinent to an award, except when DOE can demonstrate that such records shall be kept confidential and would have been exempted from disclosure pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) if the records had belonged to DOE.
(g) Paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) of this section apply to the following types of documents, and their supporting records: indirect cost rate computations or proposals, cost allocation plans, and any similar accounting computations of the rate at which a particular group of costs is chargeable (such as computer usage chargeback rates or composite fringe benefit rates).
(1)
If submitted for negotiation.
If the recipient submits to the Federal agency responsible for negotiating the recipient's indirect cost rate or the subrecipient submits to the recipient the proposal, plan, or other computation to form the basis for negotiation of the rate, then the 3-year retention period for its supporting records starts on the date of such submission.
(2)
If not submitted for negotiation.
If the recipient is not required to submit to the cognizant Federal agency or the subrecipient is not required to submit to the recipient the proposal, plan, or other computation for negotiation purposes, then the 3-year retention period for the proposal, plan, or other computation and its supporting records starts at the end of the fiscal year (or other accounting period) covered by the proposal, plan, or other computation.
(h) If, by the terms and conditions of the award, the recipient or subrecipient—
(1) Is accountable for program income earned or received after the end of the project period or after the termination of an award or subaward, or
(2) If program income earned during the project period is required to be applied to costs incurred after the end of the project period or after termination of an award or subaward, the record retention period shall start on the last day of the recipient's or subrecipient's fiscal year in which such income was earned or received or such costs were incurred. All other program income records shall be retained in accordance with § 600.153(b).

# Termination and Enforcement
§ 600.160
Purpose of termination and enforcement.
Sections 600.161 and 600.162 set forth uniform suspension, termination and enforcement procedures.
§ 600.161
Termination.
(a) Awards may be terminated in whole or in part only if paragraph (a) (1), (2) or (3) of this section apply.
(1) By DOE, if a recipient materially fails to comply with the terms and conditions of an award.
(2) By DOE with the consent of the recipient, in which case the two parties shall agree upon the termination conditions, including the effective date and, in the case of partial termination, the portion to be terminated.
(3) By the recipient upon sending to DOE written notification setting forth the reasons for such termination, the effective date, and, in the case of partial termination, the portion to be terminated. However, if DOE determines in the case of partial termination that the reduced or modified portion of the award will not accomplish the purposes for which the award was made, it may terminate the award in its entirety under either paragraph (a) (1) or (2) of this section.
(b) If costs are allowed under an award, the responsibilities of the recipient referred to in § 600.171(a), including those for property management as applicable, shall be considered in the
termination of the award, and provision shall be made for continuing responsibilities of the recipient after termination, as appropriate.
§ 600.162
Enforcement.
(a)
Remedies for noncompliance.
If a recipient materially fails to comply with the terms and conditions of an award, whether stated in a Federal statute, regulation, assurance, application, or notice of award, DOE may, in addition to imposing any of the special conditions outlined in § 600.114, take one or more of the following actions, as appropriate in the circumstances.
(1) Temporarily withhold cash payments pending correction of the deficiency by the recipient or more severe enforcement action by DOE.
(2) Disallow (that is, deny both use of funds and any applicable matching credit for) all or part of the cost of the activity or action not in compliance.
(3) Wholly or partly suspend or terminate the current award.
(4) Withhold further awards for the project or program.
(5) Take other remedies that may be legally available.
(b)
Hearings and appeals.
In taking an enforcement action, DOE shall provide the recipient an opportunity for hearing, appeal, or other administrative proceeding to which the recipient is entitled under any statute or regulation applicable to the action involved.
(c)
Effects of suspension and termination.
Costs of a recipient resulting from obligations incurred by the recipient during a suspension or after termination of an award are not allowable unless the awarding agency expressly authorizes them in the notice of suspension or termination or subsequently. Other recipient costs during suspension or after termination which are necessary and not reasonably avoidable are allowable if paragraph (c) (1) and (2) of this section apply.
(1) The costs result from obligations which were properly incurred by the recipient before the effective date of suspension or termination, are not in anticipation of it, and in the case of a termination, are noncancellable.
(2) The costs would be allowable if the award were not suspended or expired normally at the end of the funding period in which the termination takes effect.
(d)
Relationship to debarment and suspension.
The enforcement remedies identified in this section, including suspension and termination, do not preclude a recipient from being subject to debarment and suspension under 10 CFR part 1036.

# After-the-Award Requirements
§ 600.170
Purpose.
Sections 600.171 through 600.173 contain closeout procedures and other procedures for subsequent disallowances and adjustments.
§ 600.171
Closeout procedures.
(a) Recipients shall submit, within 90 calendar days after the date of completion of the award, all financial, performance, and other reports as required by the terms and conditions of the award. DOE may approve extensions when requested by the recipient.
(b) Unless DOE authorizes an extension, a recipient shall liquidate all obligations incurred under the award not later than 90 calendar days after the funding period or the date of completion as specified in the terms and conditions of the award or in agency implementing instructions.
(c) DOE shall make prompt payments to a recipient for allowable reimbursable costs under the award being closed out.
(d) The recipient shall promptly refund any balances of unobligated cash that DOE has advanced or paid and that is not authorized to be retained by the recipient for use in other projects. OMB Circular A-129 governs unreturned amounts that become delinquent debts.
(e) When authorized by the terms and conditions of the award, DOE shall make a settlement for any upward or downward adjustments to the Federal share of costs after closeout reports are received.
(f) The recipient shall account for any real and personal property acquired with Federal funds or received from the Federal Government in accordance with §§ 600.131 through 600.137.
(g) In the event a final audit has not been performed prior to the closeout of
an award, DOE shall retain the right to recover an appropriate amount after fully considering the recommendations on disallowed costs resulting from the final audit.
§ 600.172
Subsequent adjustments and continuing responsibilities.
(a) The closeout of an award does not affect any of the following.
(1) The right of DOE to disallow costs and recover funds on the basis of a later audit or other review.
(2) The obligation of the recipient to return any funds due as a result of later refunds, corrections, or other transactions.
(3) Audit requirements in § 600.126.
(4) Property management requirements in §§ 600.131 through 600.137.
(5) Records retention as required in § 600.153.
(b) After closeout of an award, a relationship created under an award may be modified or ended in whole or in part with the consent of DOE and the recipient, provided the responsibilities of the recipient referred to in paragraph 600.173(a), including those for property management as applicable, are considered and provisions made for continuing responsibilities of the recipient, as appropriate.
§ 600.173
Collection of amounts due.
(a) Any funds paid to a recipient in excess of the amount to which the recipient is finally determined to be entitled under the terms and conditions of the award constitute a debt to the Federal Government. If not paid within a reasonable period after the demand for payment, DOE may reduce the debt by paragraph (a) (1), (2) or (3) of this section.
(1) Making an administrative offset against other requests for reimbursements.
(2) Withholding advance payments otherwise due to the recipient.
(3) Taking other action permitted by statute.
(b) Except as otherwise provided by law, DOE shall charge interest on an overdue debt in accordance with 4 CFR Chapter II, “Federal Claims Collection Standards.”

Government
means a State or local government or a federally recognized Indian tribal government.
Grant

The term does not include technical assistance which provides services instead of money, or other assistance in the form of revenue sharing, loans, loan guarantees, interest subsidies, insurance, or direct appropriations. Also, the term does not include assistance, such as a fellowship or other lump sum award, which the grantee is not required to account for.

provided. The grantee is the entire legal entity even if only a particular component of the entity is designated in the grant award document.
Local government
means a county, municipality, city, town, township, local public authority (including any public and Indian housing agency under the United States Housing Act of 1937) school district, special district, intrastate district, council of governments (whether or not incorporated as a nonprofit corporation under state law), any other regional or interstate government entity, or any agency or instrumentality of a local government.

For reports prepared on an accrued expenditure basis, outlays are the sum of actual cash disbursements, the amount of indirect expense incurred, the value of inkind contributions applied, and the new increase (or decrease) in the amounts owed by the grantee for goods and other property received, for services performed by employees, contractors, subgrantees, subcontractors, and other payees, and other amounts becoming owed under programs for which no current services or performance are required, such as annuities, insurance claims, and other benefit payments.
Percentage of completion method
refers to a system under which payments are made for construction work according to the percentage of completion of the work, rather than to the grantee's cost incurred.
Prior approval
means documentation evidencing consent prior to incurring specific cost. For the Department of Energy, this must be signed by a Contracting Officer.
Real property
means land, including land improvements, structures and appurtenances thereto, excluding movable machinery and equipment.
Share,
when referring to the awarding agency's portion of real property, equipment or supplies, means the same percentage as the awarding agency's portion of the acquiring party's total costs under the grant to which the acquisition costs under the grant to which the acquisition cost of the property was charged. Only costs are to be counted—not the value of third-party in-kind contributions.
State
means any of the several States of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, any territory or possession of the United States, or any agency or instrumentality of a State exclusive of local governments. The term does not include any public and Indian housing agency under United States Housing Act of 1937.
Subgrant
means an award of financial assistance in the form of money, or property in lieu of money, made under a grant by a grantee to an eligible subgrantee.

grant
in this subpart.
Subgrantee
means the government or other legal entity to which a subgrant is awarded and which is accountable to the grantee for the use of the funds provided.
Supplies
means all tangible personal property other than “equipment” as defined in this subpart.
Suspension
means depending on the context, either (1) temporary withdrawal of the authority to obligate grant funds pending corrective action by the grantee or subgrantee or a decision to terminate the grant, or (2) an action taken by a suspending official in accordance with agency regulations
implementing E.O. 12549 to immediately exclude a person from participating in grant transactions for a period, pending completion of an investigation and such legal or debarment proceedings as may ensue.
Termination
means permanent withdrawal of the authority to obligate previously-awarded grant funds before that authority would otherwise expire. It also means the voluntary relinquishment of that authority by the grantee or subgrantee.
Termination
does not include: (1) Withdrawal of funds awarded on the basis of the grantee's underestimate of the unobligated balance in a prior period; (2) withdrawal of the unobligated balance as of the expiration of a grant; (3) refusal to extend a grant or award additional funds, to make a competing or noncompeting continuation, renewal, extension, or supplemental award; or (4) voiding of a grant upon determination that the award was obtained fraudulently, or was otherwise illegal or invalid from inception.
Terms of a grant or subgrant
mean all requirements of the grant or subgrant, whether in statute, regulations, or the award document.
Third party in-kind contributions
mean property or services which benefit a federally assisted project or program and which are contributed by non-Federal third parties without charge to the grantee, or a cost-type contractor under the grant agreement.
Unliquidated obligations
for reports prepared on a cash basis mean the amount of obligations incurred by the grantee that has not been paid. For reports prepared on an accrued expenditure basis, they represent the amount of obligations incurred by the grantee for which an outlay has not been recorded.
Unobligated balance
means the portion of the funds authorized by the Federal agency that has not been obligated by the grantee and is determined by deducting the cumulative obligations from the cumulative funds authorized.

Forms for applying for grants.
(a)
Scope.
(1) This section prescribes forms and instructions to be used by governmental organizations (except hospitals and institutions of higher education operated by a government) in applying for grants. This section is not applicable, however, to formula grant programs which do not require applicants to apply for funds on a project basis.

# Post-Award Requirements

# Financial Administration
§ 600.220
Standards for financial management systems.
(a) A State must expend and account for grant funds in accordance with State laws and procedures for expending and accounting for its own funds. Fiscal control and accounting procedures of the State, as well as its subgrantees and cost-type contractors, must be sufficient to—
(1) Permit preparation of reports required by this part and the statutes authorizing the grant, and
(2) Permit the tracing of funds to a level of expenditures adequate to establish that such funds have not been used in violation of the restrictions and prohibitions of applicable statutes.
(b) The financial management systems of other grantees and subgrantees must meet the following standards:
(1)
Financial reporting.
Accurate, current, and complete disclosure of the financial results of financially assisted activities must be made in accordance with the financial reporting requirements of the grant or subgrant.
(2)
Accounting records.
Grantees and subgrantees must maintain records which adequately identify the source and application of funds provided for financially-assisted activities. These records must contain information pertaining to grant or subgrant awards and authorizations, obligations, unobligated balances, assets, liabilities, outlays or expenditures, and income.
(3)
Internal control.
Effective control and accountability must be maintained for all grant and subgrant cash, real and personal property, and other assets. Grantees and subgrantees must adequately safeguard all such property and must assure that it is used solely for authorized purposes.
(4)
Budget control.
Actual expenditures or outlays must be compared with budgeted amounts for each grant or subgrant. Financial information must be related to performance or productivity data, including the development of unit cost information whenever appropriate or specifically required in the grant or subgrant agreement. If unit cost data are required, estimates based on available documentation will be accepted whenever possible.
(5)
Allowable cost.
Applicable OMB cost principles, agency program regulations, and the terms of grant and subgrant agreements will be followed in determining the reasonableness, allowability, and allocability of costs.
(6)
Source documentation.
Accounting records must be supported by such source documentation as cancelled checks, paid bills, payrolls, time and attendance records, contract and subgrant award documents, etc.
(7)
Cash management.
Procedures for minimizing the time elapsing between the transfer of funds from the U.S. Treasury and disbursement by grantees and subgrantees must be followed whenever advance payment procedures are used. Grantees must establish reasonable procedures to ensure the receipt of reports on subgrantees' cash balances and cash disbursements in sufficient time to enable them to prepare complete and accurate cash transactions reports to the awarding agency. When advances are made by letter-of-credit or electronic transfer of funds methods, the grantee must make drawdowns as close as possible to the time of making disbursements. Grantees must monitor cash drawdowns by their subgrantees to assure that they conform substantially to the same standards of timing and amount as apply to advances to the grantees.
(c) An awarding agency may review the adequacy of the financial management system of any applicant for financial assistance as part of a preaward review or at any time subsequent to award.
[53 FR 8045, 8087, Mar. 11, 1988, as amended at 57 FR 5, Jan. 2, 1992]
§ 600.221
Payment.
(a)
Scope.
This section prescribes the basic standard and the methods under
which a Federal agency will make payments to grantees, and grantees will make payments to subgrantees and contractors.
(b)
Basic standard.
Methods and procedures for payment shall minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds and disbursement by the grantee or subgrantee, in accordance with Treasury regulations at 31 CFR part 205.
(c)
Advances.
Grantees and subgrantees shall be paid in advance, provided they maintain or demonstrate the willingness and ability to maintain procedures to minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of the funds and their disbursement by the grantee or subgrantee.
(d)
Reimbursement.
Reimbursement shall be the preferred method when the requirements in paragraph (c) of this section are not met. Grantees and subgrantees may also be paid by reimbursement for any construction grant. Except as otherwise specified in regulation, Federal agencies shall not use the percentage of completion method to pay construction grants. The grantee or subgrantee may use that method to pay its construction contractor, and if it does, the awarding agency's payments to the grantee or subgrantee will be based on the grantee's or subgrantee's actual rate of disbursement.
(e)
Working capital advances.
If a grantee cannot meet the criteria for advance payments described in paragraph (c) of this section, and the Federal agency has determined that reimbursement is not feasible because the grantee lacks sufficient working capital, the awarding agency may provide cash or a working capital advance basis. Under this procedure the awarding agency shall advance cash to the grantee to cover its estimated disbursement needs for an initial period generally geared to the grantee's disbursing cycle. Thereafter, the awarding agency shall reimburse the grantee for its actual cash disbursements. The working capital advance method of payment shall not be used by grantees or subgrantees if the reason for using such method is the unwillingness or inability of the grantee to provide timely advances to the subgrantee to meet the subgrantee's actual cash disbursements.
(f)
Effect of program income, refunds, and audit recoveries on payment.
(1) Grantees and subgrantees shall disburse repayments to and interest earned on a revolving fund before requesting additional cash payments for the same activity.
(2) Except as provided in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, grantees and subgrantees shall disburse program income, rebates, refunds, contract settlements, audit recoveries and interest earned on such funds before requesting additional cash payments.
(g)
Withholding payments.
(1) Unless otherwise required by Federal statute, awarding agencies shall not withhold payments for proper charges incurred by grantees or subgrantees unless—
(i) The grantee or subgrantee has failed to comply with grant award conditions or
(ii) The grantee or subgrantee is indebted to the United States.
(2) Cash withheld for failure to comply with grant award condition, but without suspension of the grant, shall be released to the grantee upon subsequent compliance. When a grant is suspended, payment adjustments will be made in accordance with § 600.243(c).
(3) A Federal agency shall not make payment to grantees for amounts that are withheld by grantees or subgrantees from payment to contractors to assure satisfactory completion of work. Payments shall be made by the Federal agency when the grantees or subgrantees actually disburse the withheld funds to the contractors or to escrow accounts established to assure satisfactory completion of work.
(h)
Cash depositories.
(1) Consistent with the national goal of expanding the opportunities for minority business enterprises, grantees and subgrantees are encouraged to use minority banks (a bank which is owned at least 50 percent by minority group members). A list of minority owned banks can be obtained from the Minority Business Development Agency, Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230.
(2) A grantee or subgrantee shall maintain a separate bank account only when required by Federal-State agreement.
(i)
Interest earned on advances.
Unless there are statutory provisions to the contrary, grantees and subgrantees shall promptly, but at least quarterly, remit to the Federal agency interest earned on advances. The grantee or subgrantee may keep interest amounts up to $100 per year for administrative expenses.
[53 FR 8045, 8087, Mar. 11, 1988, as amended at 57 FR 5, Jan. 2, 1992; 61 FR 7165, Feb. 26, 1996]

Allowable costs.
(a)
Limitation on use of funds.
Grant funds may be used only for:
(1) The allowable costs of the grantees, subgrantees and cost-type contractors, including allowable costs in the form of payments to fixed-price contractors; and
(2) Reasonable fees or profit to cost-type contractors but not any fee or profit (or other increment above allowable costs) to the grantee or subgrantee.
(b)
Applicable cost principles.
For each kind of organization, there is a set of Federal principles for determining allowable costs. Allowable costs will be determined in accordance with the cost principles applicable to the organization incurring the costs. The following chart lists the kinds of organizations and the applicable cost principles.
For the costs of a—

§ 600.223
Period of availability of funds.
(a)
General.
Where a funding period is specified, a grantee may charge to the award only costs resulting from obligations of the funding period unless carryover of unobligated balances is permitted, in which case the carryover balances may be charged for costs resulting from obligations of the subsequent funding period.
(b)
Liquidation of obligations.
A grantee must liquidate all obligations incurred under the award not later than 90 days after the end of the funding period (or as specified in a program regulation) to coincide with the submission of the annual Financial Status Report (SF-269). The Federal agency may extend this deadline at the request of the grantee.
§ 600.224
Matching or cost sharing.
(a)
Basic rule: Costs and contributions acceptable.
With the qualifications and exceptions listed in paragraph (b) of this section, a matching or cost sharing requirement may be satisfied by either or both of the following:
(1) Allowable costs incurred by the grantee, subgrantee or a cost-type contractor under the assistance agreement. This includes allowable costs borne by non-Federal grants or by others cash donations from non-Federal third parties.
(2) The value of third party in-kind contributions applicable to the period to which the cost sharing or matching requirements applies.
(b)
Qualifications and exceptions
—(1)
Costs borne by other Federal grant agreements.
Except as provided by Federal statute, a cost sharing or matching requirement may not be met by costs borne by another Federal grant. This prohibition does not apply to income earned by a grantee or subgrantee from a contract awarded under another Federal grant.
(2)
General revenue sharing.
For the purpose of this section, general revenue sharing funds distributed under 31 U.S.C. 6702 are not considered Federal grant funds.
(3)
Cost or contributions counted towards other Federal costs-sharing requirements.
Neither costs nor the values of third party in-kind contributions may
count towards satisfying a cost sharing or matching requirement of a grant agreement if they have been or will be counted towards satisfying a cost sharing or matching requirement of another Federal grant agreement, a Federal procurement contract, or any other award of Federal funds.
(4)
Costs financed by program income.
Costs financed by program income, as defined in § 600.425, shall not count towards satisfying a cost sharing or matching requirement unless they are expressly permitted in the terms of the assistance agreement. (This use of general program income is described in § 600.225(g).)
(5)
Services or property financed by income earned by contractors.
Contractors under a grant may earn income from the activities carried out under the contract in addition to the amounts earned from the party awarding the contract. No costs of services or property supported by this income may count toward satisfying a cost sharing or matching requirement unless other provisions of the grant agreement expressly permit this kind of income to be used to meet the requirement.
(6)
Records.
Costs and third party in-kind contributions counting towards satisfying a cost sharing or matching requirement must be verifiable from the records of grantees and subgrantee or cost-type contractors. These records must show how the value placed on third party in-kind contributions was derived. To the extent feasible, volunteer services will be supported by the same methods that the organization uses to support the allocability of regular personnel costs.
(7)
Special standards for third party in-kind contributions.
(i) Third party in-kind contributions count towards satisfying a cost sharing or matching requirement only where, if the party receiving the contributions were to pay for them, the payments would be allowable costs.
(ii) Some third party in-kind contributions are goods and services that, if the grantee, subgrantee, or contractor receiving the contribution had to pay for them, the payments would have been an indirect costs. Cost sharing or matching credit for such contributions shall be given only if the grantee, subgrantee, or contractor has established, along with its regular indirect cost rate, a special rate for allocating to individual projects or programs the value of the contributions.
(iii) A third party in-kind contribution to a fixed-price contract may count towards satisfying a cost sharing or matching requirement only if it results in:
(A) An increase in the services or property provided under the contract (without additional cost to the grantee or subgrantee) or
(B) A cost savings to the grantee or subgrantee.
(iv) The values placed on third party in-kind contributions for cost sharing or matching purposes will conform to the rules in the succeeding sections of this subpart. If a third party in-kind contribution is a type not treated in those sections, the value placed upon it shall be fair and reasonable.
(c)
Valuation of donated services
—(1)
Volunteer services.
Unpaid services provided to a grantee or subgrantee by individuals will be valued at rates consistent with those ordinarily paid for similar work in the grantee's or subgrantee's organization. If the grantee or subgrantee does not have employees performing similar work, the rates will be consistent with those ordinarily paid by other employers for similar work in the same labor market. In either case, a reasonable amount for fringe benefits may be included in the valuation.
(2)
Employees of other organizations.
When an employer other than a grantee, subgrantee, or cost-type contractor furnishes free of charge the services of an employee in the employee's normal line of work, the services will be valued at the employee's regular rate of pay exclusive of the employee's fringe benefits and overhead costs. If the services are in a different line of work, paragraph (c)(1) of this section applies.
(d)
Valuation of third party donated supplies and loaned equipment or space.
(1) If a third party donates supplies, the contribution will be valued at the market value of the supplies at the time of donation.
(2) If a third party donates the use of equipment or space in a building but retains title, the contribution will be
valued at the fair rental rate of the equipment or space.
(e)
Valuation of third party donated equipment, buildings, and land.
If a third party donates equipment, buildings, or land, and title passes to a grantee or subgrantee, the treatment of the donated property will depend upon the purpose of the grant or subgrant, as follows:
(1)
Awards for capital expenditures.
If the purpose of the grant or subgrant is to assist the grantee or subgrantee in the acquisition of property, the market value of that property at the time of donation may be counted as cost sharing or matching,
(2)
Other awards.
If assisting in the acquisition of property is not the purpose of the grant or subgrant, paragraphs (e)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section apply:
(i) If approval is obtained from the awarding agency, the market value at the time of donation of the donated equipment or buildings and the fair rental rate of the donated land may be counted as cost sharing or matching. In the case of a subgrant, the terms of the grant agreement may require that the approval be obtained from the Federal agency as well as the grantee. In all cases, the approval may be given only if a purchase of the equipment or rental of the land would be approved as an allowable direct cost. If any part of the donated property was acquired with Federal funds, only the non-federal share of the property may be counted as cost-sharing or matching.
(ii) If approval is not obtained under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, no amount may be counted for donated land, and only depreciation or use allowances may be counted for donated equipment and buildings. The depreciation or use allowances for this property are not treated as third party in-kind contributions. Instead, they are treated as costs incurred by the grantee or subgrantee. They are computed and allocated (usually as indirect costs) in accordance with the cost principles specified in § 600.222, in the same way as depreciation or use allowances for purchased equipment and buildings. The amount of depreciation or use allowances for donated equipment and buildings is based on the property's market value at the time it was donated.
(f)
Valuation of grantee or subgrantee donated real property for construction/acquisition.
If a grantee or subgrantee donates real property for a construction or facilities acquisition project, the current market value of that property may be counted as cost sharing or matching. If any part of the donated property was acquired with Federal funds, only the non-federal share of the property may be counted as cost sharing or matching.
(g)
Appraisal of real property.
In some cases under paragraphs (d), (e) and (f) of this section, it will be necessary to establish the market value of land or a building or the fair rental rate of land or of space in a building. In these cases, the Federal agency may require the market value or fair rental value be set by an independent appraiser, and that the value or rate be certified by the grantee. This requirement will also be imposed by the grantee on subgrantees.
[53 FR 8045, 8087, Mar. 11, 1988, as amended at 57 FR 5, Jan. 2, 1992; 61 FR 7165, Feb. 26, 1996]
§ 600.225
Program income.
(a)
General.
Grantees are encouraged to earn income to defray program costs. Program income includes income from fees for services performed, from the use or rental of real or personal property acquired with grant funds, from the sale of commodities or items fabricated under a grant agreement, and from payments of principal and interest on loans made with grant funds. Except as otherwise provided in regulations of the Federal agency, program income does not include interest on grant funds, rebates, credits, discounts, refunds, etc. and interest earned on any of them.
(b)
Definition of program income.
Program income means gross income received by the grantee or subgrantee directly generated by a grant supported activity, or earned only as a result of the grant agreement during the grant period. “During the grant period” is the time between the effective date of the award and the ending date of the award reflected in the final financial report.
(c)
Cost of generating program income.
If authorized by Federal regulations or
the grant agreement, costs incident to the generation of program income may be deducted from gross income to determine program income.
(d)
Governmental revenues.
Taxes, special assessments, levies, fines, and other such revenues raised by a grantee or subgrantee are not program income unless the revenues are specifically identified in the grant agreement or Federal agency regulations as program income.
(e)
Royalties.
Income from royalties and license fees for copyrighted material, patents, and inventions developed by a grantee or subgrantee is program income only if the revenues are specifically identified in the grant agreement or Federal agency regulations as program income. (See § 600.234.)
(f)
Property.
Proceeds from the sale of real property or equipment will be handled in accordance with the requirements of §§ 600.231 and 600.232.
(g)
Use of program income.
Program income shall be deducted from outlays which may be both Federal and non-Federal as described below, unless the Federal agency regulations or the grant agreement specify another alternative (or a combination of the alternatives). In specifying alternatives, the Federal agency may distinguish between income earned by the grantee and income earned by subgrantees and between the sources, kinds, or amounts of income. When Federal agencies authorize the alternatives in paragraphs (g) (2) and (3) of this section, program income in excess of any limits stipulated shall also be deducted from outlays.
(1)
Deduction.
Ordinarily program income shall be deducted from total allowable costs to determine the net allowable costs. Program income shall be used for current costs unless the Federal agency authorizes otherwise. Program income which the grantee did not anticipate at the time of the award shall be used to reduce the Federal agency and grantee contributions rather than to increase the funds committed to the project.
(2)
Addition.
When authorized, program income may be added to the funds committed to the grant agreement by the Federal agency and the grantee. The program income shall be used for the purposes and under the conditions of the grant agreement.
(3)
Cost sharing or matching.
When authorized, program income may be used to meet the cost sharing or matching requirement of the grant agreement. The amount of the Federal grant award remains the same.
(h)
Income after the award period.
There are no Federal requirements governing the disposition of program income earned after the end of the award period (i.e., until the ending date of the final financial report, see paragraph (a) of this section), unless the terms of the agreement or the Federal agency regulations provide otherwise.

§ 600.226
Non-Federal audit.
(a)
Basic rule.
Grantees and subgrantees are responsible for obtaining audits in accordance with the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 (31 U.S.C. 7501-7507) and revised OMB Circular A-133, “Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations.” The audits shall be made by an independent auditor in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards covering financial audits.
(b)
Subgrantees.
State or local governments, as those terms are defined for purposes of the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996, that provide Federal awards to a subgrantee, which expends $300,000 or more (or other amount as specified by OMB) in Federal awards in a fiscal year, shall:
(1) Determine whether State or local subgrantees have met the audit requirements of the Act and whether subgrantees covered by OMB Circular A-110, “Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Agreements with Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals, and Other Non-Profit Organizations,” have met the audit requirements of the Act. Commercial contractors (private for-profit and private and governmental organizations) providing goods and services to State and local governments are not required to have a single audit performed. State and local governments should use their own procedures to ensure that the contractor
has complied with laws and regulations affecting the expenditure of Federal funds;
(2) Determine whether the subgrantee spent Federal assistance funds provided in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. This may be accomplished by reviewing an audit of the subgrantee made in accordance with the Act, Circular A-110, or through other means (e.g., program reviews) if the subgrantee has not had such an audit;
(3) Ensure that appropriate corrective action is taken within six months after receipt of the audit report in instance of noncompliance with Federal laws and regulations;
(4) Consider whether subgrantee audits necessitate adjustment of the grantee's own records; and
(5) Require each subgrantee to permit independent auditors to have access to the records and financial statements.
(c)
Auditor selection.
In arranging for audit services, § 600.236 shall be followed.
[53 FR 8045, 8087, Mar. 11, 1988. Redesignated at 59 FR 53264, Oct. 21, 1994, as amended at 61 FR 7166, Feb. 26, 1996; 62 FR 45939, 45940, Aug. 29, 1997]

# Changes, Property, and Subawards
§ 600.230
Changes.
(a)
General.
Grantees and subgrantees are permitted to rebudget within the approved direct cost budget to meet unanticipated requirements and may make limited program changes to the approved project. However, unless waived by the awarding agency, certain types of post-award changes in budgets and projects shall require the prior written approval of the awarding agency.
(b)
Relation to cost principles.
The applicable cost principles (see § 600.222) contain requirements for prior approval of certain types of costs. Except where waived, those requirements apply to all grants and subgrants even if paragraphs (c) through (f) of this section do not.
(c)
Budget changes
—(1)
Nonconstruction projects.
Except as stated in other regulations or an award document, grantees or subgrantees shall obtain the prior approval of the awarding agency whenever any of the following changes is anticipated under a nonconstruction award:
(i) Any revision which would result in the need for additional funding.
(ii) Unless waived by the awarding agency, cumulative transfers among direct cost categories, or, if applicable, among separately budgeted programs, projects, functions, or activities which exceed or are expected to exceed ten percent of the current total approved budget, whenever the awarding agency's share exceeds $100,000.
(iii) Transfer of funds allotted for training allowances (i.e., from direct payments to trainees to other expense categories).
(2)
Construction projects.
Grantees and subgrantees shall obtain prior written approval for any budget revision which would result in the need for additional funds.
(3)
Combined construction and nonconstruction projects.
When a grant or subgrant provides funding for both construction and nonconstruction activities, the grantee or subgrantee must obtain prior written approval from the awarding agency before making any fund or budget transfer from nonconstruction to construction or vice versa.
(d)
Programmatic changes.
Grantees or subgrantees must obtain the prior approval of the awarding agency whenever any of the following actions is anticipated:
(1) Any revision of the scope or objectives of the project (regardless of whether there is an associated budget revision requiring prior approval).
(2) Need to extend the period of availability of funds.
(3) Changes in key persons in cases where specified in an application or a grant award. In research projects, a change in the project director or principal investigator shall always require approval unless waived by the awarding agency.
(4) Under nonconstruction projects, contracting out, subgranting (if authorized by law) or otherwise obtaining the services of a third party to perform activities which are central to the purposes of the award. This approval requirement is in addition to the approval requirements of § 600.236 but
does not apply to the procurement of equipment, supplies, and general support services.
(e)
Additional prior approval requirements.
The awarding agency may not require prior approval for any budget revision which is not described in paragraph (c) of this section.
(f)
Requesting prior approval.
(1) A request for prior approval of any budget revision will be in the same budget formal the grantee used in its application and shall be accompanied by a narrative justification for the proposed revision.
(2) A request for a prior approval under the applicable Federal cost principles (see § 600.222) may be made by letter.
(3) A request by a subgrantee for prior approval will be addressed in writing to the grantee. The grantee will promptly review such request and shall approve or disapprove the request in writing. A grantee will not approve any budget or project revision which is inconsistent with the purpose or terms and conditions of the Federal grant to the grantee. If the revision, requested by the subgrantee would result in a change to the grantee's approved project which requires Federal prior approval, the grantee will obtain the Federal agency's approval before approving the subgrantee's request.
[53 FR 8045, 8087, Mar. 11, 1988. Redesignated at 59 FR 53264, Oct. 21, 1994, as amended at 61 FR 7166, Feb. 26, 1996]
§ 600.231
Real property.
(a)
Title.
Subject to the obligations and conditions set forth in this section, title to real property acquired under a grant or subgrant will vest upon acquisition in the grantee or subgrantee respectively.
(b)
Use.
Except as otherwise provided by Federal statutes, real property will be used for the originally authorized purposes as long as needed for that purposes, and the grantee or subgrantee shall not dispose of or encumber its title or other interests.
(c)
Disposition.
When real property is no longer needed for the originally authorized purpose, the grantee or subgrantee will request disposition instructions from the awarding agency. The instructions will provide for one of the following alternatives:
(1)
Retention of title.
Retain title after compensating the awarding agency. The amount paid to the awarding agency will be computed by applying the awarding agency's percentage of participation in the cost of the original purchase to the fair market value of the property. However, in those situations where a grantee or subgrantee is disposing of real property acquired with grant funds and acquiring replacement real property under the same program, the net proceeds from the disposition may be used as an offset to the cost of the replacement property.
(2)
Sale of property.
Sell the property and compensate the awarding agency. The amount due to the awarding agency will be calculated by applying the awarding agency's percentage of participation in the cost of the original purchase to the proceeds of the sale after deduction of any actual and reasonable selling and fixing-up expenses. If the grant is still active, the net proceeds from sale may be offset against the original cost of the property. When a grantee or subgrantee is directed to sell property, sales procedures shall be followed that provide for competition to the extent practicable and result in the highest possible return.
(3)
Transfer of title.
Transfer title to the awarding agency or to a third-party designated/approved by the awarding agency. The grantee or subgrantee shall be paid an amount calculated by applying the grantee or subgrantee's percentage of participation in the purchase of the real property to the current fair market value of the property.
§ 600.232
Equipment.
(a)
Title.
Subject to the obligations and conditions set forth in this section, title to equipment acquired under a grant or subgrant will vest upon acquisition in the grantee or subgrantee respectively.
(b)
States.
A State will use, manage, and dispose of equipment acquired under a grant by the State in accordance with State laws and procedures. Other grantees and subgrantees will follow paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section.
(c)
Use.
(1) Equipment shall be used by the grantee or subgrantee in the program or project for which it was acquired as long as needed, whether or not the project or program continues to be supported by Federal funds. When no longer needed for the original program or project, the equipment may be used in other activities currently or previously supported by a Federal agency.
(2) The grantee or subgrantee shall also make equipment available for use on other projects or programs currently or previously supported by the Federal Government, providing such use will not interfere with the work on the projects or program for which it was originally acquired. First preference for other use shall be given to other programs or projects supported by the awarding agency. User fees should be considered if appropriate.
(3) Notwithstanding the encouragement in § 600.225(a) to earn program income, the grantee or subgrantee must not use equipment acquired with grant funds to provide services for a fee to compete unfairly with private companies that provide equivalent services, unless specifically permitted or contemplated by Federal statute.
(4) When acquiring replacement equipment, the grantee or subgrantee may use the equipment to be replaced as a trade-in or sell the property and use the proceeds to offset the cost of the replacement property, subject to the approval of the awarding agency.
(d)
Management requirements.
Procedures for managing equipment (including replacement equipment), whether acquired in whole or in part with grant funds, until disposition takes place will, as a minimum, meet the following requirements:
(1) Property records must be maintained that include a description of the property, a serial number or other identification number, the source of property, who holds title, the acquisition date, and cost of the property, percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the property, the location, use and condition of the property, and any ultimate disposition data including the date of disposal and sale price of the property.
(2) A physical inventory of the property must be taken and the results reconciled with the property records at least once every two years.
(3) A control system must be developed to ensure adequate safeguards to prevent loss, damage, or theft of the property. Any loss, damage, or theft shall be investigated.
(4) Adequate maintenance procedures must be developed to keep the property in good condition.
(5) If the grantee or subgrantee is authorized or required to sell the property, proper sales procedures must be established to ensure the highest possible return.
(e)
Disposition.
When original or replacement equipment acquired under a grant or subgrant is no longer needed for the original project or program or for other activities currently or previously supported by a Federal agency, disposition of the equipment will be made as follows:
(1) Items of equipment with a current per-unit fair market value of less than $5,000 may be retained, sold or otherwise disposed of with no further obligation to the awarding agency.
(2) Items of equipment with a current per unit fair market value in excess of $5,000 may be retained or sold and the awarding agency shall have a right to an amount calculated by multiplying the current market value or proceeds from sale by the awarding agency's share of the equipment.
(3) In cases where a grantee or subgrantee fails to take appropriate disposition actions, the awarding agency may direct the grantee or subgrantee to take excess and disposition actions.
(f)
Federal equipment.
In the event a grantee or subgrantee is provided federally-owned equipment:
(1) Title will remain vested in the Federal Government.
(2) Grantees or subgrantees will manage the equipment in accordance with Federal agency rules and procedures, and submit an annual inventory listing.
(3) When the equipment is no longer needed, the grantee or subgrantee will request disposition instructions from the Federal agency.
(g)
Right to transfer title.
The Federal awarding agency may reserve the right
to transfer title to the Federal Government or a third party named by the awarding agency when such a third party is otherwise eligible under existing statutes. Such transfers shall be subject to the following standards:
(1) The property shall be identified in the grant or otherwise made known to the grantee in writing.
(2) The Federal awarding agency shall issue disposition instructions within 120 calendar days after the end of the Federal support of the project for which it was acquired. If the Federal awarding agency fails to issue disposition instructions within the 120 calendar-day period the grantee shall follow § 600.232(e).
(3) When title to equipment is transferred, the grantee shall be paid an amount calculated by applying the percentage of participation in the purchase to the current fair market value of the property.
[53 FR 8045, 8087, Mar. 11, 1988. Redesignated at 59 FR 53264, Oct. 21, 1994, as amended at 61 FR 7166, Feb. 26, 1996]
§ 600.233
Supplies.
(a)
Title.
Title to supplies acquired under a grant or subgrant will vest, upon acquisition, in the grantee or subgrantee respectively.
(b)
Disposition.
If there is a residual inventory of unused supplies exceeding $5,000 in total aggregate fair market value upon termination or completion of the award, and if the supplies are not needed for any other federally sponsored programs or projects, the grantee or subgrantee shall compensate the awarding agency for its share.
§ 600.234
Copyrights.
The Federal awarding agency reserves a royalty-free, nonexclusive, and irrevocable license to reproduce, publish or otherwise use, and to authorize others to use, for Federal Government purposes:
(a) The copyright in any work developed under a grant, subgrant, or contract under a grant or subgrant; and
(b) Any rights of copyright to which a grantee, subgrantee or a contractor purchases ownership with grant support.
§ 600.235
Subawards to debarred and suspended parties.
Grantees and subgrantees must not make any award or permit any award (subgrant or contract) at any tier to any party which is debarred or suspended or is otherwise excluded from or ineligible for participation in Federal assistance programs under Executive Order 12549, “Debarment and Suspension.”
§ 600.236
Procurement.
(a)
States.
When procuring property and services under a grant, a State will follow the same policies and procedures it uses for procurements from its non-Federal funds. The State will ensure that every purchase order or other contract includes any clauses required by Federal statutes and executive orders and their implementing regulations. Other grantees and subgrantees will follow paragraphs (b) through (i) in this section.
(b)
Procurement standards.
(1) Grantees and subgrantees will use their own procurement procedures which reflect applicable State and local laws and regulations, provided that the procurements conform to applicable Federal law and the standards identified in this section.
(2) Grantees and subgrantees will maintain a contract administration system which ensures that contractors perform in accordance with the terms, conditions, and specifications of their contracts or purchase orders.
(3) Grantees and subgrantees will maintain a written code of standards of conduct governing the performance of their employees engaged in the award and administration of contracts. No employee, officer or agent of the grantee or subgrantee shall participate in selection, or in the award or administration of a contract supported by Federal funds if a conflict of interest, real or apparent, would be involved. Such a conflict would arise when:
(i) The employee, officer or agent,
(ii) Any member of his immediate family,
(iii) His or her partner, or
(iv) An organization which employs, or is about to employ, any of the above, has a financial or other interest in the firm selected for award. The
grantee's or subgrantee's officers, employees or agents will neither solicit nor accept gratuities, favors or anything of monetary value from contractors, potential contractors, or parties to subagreements. Grantee and subgrantees may set minimum rules where the financial interest is not substantial or the gift is an unsolicited item of nominal intrinsic value. To the extent permitted by State or local law or regulations, such standards or conduct will provide for penalties, sanctions, or other disciplinary actions for violations of such standards by the grantee's and subgrantee's officers, employees, or agents, or by contractors or their agents. The awarding agency may in regulation provide additional prohibitions relative to real, apparent, or potential conflicts of interest.
(4) Grantee and subgrantee procedures will provide for a review of proposed procurements to avoid purchase of unnecessary or duplicative items. Consideration should be given to consolidating or breaking out procurements to obtain a more economical purchase. Where appropriate, an analysis will be made of lease versus purchase alternatives, and any other appropriate analysis to determine the most economical approach.
(5) To foster greater economy and efficiency, grantees and subgrantees are encouraged to enter into State and local intergovernmental agreements for procurement or use of common goods and services.
(6) Grantees and subgrantees are encouraged to use Federal excess and surplus property in lieu of purchasing new equipment and property whenever such use is feasible and reduces project costs.
(7) Grantees and subgrantees are encouraged to use value engineering clauses in contracts for construction projects of sufficient size to offer reasonable opportunities for cost reductions. Value engineering is a systematic and creative anaylsis of each contract item or task to ensure that its essential function is provided at the overall lower cost.
(8) Grantees and subgrantees will make awards only to responsible contractors possessing the ability to perform successfully under the terms and conditions of a proposed procurement. Consideration will be given to such matters as contractor integrity, compliance with public policy, record of past performance, and financial and technical resources.
(9) Grantees and subgrantees will maintain records sufficient to detail the significant history of a procurement. These records will include, but are not necessarily limited to the following: rationale for the method of procurement, selection of contract type, contractor selection or rejection, and the basis for the contract price.
(10) Grantees and subgrantees will use time and material type contracts only—
(i) After a determination that no other contract is suitable, and
(ii) If the contract includes a ceiling price that the contractor exceeds at its own risk.
(11) Grantees and subgrantees alone will be responsible, in accordance with good administrative practice and sound business judgment, for the settlement of all contractual and administrative issues arising out of procurements. These issues include, but are not limited to source evaluation, protests, disputes, and claims. These standards do not relieve the grantee or subgrantee of any contractual responsibilities under its contracts. Federal agencies will not substitute their judgment for that of the grantee or subgrantee unless the matter is primarily a Federal concern. Violations of law will be referred to the local, State, or Federal authority having proper jurisdiction.
(12) Grantees and subgrantees will have protest procedures to handle and resolve disputes relating to their procurements and shall in all instances disclose information regarding the protest to the awarding agency. A protestor must exhaust all administrative remedies with the grantee and subgrantee before pursuing a protest with the Federal agency. Reviews of protests by the Federal agency will be limited to:
(i) Violations of Federal law or regulations and the standards of this section (violations of State or local law will be under the jurisdiction of State or local authorities) and
(ii) Violations of the grantee's or subgrantee's protest procedures for failure to review a complaint or protest. Protests received by the Federal agency other than those specified above will be referred to the grantee or subgrantee.
(c)
Competition.
(1) All procurement transactions will be conducted in a manner providing full and open competition consistent with the standards of § 600.236. Some of the situations considered to be restrictive of competition include but are not limited to:
(i) Placing unreasonable requirements on firms in order for them to qualify to do business,
(ii) Requiring unnecessary experience and excessive bonding,
(iii) Noncompetitive pricing practices between firms or between affiliated companies,
(iv) Noncompetitive awards to consultants that are on retainer contracts,
(v) Organizational conflicts of interest,
(vi) Specifying only a “brand name” product instead of allowing “an equal” product to be offered and describing the performance of other relevant requirements of the procurement, and
(vii) Any arbitrary action in the procurement process.
(2) Grantees and subgrantees will conduct procurements in a manner that prohibits the use of statutorily or administratively imposed in-State or local geographical preferences in the evaluation of bids or proposals, except in those cases where applicable Federal statutes expressly mandate or encourage geographic preference. Nothing in this section preempts State licensing laws. When contracting for architectural and engineering (A/E) services, geographic location may be a selection criteria provided its application leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project, to compete for the contract.
(3) Grantees will have written selection procedures for procurement transactions. These procedures will ensure that all solicitations:
(i) Incorporate a clear and accurate description of the technical requirements for the material, product, or service to be procured. Such description shall not, in competitive procurements, contain features which unduly restrict competition. The description may include a statement of the qualitative nature of the material, product or service to be procured, and when necessary, shall set forth those minimum essential characteristics and standards to which it must conform if it is to satisfy its intended use. Detailed product specifications should be avoided if at all possible. When it is impractical or uneconomical to make a clear and accurate description of the technical requirements, a “brand name or equal” description may be used as a means to define the performance or other salient requirements of a procurement. The specific features of the named brand which must be met by offerors shall be clearly stated; and
(ii) Identify all requirements which the offerors must fulfill and all other factors to be used in evaluating bids or proposals.
(4) Grantees and subgrantees will ensure that all prequalified lists of persons, firms, or products which are used in acquiring goods and services are current and include enough qualified sources to ensure maximum open and free competition. Also, grantees and subgrantees will not preclude potential bidders from qualifying during the solicitation period.
(d)
Methods of procurement to be followed.
(1) Procurement by
small purchase procedures.
Small purchase procedures are those relatively simple and informal procurement methods for securing services, supplies, or other property that do not cost more than the simplified acquisition threshold fixed at 41 U.S.C. 403(11) (currently set at $100,000). If small purchase procedures are used, price or rate quotations shall be obtained from an adequate number of qualified sources.
(2) Procurement by
sealed bids
(formal advertising). Bids are publicly solicited and a firm-fixed-price contract (lump sum or unit price) is awarded to the responsible bidder whose bid, conforming with all the material terms and conditions of the invitation for bids, is the lowest in price. The sealed bid method is the preferred method for procuring construction, if the conditions in § 600.236(d)(2)(i) apply.
(i) In order for sealed bidding to be feasible, the following conditions should be present:
(A) A complete, adequate, and realistic specification or purchase description is available;
(B) Two or more responsible bidders are willing and able to compete effectively and for the business; and
(C) The procurement lends itself to a firm fixed price contract and the selection of the successful bidder can be made principally on the basis of price.
(ii) If sealed bids are used, the following requirements apply:
(A) The invitation for bids will be publicly advertised and bids shall be solicited from an adequate number of known suppliers, providing them sufficient time prior to the date set for opening the bids;
(B) The invitation for bids, which will include any specifications and pertinent attachments, shall define the items or services in order for the bidder to properly respond;
(C) All bids will be publicly opened at the time and place prescribed in the invitation for bids;
(D) A firm fixed-price contract award will be made in writing to the lowest responsive and responsible bidder. Where specified in bidding documents, factors such as discounts, transportation cost, and life cycle costs shall be considered in determining which bid is lowest. Payment discounts will only be used to determine the low bid when prior experience indicates that such discounts are usually taken advantage of; and
(E) Any or all bids may be rejected if there is a sound documented reason.
(3) Procurement by
competitive proposals.
The technique of competitive proposals is normally conducted with more than one source submitting an offer, and either a fixed-price or cost-reimbursement type contract is awarded. It is generally used when conditions are not appropriate for the use of sealed bids. If this method is used, the following requirements apply:
(i) Requests for proposals will be publicized and identify all evaluation factors and their relative importance. Any response to publicized requests for proposals shall be honored to the maximum extent practical;
(ii) Proposals will be solicited from an adequate number of qualified sources;
(iii) Grantees and subgrantees will have a method for conducting technical evaluations of the proposals received and for selecting awardees;
(iv) Awards will be made to the responsible firm whose proposal is most advantageous to the program, with price and other factors considered; and
(v) Grantees and subgrantees may use competitive proposal procedures for qualifications-based procurement of architectural/engineering (A/E) professional services whereby competitors' qualifications are evaluated and the most qualified competitor is selected, subject to negotiation of fair and reasonable compensation. The method, where price is not used as a selection factor, can only be used in procurement of A/E professional services. It cannot be used to purchase other types of services though A/E firms are a potential source to perform the proposed effort.
(4) Procurement by
noncompetitive proposals
is procurement through solicitation of a proposal from only one source, or after solicitation of a number of sources, competition is determined inadequate.
(i) Procurement by noncompetitive proposals may be used only when the award of a contract is infeasible under small purchase procedures, sealed bids or competitive proposals and one of the following circumstances applies:
(A) The item is available only from a single source;
(B) The public exigency or emergency for the requirement will not permit a delay resulting from competitive solicitation;
(C) The awarding agency authorizes noncompetitive proposals; or
(D) After solicitation of a number of sources, competition is determined inadequate.
(ii) Cost analysis, i.e., verifying the proposed cost data, the projections of the data, and the evaluation of the specific elements of costs and profits, is required.
(iii) Grantees and subgrantees may be required to submit the proposed procurement to the awarding agency for
pre-award review in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section.
(e)
Contracting with small and minority firms, women's business enterprise and labor surplus area firms.
(1) The grantee and subgrantee will take all necessary affirmative steps to assure that minority firms, women's business enterprises, and labor surplus area firms are used when possible.
(2) Affirmative steps shall include:
(i) Placing qualified small and minority businesses and women's business enterprises on solicitation lists;
(ii) Assuring that small and minority businesses, and women's business enterprises are solicited whenever they are potential sources;
(iii) Dividing total requirements, when economically feasible, into smaller tasks or quantities to permit maximum participation by small and minority business, and women's business enterprises;
(iv) Establishing delivery schedules, where the requirement permits, which encourage participation by small and minority business, and women's business enterprises;
(v) Using the services and assistance of the Small Business Administration, and the Minority Business Development Agency of the Department of Commerce; and
(vi) Requiring the prime contractor, if subcontracts are to be let, to take the affirmative steps listed in paragraphs (e)(2) (i) through (v) of this section.
(f)
Contract cost and price.
(1) Grantees and subgrantees must perform a cost or price analysis in connection with every procurement action including contract modifications. The method and degree of analysis is dependent on the facts surrounding the particular procurement situation, but as a starting point, grantees must make independent estimates before receiving bids or proposals. A cost analysis must be performed when the offeror is required to submit the elements of his estimated cost, e.g., under professional, consulting, and architectural engineering services contracts. A cost analysis will be necessary when adequate price competition is lacking, and for sole source procurements, including contract modifications or change orders, unless price resonableness can be established on the basis of a catalog or market price of a commercial product sold in substantial quantities to the general public or based on prices set by law or regulation. A price analysis will be used in all other instances to determine the reasonableness of the proposed contract price.
(2) Grantees and subgrantees will negotiate profit as a separate element of the price for each contract in which there is no price competition and in all cases where cost analysis is performed. To establish a fair and reasonable profit, consideration will be given to the complexity of the work to be performed, the risk borne by the contractor, the contractor's investment, the amount of subcontracting, the quality of its record of past performance, and industry profit rates in the surrounding geographical area for similar work.
(3) Costs or prices based on estimated costs for contracts under grants will be allowable only to the extent that costs incurred or cost estimates included in negotiated prices are consistent with Federal cost principles (see § 600.422). Grantees may reference their own cost principles that comply with the applicable Federal cost principles.
(4) The cost plus a percentage of cost and percentage of construction cost methods of contracting shall not be used.
(g)
Awarding agency review.
(1) Grantees and subgrantees must make available, upon request of the awarding agency, technical specifications on proposed procurements where the awarding agency believes such review is needed to ensure that the item and/or service specified is the one being proposed for purchase. This review generally will take place prior to the time the specification is incorporated into a solicitation document. However, if the grantee or subgrantee desires to have the review accomplished after a solicitation has been developed, the awarding agency may still review the specifications, with such review usually limited to the technical aspects of the proposed purchase.
(2) Grantees and subgrantees must on request make available for awarding agency pre-award review procurement
documents, such as requests for proposals or invitations for bids, independent cost estimates, etc. when:
(i) A grantee's or subgrantee's procurement procedures or operation fails to comply with the procurement standards in this section; or
(ii) The procurement is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold and is to be awarded without competition or only one bid or offer is received in response to a solicitation; or
(iii) The procurement, which is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold, specifies a “brand name” product; or
(iv) The proposed award is more than the simplified acquisition threshold and is to be awarded to other than the apparent low bidder under a sealed bid procurement; or
(v) A proposed contract modification changes the scope of a contract or increases the contract amount by more than the simplified acquisition threshold.
(3) A grantee or subgrantee will be exempt from the pre-award review in paragraph (g)(2) of this section if the awarding agency determines that its procurement systems comply with the standards of this section.
(i) A grantee or subgrantee may request that its procurement system be reviewed by the awarding agency to determine whether its system meets these standards in order for its system to be certified. Generally, these reviews shall occur where there is a continuous high-dollar funding, and third-party contracts are awarded on a regular basis.
(ii) A grantee or subgrantee may self-certify its procurement system. Such self-certification shall not limit the awarding agency's right to survey the system. Under a self-certification procedure, awarding agencies may wish to rely on written assurances from the grantee or subgrantee that it is complying with these standards. A grantee or subgrantee will cite specific procedures, regulations, standards, etc., as being in compliance with these requirements and have its system available for review.
(h)
Bonding requirements.
For construction or facility improvement contracts or subcontracts exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, the awarding agency may accept the bonding policy and requirements of the grantee or subgrantee provided the awarding agency has made a determination that the awarding agency's interest is adequately protected. If such a determination has not been made, the minimum requirements shall be as follows:
(1)
A bid guarantee from each bidder equivalent to five percent of the bid price.
The “bid guarantee” shall consist of a firm commitment such as a bid bond, certified check, or other negotiable instrument accompanying a bid as assurance that the bidder will, upon acceptance of his bid, execute such contractual documents as may be required within the time specified.
(2)
A performance bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent of the contract price.
A “performance bond” is one executed in connection with a contract to secure fulfillment of all the contractor's obligations under such contract.
(3)
A payment bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent of the contract price.
A “payment bond” is one executed in connection with a contract to assure payment as required by law of all persons supplying labor and material in the execution of the work provided for in the contract.
(i)
Contract provisions.
A grantee's and subgrantee's contracts must contain provisions in paragraph (i) of this section. Federal agencies are permitted to require changes, remedies, changed conditions, access and records retention, suspension of work, and other clauses approved by the Office of Federal Procurement Policy.
(1) Administrative, contractual, or legal remedies in instances where contractors violate or breach contract terms, and provide for such sanctions and penalties as may be appropriate. (Contracts more than the simplified acquisition threshold)
(2) Termination for cause and for convenience by the grantee or subgrantee including the manner by which it will be effected and the basis for settlement. (All contracts in excess of $10,000)
(3) Compliance with Executive Order 11246 of September 24, 1965, entitled “Equal Employment Opportunity,” as amended by Executive Order 11375 of October 13, 1967, and as supplemented in Department of Labor regulations (41 CFR chapter 60). (All construction contracts awarded in excess of $10,000 by grantees and their contractors or subgrantees)

(6) Compliance with Sections 103 and 107 of the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act (40 U.S.C. 327-330) as supplemented by Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR Part 5). (Construction contracts awarded by grantees and subgrantees in excess of $2000, and in excess of $2500 for other contracts which involve the employment of mechanics or laborers)
(7) Notice of awarding agency requirements and regulations pertaining to reporting.
(8) Notice of awarding agency requirements and regulations pertaining to patent rights with respect to any discovery or invention which arises or is developed in the course of or under such contract.
(9) Awarding agency requirements and regulations pertaining to copyrights and rights in data.
(10) Access by the grantee, the subgrantee, the Federal grantor agency, the Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their duly authorized representatives to any books, documents, papers, and records of the contractor which are directly pertinent to that specific contract for the purpose of making audit, examination, excerpts, and transcriptions.
(11) Retention of all required records for three years after grantees or subgrantees make final payments and all other pending matters are closed.
(12) Compliance with all applicable standards, orders, or requirements issued under section 306 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 1857(h)), section 508 of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1368), Executive Order 11738, and Environmental Protection Agency regulations (40 CFR part 15).

# Reports, Records Retention, and Enforcement
§ 600.240
Monitoring and reporting program performance.
(a)
Monitoring by grantees.
Grantees are responsible for managing the day-to-day operations of grant and subgrant supported activities. Grantees must monitor grant and subgrant supported activities to assure compliance with applicable Federal requirements and that performance goals are being achieved. Grantee monitoring must cover each program, function or activity.
(b)
Nonconstruction performance reports.
The Federal agency may, if it decides that performance information available from subsequent applications contains sufficient information to meet its programmatic needs, require the grantee to submit a performance report only upon expiration or termination of grant support. Unless waived by the Federal agency this report will be due on the same date as the final Financial Status Report.
(1) Grantees shall submit annual performance reports unless the awarding agency requires quarterly or semi-annual reports. However, performance reports will not be required more frequently than quarterly. Annual reports shall be due 90 days after the grant year, quarterly or semi-annual reports shall be due 30 days after the reporting period. The final performance report will be due 90 days after the expiration or termination of grant support. If a justified request is submitted by a grantee, the Federal agency may extend the due date for any performance report. Additionally, requirements for unnecessary performance reports may be waived by the Federal agency.
(2) Performance reports will contain, for each grant, brief information on the following:
(i) A comparison of actual accomplishments to the objectives established for the period. Where the output of the project can be quantified, a computation of the cost per unit of output may be required if that information will be useful.
(ii) The reasons for slippage if established objectives were not met.
(iii) Additional pertinent information including, when appropriate, analysis and explanation of cost overruns or high unit costs.
(3) Grantees will not be required to submit more than the original and two copies of performance reports.
(4) Grantees will adhere to the standards in this section in prescribing performance reporting requirements for subgrantees.
(c)
Construction performance reports.
For the most part, on-site technical inspections and certified percentage-of-completion data are relied on heavily by Federal agencies to monitor progress under construction grants and subgrants. The Federal agency will require additional formal performance reports only when considered necessary, and never more frequently than quarterly.
(d)
Significant developments.
Events may occur between the scheduled performance reporting dates which have significant impact upon the grant or subgrant supported activity. In such cases, the grantee must inform the Federal agency as soon as the following types of conditions become known:
(1) Problems, delays, or adverse conditions which will materially impair the ability to meet the objective of the award. This disclosure must include a statement of the action taken, or contemplated, and any assistance needed to resolve the situation.
(2) Favorable developments which enable meeting time schedules and objectives sooner or at less cost than anticipated or producing more beneficial results than originally planned.
(e) Federal agencies may make site visits as warranted by program needs.
(f)
Waivers, extensions.
(1) Federal agencies may waive any performance report required by this part if not needed.
(2) The grantee may waive any performance report from a subgrantee when not needed. The grantee may extend the due date for any performance report from a subgrantee if the grantee will still be able to meet its performance reporting obligations to the Federal agency.
§ 600.241
Financial reporting.
(a)
General.
(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (a) (2) and (5) of this section, grantees will use only the forms specified in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section, and such supplementary or other forms as may from time to time be authorized by OMB, for:
(i) Submitting financial reports to Federal agencies, or
(ii) Requesting advances or reimbursements when letters of credit are not used.
(2) Grantees need not apply the forms prescribed in this section in dealing with their subgrantees. However, grantees shall not impose more burdensome requirements on subgrantees.
(3) Grantees shall follow all applicable standard and supplemental Federal agency instructions approved by OMB to the extent required under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 for use in connection with forms specified in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section. Federal agencies may issue substantive supplementary instructions only with the approval of OMB. Federal agencies may shade out or instruct the grantee to disregard any line item that the Federal agency finds unnecessary for its decisionmaking purposes.
(4) Grantees will not be required to submit more than the original and two copies of forms required under this subpart.
(5) Federal agencies may provide computer outputs to grantees to expedite or contribute to the accuracy of reporting. Federal agencies may accept the required information from grantees in machine usable format or computer printouts instead of prescribed forms.
(6) Federal agencies may waive any report required by this section if not needed.
(7) Federal agencies may extend the due date of any financial report upon receiving a justified request from a grantee.

—(1)
Form.
(i) For grants paid by letter or credit, Treasury check advances or electronic transfer of funds, the grantee will submit the Standard Form 272, Federal Cash Transactions Report, and when necessary, its continuation sheet, Standard Form 272a, unless the terms of the award exempt the grantee from this requirement.
(ii) These reports will be used by the Federal agency to monitor cash advanced to grantees and to obtain disbursement or outlay information for each grant from grantees. The format of the report may be adapted as appropriate when reporting is to be accomplished with the assistance of automatic data processing equipment provided that the information to be submitted is not changed in substance.
(2)
Forecasts of Federal cash requirements.
Forecasts of Federal cash requirements may be required in the “Remarks” section of the report.
(3)
Cash in hands of subgrantees.

(4)
Frequency and due date.
Grantees must submit the report no later than 15 working days following the end of each quarter. However, where an advance either by letter of credit or electronic transfer of funds is authorized at an annualized rate of one million dollars or more, the Federal agency may require the report to be submitted within 15 working days following the end of each month.
(d)
Request for advance or reimbursement
—(1)
Advance payments.
Requests for Treasury check advance payments will be submitted on Standard Form 270, Request for Advance or Reimbursement. (This form will not be used for drawdowns under a letter of credit, electronic funds transfer or when Treasury check advance payments are made to the grantee automatically on a predetermined basis.)
(2)
Reimbursements.
Requests for reimbursement under nonconstruction grants will also be submitted on Standard Form 270. (For reimbursement requests under construction grants, see paragraph (e)(1) of this section.)
(3) The frequency for submitting payment requests is treated in § 600.441(b)(3).
(e)
Outlay report and request for reimbursement for construction programs
—(1)
Grants that support construction activities paid by reimbursement method.
(i) Requests for reimbursement under construction grants will be submitted on Standard Form 271, Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs. Federal agencies may, however, prescribe the Request for Advance or Reimbursement form, specified in § 600.241(d), instead of this form.
(ii) The frequency for submitting reimbursement requests is treated in § 600.241(b)(3).
(2)
Grants that support construction activities paid by letter of credit, electronic funds transfer or Treasury check advance.
(i) When a construction grant is paid by letter of credit, electronic funds transfer or Treasury check advances, the grantee will report its outlays to the Federal agency using Standard Form 271, Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs. The Federal agency will provide any necessary special instruction. However, frequency and due date shall be governed by § 600.241(b) (3) and (4).
(ii) When a construction grant is paid by Treasury check advances based on periodic requests from the grantee, the advances will be requested on the form specified in § 600.241(d).
(iii) The Federal agency may substitute the Financial Status Report specified in § 600.241(b) for the Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs.

[53 FR 8045, 8047, Mar. 11, 1988, as amended at 59 FR 53266, Oct. 21, 1994; 61 FR 7166, Feb. 26, 1996]
§ 600.242
Retention and access requirements for records.
(a)
Applicability.
(1) This section applies to all financial and programmatic records, supporting documents, statistical records, and other records of grantees or subgrantees which are:
(i) Required to be maintained by the terms of this subpart, program regulations or the grant agreement, or
(ii) Otherwise reasonably considered as pertinent to program regulations or the grant agreement.
(2) This section does not apply to records maintained by contractors or subcontractors. For a requirement to place a provision concerning records in certain kinds of contracts, see § 600.436(i)(10).
(b)
Length of retention period.
(1) Except as otherwise provided, records must be retained for three years from the starting date specified in paragraph (c) of this section.
(2) If any litigation, claim, negotiation, audit or other action involving the records has been started before the expiration of the 3-year period, the records must be retained until completion of the action and resolution of all issues which arise from it, or until the end of the regular 3-year period, whichever is later.
(3) To avoid duplicate recordkeeping, awarding agencies may make special arrangements with grantees and subgrantees to retain any records which are continuously needed for joint use. The awarding agency will request transfer of records to its custody when it determines that the records possess long-term retention value. When the records are transferred to or maintained by the Federal agency, the 3-year retention requirement is not applicable to the grantee or subgrantee.
(c)
Starting date of retention period
(1)
General.
When grant support is continued or renewed at annual or other intervals, the retention period for the records of each funding period starts on the day the grantee or subgrantee submits to the awarding agency its single or last expenditure report for that period. However, if grant support is continued or renewed quarterly, the retention period for each year's records starts on the day the grantee submits its expenditure report for the last quarter of the Federal fiscal year. In all other cases, the retention period starts on the day the grantee submits its final expenditure report. If an expenditure report has been waived, the retention period starts on the day the report would have been due.
(2)
Real property and equipment records.
The retention period for real property and equipment records starts from the date of the disposition or replacement or transfer at the direction of the awarding agency.
(3)
Records for income transactions after grant or subgrant support.
In some cases grantees must report income after the period of grant support. Where there is such a requirement, the retention period for the records pertaining to the earning of the income starts from the end of the grantee's fiscal year in which the income is earned.
(4)
Indirect cost rate proposals, cost allocations plans, etc.
This paragraph applies to the following types of documents, and their supporting records: indirect cost rate computations or proposals, cost allocation plans, and any similar accounting computations of the rate at which a particular group of costs is chargeable (such as computer usage chargeback rates or composite fringe benefit rates).
(i)
If submitted for negotiation.
If the proposal, plan, or other computation is required to be submitted to the Federal Government (or to the grantee) to form the basis for negotiation of the rate, then the 3-year retention period for its supporting records starts from the date of such submission.
(ii)
If not submitted for negotiation.
If the proposal, plan, or other computation is not required to be submitted to the Federal Government (or to the grantee) for negotiation purposes, then the 3-year retention period for the proposal plan, or computation and its supporting records starts from end of the fiscal year (or other accounting period) covered by the proposal, plan, or other computation.
(d)
Substitution of microfilm.
Copies made by microfilming, photocopying, or similar methods may be substituted for the original records.
(e)
Access to records
—(1)
Records of grantees and subgrantees.
The awarding agency and the Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their authorized representatives, shall have the right of access to any pertinent books, documents, papers, or other records of grantees and subgrantees which are pertinent to the grant, in order to make audits, examinations, excerpts, and transcripts.
(2)
Expiration of right of access.
The rights of access in this section must
not be limited to the required retention period but shall last as long as the records are retained.
(f)
Restrictions on public access.
The Federal Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) does not apply to records unless required by Federal, State, or local law, grantees and subgrantees are not required to permit public access to their records.
§ 600.243
Enforcement.
(a)
Remedies for noncompliance.
If a grantee or subgrantee materially fails to comply with any term of an award, whether stated in a Federal statute or regulation, an assurance, in a State plan or application, a notice of award, or elsewhere, the awarding agency may take one or more of the following actions, as appropriate in the circumstances:
(1) Temporarily withhold cash payments pending correction of the deficiency by the grantee or subgrantee or more severe enforcement action by the awarding agency,
(2) Disallow (that is, deny both use of funds and matching credit for) all or part of the cost of the activity or action not in compliance,
(3) Wholly or partly suspend or terminate the current award for the grantee's or subgrantee's program,
(4) Withhold further awards for the program, or
(5) Take other remedies that may be legally available.
(b)
Hearings, appeals.
In taking an enforcement action, the awarding agency will provide the grantee or subgrantee an opportunity for such hearing, appeal, or other administrative proceeding to which the grantee or subgrantee is entitled under any statute or regulation applicable to the action involved.
(c)
Effects of suspension and termination.
Costs of grantee or subgrantee resulting from obligations incurred by the grantee or subgrantee during a suspension or after termination of an award are not allowable unless the awarding agency expressly authorizes them in the notice of suspension or termination or subsequently. Other grantee or subgrantee costs during suspension or after termination which are necessary and not reasonably avoidable are allowable if:
(1) The costs result from obligations which were properly incurred by the grantee or subgrantee before the effective date of suspension or termination, are not in anticipation of it, and, in the case of a termination, are noncancellable, and,
(2) The costs would be allowable if the award were not suspended or expired normally at the end of the funding period in which the termination takes effect.
(d)
Relationship to debarment and suspension.
The enforcement remedies identified in this section, including suspension and termination, do not preclude grantee or subgrantee from being subject to “Debarment and Suspension” under E.O. 12549 (see § 600.235).

§ 600.244
Termination for convenience.
Except as provided in § 600.443 awards may be terminated in whole or in part only as follows:
(a) By the awarding agency with the consent of the grantee or subgrantee in which case the two parties shall agree upon the termination conditions, including the effective date and in the case of partial termination, the portion to be terminated, or
(b) By the grantee or subgrantee upon written notification to the awarding agency, setting forth the reasons for such termination, the effective date, and in the case of partial termination, the portion to be terminated. However, if, in the case of a partial termination, the awarding agency determines that the remaining portion of the award will not accomplish the purposes for which the award was made, the awarding agency may terminate the award in its entirety under either § 600.243 or paragraph (a) of this section.
[53 FR 8045, 8087, Mar. 11, 1988. Redesignated at 59 FR 53264, Oct. 21, 1994, as amended at 61 FR 7166, Feb. 26, 1996]

(2)
Subawards.
(i) Any legal entity (including any State, local government, university or other nonprofit organization, as well as any for-profit entity) that receives an award from DOE must apply the provisions of this part to subawards with for-profit organizations.
(ii) For-profit organizations that receive prime awards covered by this part must apply to each subaward the administrative requirements that are applicable to the particular type of subrecipient (
e.g.,
10 CFR part 600, subpart B, contains requirements for institutions of higher education, hospitals, or other nonprofit organizations and 10 CFR part 600, subpart C, specifies requirements for subrecipients that are States or local governments).
§ 600.302

(b) Recipients are encouraged to use the metric system to the maximum extent practicable in measurement-sensitive activities and in measurement-sensitive outputs resulting from DOE funded programs.

# Post-Award Requirements

# Financial and Program Management
§ 600.310
Purpose of financial and program management.
Sections 600.311 through 600.318 prescribe standards for financial management systems; methods for making payments; and rules for cost sharing and matching, program income, revisions to budgets and program plans, audits, allowable costs, and fee and profit.
§ 600.311
Standards for financial management systems.
(a) Recipients are encouraged to use existing financial management systems to the extent that the systems comply with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and the minimum standards in this section. At a minimum, a recipient's financial management system must provide:
(1) Effective control of all funds. Control systems must be adequate to ensure that costs charged to Federal funds and those counted as the recipient's cost share or match are consistent with requirements for cost reasonableness, allowability, and allocability in the applicable cost principles (
see
§ 600.317) and in the terms and conditions of the award.
(2) Accurate, current and complete records that document, for each project funded wholly or in part with Federal funds, the source and application of the Federal funds and the recipient's required cost share or match. These records must:
(i) Contain information about receipts, authorizations, assets, expenditures, program income, and interest.
(ii) Be adequate to make comparisons of outlays with amounts budgeted for each award (as required for programmatic and financial reporting under § 600.341). Where appropriate, financial information should be related to performance and unit cost data.
(3) To the extent that advance payments are authorized under § 600.312, procedures that minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds to the recipient from the Government and the recipient's disbursement of the funds for program purposes.
(4) A system to support charges to Federal awards for salaries and wages, whether treated as direct or indirect costs. If employees work on multiple activities or cost objectives, a distribution of their salaries and wages must be supported by personnel activity reports which:
(i) Reflect an after the fact distribution of the actual activity of each employee.
(ii) Account for the total activity for which each employee is compensated.
(iii) Are prepared at least monthly, and coincide with one or more pay periods.
(b) If the Federal Government guarantees or insures the repayment of money borrowed by the recipient, DOE, at its discretion, may require adequate bonding and insurance if the bonding and insurance requirements of the recipient are not deemed adequate to protect the interest of the Federal Government.
(c) DOE may require adequate fidelity bond coverage if the recipient lacks sufficient coverage to protect the Federal Government's interest.
(d) If bonds are required in the situations described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the bonds must be obtained from companies holding certificates of authority as acceptable sureties, as prescribed in 31 CFR part 223, “Surety Companies Doing Business with the United States.”
§ 600.312
Payment.
(a)
Methods available.
Payment methods for awards with for-profit organizations are:
(1)
Reimbursement.
Under this method, the recipient requests reimbursement for costs incurred during a particular time period. In cases where the recipient submits requests for payment to the contracting officer, the DOE payment office reimburses the recipient by electronic funds transfer after approval of the request by the designated contracting officer.
(2)
Advance payments.
Under this method, DOE makes a payment to a recipient based upon projections of the recipient's cash needs. The payment generally is made upon the recipient's request, although predetermined payment schedules may be used when the
timing of the recipient's needs to disburse funds can be predicted in advance with sufficient accuracy to ensure compliance with paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section.
(b)
Selecting a method.
(1) The preferred payment method is the reimbursement method, as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
(2) Advance payments, as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, may be used in exceptional circumstances, subject to the following conditions:
(i) The contracting officer, in consultation with the program official, determines in writing that advance payments are necessary or will materially contribute to the probability of success of the project contemplated under the award (
e.g.,
as startup funds for a project performed by a newly formed company).
(ii) Cash advances must be limited to the minimum amounts needed to carry out the program.
(iii) Recipients and DOE must maintain procedures to ensure that the timing of cash advances is as close as is administratively feasible to the recipients' disbursements of the funds for program purposes, including direct program or project costs and the proportionate share of any allowable indirect costs.
(iv) Recipients must maintain advance payments of Federal funds in interest-bearing accounts, and remit annually the interest earned to the contracting officer for return to the Department of Treasury's miscellaneous receipts account, unless one of the following applies:
(A) The recipient receives less than $120,000 in Federal awards per year.
(B) The best reasonably available interest bearing account would not be expected to earn interest in excess of $250 per year on Federal cash balances.
(C) The depository would require an average or minimum balance so high that establishing an interest bearing account would not be feasible, given the expected Federal and non-Federal cash resources.
(c)
Frequency of payments.
For either reimbursements or advance payments, recipients may submit requests for payment monthly, or more often if authorized by the contracting officer.
(d)
Forms for requesting payment.
DOE may authorize recipients to use the SF-270, “Request for Advance or Reimbursement;” the SF-271, “Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs;” or prescribe other forms or formats as necessary.
(e)
Timeliness of payments.
Payments normally will be made within 30 calendar days of the receipt of a recipient's request for reimbursement or advance by the office designated to receive the request, unless the billing is improper.
(f)
Precedence of other available funds.
Recipients must disburse funds available from program income, rebates, refunds, contract settlements, audit recoveries, credits, discounts, and interest earned on such funds before requesting additional cash payments.
(g)
Withholding of payments.
Unless otherwise required by statute, contracting officers may not withhold payments for proper charges made by recipients during the project period for reasons other than the following:
(1) A recipient failed to comply with project objectives, the terms and conditions of the award, or Federal reporting requirements, in which case the contracting officer may suspend payments in accordance with § 600.352.
(2) The recipient is delinquent on a debt to the United States (
see
definitions of “debt” and “delinquent debt” in 32 CFR 22.105). In that case, the contracting officer may, upon reasonable notice, withhold payments to the recipient until the debt owed is resolved.
§ 600.313
Cost sharing or matching.
(a)
Acceptable contributions.
All contributions, including cash contributions and third party in-kind contributions, must be accepted as part of the recipient's cost sharing or matching if such contributions meet all of the following criteria:
(1) They are verifiable from the recipient's records.
(2) They are not included as contributions for any other federally-assisted project or program.
(3) They are necessary and reasonable for proper and efficient accomplishment of project or program objectives.
(4) They are allowable under § 600.317.
(5) They are not paid by the Federal Government under another award unless authorized by Federal statute to be used for cost sharing or matching.
(6) They are provided for in the approved budget.
(7) They conform to other provisions of this part, as applicable.
(b)
Valuing and documenting contributions
—(1)
Valuing recipient's property or services of recipient's employees.
Values are established in accordance with the applicable cost principles in § 600.317, which means that amounts chargeable to the project are determined on the basis of costs incurred. For real property or equipment used on the project, the cost principles authorize depreciation or use charges. The full value of the item may be applied when the item will be consumed in the performance of the award or fully depreciated by the end of the award. In cases where the full value of a donated capital asset is to be applied as cost sharing or matching, that full value must be the lesser or the following:
(i) The certified value of the remaining life of the property recorded in the recipient's accounting records at the time of donation; or
(ii) The current fair market value. If there is sufficient justification, the contracting officer may approve the use of the current fair market value of the donated property, even if it exceeds the certified value at the time of donation to the project. The contracting officer may accept the use of any reasonable basis for determining the fair market value of the property.
(2)
Valuing services of others' employees.
If an employer other than the recipient furnishes the services of an employee, those services are valued at the employee's regular rate of pay plus an amount of fringe benefits and overhead (at an overhead rate appropriate for the location where the services are performed), provided these services are in the same skill for which the employee is normally paid.
(3)
Valuing volunteer services.
Volunteer services furnished by professional and technical personnel, consultants, and other skilled and unskilled labor may be counted as cost sharing or matching if the service is an integral and necessary part of an approved project or program. Rates for volunteer services must be consistent with those paid for similar work in the recipient's organization. In those markets in which the required skills are not found in the recipient organization, rates must be consistent with those paid for similar work in the labor market in which the recipient competes for the kind of services involved. In either case, paid fringe benefits that are reasonable, allowable, and allocable may be included in the valuation.
(4)
Valuing property donated by third parties.
(i) Donated supplies may include such items as office supplies or laboratory supplies. Value assessed to donated supplies included in the cost sharing or matching share must be reasonable and must not exceed the fair market value of the property at the time of the donation.
(ii) Normally only depreciation or use charges for equipment and buildings may be applied. However, the fair rental charges for land and the full value of equipment or other capital assets may be allowed, when they will be consumed in the performance of the award or fully depreciated by the end of the award, provided that the contracting officer has approved the charges. When use charges are applied, values must be determined in accordance with the usual accounting policies of the recipient, with the following qualifications:
(A) The value of donated space must not exceed the fair rental value of comparable space as established by an independent appraisal of comparable space and facilities in a privately-owned building in the same locality.
(B) The value of loaned equipment must not exceed its fair rental value.
(5)
Documentation.
The following requirements pertain to the recipient's supporting records for in-kind contributions from third parties:
(i) Volunteer services must be documented and, to the extent feasible, supported by the same methods used by the recipient for its own employees.
(ii) The basis for determining the valuation for personal services and property must be documented.
§ 600.314
Program income.
(a) DOE must apply the standards in this section to the disposition of program income from projects financed in whole or in part with Federal funds.
(b) Unless program regulations or the terms and conditions of the award provide otherwise, recipients, without any further accounting to DOE, may retain program income earned:
(1) From license fees and royalties for copyrighted material, patents, patent applications, trademarks, and inventions produced under an award.
(2) After the end of the project period.
(c) Unless program regulations or the terms and conditions of the award provide otherwise, costs incident to the generation of program income for which there is some obligation to the Government may be deducted from gross income to determine program income, provided these costs have not been charged to the award.
(d) Other than any program income excluded pursuant to paragraph (b) and (c) of this section, program income earned during the project period must be retained by the recipient and used in one or more of the following ways, as specified in program regulations or the terms and conditions of the award:
(1) Added to funds committed to the project by DOE and recipient and used to further eligible project or program objectives.
(2) Used to finance the non-Federal share of the project or program.
(3) Deducted from the total project or program allowable cost in determining the net allowable costs on which the Federal share of costs is based.
(e) If the program regulation or terms and conditions of an award authorize the disposition of program income as described in paragraph (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this section, and stipulate a limit on the amounts that may be used in those ways, program income in excess of the stipulated limits must be used in accordance with paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
(f) In the event that the program regulation or terms and conditions of the award do not specify how program income is to be used, paragraph (d)(3) of this section applies automatically to all projects or programs except research. For awards that support basic or applied research, paragraph (d)(1) of this section applies automatically unless the terms and conditions specify another alternative or the recipient is subject to special award conditions, as indicated in § 600.304.
(g) Proceeds from the sale of property that is acquired, rather than fabricated, under an award are not program income and must be handled in accordance with the requirements of §§ 600.320 through 600.325 of this part.
§ 600.315
Revision of budget and program plans.
(a) The budget plan is the financial expression of the project or program as approved during the award process. It includes the sum of the Federal and non-Federal shares when there are cost sharing requirements. The budget plan must be related to performance for program evaluation purposes, whenever appropriate.
(b) The recipient must obtain the contracting officer's prior approval if a revision is necessary for either of the following two reasons:
(1) A change in the scope or the objective of the project or program (even if there is no associated budget revision requiring prior written approval).
(2) A need for additional Federal funding.
(c) The recipient must obtain the contracting officer's prior approval if a revision is necessary for any of the following six reasons, unless the requirement for prior approval is specifically waived in the program regulation or terms and conditions of the award:
(1) A change in the approved project director, principal investigator, or other key person specified in the application or award document.
(2) The absence for more than three months, or a 25 percent reduction in time devoted to the project, by the approved project director or principal investigator.
(3) The inclusion of any additional costs that require prior approval in accordance with the applicable costs principles for Federal funds and the requirements applicable to the recipient's cost share or match, as provided in § 600.313 and § 600.317, respectively.
(4) The inclusion of pre-award costs for periods greater than the 90 calendar days immediately preceding the effective date of the award.
(5) A “no-cost” extension of the project period.
(6) Any subaward, transfer, or contracting out of substantive program performance under an award, unless described in the application and funded in the approved awards.
(d) If specifically required in the program regulation or the terms and conditions of the award, the recipient must obtain the contracting officer's prior approval for the following revisions:
(1) The transfer of funds among direct cost categories, functions, and activities for awards in which the Federal share of the project exceeds $100,000 and the cumulative amount of such transfers exceeds or is expected to exceed 10 percent of the total budget as last approved by DOE.
(2) For awards that provide support for both construction and nonconstruction work, any fund or budget transfers between the two types of work supported.
(e) Within 30 calendar days from the date of receipt of the recipient's request for budget revisions, the contracting officer must review the request and notify the recipient whether the budget revisions have been approved. If the revision is still under consideration at the end of 30 calendar days, the contracting officer must inform the recipient in writing of the date when the recipient may expect the decision.
§ 600.316
Audits.
(a) Any recipient that expends $500,000 or more in a year under Federal awards must have an audit made for that year by an independent auditor, in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. If a recipient is currently performing under a Federal award that requires an audit by its Federal cognizant agency, that auditor must perform the independent audit. The audit generally should be made a part of the regularly scheduled, annual audit of the recipient's financial statements. However, it may be more economical in some cases to have Federal awards separately audited, and a recipient may elect to do so, unless that option is precluded by award terms and conditions or by Federal laws or regulations applicable to the program(s) under which the awards were made.
(b) The auditor must determine and report on whether:
(1) The recipient has an internal control structure that provides reasonable assurance that it is managing Federal awards in compliance with Federal laws and regulations and the terms and conditions of the awards.
(2) Based on a sampling of Federal award expenditures, the recipient has complied with laws, regulations, and award terms that may have a direct and material effect on Federal awards.
(c) The recipient must make the auditor's report available to the DOE contracting officers whose awards are affected.
(d) Before requesting an audit in addition to the independent audit, the contracting officer must:
(1) Consider whether the independent audit satisfies his or her requirements;
(2) Limit the scope of such additional audit to areas not adequately addressed by the independent audit; and
(3) If DOE is not the Federal agency with the predominant fiscal interest in the recipient, coordinate with the agency that has the predominant fiscal interest.
(e) The recipient and its Federal cognizant agency for audit should develop a coordinated audit approach to minimize duplication of audit work.
(f) Audit costs (including a reasonable allocation of the costs of the audit of the recipient's financial statement, based on the relative benefit to the Government and the recipient) are allowable costs of DOE awards.
§ 600.317
Allowable costs.
(a) DOE determines allowability of costs in accordance with the cost principles applicable to the type of entity incurring the cost as follows:
(1)
For-profit organizations.
Allowability of costs incurred by for-profit organizations and those nonprofit organizations listed in Attachment C to OMB Circular A-122 is determined in accordance with the for-profit costs
principles in 48 CFR part 31 in the Federal Acquisition Regulation, except that patent prosecution costs are not allowable unless specifically authorized in the award document.
(2)
Other types of organizations.
Allowability of costs incurred by other types of organizations that may be subrecipients under a prime award to a for-profit organization is determined as follows:
(i)
Institutions of higher education.
Allowability is determined in accordance with OMB Circular A-21, “Cost Principles for Educational Institutions.”
(ii)
Other nonprofit organizations.
Allowability is determined in accordance with OMB Circular A-122, “Cost Principles for Nonprofit Organizations.”
(iii)
Hospitals.
Allowability is determined in accordance with the provisions of 45 CFR part 74, Appendix E, “Principles for Determining Costs Applicable to Research and Development Under Grants and Contracts with Hospitals.”
(iv)
Governmental organizations.
Allowability for State, local, or federally recognized Indian tribal government is determined in accordance with OMB Circular A-87, “Cost Principles for State and Local Governments.”
(b)
Pre-award costs.
If a recipient incurs pre-award costs without the prior approval of the contracting officer, DOE may pay those costs incurred within the ninety calendar day period immediately preceding the effective date of the award, if such costs are:
(1) Necessary for the effective and economical conduct of the project;
(2) Otherwise allowable in accordance with the applicable cost principles; and
(3) Less than the total value of the award.
§ 600.318
Fee and profit.
(a) Grants and cooperative agreements may not provide for the payment of fee or profit to recipients or subrecipients, except for awards made pursuant to the Small Business Innovation Research or Small Business Technology Transfer Research programs.
(b) A recipient or subrecipient may pay a fee or profit to a contractor providing goods or services under a contract.

# Property Standards
§ 600.320
Purpose of property standards.
Sections 600.321 through 600.325 set forth uniform standards for management, use, and disposition of property. DOE encourages recipients to use existing property-management systems to the extent that the systems meet these minimum requirements.
§ 600.321
Real property and equipment.
(a)
Prior approvals for acquisition with Federal funds.
Recipients may purchase real property or equipment in whole or in part with Federal funds under an award only with the prior approval of the contracting officer.
(b)
Title.
Unless a statute specifically authorizes and the award specifies that title to property vests unconditionally in the recipient, title to real property or equipment vests in the recipient subject to the conditions that the recipient:
(1) Use the real property or equipment for the authorized purposes of the project until funding for the project ceases, or until the property is no longer needed for the purposes of the project;
(2) Not encumber the property without approval of the contracting officer; and
(3) Use and dispose of the property in accordance with paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section.
(c)
Federal interest in real property or equipment offered as cost-share.
A recipient may offer the full value of real property or equipment that is purchased with recipient's funds or that is donated by a third party to meet a portion of any required cost sharing or matching, subject to the requirements in § 600.313. If a resulting award includes such property as a portion of the recipient's cost share, the Government has a financial interest in the property, (
i.e.,
a share of the property value equal to the Federal participation in the project). The property is considered as if it had been acquired in part with Federal funds, and is subject to the provisions of paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3) of this section and to the provisions of § 600.323.
(d)
Insurance.
Recipients must, at a minimum, provide the equivalent insurance coverage for real property and equipment acquired with DOE funds as provided to property owned by the recipient.
(e)
Use.
If real property or equipment is acquired in whole or in part with Federal funds under an award and the award does not specify that title vests unconditionally in the recipient, the real property or equipment is subject to the following:
(1) During the time that the real property or equipment is used on the project or program for which it was acquired, the recipient must make it available for use on other projects or programs, if such other use does not interfere with the work on the project or program for which the real property or equipment was originally acquired. Use of the real property or equipment on other projects is subject to the following order of priority:
(i) Activities sponsored by DOE grants, cooperative agreements, or other assistance awards;
(ii) Activities sponsored by other Federal agencies' grants, cooperative agreements, or other assistance awards;
(iii) Activities under Federal procurement contracts or activities not sponsored by any Federal agency. If so used, use charges must be assessed to those activities. For real property or equipment, the use charges must be at rates equivalent to those for which comparable real property or equipment may be leased.
(2) After Federal funding for the project ceases or if the real property or equipment is no longer needed for the purposes of the project, the recipient may use the real property or equipment for other projects, insofar as:
(i) There are Federally sponsored projects for which the real property or equipment may be used. If the only use for the real property or equipment is for projects that have no Federal sponsorship, the receipt must proceed with disposition of the real property or equipment, in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section.
(ii) The recipient obtains written approval from the contracting officer to do so. The contracting officer must ensure that there is a formal change of accountability for the real property or equipment to a currently funded, Federal award.
(iii) The recipient's use of the real property or equipment for other projects is in the same order of priority as described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
(f)
Disposition.
(1) If an item of real property or equipment is no longer needed for Federally sponsored projects, the recipient has the following options:
(i) If the property is equipment with a current per unit fair market value of less than $5,000, it may be retained, sold, or otherwise disposed of with no further obligation to DOE.
(ii) If the property that is no longer needed is equipment (rather than real property), the recipient may wish to replace it with an item that is needed currently for the project by trading in or selling to offset the costs of the replacement equipment, subject to the approval of the contracting officer.
(iii) The recipient may elect to retain title, without further obligation to the Federal Government, by compensating the Federal Government for that percentage of the current fair market value of the real property or equipment that is attributable to the Federal participation in the project.
(iv) If the recipient does not elect to retain title to real property or equipment or does not request approval to use equipment as trade-in or offset for replacement equipment, the recipient must request disposition instructions from the responsible agency.
(2) If a recipient requests disposition instructions, the contracting officer must:
(i) For equipment (but not real property), consult with the DOE Project Director to determine whether the condition and nature of the equipment warrant excess screening within DOE. If screening is warranted, the equipment will be made available for reutilization within DOE through the Energy Asset Disposal System (EADS). If no DOE requirement is identified within a 30-day period, EADS automatically reports the availability of the equipment to the General Services Administration, to determine whether a requirement
for the equipment exists in other Federal agencies.
(ii) For either real property or equipment, issue instructions to the recipient for disposition of the property no later than 120 calendar days after the recipient's request. The contracting officer's options for disposition are to direct the recipient to:
(A) Transfer title to the real property or equipment to the Federal Government or to an eligible third party provided that, in such cases, the recipient is entitled to compensation for its attributable percentage of the current fair market value of the real property or equipment, plus any reasonable shipping or interim storage costs incurred.
(B) Sell the real property or equipment and pay the Federal Government for that percentage of the current fair market value of the property that is attributable to the Federal participation in the project (after deducting actual and reasonable selling and fix-up expenses, if any, from the sale proceeds). If the recipient is authorized or required to sell the real property or equipment, the recipient must use competitive procedures that result in the highest practicable return.
(3) If the responsible agency fails to issue disposition instructions within 120 calendar days of the recipient's request, the recipient must dispose of the real property or equipment through the option described in paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(B) of this section.
§ 600.322
Federally owned property.
(a)
Annual inventory.
The recipient must submit annually to the contracting officer an inventory listing of all Federally owned property in its custody, i.e., property furnished by the Federal Government, rather than acquired by the recipient with Federal funds under the award.
(b)
Insurance.
The recipient may not insure Federally owned property unless required by the terms and conditions of the award.
(c)
Use on other activities.
(1) Use of federally owned property on other activities is permissible, if authorized by the contracting officer responsible for administering the award to which the property currently is charged.
(2) Use on other activities must be in the following order of priority:
(i) Activities sponsored by DOE grants, cooperative agreements, or other assistance awards;
(ii) Activities sponsored by other Federal agencies' grants, cooperative agreements, or other assistance awards;
(iii) Activities under Federal procurement contracts or activities not sponsored by any Federal agency. If so used, use charges must be assessed to those activities. For real property or equipment, the use charges must be at rates equivalent to those for which comparable real property or equipment may be leased.
(d)
Disposition or property.
Upon completion of the award, the recipient must submit to the contracting officer a final inventory of Federal owned property. DOE may:
(1) Use the property to meet another Federal Government need (
e.g.,
by transferring accountability for the property to another Federal award to the same recipient, or by directing the recipient to transfer the property to a Federal agency that needs the property or to another recipient with a currently funded award).
(2) Declare the property to be excess property and either:
(i) Report the property to the General Services Administration through EADS, in accordance with the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (40 U.S.C. 483(b)(2)), as implemented by General Services Administration regulations at 41 CFR 101-47.202; or
(ii) Dispose of the property by alternative methods, if there is authority under law, such as 15 U.S.C. 3710(i).
§ 600.323
Property management system.
The recipient's property management system must include the following:
(a) Property records must be maintained, to include the following information for property that is Federally owned, equipment that is acquired in whole or in part with Federal funds, or property or equipment that is used as cost sharing or matching:
(1) A description of the property.
(2) Manufacturer's serial number, model number, Federal stock number, national stock number, or any other identification number.
(3) Source of the property, including the award number.
(4) Whether title vests in the recipient or the Federal Government.
(5) Acquisition date (or date received, if the property was furnished by the Federal Government) and cost.
(6) Information from which one can calculate the percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the property (not applicable to property furnished by the Federal Government).
(7) The location and condition of the property and the date the information was reported.
(8) Ultimate disposition data, including data of disposal and sales price or the method used to determine current fair market value where a recipient compensates the Federal Government for its share.
(b) Federal owned equipment must be marked to indicate Federal ownership.
(c) A physical inventory must be taken and the results reconciled with the property records at least once every two years. Any differences between quantities determined by the physical inspection and those shown in the accounting records must be investigated to determine the causes of the difference. The recipient must, in connection with the inventory, verify the existence, current utilization, and continued need for the property.
(d) A control system must be in effect to insure adequate safeguards to prevent loss, damage, or theft of the property. Any loss, damage, or theft of property must be investigated and fully documented. If the property is owned by the Federal Government, the recipient must promptly notify the Federal agency responsible for administering the property.
(e) Adequate maintenance procedures must be implemented to keep the property in good condition.
§ 600.324
Supplies.
(a) Title vests in the recipient upon acquisition of supplies acquired with Federal funds under an award.
(b) Upon termination or completion of the project or program, the recipient may retain any unused supplies. If the inventory of unused supplies exceeds $5,000 in total aggregate value and the items are not needed for any other Federally sponsored project or program, the recipient may retain the items for use on non-Federal sponsored activities or sell them, but must, in either case, compensate the Federal Government for its share.
§ 600.325
Intellectual property.
(a)
Scope.
This section sets forth the policies with regard to disposition of rights to data and to inventions conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the course of, or under, a grant or cooperative agreement with DOE.
(b)
Patents right—small business concerns.
In accordance with 35 U.S.C. 202, if the recipient is a small business concern and receives a grant, cooperative agreement, subaward, or contract for research, developmental, or demonstration activities, then, unless there are “exceptional circumstances” as described in 35 U.S.C. 202(e), the award must contain the standard clause in appendix A to this subpart, entitled “Patents Rights (Small Business Firms and Nonprofit Organizations” which provides to the recipient the right to elect ownership of inventions made under the award.
(c)
Patent rights—other than small business concerns, e.g., large businesses
—(1)
No Patent Waiver.
Except as provided by paragraph (c)(2) of this section, if the recipient is a for-profit organization other than a small business concern, as defined in 35 U.S.C. 201(h) and receives an award or a subaward for research, development, and demonstration activities, then, pursuant to statute, the award must contain the standard clause in appendix A to this subpart, entitled “Patent Rights (Large Business Firms)—No Waiver” which provides that DOE owns the patent rights to inventions made under the award.
(2)
Patent Waiver Granted.
Paragraph (c)(1) of this section does not apply if:
(i) DOE grants a class waiver for a particular program under 10 CFR part 784;
(ii) The applicant requests and receives an advance patent waiver under 10 CFR part 784; or
(iii) A subaward is covered by a waiver granted under the prime award.
(3)
Special Provision.
Normally, an award will not include a background patent and data provision. However, under special circumstances, in order to provide heightened assurance of commercialization, a provision providing for a right to require licensing of third parties to background inventions, limited rights data and/or restricted computer software, may be included. Inclusion of a background patent and/or a data provision to assure commercialization will be done only with the written concurrence of the DOE program official setting forth the need for such assurance. An award may include the right to license the Government and third party contractors for special Government purposes when future availability of the technology would also benefit the government,
e.g.,
clean-up of DOE facilities. The scope of any such background patent and/or data licensing provision is subject to negotiation.
(d)
Rights in data—general rule.
(1) Subject to paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) of this section, and except as otherwise provided by paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section or other law, any award under this subpart must contain the standard clause in appendix A to this subpart, entitled “Rights in Data—General”.
(2) Normally, an award will not require the delivery of limited rights data or restricted computer software. However, if the contracting officer, in consultation with DOE patent counsel and the DOE program official, determines that delivery of limited rights data or restricted computer software is necessary, the contracting officer, after negotiation with the applicant, may insert in the award the standard clause as modified by Alternates I and/or II set forth in appendix A to this subpart.
(3) If software is specified for delivery to DOE, or if other special circumstances exist,
e.g.,
DOE specifying “open-source” treatment of software, then the contracting officer, after negotiation with the recipient, may include in the award special provisions requiring the recipient to obtain written approval of the contracting officer prior to asserting copyright in the software, modifying the retained Government license, and/or otherwise altering the copyright provisions.
(e)
Rights in data—programs covered under special protected data statutes.
(1) If a statute, other than those providing for the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) programs, provides for a period of time, typically up to five years, during which data produced under an award for research, development, and demonstration may be protected from public disclosure, then the contracting officer must insert in the award the standard clause in appendix A to this subpart entitled “Rights in Data—Programs Covered Under Special Protected Data Statutes” or, as determined in consultation with DOE patent counsel and the DOE program official, a modified version of such clause which may identify data or categories of data that the recipient must make available to the public.
(2) An award under paragraph (e)(1) of this section is subject to the provisions of paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) of this section.
(f)
Rights in data—SBIR/STTR programs.
(1) If an applicant receives an award under the SBIR or STTR program, then the contracting officer must insert in the award the standard data clause in the General Terms and Conditions for SBIR Grants, entitled “Rights in Data—SBIR Program”.
(2) The data rights provisions for SBIR/STTR grants are contained in the award terms and conditions for SBIR grants located at
http://e-center.doe.gov
on the Professionals Homepage under Financial Assistance, Regulations and Guidance.
(g)
Authorization and consent.
(1) Work performed by a recipient under a grant is not subject to authorization and consent to the use of a patented invention, and the Government assumes no liability for patent infringement by the recipient under 28 U.S.C. 1498.
(2) Work performed by a recipient under a cooperative agreement is subject to authorization and consent to
the use of a patented invention consistent with the principles set forth in 48 CFR 27.201-1.
(3) The contracting officer, in consultation with patent counsel, may also include clauses in the cooperative agreement addressing other patent matters related to authorization and consent, such as patent indemnification of the Government by recipient and notice and assistance regarding patent and copyright infringement. The policies and clauses for these other patent matters will be the same or consistent with those in 48 CFR part 927.

# Procurement Standards
§ 600.330
Purpose of procurement standards.
Section 600.331 sets forth requirements necessary to ensure:
(a) Recipients' procurements that use Federal funds comply with applicable Federal statutes, regulations, and executive orders.

§ 600.331
Requirements.
The following requirements pertain to recipients' procurements funded in whole or in part with Federal funds or with recipients' cost-share or match:
(a)
Reasonable cost.
Recipients' procurement procedures must use best commercial practices to ensure reasonable cost for procured goods and services. Recipients are encouraged to buy commercial items, if practicable.
(b)
Pre-award review of certain procurements.
If the contracting officer determines that there is a compelling need to perform a pre-award review of a specific transaction and the terms of the award identify the specific transaction and provide for such a review, then the recipient must obtain the contracting officer's approval prior to awarding the transaction and must provide the contracting officer the following documents to review:
(1) Request for proposals or invitation to bid, if any;
(2) Cost estimate;
(3) Proposal/bid;
(4) Proposed award document; and
(5) Summary of negotiations or justification for award.
(c)
Contract provisions.
(1) Contracts in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold must contain contractual provisions or conditions that allow for administrative, contractual, or legal remedies in instances in which a contractor violates or breaches the contract terms, and provide for such remedial actions as may be appropriate.
(2) All contracts in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold must contain suitable provisions for termination for default by the recipient and for termination due to circumstances beyond the control of the contractor.
(3) All negotiated contracts in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold must include a provision permitting access of DOE, the Inspector General, the Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their duly authorized representatives, to any books, documents, papers, and records of the contractor that are directly pertinent to a specific programs, for the purpose of making audits, examinations, excerpts, transcriptions, and copies of such documents.
(4) All contracts, including those for amounts less than the simplified acquisition threshold, awarded by recipients and their contractors must contain the procurement provisions of Appendix B to this subpart, as applicable.
(d)
Recipient responsibilities.
The recipient is the responsible authority, without recourse to DOE, regarding the settlement and satisfaction of all contractual and administrative issues arising out of procurements entered into in support of an award. This includes disputes, claims, protests of award, source evaluation or other matters of a contractual nature. The recipient should refer matters concerning violations of statutes to such Federal, State or local authority as may have proper jurisdiction.

# Reports and Records
§ 600.340
Purpose of reports and records.
Sections 600.341 and 600.342 prescribe requirements for monitoring and reporting financial and program performance and for records retention.
§ 600.341
Monitoring and reporting program and financial performance.
(a) The terms and conditions of the award prescribe the reporting requirements, the frequency, and the due dates for reports. At a minimum, requirements must include:
(1) Periodic progress reports (at least annually, but no more frequently than quarterly) addressing both program status and business status, as follows:
(i) The program portions of the reports must address progress toward achieving program performance goals and milestones, including current issues, problems, or developments.
(ii) The business portions of the reports must provide summarized details on the status of resources (Federal funds and non-Federal cost sharing or matching), including an accounting of expenditures for the period covered by the report. The report should compare the resource status with any payment and expenditure schedules or plans provided in the original award, explain any major deviations from those schedules, and discuss actions that will be taken to address the deviations.
(2) A final technical report if the award is for research and development.
(b) If the contracting officer previously authorized advance payments, pursuant to § 600.312(a)(2), he/she should consult with the DOE project director and consider whether program progress reported in the periodic progress report, in relation to reported expenditures, is sufficient to justify continued authorization of advance payments.
§ 600.342
Retention and access requirements for records.
(a) This section sets forth requirements for records retention and access to records for awards to recipients and subrecipients.
(b) Financial records, supporting documents, statistical records, and all other records pertinent to an award must be retained for a period of three years from the date of submission of the final expenditure report. The only exceptions are the following.
(1) If any litigation, claim, or audit is started before the expiration of the 3-year period, the records must be retained until all litigation, claims, or audit findings involving the records have been resolved and final action taken.
(2) Records for real property and equipment acquired with Federal funds must be retained for 3 years after final disposition.
(3) If records are transferred to or maintained by DOE, the 3-year retention requirement is not applicable to the recipient.
(4) Indirect cost rate proposals, cost allocation plans, and related records must be retained in accordance with the requirements specified in paragraph (g) of this section.
(c) Copies of original records may be substituted for the original records if authorized by the contracting officer.
(d) The contracting officer may request that recipients transfer certain records to DOE custody if he or she determines that the records possess long term retention value. However, in order to avoid duplicate recordkeeping, a contracting officer may make arrangements for recipients to retain any records that are continuously needed for joint use.
(e) DOE, the Inspector General, Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their duly authorized representatives, have the right of timely and unrestricted access to any books, documents, papers, or other records of recipients that are pertinent to the awards, in order to make audits, examinations, excerpts, transcripts and copies of such documents. This right also includes timely and reasonable access to a recipient's personnel for the purpose of interview and discussion related to such documents. The rights of access in this paragraph are not limited to the required retention period, but must last as long as records are retained.
(f) Unless required by statute, DOE must not place restrictions on recipients that limit public access to the records of recipients that are pertinent to an award, except when DOE can demonstrate that such records would be kept confidential and would be exempt from disclosure pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) if the records belonged to DOE.
(g) Indirect cost proposals, cost allocation plans, and other cost accounting
documents (such as documents related to computer usage chargeback rates), along with their supporting records, must be retained for a 3-year period, as follows:
(1) If the recipient or the subrecipient is required to submit an indirect-cost proposal, cost allocation plan, or other computation to the cognizant Federal agency for purposes of negotiating an indirect cost rate or other rates, the 3-year retention period starts on the date of the submission.
(2) If the recipient or the subrecipient is not required to submit the documents or supporting records for negotiating an indirect cost rate or other rates, the 3-year retention period for the documents and records starts at the end of the fiscal year (or other accounting period) covered by the proposal, plan, or other computation.
(h) If the information described in this section is maintained on a computer, recipients must retain the computer data on a reliable medium for the time periods prescribed. Recipients may transfer computer data in machine readable form from one reliable computer medium to another. Recipients' computer data retention and transfer procedures must maintain the integrity, reliability, and security of the original computer data. Recipients must also maintain an audit trail describing the data transfer. For the record retention time periods prescribed in this section, recipients must not destroy, discard, delete, or write over such computer data.

# Termination and Enforcement
§ 600.350
Purpose of termination and enforcement.
Sections 600.351 through 600.353 set forth uniform procedures for suspension, termination, enforcement, and disputes.
§ 600.351
Termination.
(a) Awards may be terminated in whole or in part only in accordance with one of the following:
(1) By the contracting officer, if a recipient materially fails to comply with the terms and conditions of an award.
(2) By the contracting officer with the consent of the recipient, in which case the two parties must agree upon the termination conditions, including the effective date and, in the case of partial termination, the portion to be terminated.
(3) By the recipient upon sending to the contracting officer written notification setting forth the reasons for such termination, the effective date, and, in the case of partial termination, the portion to be terminated. The recipient must provide such notice at least 30 calendar days prior to the effective date of the termination. However, if the contracting officer determines in the case of partial termination that the reduced or modified portion of the award will not accomplish the purposes for which the award was made, he or she may terminate the award in its entirety.
(b) If the recipient incurred allowable costs prior to the termination, the responsibilities of the recipient referred to in § 600.361(b), including those related to property, apply to the termination of the award, and provision must be made for continuing responsibilities of the recipient after termination, as appropriate.
§ 600.352
Enforcement.
(a)
Remedies for noncompliance.
If a recipient materially fails to comply with the terms and conditions of an award, whether stated in a Federal statute, regulation, assurance, application, or notice of award, the contracting officer may, in addition to imposing any of the special conditions outlined in § 600.304, take one or more of the following actions, as appropriate:
(1) Temporarily withhold cash payments pending correction of the deficiency by the recipient or more severe enforcement action by the contracting officer.
(2) Disallow (that is, deny both the use of funds and any applicable matching credit for) all or part of the cost of the activity or action not in compliance.
(3) Wholly or partly suspend or terminate the current award.
(4) Withhold further awards for the project or program.
(5) Apply other remedies that may be legally available.
(b)
Hearings and appeals.
In taking an enforcement action, DOE must provide the recipient an opportunity for hearing, appeal, or other administrative proceeding to which the recipient is entitled under any statute or regulation applicable to the action involved.
(c)
Effects of suspension and termination.
Costs resulting from obligations incurred by the recipient during a suspension or after termination of an award are not allowable, unless the contracting officer expressly authorizes them in the notice of suspension or termination or subsequently authorizes such costs. Other recipient costs during suspension or after termination, which are necessary and not reasonably avoidable, are allowable if the costs:
(1) Result from obligations which were properly incurred by the recipient before the effective date of suspension or termination, are not in anticipation of it, and in the case of a termination, are noncancellable; and
(2) Would be allowable if the award expired normally at the end of the funding period.
(d)
Relationship to debarment and suspension.
The enforcement remedies identified in this section, including suspension and termination, do not preclude a recipient from being subject to debarment and suspension under 10 CFR part 1036.
§ 600.353
Disputes and appeals.
Consistent with 10 CFR 600.22 and part 1024, recipients have the right to appeal certain decisions by contracting officers.

# After-the-Award Requirements
§ 600.360
Purpose.
Sections 600.361 through 600.363 contain procedures for closeout and for subsequent disallowances and adjustments.
§ 600.361
Closeout procedures.
(a) Recipients must submit, within 90 calendar days after the date of completion of the award, all reports required by the terms and conditions of the award. DOE may approve extensions when requested by the recipient.

(2) DOE must make prompt, final payments to a recipient for allowable reimbursable costs under the award being closed out.
(3) The recipient must promptly refund any unobligated balances of cash that DOE has advanced or paid and that are not authorized to be retained by the recipient for use in other projects. OMB Circular A-129 governs unreturned amounts that become delinquent debts.
(4) When authorized by the terms and conditions of the award, the contracting officer must make a settlement for any upward or downward adjustments to the Federal share of costs after closeout reports are received.
(5) The recipient must account for any real property and equipment acquired with Federal funds or received from the Federal Government in accordance with §§ 600.321 through 600.325.
(6) If a final audit is required and has not been performed prior to the closeout of an award, DOE retains the right to recover an appropriate amount after fully considering the recommendations on disallowed costs resulting from the final audit.
§ 600.362
Subsequent adjustments and continuing responsibilities.
(a) The closeout of an award does not affect any of the following:
(1) The right of DOE to disallow costs and recover funds on the basis of a later audit or other review.
(2) The obligation of the recipient to return any funds due as a result of later refunds, corrections, or other transactions.
(3) Audit requirements in § 600.316.
(4) Property management requirements in §§ 600.321 through 600.325.

the contracting officer and the recipient, provided property management requirements are considered and provisions made for the continuing responsibilities of the recipient, as appropriate.
§ 600.363
Collection of amounts due.
(a) Any funds paid to a recipient in excess of the amount to which the recipient is finally determined to be entitled under the terms and conditions of the award constitute a debt to the Federal Government. If not paid within 30 days after the demand for payment, DOE may reduce the debt in accordance with the procedures and techniques described in 10 CFR part 1015 and OMB Circular A-129, including:
(1) Making an administrative offset against other requests for reimbursements.
(2) Withholding advance payments otherwise due to the recipient.
(3) Taking other action permitted by statute or regulation.
(b) Except as otherwise provided by law, DOE may charge interest and administrative fees on an overdue debt in accordance with 31 CFR Chapter IX, parts 900-904, “Federal Claims Collection Standards.”

# Additional Provisions
§ 600.380
Purpose.
The purpose of “Additional Provisions” is to provide alternative requirements for recipients otherwise covered by this subpart D, when they are performing under Small Business Innovation Research grants.

The Recipient may retain the entire right, title, and interest throughout the world to each subject invention subject to the provisions of this Patent Rights clause and 35 U.S.C. 203. With respect to any subject invention in which the Recipient retains title, the Federal Government shall have a non-exclusive, nontransferable, irrevocable, paid-up license to practice or have practiced for or on behalf of the U.S. the subject invention throughout the world.

# (c) Invention Disclosure, Election of Title and Filing of Patent Applications by Recipient
(1) The Recipient will disclose each subject invention to DOE within two months after the inventor discloses it in writing to Recipient personnel responsible for the administration of patent matters. The disclosure to DOE shall be in the form of a written report and shall identify the award under which the invention was made and the inventor(s). It shall be sufficiently complete in technical detail to convey a clear understanding to the extent known at the time of disclosure, of the nature, purpose, operation, and the physical, chemical, biological or electrical characteristics of the invention. The disclosure shall also identify any publication, on sale or public use of the invention and whether a manuscript describing the invention has been submitted for publication and, if so, whether it has been accepted for publication at the time of disclosure. In addition, after disclosure to DOE, the Recipient will promptly notify DOE of the acceptance of any manuscript describing the invention for publication or of any on sale or public use planned by the Recipient.
(2) The Recipient will elect in writing whether or not to retain title to any such invention by notifying DOE within two years of disclosure to DOE. However, in any case where publication, on sale, or public use has initiated the one-year statutory period wherein valid patent protection can still be obtained in the U.S., the period for election of title may be shortened by the agency to a date that is no more than 60 days prior to the end of the statutory period.
(3) The Recipient will file its initial patent application on an invention to which it elects to retain title within one year after election of title or, if earlier, prior to the end of any statutory period wherein valid patent protection can be obtained in the U.S. after a publication, on sale, or public use. The Recipient will file patent applications in additional countries or international patent offices within either ten months of the corresponding initial patent application, or six months from the date when permission is granted by the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks to file foreign patent applications when such filing has been prohibited by a Secrecy Order.
(4) Requests for extension of the time for disclosure to DOE, election, and filing under
subparagraphs (c)(1), (2), and (3) of this clause may, at the discretion of DOE, be granted.

# (d) Conditions When the Government May Obtain Title
The Recipient will convey to DOE, upon written request, title to any subject invention:
(1) If the Recipient fails to disclose or elect the subject invention within the times specified in paragraph (c) of this patent rights clause, or elects not to retain title; provided that DOE may only request title within 60 days after learning of the failure of the Recipient to disclose or elect within the specified times;
(2) In those countries in which the Recipient fails to file patent applications within the times specified in paragraph (c) of this Patent Rights clause; provided, however, that if the Recipient has filed a patent application in a country after the times specified in paragraph (c) of this Patent Rights clause, but prior to its receipt of the written request of DOE, the Recipient shall continue to retain title in that country; or
(3) In any country in which the Recipient decides not to continue the prosecution of any application for, to pay the maintenance fees on, or defend in a reexamination or opposition proceeding on, a patent on a subject invention.

# (e) Minimum Rights to Recipient and Protection of the Recipient Right To File
(1) The Recipient will retain a non-exclusive royalty-free license throughout the world in each subject invention to which the Government obtains title, except if the Recipient fails to disclose the subject invention within the times specified in paragraph (c) of this Patent Rights clause. The Recipient's license extends to its domestic subsidiaries and affiliates, if any, within the corporate structure of which the Recipient is a party and includes the right to grant sublicenses of the same scope of the extent the Recipient was legally obligated to do so at the time the award was awarded. The license is transferable only with the approval of DOE except when transferred to the successor of that part of the Recipient's business to which the invention pertains.
(2) The Recipient's domestic license may be revoked or modified by DOE to the extent necessary to achieve expeditious practical application of the subject invention pursuant to an application for an exclusive license submitted in accordance with applicable provisions at 37 CFR part 404 and the agency's licensing regulation, if any. This license will not be revoked in that field of use or the geographical areas in which the Recipient has achieved practical application and continues to make the benefits of the invention reasonably accessible to the public. The license in any foreign country may be revoked or modified at discretion of the funding Federal agency to the extent the Recipient, its licensees, or its domestic subsidiaries or affiliates have failed to achieve practical application in that foreign country.
(3) Before revocation or modification of the license, the funding Federal agency will furnish the Recipient a written notice of its intention to revoke or modify the license, and the Recipient will be allowed thirty days (or such other time as may be authorized by DOE for good cause shown by the Recipient) after the notice to show cause why the license should not be revoked or modified. The Recipient has the right to appeal, in accordance with applicable regulations in 37 CFR part 404 and the agency's licensing regulations, if any, concerning the licensing of Government-owned inventions, any decision concerning the revocation or modification of its license.

# (f) Recipient Action To Protect Government's Interest
(1) The Recipient agrees to execute or to have executed and promptly deliver to DOE all instruments necessary to:
(i) Establish or confirm the rights the Government has throughout the world in those subject inventions for which the Recipient retains title; and
(ii) Convey title to DOE when requested under paragraph (d) of this Patent Rights clause, and to enable the government to obtain patent protection throughout the world in that subject invention.
(2) The Recipient agrees to require, by written agreement, its employees, other than clerical and non-technical employees, to disclose promptly in writing to personnel identified as responsible for the administration of patent matters and in a format suggested by the Recipient each subject invention made under this award in order that the Recipient can comply with the disclosure provisions of paragraph (c) of this Patent Rights clause, and to execute all papers necessary to file patent applications on subject inventions and to establish the Government's rights in the subject inventions. The disclosure format should require, as a minimum, the information requested by paragraph (c)(1) of this Patent Rights clause. The Recipient shall instruct such employees through the employee agreements or other suitable educational programs on the importance of reporting inventions in sufficient time to permit the filing of patent applications prior to U.S. or foreign statutory bars.
(3) The Recipient will notify DOE of any decision not to continue prosecution of a patent application, pay maintenance fees, or defend in a reexamination or opposition proceeding on a patent, in any country, not less
than 30 days before the expiration of the response period required by the relevant patent office.
(4) The Recipient agrees to include, within the specification of any U.S. patent application and any patent issuing thereon covering a subject invention, the following statement: “This invention was made with Government support under (identify the award) awarded by (identify DOE). The Government has certain rights in this invention.”

# (g) Subaward/Contract
(1) The Recipient will include this Patent Rights clause, suitably modified to identify the parties, in all subawards/contracts, regardless of tier, for experimental, developmental or research work to be performed by a small business firm or nonprofit organization. The subrecipient/contractor will retain all rights provided for the Recipient in this Patent Rights clause, and the Recipient will not, as part of the consideration for awarding the subcontract, obtain rights in the subcontractors' subject inventions.
(2) The Recipient will include in all other subawards/contracts, regardless of tier, for experimental, developmental or research work, the patent rights clause required by 10 CFR 600.325(c).
(3) In the case of subawards/contracts at any tier, DOE, the Recipient, and the subrecipient/contractor agree that the mutual obligations of the parties created by this clause constitute a contract between the subrecipient/contractor and DOE with respect to those matters covered by the clause.

# (h) Reporting on Utilization of Subject Inventions
The Recipient agrees to submit on request periodic reports no more frequently than annually on the utilization of a subject invention or on efforts at obtaining such utilization that are being made by the Recipient or its licensees or assignees. Such reports shall include information regarding the status of development, date of first commercial sale or use, gross royalties received by the Recipient and such other data and information as DOE may reasonably specify. The Recipient also agrees to provide additional reports in connection with any march-in proceeding undertaken by DOE in accordance with paragraph (j) of this Patent Rights clause. As required by 35 U.S.C. 202(c)(5), DOE agrees it will not disclose such information to persons outside the Government without the permission of the Recipient.

# (i) Preference for United States Industry.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Patent Rights clause, the Recipient agrees that neither it nor any assignee will grant to any person the exclusive right to use or sell any subject invention in the U.S. unless such person agrees that any products embodying the subject invention or produced through the use of the subject invention will be manufactured substantially in the U.S. However, in individual cases, the requirement for such an agreement may be waived by DOE upon a showing by the Recipient or its assignee that reasonable but unsuccessful efforts have been made to grant licenses on similar terms to potential licensees that would be likely to manufacture substantially in the U.S. or that under the circumstances domestic manufacture is not commercially feasible.

# (j) March-in-Rights
The Recipient agrees that with respect to any subject invention in which it has acquired title, DOE has the right in accordance with procedures at 37 CFR 401.6 and any supplemental regulations of the Agency to require the Recipient, an assignee or exclusive licensee of a subject invention to grant a non-exclusive, partially exclusive, or exclusive license in any field of use to a responsible applicant or applicants, upon terms that are reasonable under the circumstances and if the Recipient, assignee, or exclusive licensee refuses such a request, DOE has the right to grant such a license itself if DOE determines that:
(1) Such action is necessary because the Recipient or assignee has not taken or is not expected to take within a reasonable time, effective steps to achieve practical application of the subject invention in such field of use;
(2) Such action is necessary to alleviate health or safety needs which are not reasonably satisfied by the Recipient, assignee, or their licensees;
(3) Such action is necessary to meet requirements for public use specified by Federal regulations and such requirements are not reasonably satisfied by the Recipient, assignee, or licensee; or
(4) Such action is necessary because the agreement required by paragraph (i) of this Patent Rights clause has not been obtained or waived or because a licensee of the exclusive right to use or sell any subject invention in the U.S. is in breach of such agreement.

# (k) Special Provisions for Awards With Nonprofit Organizations
If the Recipient is a nonprofit organization, it agrees that:
(1) Rights to a subject invention in the U.S. may not be assigned without the approval of DOE, except where such assignment is made to an organization which has as one of its primary functions the management of inventions, provided that such assignee will be subject to the same provisions as the Recipient;
(2) The Recipient will share royalties collected on a subject invention with the inventor, including Federal employee co-inventors (when DOE deems it appropriate) when the subject invention is assigned in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 202(e) and 37 CFR 401.10;
(3) The balance of any royalties or income earned by the Recipient with respect to subject inventions, after payment of expenses (including payments to inventors) incidental to the administration of subject inventions, will be utilized for the support of scientific or engineering research or education; and
(4) It will make efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to attract licensees of subject inventions that are small business firms and that it will give preference to a small business firm if the Recipient determines that the small business firm has a plan or proposal for marketing the invention which, if executed, is equally likely to bring the invention to practical application as any plans or proposals from applicants that are not small business firms; provided that the Recipient is also satisfied that the small business firm has the capability and resources to carry out its plan or proposal. The decision whether to give a preference in any specific case will be at the discretion of the Recipient. However, the Recipient agrees that the Secretary of Commerce may review the Recipient's licensing program and decisions regarding small business applicants, and the Recipient will negotiate changes to its licensing policies, procedures or practices with the Secretary when the Secretary's review discloses that the Recipient could take reasonable steps to implement more effectively the requirements of this paragraph (k)(4).

(2) The time limits in the procedures set forth in subparagraph (e)(1) of this clause may be modified in accordance with agency regulations implementing the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) if necessary to respond to a request thereunder.

# (f) Omitted or Incorrect Markings
(1) Data delivered to the Government without either the limited rights or restricted rights notice as authorized by paragraph (g) of this clause, or the copyright notice required by paragraph (c) of this clause, shall be deemed to have been furnished with unlimited rights, and the Government assumes no liability for the disclosure, use, or reproduction of such data. However, to the extent the data has not been disclosed without restriction outside the Government, the Recipient may request, within 6 months (or a longer time approved by the Contracting Officer for good cause shown) after delivery or such data, permission to have notices placed on qualifying data at the Recipient's expense, and the Contracting Officer may agree to do so if the Recipient:
(i) Identifies the data to which the omitted notice is to be applied;
(ii) Demonstrates that the omission of the notice was inadvertent;
(iii) Establishes that the use of the proposed notice is authorized; and
(iv) Acknowledges that the Government has no liability with respect to the disclosure, use, or reproduction of any such data made prior to the addition of the notice or resulting from the omission of the notice.
(2) The Contracting Officer may also:
(i) Permit correction at the Recipient's expense of incorrect notices if the Recipient identifies the data on which correction of the notice is to be made, and demonstrates that the correct notice is authorized, or
(ii) Correct any incorrect notices.

# (g) Protection of Limited Rights Data and Restricted Computer Software
When data other than that listed in subparagraphs (b)(1)(i), (ii), and (iii) of this clause are specified to be delivered under this agreement and qualify as either limited rights data or restricted computer software, if the Recipient desires to continue protection of such data, the Recipient shall withhold such data and not furnish them to the Government under this agreement. As a condition to this withholding, the Recipient shall identify the data being withheld and furnish form, fit, and function data in lieu thereof. Limited rights data that are formatted as a computer data base for delivery to the Government are to be treated as limited rights data and not restricted computer software.

# (h) Subaward/Contract
The Recipient has the responsibility to obtain from its subrecipients/contractors all data and rights therein necessary to fulfill the Recipient's obligations to the Government under this agreement. If a subrecipient/contractor refuses to accept terms affording the Government such rights, the Recipient shall promptly bring such refusal to the attention of the Contracting Officer and not proceed with the subaward/contract award without further authorization.

# (i) Additional Data Requirements
In addition to the data specified elsewhere in this agreement to be delivered, the Contracting Officer may, at anytime during agreement performance or within a period of 3 years after acceptance of all items to be delivered under this agreement, order any data first produced or specifically used in the performance of this agreement. This clause is applicable to all data ordered under this subparagraph. Nothing contained in this subparagraph shall require the Recipient to deliver any data the withholding of which is authorized by this clause, or data which are specifically identified in this agreement as not subject to this clause. When data are to be delivered under this subparagraph, the Recipient will be compensated for converting the data into the prescribed form, for reproduction, and for delivery.
(j) The recipient agrees, except as may be otherwise specified in this award for specific data items listed as not subject to this paragraph, that the Contracting Officer or an authorized representative may, up to three years after acceptance of all items to be delivered under this award, inspect at the Recipient's facility any data withheld pursuant to paragraph (g) of this clause, for purposes of verifying the Recipient's assertion pertaining to the limited rights or restricted rights status of the data or for evaluating work performance. Where the Recipient
whose data are to be inspected demonstrates to the Contracting Officer that there would be a possible conflict of interest if the inspection were made by a particular representative, the Contracting Officer shall designate an alternate inspector.
As prescribed in 600.325(d)(1), the following Alternate I and/or II may be inserted in the clause in the award instrument.
Alternate I:
(g)(2) Notwithstanding subparagraph (g)(1) of this clause, the agreement may identify and specify the delivery of limited rights data, or the Contracting Officer may require by written request the delivery of limited rights data that has been withheld or would otherwise be withholdable. If delivery of such data is so required, the Recipient may affix the following “Limited Rights Notice” to the data and the Government will thereafter treat the data, in accordance with such Notice:

# LIMITED RIGHTS NOTICE
(a) These data are submitted with limited rights under Government agreement No. ________ (and subaward/contract No. ________, if appropriate).

# PROTECTED RIGHTS NOTICE
These protected data were produced under agreement no. ______ with the U.S. Department of Energy and may not be published, disseminated, or disclosed to others outside the Government until (
Note:
) The period of protection of such data is fully negotiable, but cannot exceed the applicable statutorily authorized maximum), unless express written authorization is obtained from the recipient. Upon expiration of the period of protection set forth in this Notice, the Government shall have unlimited rights in this data. This Notice shall be marked on any reproduction of this data, in whole or in part.

# (End of notice)

(a) For evaluation purposes under the restriction that the “Protected Data” be retained in confidence and not be further disclosed; or
(b) To subcontractors or other team members performing work under the Government's (insert name of program or other applicable activity) program of which this award is a part, for information or use in connection with the work performed under their activity, and under the restriction that the Protected Data be retained in confidence and not be further disclosed.
(3) The obligations of confidentiality and restrictions on publication and dissemination shall end for any Protected Data.
(a) At the end of the protected period;
(b) If the data becomes publicly known or available from other sources without a breach of the obligation of confidentiality with respect to the Protected Data;

(d) If the Recipient disseminates or authorizes another to disseminate such data without obligations of confidentiality.
(4) However, the Recipient agrees that the following types of data are not considered to be protected and shall be provided to the Government when required by this award
without any claim that the data are Protected Data. The parties agree that notwithstanding the following lists of types of data, nothing precludes the Government from seeking delivery of additional data in accordance with this award, or from making publicly available additional non-protected data, nor does the following list constitute any admission by the Government that technical data not on the list is Protected Data. (
Note:
It is expected that this paragraph will specify certain types of mutually agreed upon data that will be available to the public and will not be asserted by the recipient/contractor as limited rights or protected data).
(5) The Government's sole obligation with respect to any protected data shall be as set forth in this paragraph (g).

# (h) Protection of Limited Rights Data
When data other than that listed in subparagraphs (b)(1)(i), (ii), and (iii) of this clause are specified to be delivered under this agreement and such data qualify as either limited rights data or restricted computer software, the Recipient, if the Recipient desires to continue protection of such data, shall withhold such data and not furnish them to the Government under this agreement. As a condition to this withholding the Recipient shall identify the data being withheld and furnish form, fit, and function data in lieu thereof.

# (i) Subaward/Contract

When data are to be delivered under this subparagraph, the Recipient will be compensated for converting the data into the prescribed form, for reproduction, and for delivery.
(k) The Recipient agrees, except as may be otherwise specified in this agreement for specific data items listed as not subject to this paragraph, that the Contracting Officer or an authorized representative may, up to three years after acceptance of all items to be delivered under this contract, inspect at the Recipient's facility any data withheld pursuant to paragraph (h) of this clause, for purposes of verifying the Recipient's assertion pertaining to the limited rights or restricted rights status of the data or for evaluating work performance. Where the Recipient whose data are to be inspected demonstrates to the Contracting Officer that there would be a possible conflict of interest if the inspection were made by a particular representative, the Contracting Officer shall designate an alternate inspector.
As prescribed in 600.325(e)(2), the following Alternate I and/or II may be inserted in the clause in the award instrument.
Alternate I:
(h)(2) Notwithstanding subparagraph (h)(1) of this clause, the agreement may identify and specify the delivery of limited rights data, or the Contracting Officer may require by written request the delivery of limited rights data that has been withheld or would otherwise be withholdable.

Contractors who apply or bid for an award of $100,000 or more must file the required certification. Each tier certifies to the tier above that it will not and has not used Federal appropriated funds to pay any person or organization for influencing or attempting to influence an officer or employee of any agency, a member of Congress, officer or employee of Congress, or an employee of a member of Congress in connection with obtaining any Federal contract, grant or any other award covered by 31 U.S.C.1352. Each tier must also disclose any lobbing with non-Federal funds that takes place in connection with obtaining any Federal award. Such disclosures are forwarded from tier to tier up to the recipient.
7.
Debarment and Suspension (E.O.s 12549 and 12689—
Contract awards that exceed the simplified acquisition threshold and certain other contract awards must not be made to parties listed on nonprocurement portion of the General Services Administration's Lists of Parties Excluded from Federal Procurement and Nonprocurement Programs in accordance with E.O.s 12549 (3 CFR, 1986 Comp., p. 189) and 12689 (3 CFR, 1989 Comp., p. 235),“Debarment and Suspension.” This list contains the names of parties debarred, suspended, or otherwise excluded by agencies, and contractors declared ineligible under statutory or regulatory authority other than E.O. 12549. Contractors with awards that exceed the small purchase threshold must provide the required certification regarding its exclusion status and that of its principals.
8.
Davis-Bacon Act (40 U.S.C. 276a)—
As a general rule, it is unlikely that the Davis-Bacon Act, which among other things requires payment of prevailing wages on projects for the construction of public works, would apply to financial assistance awards. However, the presence of certain factors (
e.g.,
requirement of particular program statutes; title to a construction facility resting in the Government) might necessitate a closer analysis of the award, to determine if the Davis-Bacon Act would apply in the particular factual situation presented.

(g) For awards and commitments in process prior to December 23, 1989, but not made before that date, certifications shall be required at award or

(h) No reporting is required for an activity paid for with appropriated funds if that activity is allowable under either subpart B or C.

# Subpart B—Activities by Own Employees
§ 601.200
Agency and legislative liaison.
(a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in § 601.100 (a), does not apply in the case of a payment of reasonable compensation made to an officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement if the payment is for agency and legislative liaison activities not directly related to a covered Federal action.
(b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, providing any information specifically requested by an agency or Congress is allowable at any time.
(c) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the following agency and legislative liaison activities are allowable at any time only where they are not related to a specific solicitation for any covered Federal action:
(1) Discussing with an agency (including individual demonstrations) the qualities and characteristics of the person's products or services, conditions or terms of sale, and service capabilities; and,
(2) Technical discussions and other activities regarding the application or adaptation of the person's products or services for an agency's use.
(d) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the following agencies and legislative liaison activities are allowable only where they are prior to formal solicitation of any covered Federal action:
(1) Providing any information not specifically requested but necessary for an agency to make an informed decision about initiation of a covered Federal action;
(2) Technical discussions regarding the preparation of an unsolicited proposal prior to its official submission; and,
(3) Capability presentations by persons seeking awards from an agency pursuant to the provisions of the Small Business Act, as amended by Public Law 95-507 and other subsequent amendments.
(e) Only those activities expressly authorized by this section are allowable under this section.
§ 601.205
Professional and technical services.
(a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in § 601.100 (a), does not apply in the case of a payment of reasonable compensation made to an officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or an extension, continuation, renewal, amendment, or modification of a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement if payment is for professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any bid, proposal, or application for that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or for meeting requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement.
(b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, “professional and technical services” shall be limited to advice and analysis directly applying any professional or technical discipline. For example, drafting of a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by a lawyer is allowable. Similarly, technical advice provided by an engineer on the performance or operational capability of a piece of equipment rendered directly in the negotiation of a contract is allowable. However, communications with the intent to influence made by a professional (such as a licensed lawyer) or a technical person (such as a licensed accountant) are not allowable under this section unless they provide advice and analysis directly applying their professional or
technical expertise and unless the advice or analysis is rendered directly and solely in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action. Thus, for example, communications with the intent to influence made by a lawyer that do not provide legal advice or analysis directly and solely related to the legal aspects of his or her client's proposal, but generally advocate one proposal over another are not allowable under this section because the lawyer is not providing professional legal services. Similarly, communications with the intent to influence made by an engineer providing an engineering analysis prior to the preparation or submission of a bid or proposal are not allowable under this section since the engineer is providing technical services but not directly in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action.
(c) Requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving a covered Federal award include those required by law or regulation, or reasonably expected to be required by law or regulation, and any other requirements in the actual award documents.
(d) Only those services expressly authorized by this section are allowable under this section.
§ 601.210
Reporting.
No reporting is required with respect to payments of reasonable compensation made to regularly employed officers or employees of a person.

# Subpart C—Activities by Other Than Own Employees
§ 601.300
Professional and technical services.
(a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in § 601.100 (a), does not apply in the case of any reasonable payment to a person, other than an officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving a covered Federal action, if the payment is for professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any bid, proposal, or application for that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or for meeting requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement.
(b) The reporting requirements in § 601.110 (a) and (b) regarding filing a disclosure form by each person, if required, shall not apply with respect to professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any commitment providing for the United States to insure or guarantee a loan.
(c) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, “professional and technical services” shall be limited to advice and analysis directly applying any professional or technical discipline. For example, drafting or a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by a lawyer is allowable. Similarly, technical advice provided by an engineer on the performance or operational capability of a piece of equipment rendered directly in the negotiation of a contract is allowable. However, communications with the intent to influence made by a professional (such as a licensed lawyer) or a technical person (such as a licensed accountant) are not allowable under this section unless they provide advice and analysis directly applying their professional or technical expertise and unless the advice or analysis is rendered directly and solely in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action. Thus, for example, communications with the intent to influence made by a lawyer that do not provide legal advice or analysis directly and solely related to the legal aspects of his or her client's proposal, but generally advocate one proposal over another are not allowable under this section because the lawyer is not providing professional legal services. Similarly, communications with the intent to influence made by an engineer providing an engineering analysis prior to the preparation or submission of a bid or proposal are not allowable under this section since the engineer is providing technical services but not directly in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action.
(d) Requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving a covered Federal award include those required by law or regulation, or reasonably expected to be required by law or regulation, and any other requirements in the actual award documents.
(e) Persons other than officers or employees of a person requesting or receiving a covered Federal action include consultants and trade associations.
(f) Only those services expressly authorized by this section are allowable under this section.

# Subpart D—Penalties and Enforcement
§ 601.400
Penalties.
(a) Any person who makes an expenditure prohibited by this part shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $25,132 and not more than $251,322 for each such expenditure.
(b) Any person who fails to file or amend the disclosure form (see appendix B to this part) to be filed or amended if required by this part, shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $25,132 and not more than $251,322 for each such failure.
(c) A filing or amended filing on or after the date on which an administrative action for the imposition of a civil penalty is commenced does not prevent the imposition of such civil penalty for a failure occurring before that date. An administrative action is commenced with respect to a failure when an investigating official determines in writing to commence an investigation of an allegation of such failure.
(d) In determining whether to impose a civil penalty, and the amount of any such penalty, by reason of a violation by any person, the agency shall consider the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violation, the effect on the ability of such person to continue in business, any prior violations by such person, the degree of culpability of such person, the ability of the person to pay the penalty, and such other matters as may be appropriate.
(e) First offenders under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section shall be subject to a civil penalty of $25,132, absent aggravating circumstances. Second and subsequent offenses by persons shall be subject to an appropriate civil penalty between $25,132 and $251,322, as determined by the agency head or his or her designee.
(f) An imposition of a civil penalty under this section does not prevent the United States from seeking any other remedy that may apply to the same conduct that is the basis for the imposition of such civil penalty.

(a) The project period during which DOE expects to provide support for an approved project under this part shall generally not exceed 3 years and may exceed 5 years only if DOE makes a renewal award or otherwise extends the award. The project period shall be specified on the Notice of Financial Assistance Grant (DOE Form 4600.1).
(b) Each budget period of an award under this part shall generally be 12 months and may be as much as 24 months, as DOE deems appropriate.
§ 602.12
Cost sharing.
Cost sharing is not required, nor will it be considered, as a criterion in the evaluation and selection process unless otherwise provided under § 602.9(d)(5).
§ 602.13
Limitation of DOE liability.
Awards made under this part are subject to the requirement that the maximum DOE obligation to the recipient is the amount shown in the Notice of Financial Assistance Award as the amount of DOE funds obligated. DOE shall not be obligated to make any additional, supplemental, continuation, renewal, or other award for the same or any other purpose.
§ 602.14
Fee.
(a) Notwithstanding 2 CFR part 200 as amended by 2 CFR part 910, a fee may be paid, in appropriate circumstances, to a recipient that is a small business concern, as qualified under the criteria and size standards of 13 CFR part 121, in order to permit the concern to participate in the Epidemiology and Other Health Studies Financial Assistance Program. Whether or not it is appropriate to pay a fee shall be determined by the contracting officer, who shall, at a minimum, apply the following guidelines:
(1) Whether the acceptance of an award will displace other work that the small business is currently engaged in or committed to assume in the near future; or
(2) Whether the acceptance of an award will, in the absence of paying a fee, cause substantial financial distress to the business. In evaluating financial distress, the contracting officer shall balance current displacement against reasonable future benefit to the company. (If the award will result in the beneficial expansion of the existing
business base of the company, then no fee would generally be appropriate.) Fees shall not be paid to other entities except as a deviation from 2 CFR part 200 as amended by 2 CFR part 910, nor shall fees be paid under awards in support of conferences.
(b) To request a fee, a small business concern shall submit with its application a written self-certification that it is a small business concern qualified under the criteria and size standards in 13 CFR part 121. In addition, the application must state the amount of fee requested for the entire project period and the basis for requesting the amount and must also state why payment of a fee by DOE would be appropriate.
(c) If the contracting officer determines that payment of a fee is appropriate under paragraph (a) of this section, the amount of fee shall be that determined to be reasonable by the contracting officer. The contracting officer shall, at a minimum, apply the following guidelines in determining the fee amount:
(1) The fee base shall include the estimated allowable cost of direct salaries and wages and allocable fringe benefits. This fee base shall exclude all other direct and indirect costs.
(2) The fee amount expressed as a percentage of the appropriate fee base, pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section, shall not exceed the percentage rate of fee that would result if a Federal agency contracted for the same amount of salaries, wages, and allocable fringe benefits under a cost reimbursement contract.
(3) Fee amounts, determined pursuant to paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section, shall be appropriately reduced when:
(i) Advance payments are provided; and/or
(ii) Title to property acquired with DOE funds vests in the recipient (2 CFR part 200 as amended by 2 CFR part 910).
(d) Notwithstanding 2 CFR part 200 as amended by 2 CFR part 910, any fee awarded shall be a fixed fee and shall be payable on an annual basis in proportion to the work completed, as determined by the contracting officer, upon satisfactory submission and acceptance by DOE of the progress report. If the project period is shortened due to termination, or the project period is not fully funded, the fee shall be reduced by an appropriate amount.
[60 FR 5841, Jan. 31, 1995, as amended at 79 FR 76046, Dec. 19, 2014]
§ 602.15
Indirect cost limitations.
Awards issued under this part for conferences and scientific/technical meetings will not include payment for indirect costs.
§ 602.16
National security.
Activities under the Epidemiology and Other Health Studies Financial Assistance Program are not expected to involve classified information (i.e., Restricted Data, Formerly Restricted Data, National Security Information). However, if in the opinion of the recipient or DOE such involvement becomes expected prior to the closeout of the award, the recipient or DOE shall notify the other in writing immediately. If the recipient believes any information developed or acquired may be classified, the recipient shall not provide the potentially classified information to anyone, including DOE officials with whom the recipient normally communicates, except the Director, Office of Classification, and shall protect such information as if it were classified until notified by DOE that a determination has been made that it does not require such handling. Correspondence that includes the specific information in question shall be sent by registered mail to the U.S. Department of Energy, Attn: Director, Office of Classification, EHSS-60, P.O. Box A, Germantown, MD 20875. If the information is determined to be classified, the recipient may wish to discontinue the project, in which case the recipient and DOE shall terminate the award by mutual agreement. If the award is to be terminated, all material deemed by DOE to be classified shall be forwarded to DOE in a manner specified by DOE for proper disposition. If the recipient and DOE wish to continue the award, even though classified information is involved, the recipient shall be requested to obtain both personnel and facility security clearances through
the Office of Headquarters Security Operations awards or from the cognizant field office for awards obtained through DOE field organizations. Costs associated with handling and protecting any such classified information shall be negotiated at the time that the determination to proceed is made.
[60 FR 5841, Jan. 31, 1995, as amended at 71 FR 68730, Nov. 28, 2006; 80 FR 5008, Jan. 30, 2015; 88 FR 41292, June 26, 2023]
§ 602.17
Continuation funding and reporting requirements.
(a) A recipient shall periodically report to DOE on the project's progress in meeting the project objectives of the award. The following types of reports shall be used:
(1)
Progress Reports.
After issuance of an initial award, recipients must submit a satisfactory progress report to receive a continuation award for the remainder of the project period. The original and two copies of the required report must be submitted to the Office of Environment, Health, Safety and Security program manager 90 days prior to the anticipated continuation funding date. The report should include results of work to date and emphasize findings and their significance to the field, and any real or anticipated problems. The report also should contain the following information: On the first page, provide the project title, principal investigator/project director name, period of time the report covers, name and address of recipient organization, DOE award number, the amount of unexpended funds, if any, that are anticipated to be left at the end of the current budget period. If the amount exceeds 10 percent of the funds available for the budget period, provide information as to why the excess funds are anticipated to be available and how they will be used in the next budget period. The report should state whether the aims have changed from the original application, and if they have, provide revised aims. A completed budget page must be submitted with the continuation progress report when a change to anticipated future costs will exceed 25 percent of the original recommended future budget.
(2)
Notice of Energy Research and Development (R
D) Project.
A Notice of Energy R
D Project, DOE Form 1430.22, which summarizes the purpose and scope of the project, must be submitted in accordance with the Distribution and Schedule of Documents set forth in appendix A to this part, Schedule of Renewal Applications and Reports. Copies of the form may be obtained from a DOE contracting office.
(3)
Special Reports.
The recipient shall report the following events to DOE as soon after they occur as possible:
(i) Problems, delays, or adverse conditions that will materially affect the ability to attain project objectives or prevent the meeting of time schedules and goals. The report must describe remedial action that the recipient has taken, or plans to take, and any action DOE should take to alleviate the problems.
(ii) Favorable developments or events that enable meeting time schedules and goals sooner, or a lower cost than anticipated, or producing more beneficial results than originally projected.
(4)
Final Report.
A final report covering the entire project must be submitted by the recipient within 90 days after the project period ends or the award is terminated. Satisfactory completion of an award will be contingent upon the receipt of this report. The final report shall follow the same outline as progress reports. Recipients will provide, as part of the final report, a description of records and data compiled during the project, along with a plan for its preservation or disposition (see § 602.19 of this part). All manuscripts prepared for publication should be appended to the final report.
(5)
Financial Status Report (FSR) (OMB No. 0348-0039).
The FSR is required within 90 days after completion of each budget period. For budget periods exceeding 12 months, an FSR is also required within 90 days after this first 12 months unless waived by the contracting officer.
(b) DOE may extend the deadline date for any report if the recipient submits a written request before the deadline, that adequately justifies an extension.
(c) A table summarizing the various types of reports, time for submission, and number of copies is set forth in appendix A to this part. The schedule of
reports shall be as prescribed in this table, unless the award document specifies otherwise. These reports shall be submitted by the recipient to the awarding office.
(d) DOE, or its authorized representatives, may make site visits, at any reasonable time, to review the project. DOE may provide such technical assistance as may be requested.
(e) Recipients may place performance reporting requirements on a subrecipient consistent with the provisions of this section.
[60 FR 5841, Jan. 31, 1995, as amended at 71 FR 68730, Nov. 28, 2006; 80 FR 5008, Jan. 30, 2015]
§ 602.18
Dissemination of results.
(a) Recipients are encouraged to disseminate research results promptly. DOE reserves the right to utilize, and have others utilize to the extent it deems appropriate, the reports resulting from research awards.
(b) DOE may waive the technical reporting requirement of progress reports set forth in § 602.17, if the recipient submits to DOE a copy of its own report that is published or accepted for publication in a recognized scientific or technical journal and that satisfies the information requirements of the program.
(c) Recipients are urged to publish results through normal publication channels.
(d) The article shall include an acknowledgement that the project was supported, in whole or in part, by a DOE award, and specify the award number, but state that such support does not constitute an endorsement by DOE of the views expressed in the article.
[60 FR 5841, Jan. 31, 1995, as amended at 79 FR 76046, Dec. 19, 2014]
§ 602.19
Records and data.
(a) In some cases, DOE will require submission of certain project records or data to facilitate mission-related activities. Recipients, therefore, must take adequate steps to ensure proper management, control, and preservation of all project records and data.
(b) Awardees must ensure that all project data is adequately documented. Documentation shall:
(1) Reference software used to compile, manage, and analyze data;
(2) Define all technical characteristics necessary for reading or processing the records;
(3) Define file and record content and codes;
(4) Describe update cycles or conditions and rules for adding or deleting information; and
(5) Detail instrument calibration effects, sampling and analysis, space and time coverage, quality control measures, data algorithms and reduction methods, and other activities relevant to data collection and assembly.
(c) Recipients agree to comply with designated DOE records and data management requirements, including providing electronic data in prescribed formats and retention of specified records and data for eventual transfer to the Comprehensive Epidemiologic Data Resource or to another repository, as directed by DOE. Recipients will provide, as part of the final report, a description of records and data compiled during the project along with a plan for its preservation or disposition.
(d) Recipients agree to make project records and data available as soon as possible when requested by DOE.

# Subpart A—General
§ 603.100
Purpose.
This part establishes uniform policies and procedures for the implementation of DOE's “other transactions” authority and for award and administration of a technology investment agreement (TIA).
§ 603.105
Description.
(a) A TIA is a special type of assistance instrument used to increase involvement of commercial firms in the Department of Energy's (DOE) research, development and demonstration (RD
D) programs. A TIA, like a cooperative agreement, requires substantial Federal involvement in the technical or management aspects of the project. A TIA may be either a type of cooperative agreement or a type of assistance transaction other than a cooperative agreement, depending on the intellectual property provisions. A TIA is either:
(1) A type of cooperative agreement with more flexible provisions tailored for commercial firms (as distinct from a cooperative agreement subject to all of the requirements in 10 CFR 600), but with intellectual property provisions in full compliance with the DOE intellectual property statutes (
i.e.
, Bayh-Dole statute and 42 U.S.C. 2182 and 5908, as implemented in 10 CFR 600.325). The authority to award this type of TIA is 42 U.S.C. 7256(a), as well as any program-specific statute that provides authority to award cooperative agreements; or
(2) An assistance transaction other than a cooperative agreement, if its intellectual property provisions vary from the Bayh-Dole statute and 42 U.S.C. 2182 and 5908, which require the Government to retain certain intellectual property rights and require differing treatment between large businesses and nonprofit organizations or small businesses. The authority to award this type of TIA is 42 U.S.C. 7256(g), as well as any program-specific statute that provides authority to award assistance agreements.
(b) The two types of TIAs have similar requirements, except for the intellectual property requirements. If the contracting officer determines there is a unique, exceptional need to vary from the standard intellectual property requirements in 10 CFR 600.325, the TIA becomes an assistance transaction other than a cooperative agreement.
§ 603.110
Use of TIAs.
The ultimate goal for using a TIA is to broaden the technology base available to meet DOE mission requirements and foster within the technology base new relationships and practices to advance the national economic and energy security of the United States, to promote scientific and technological innovation in support of that mission, and to ensure the environmental cleanup of the national nuclear weapons complex. A TIA therefore is designed to:
(a) Reduce barriers to participation in RD
D programs by commercial firms that deal primarily in the commercial marketplace. A TIA allows contracting officers to tailor Government requirements and lower or remove barriers if it can be done with proper stewardship of Federal funds.
(b) Promote new relationships among performers in the technology base. Collaborations among commercial firms that deal primarily in the commercial marketplace, firms that regularly perform on the DOE RD
D programs and nonprofit organizations can enhance overall quality and productivity.
(c) Stimulate performers to develop and use new business practices and disseminate best practices throughout the technology base.
§ 603.115
Approval requirements.
An officer of the Department who has been appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and who has been delegated the authority from the Secretary must approve the award of a TIA and may perform other functions of the Secretary as set forth in 42 U.S.C. 7256(g). This authority may not be re-delegated. The DOE or National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) Senior Procurement Executive also must concur in the award of a TIA.
§ 603.120
Contracting officer warrant requirements.
A contracting officer may award or administer a TIA only if the contracting officer's warrant authorizes the award or administration of a TIA.
§ 603.125
Applicability of other parts of the DOE Assistance Regulations.
(a) TIAs are explicitly covered in this part and 10 CFR part 600, subpart A—General. 10 CFR part 600, subpart A, addresses general matters that relate to assistance instruments.
(b) Three additional parts of the DOE Assistance Regulations apply to TIAs, although they do not mention a TIA explicitly. They are:
(1) 10 CFR part 601—lobbying restrictions apply by law (31 U.S.C. 1352) to a TIA that is a cooperative agreement and as a matter of DOE policy to a TIA that is an assistance transaction other than a cooperative agreement.
(2) 10 CFR part 606—debarment and suspension requirements apply because they cover nonprocurement instruments in general; and
(3) 10 CFR part 607—drug-free work-place (financial assistance) requirements apply because they cover all assistance instruments.
(c) Other portions of 10 CFR part 600 apply to a TIA as referenced in part 603.

# Subpart B—Appropriate Use of Technology Investment Agreements
§ 603.200
Contracting officer responsibilities.
Contracting officers may use a TIA only in appropriate situations. To do so, the use of a TIA must be justified based on:
(a) The nature of the project, as discussed in § 603.205;
(b) The type of recipient, addressed in § 603.210;
(c) The recipient's commitment and cost sharing, as described in § 603.215;
(d) The degree of involvement of the Government program official, as discussed in § 603.220; and
(e) The contracting officer's judgment that the use of a TIA could benefit the RD
D objectives in ways that likely would not happen if another type of instrument were used (i.e., a contract, grant or cooperative agreement is not feasible or appropriate). Answers to the four questions in § 603.225 form the basis for the contracting officer's judgment.
§ 603.205
Nature of the project.
Judgments relating to the nature of the project include:
(a) The principal purpose of the project is to carry out a public purpose of support or stimulation of RD
D (i.e., assistance), rather than acquiring goods or services for the benefit of the Government (i.e., acquisition);
(b) To the maximum extent practicable, the TIA does not support RD
D that duplicates other RD
D being conducted under existing programs carried out by the DOE; and
(c) The use of a standard contract, grant or cooperative agreement for the project is not feasible or appropriate (see questions in § 603.225).
§ 603.210
Recipients.
(a) A TIA requires one or more for-profit firms, not acting in their capacity as the contractor of a FFRDC, to be involved either in the:
(1) Performance of the RD
D project; or
(2) The commercial application of the results.
(i) In those cases where there is only a non-profit performer or a consortium of non-profit performers or non-profit performers and FFRDC contractors, if and as authorized, the performers must have at least a tentative agreement with a specific for-profit partner or partners who plan on being involved in the commercial application of the results.
(ii) In consultation with legal counsel, the contracting officer should review the agreement between the performers and their for-profit partner to ensure that the for-profit partner is committed to being involved in the commercial application of the results.
(b) A TIA may be particularly useful for awards to consortia (a consortium may include one or more for-profit firms, as well as State or local government agencies, institutions of higher education, other nonprofit organizations, or FFRDC contractors, if and as authorized) because:
(1) If multiple performers are participating as a consortium, they may be more equal partners in the performance of the project than usually is the case with a prime recipient and subrecipients. All of the performers are more likely to be directly involved in developing and revising plans for the RD
D effort, reviewing technical progress, and overseeing financial and other business matters. That feature makes consortia well suited to building new relationships among performers in the technology base, a principal objective for the use of a TIA.
(2) In addition, interactions among the participants within a consortium potentially provide a self-governance mechanism. The potential for additional self-governance is particularly good when a consortium includes multiple for-profit participants that normally are competitors within an industry.
(c) A TIA may be used for carrying out RD
D performed by single firms or multiple performers (e.g., a teaming arrangement) in prime award-subaward relationships. In awarding a TIA in those cases, however, consideration should be given to providing for greater involvement of the program official or a way to increase self-governance (e.g., a prime award with multiple subawards arranged so as to give the subrecipients more insight into and authority and responsibility for the programmatic and business aspects of the overall project than they usually have).
§ 603.215
Recipient's commitment and cost sharing.
(a) The contracting officer should evaluate whether the recipient has a strong commitment to and self-interest in the success of the project and incorporating the technology into products and processes for the commercial marketplace. Evidence of that commitment and interest should be found in the proposal, in the recipient's management plan, or through other means.
(b) The contracting officer must seek cost sharing. The purpose of cost sharing is to ensure that the recipient incurs real risk that gives it a vested interest in the project's success; the willingness to commit to meaningful cost sharing is a good indicator of a recipient's self-interest. The requirements are that:
(1) To the maximum extent practicable, the non-Federal parties carrying out a RD
D project under a TIA are to provide at least half of the costs of the project; and
(2) The parties must provide the cost sharing from non-Federal resources unless otherwise provided by law.
(c) The contracting officer may consider whether cost sharing is impracticable in a given case, unless there is a statutory requirement for cost sharing that applies to the particular program under which the award is to be made. Before deciding that cost sharing is impracticable, the contracting officer should carefully consider if there are other factors that demonstrate the recipient's self-interest in the success of the current project.
§ 603.220
Government participation.
A TIA is used to carry out cooperative relationships between the Federal Government and the recipient(s) which require substantial involvement of the Government in the execution of the RD
D. For example, program officials will participate in recipients' periodic reviews of progress and may be substantially involved with the recipients
in the resulting revisions of plans for future effort.
§ 603.225
Benefits of using a TIA.
Before deciding that a TIA is appropriate, the contracting officer also must judge that using a TIA could benefit the RD
D objectives in ways that likely would not happen if another type of assistance instrument were used (e.g., a cooperative agreement subject to all of the requirements of 10 CFR part 600). The contracting officer, in conjunction with Government program officials, must consider the questions in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section, to help identify the benefits that may justify using a TIA and reducing some of the usual requirements. The contracting officer must report the answers to these questions to help the DOE measure the benefits of using a TIA. Note full concise answers are required only to questions that relate to the benefits perceived for using the TIA, rather than another type of funding instrument, for the particular project. A simple “no” or “not applicable” is a sufficient response for other questions. The questions are:
(a) Will the use of a TIA permit the involvement of any commercial firms or business units of firms that would not otherwise participate in the project? If so:
(1) What are the expected benefits of those firms' or divisions' participation (e.g., is there a specific technology that could be better, more readily available, or less expensive)?
(2) Why would they not participate if an instrument other than a TIA were used? The contracting officer should identify specific provisions of the TIA or features of the TIA award process that enable their participation. For example, if the RD
D effort is based substantially on a for-profit firm's privately developed technology and the Government may be a major user of any commercial product developed as a result of the award, a for-profit firm may not participate unless the Government's intellectual property rights in the technology are modified.
(b) Will the use of a TIA allow the creation of new relationships among participants in a consortium, at the prime or subtier levels, among business units of the same firm, or between non-Federal participants and the Federal Government that will foster better technology? If so:
(1) Why do these new relationships have the potential for fostering technology that is better, more affordable, or more readily available?
(2) Are there provisions of the TIA or features of the TIA award process that enable these relationships to form? If so, the contracting officer should be able to identify specifically what they are. If not, the contracting officer should be able to explain specifically why the relationships could not be created if another type of assistance instrument were used. For example, a large business firm may not be willing to participate in a consortium or teaming arrangement with small business firms and nonprofit firms under a standard cooperative agreement because those entities have invention rights under the Bayh-Dole statute that are not available to large businesses. A large business firm may be willing to participate in a consortium or teaming arrangement only if all partners are substantially equal with regard to the allocation of intellectual property rights.
(c) Will the use of a TIA allow firms or business units of firms that traditionally accept Government awards to use new business practices in the execution of the RD
D project that will foster better technology, new technology more quickly or less expensively, or facilitate partnering with commercial firms? If so:
(1) What specific benefits result from the use of these new practices? The contracting officer should be able to explain specifically the potential for those benefits.
(2) Are there provisions of the TIA or features of the TIA award process that enable the use of the new practices? If so, the contracting officer should be able to identify those provisions or features and explain why the practices could not be used if the award were made using another type of assistance instrument.
(d) Are there any other benefits of the use of a TIA that could help DOE meet its objectives in carrying out the project? If so, the contracting officer
should be able to identify specifically what they are, how they can help meet the objectives, what features of the TIA or award process enable DOE to realize them, and why the benefits likely would not be realized if an assistance instrument other than a TIA were used.
§ 603.230
Fee or profit.
The contracting officer may not use a TIA if any participant is to receive fee or profit. Note that this policy extends to all performers of the project, including any subawards for substantive program performance, but it does not preclude participants' or subrecipients' payment of reasonable fee or profit when making purchases from suppliers of goods (e.g., supplies and equipment) or services needed to carry out the RD
D.

# Subpart C—Requirements for Expenditure-Based and Fixed-Support Technology Investment Agreements
§ 603.300
Difference between an expenditure-based and a fixed-support TIA.
The contracting officer may negotiate expenditure-based or fixed-support award terms for either types of TIA subject to the requirements in this subpart. The fundamental difference between an expenditure-based and a fixed-support TIA is:
(a) For an expenditure-based TIA, the amounts of interim payments or the total amount ultimately paid to the recipient are based on the amounts the recipient expends on project costs. If a recipient completes the project specified at the time of award before it expends all of the agreed-upon Federal funding and recipient cost sharing, the Federal Government may recover its share of the unexpended balance of funds or, by mutual agreement with the recipient, amend the agreement to expand the scope of the RD
D project. An expenditure-based TIA, therefore, is analogous to a cost-type procurement contract or grant.
(b) For a fixed-support TIA, the amount of assistance is established at the time of award and is not meant to be adjusted later. In that sense, a fixed-support TIA is somewhat analogous to a fixed-price procurement contract.
§ 603.305
Use of a fixed-support TIA.
The contracting officer may use a fixed-support TIA if:
(a) The agreement is to support or stimulate RD
D with outcomes that are well defined, observable, and verifiable;
(b) The resources required to achieve the outcomes can be estimated well enough to ensure the desired level of cost sharing (see example in § 603.560(b)); and
(c) The agreement does not require a specific amount or percentage of recipient cost sharing. In cases where the agreement does require a specific amount or percentage of cost sharing, a fixed-support TIA is not practicable because the agreement has to specify cost principles or standards for costs that may be charged to the project; require the recipient to track the costs of the project; and provide access for audit to allow verification of the recipient's compliance with the mandatory cost sharing. A fixed-support TIA may not be used if there is:
(1) A requirement (e.g., in statute or policy determination) for a specific amount or percentage of recipient cost sharing; or
(2) The contracting officer, in consultation with the program official, otherwise elects to include in the TIA a requirement for a specific amount or percentage of cost sharing.
§ 603.310
Use of an expenditure-based TIA.
In general, the contracting officer must use an expenditure-based TIA under conditions other than those described in § 603.305. Reasons for any exceptions to this general rule must be documented in the award file and must be consistent with the policy in § 603.230 that precludes payment of fee or profit to participants.
§ 603.315
Advantages of a fixed-support TIA.
In situations where the use of a fixed-support TIA is permissible (see §§ 603.305 and 603.310), its use may encourage some commercial firms' participation in the RD
D. With a fixed-
support TIA, the contracting officer can eliminate or reduce some post-award requirements that sometimes are cited as disincentives for those firms to participate. For example, a fixed-support TIA need not:
(a) Specify minimum standards for the recipient's financial management system;
(b) Specify cost principles or standards stating the types of costs the recipient may charge to the project;
(c) Provide for financial audits by Federal auditors or independent public accountants of the recipient's books and records;
(d) Set minimum standards for the recipient's purchasing system; or
(e) Require the recipient to prepare financial reports for submission to the Federal Government.

# Subpart D—Competition Phase
§ 603.400
Competitive procedures.
DOE policy is to award a TIA using competitive procedures and a merit-based selection process, as described in 10 CFR 600.6 and 600.13, respectively:
(a) In every case where required by statute; and
(b) To the maximum extent feasible, in all other cases. If it is not feasible to use competitive procedures, the contracting officer must comply with the requirements in 10 CFR 600.6(c).
§ 603.405
Announcement format.
If the contracting officer, in consultation with the program official, decides that a TIA is among the types of instruments that may be awarded, the additional elements described in §§ 603.410 through 603.420 should be included in the announcement.
§ 603.410
Announcement content.
Once the contracting officer, in consultation with the program official, considers the factors described in Subpart B of this part and decides that a TIA is among the types of instruments that may be awarded pursuant to a program announcement, it is important to state that fact in the announcement. The announcement also should state that a TIA is more flexible than a traditional financial assistance agreement and that requirements are negotiable in areas such as audits and intellectual property rights that may cause concern for commercial firms. Doing so should increase the likelihood that commercial firms will be willing to submit proposals.
§ 603.415
Cost sharing.
To help ensure a competitive process that is fair and equitable to all potential proposers, the announcement should state clearly:
(a) That, to the maximum extent practicable, the non-Federal parties carrying out a RD
D project under a TIA are to provide at least half of the costs of the project (see § 603.215(b));
(b) The types of cost sharing that are acceptable;
(c) How any in-kind contributions will be valued, in accordance with §§ 603.530 through 603.555; and
(d) Whether any consideration will be given to alternative approaches a proposer may offer to demonstrate its strong commitment to and self-interest in the project's success, in accordance with § 603.215.
§ 603.420
Disclosure of information.
The announcement should tell potential proposers that:
(a) For all TIAs, information described in paragraph (b) of this section is exempt from disclosure requirements of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)(codified at 5 U.S.C. 552) for a period of five years after the date on which the DOE receives the information from them; and
(b) As provided in 42 U.S.C. 7256(g) incorporating certain provisions of 10 U.S.C. 2371, disclosure is not required, and may not be compelled, under FOIA during that period if:
(1) A proposer submits the information in a competitive or noncompetitive process that could result in the award of a TIA; and
(2) The type of information is among the following types that are exempt:
(i) Proposals, proposal abstracts, and supporting documents; and
(ii) Business plans and technical information submitted on a confidential basis.
(c) If proposers desire to protect business plans and technical information
for five years from FOIA disclosure requirements, they must mark them with a legend identifying them as documents submitted on a confidential basis. After the five-year period, information may be protected for longer periods if it meets any of the criteria in 5 U.S.C. 552(b) (as implemented by the DOE in 10 CFR part 1004) for exemption from FOIA disclosure requirements.

# Subpart E—Pre-Award Business Evaluation
§ 603.500
Pre-award business evaluation.
(a) The contracting officer must determine the qualification of the recipient, as described in §§ 603.510 and 603.515.
(b) As the business expert working with the program official, the contracting officer also must address the financial aspects of the proposed agreement. The contracting officer must:
(1) Determine that the total amount of funding for the proposed effort is reasonable, as addressed in § 603.520.
(2) Assess the value and determine the reasonableness of the recipient's proposed cost sharing contribution, as discussed in §§ 603.525 through 603.555.
(3) If contemplating the use of a fixed-support rather than expenditure-based TIA, ensure that its use is justified, as explained in §§ 603.560 and 603.565.
(4) Determine amounts for milestone payments, if used, as discussed in § 603.570.
§ 603.505
Program resources.
Program officials can be a source of information for determining the reasonableness of proposed funding (e.g., on labor rates, as discussed in § 603.520) or establishing observable and verifiable technical milestones for payments (see § 603.570).

# Recipient Qualification
§ 603.510
Recipient qualifications.
Prior to award of a TIA, the contracting officer's responsibilities for determining that the recipient is qualified are the same as those for awarding a grant or cooperative agreement. If the recipient is a consortium that is not formally incorporated, the contracting officer has the additional responsibility described in § 603.515.
§ 603.515
Qualification of a consortium.
(a) A consortium that is not formally incorporated must provide a collaboration agreement, commonly referred to as the articles of collaboration, which sets out the rights and responsibilities of each consortium member. This agreement binds the individual consortium members together and should discuss, among other things, the consortium's
(1) Management structure;
(2) Method of making payments to consortium members;
(3) Means of ensuring and overseeing members' efforts on the project;
(4) Provisions for members' cost sharing contributions; and
(5) Provisions for ownership and rights in intellectual property developed previously or under the agreement.
(b) If the prospective recipient of a TIA is a consortium that is not formally incorporated, the contracting officer must, in consultation with legal counsel, review the management plan in the consortium's collaboration agreement to ensure that the management plan is sound and that it adequately addresses the elements necessary for an effective working relationship among the consortium members. An effective working relationship is essential to increase the project's chances of success.

# Total Funding
§ 603.520
Reasonableness of total project funding.
In cooperation with the program official, the contracting officer must assess the reasonableness of the total estimated budget to perform the RD
D that will be supported by the agreement.
(a)
Labor.
Much of the budget likely will involve direct labor and associated indirect costs, which may be represented together as a “loaded” labor rate. The program official is an essential advisor on reasonableness of the
overall level of effort and its composition by labor category. The contracting officer also may rely on experience with other awards as the basis for determining reasonableness.
(b)
Real property and equipment.
In almost all cases, the project costs should normally include only depreciation or use charges for real property and equipment of for-profit participants, in accordance with § 603.680. Remember that the budget for an expenditure-based TIA may not include depreciation of a participant's property as a direct cost of the project if that participant's practice is to charge the depreciation of that type of property as an indirect cost, as many organizations do.

# Cost Sharing
§ 603.525
Value and reasonableness of the recipient's cost sharing contribution.
The contracting officer must:
(a) Determine that the recipient's cost sharing contributions meet the criteria for cost sharing and determine values for them, in accordance with §§ 603.530 through 603.555. In doing so, the contracting officer must:
(1) Ensure that there are affirmative statements from any third parties identified as sources of cash contributions, and
(2) Include in the award file an evaluation that documents how the values of the recipient's contributions to the funding of the project were determined.
(b) Judge that the recipient's cost sharing contribution, as a percentage of the total budget, is reasonable. To the maximum extent practicable, the recipient must provide at least half of the costs of the project, in accordance with § 603.215.
§ 603.530
Acceptable cost sharing.
The contracting officer may accept any cash or in-kind contributions that meet all of the following criteria.
(a) In the contracting officer's judgment, they represent meaningful cost sharing that demonstrates the recipient's commitment to the success of the RD
D project. Cash contributions clearly demonstrate commitment and they are strongly preferred over in-kind contributions.
(b) They are necessary and reasonable for accomplishment of the RD
D project's objectives.
(c) They are costs that may be charged to the project under § 603.625 and § 603.635, as applicable to the participant making the contribution.
(d) They are verifiable from the recipient's records.
(e) They are not included as cost sharing contributions for any other Federal award.
(f) They are not paid by the Federal Government under another award, except:
(1) Costs that are authorized by Federal statute to be used for cost sharing.
(2) Independent research and development (IR
D) costs, as described in 48 CFR part 31.208-18, that meet all of the criteria in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section. IR
D is acceptable as cost sharing, even though it may be reimbursed by the Government through other awards. It is standard business practice for all for-profit firms, including commercial firms, to recover their IR
D costs through prices charged to their customers. Thus, the cost principles at 48 CFR part 31 allow a for-profit firm that has expenditure-based, Federal procurement contracts to recover through those procurement contracts the allocable portion of its research and development costs associated with a technology investment agreement. Contracting officers should note that in accordance with section 603.545, they may not count participant's costs of prior research, including IR
D, as a cost sharing contribution.
§ 603.535
Value of proposed real property or equipment.
The contracting officer rarely should accept values for cost sharing contributions of real property or equipment that are in excess of depreciation or reasonable use charges, as discussed in § 603.680 for for-profit participants. The contracting officer may accept the full value of a donated capital asset if the real property or equipment is to be dedicated to the project and the contracting officer expects that it will have a fair market value that is less than $5,000 at the project's end. In
those cases, the contracting officer should value the donation at the lesser of:
(a) The value of the property as shown in the recipient's accounting records (
i.e.
, purchase price less accumulated depreciation); and
(b) The current fair market value. The contracting officer may accept the use of any reasonable basis for determining the fair market value of the property. If there is a justification to do so, the contracting officer may accept the current fair market value even if it exceeds the value in the recipient's records.
§ 603.540
Acceptability of fully depreciated real property or equipment.
The contracting officer should limit the value of any contribution of a fully depreciated asset to a reasonable use charge. In determining what is reasonable, the contracting officer must consider:
(a) The original cost of the asset;
(b) Its estimated remaining useful life at the time of the negotiations;
(c) The effect of any increased maintenance charges or decreased performance due to age; and
(d) The amount of depreciation that the participant previously charged to Federal awards.
§ 603.545
Acceptability of costs of prior RD
D.
The contracting officer may not count any participant's costs of prior RD
D as a cost sharing contribution. Only the additional resources that the recipient will provide to carry out the current project (which may include pre-award costs for the current project, as described in § 603.830) are to be counted.
§ 603.550
Acceptability of intellectual property.
(a) In most instances, the contracting officer should not count costs of patents and other intellectual property (
e.g.
, copyrighted material, including software) as cost sharing because:
(1) It is difficult to assign values to these intangible contributions;
(2) Their value usually is a manifestation of prior research costs, which are not allowed as cost share under § 603.545; and
(3) Contributions of intellectual property rights generally do not represent the same cost of lost opportunity to a recipient as contributions of cash or tangible assets. The purpose of cost share is to ensure that the recipient incurs real risk that gives it a vested interest in the project's success.
(b) The contracting officer may include costs associated with intellectual property if the costs are based on sound estimates of market value of the contribution. For example, a for-profit firm may offer the use of commercially available software for which there is an established license fee for use of the product. The costs of the development of the software would not be a reasonable basis for valuing its use.
§ 603.555
Value of other contributions.
For types of participant contributions other than those addressed in §§ 603.535 through 603.550, the general rule is that the contracting officer is to value each contribution consistently with the cost principles or standards in § 603.625 and § 603.635 that apply to the participant making the contribution. When valuing services and property donated by parties other than the participants, the contracting officer may use as guidance the provisions of 10 CFR 600.313(b)(2) through (b)(5).

# Fixed-Support or Expenditure-Based Approach
§ 603.560
Estimate of project expenditures.
(a) To use a fixed-support TIA, rather than an expenditure-based TIA, the contracting officer must have confidence in the estimate of the expenditures required to achieve well-defined outcomes. Therefore, the contracting officer must work carefully with program officials to select outcomes that, when the recipient achieves them, are reliable indicators of the amount of effort the recipient expended. However, the estimate of the required expenditures need not be a precise dollar amount, as illustrated by the example in paragraph (b) of this section, if:
(1) The recipient is contributing a substantial share of the costs of
achieving the outcomes, which must meet the criteria in § 603.305(a); and
(2) The contracting officer is confident that the costs of achieving the outcomes will be at least a minimum amount that can be specified and the recipient is willing to accept the possibility that its cost sharing percentage ultimately will be higher if the costs exceed that minimum amount.
(b) To illustrate the approach, consider a project for which the contracting officer is confident that the recipient will have to expend at least $800,000 to achieve the specified outcomes. The contracting officer must determine, in conjunction with program officials, the minimum level of recipient cost sharing required to demonstrate the recipient's commitment to the success of the project. For purposes of this illustration, let that minimum recipient cost sharing be 60% of the total project costs. In that case, the Federal share should be no more than 40% and the contracting officer could set a fixed level of Federal support at $320,000 (40% of $800,000). With that fixed level of Federal support, the recipient would be responsible for the balance of the costs needed to complete the project.
(c) Note, however, that the level of recipient cost sharing negotiated should be based solely on the level needed to demonstrate the recipient's commitment. The contracting officer may not use a shortage of Federal Government funding for the program as a reason to try to persuade a recipient to accept a fixed-support TIA, rather than an expenditure-based instrument, or to accept responsibility for a greater share of the total project costs than it otherwise is willing to offer. If there is insufficient funding to provide an appropriate Federal Government share for the entire project, the contracting officer should re-scope the effort covered by the agreement to match the available funding.
§ 603.565
Use of a hybrid instrument.
For a RD
D project that is to be carried out by a number of participants, the contracting officer may award a TIA that provides for some participants to perform under fixed-support arrangements and others to perform under expenditure-based arrangements. This approach may be useful, for example, if a commercial firm that is a participant will not accept an agreement with all of the post-award requirements of an expenditure-based award. Before using a fixed-support arrangement for that firm's portion of the project, the agreement must meet the criteria in § 603.305.

# Accounting, Payments, and Recovery of Funds
§ 603.570
Determining milestone payment amounts.
(a) If the contracting officer selects the milestone payment method (see § 603.805), the contracting officer must assess the reasonableness of the estimated amount for reaching each milestone. This assessment enables the contracting officer to set the amount of each milestone payment to approximate the Federal share of the anticipated resource needs for carrying out that phase of the RD
D effort.
(b) The Federal share at each milestone need not be the same as the Federal share of the total project. For example, the contracting officer might deliberately set payment amounts with a larger Federal share for early milestones if a project involves a start-up company with limited resources.
(c) For an expenditure-based TIA, if the contracting officer establishes minimum cost sharing percentages for each milestone, those percentages should be indicated in the agreement.
(d) For a fixed-support TIA, the milestone payments should be associated with the well-defined, observable, and verifiable technical outcomes (
e.g.
, demonstrations, tests, or data analysis) that are established for the project in accordance with §§ 603.305(a) and 603.560(a).
§ 603.575
Repayment of Federal cost share.
In accordance with the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (Public Law 109-58), section 988(e), the contracting officer may not require repayment of the Federal share of a cost-shared TIA as a condition of making an award, unless otherwise authorized by statute.

# Subpart F—Award Terms Affecting Participants' Financial, Property, and Purchasing Systems
§ 603.600
Administrative matters.
This subpart addresses “systemic” administrative matters that place requirements on the operation of a participant's financial management, property management, or purchasing system. Each participant's systems are organization-wide and do not vary with each agreement. Therefore, a TIA should address systemic requirements in a uniform way for each type of participant organization.
§ 603.605
General policy.
The general policy for an expenditure-based TIA is to avoid requirements that would force participants to use different financial management, property management, and purchasing systems than they currently use for:
(a) Expenditure-based Federal procurement contracts and assistance awards in general, if they receive them; or
(b) Commercial business, if they have no expenditure-based Federal procurement contracts and assistance awards.
§ 603.610
Flow down requirements.
If it is an expenditure-based award, the TIA must require participants to provide the same financial management, property management, and purchasing systems requirements to a subrecipient that would apply if the subrecipient were a participant. For example, a for-profit participant would require a university subrecipient to comply with requirements that apply to a university participant and would require a GOCO or FFRDC subrecipient to comply with standards that conform as much as practicable with the requirements in the GOCO/FFRDC procurement contract. Note that this policy applies to subawards for substantive performance of portions of the RD
D project supported by the TIA and not to participants' purchases of goods or services needed to carry out the RD
D.

# Financial Matters
§ 603.615
Financial management standards for-profit firms.
(a) To avoid causing needless changes in participants' financial management systems, an expenditure-based TIA will make for-profit participants that currently perform under other expenditure-based Federal procurement contracts or assistance awards subject to the same standards for financial management systems that apply to those other awards. Therefore, if a for-profit participant has expenditure-based DOE assistance awards other than a TIA, the TIA must apply the standards in 10 CFR 600.311. The contracting officer may grant an exception and allow a for-profit participant that has other expenditure-based Federal Government awards to use an alternative set of standards that meets the minimum criteria in paragraph (b) of this section, if there is a compelling programmatic or business reason to do so. For each case in which an exception is granted, the contracting officer must document the reason in the award file.
(b) For an expenditure-based TIA, the contracting officer is to allow and encourage each for-profit participant that does not currently perform under expenditure-based Federal procurement contracts or assistance awards (other than a TIA) to use its existing financial management system as long as the system, as a minimum:
(1) Complies with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.
(2) Effectively controls all project funds, including Federal funds and any required cost share. The system must have complete, accurate, and current records that document the sources of funds and the purposes for which they are disbursed. It also must have procedures for ensuring that project funds are used only for purposes permitted by the agreement (see § 603.625).
(3) Includes, if advance payments are authorized under § 603.805, procedures to minimize the time elapsing between the payment of funds by the Government and the firm's disbursement of the funds for program purposes.
§ 603.620
Financial management standards for nonprofit participants.
So as not to force system changes for any State, local government, institution of higher education, or other nonprofit organization, expenditure-based TIA requirements for the financial management system of any nonprofit participant are to be the same as those that apply to the participant's other Federal assistance awards. Specifically, the requirements are those in:
(a) 10 CFR 600.220 for State and local governments; and
(b) 10 CFR 600.121(b) for other nonprofit organizations, with the exception of nonprofit Government-owned, contractor-operated (GOCO) facilities and Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) that are excepted from the definition of “recipient” in 10 CFR 600.101. If a GOCO or FFRDC is a participant, the contracting officer must specify appropriate standards that conform as much as practicable with requirements in their procurement contract.
§ 603.625
Cost principles or standards applicable to for-profit participants.
(a) So as not to require any firm to needlessly change its cost accounting system, an expenditure-based TIA is to apply the Government cost principles in 48 CFR part 31 to for-profit participants that currently perform under expenditure-based Federal procurement contracts or assistance awards (other than a TIA) and therefore have existing systems for identifying allowable costs under those principles. If there are programmatic or business reasons to do otherwise, the contracting officer may grant an exception from this requirement and use alternative standards as long as the alternative satisfies the conditions described in paragraph (b) of this section; if an exception is granted the reasons must be documented in the award file.
(b) For other for-profit participants, the contracting officer may establish alternative standards in the agreement as long as that alternative provides, as a minimum, that Federal funds and funds counted as recipients' cost sharing will be used only for costs that:
(1) A reasonable and prudent person would incur in carrying out the RD
D project contemplated by the agreement. Generally, elements of cost that appropriately are charged are those identified with RD
D activities under the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (see Statement of Financial Accounting Standards Number 2, “Accounting for Research and Development Costs,” October 1974). Moreover, costs must be allocated to DOE and other projects in accordance with the relative benefits the projects receive. Costs charged to DOE projects must be given consistent treatment with costs allocated to the participants' other RD
D activities (e.g., activities supported by the participants themselves or by non-Federal sponsors).
(2) Are consistent with the purposes stated in the governing Congressional authorizations and appropriations. The contracting officer is responsible for ensuring that provisions in the award document address any requirements that result from authorizations and appropriations.
§ 603.630
Use Federally approved indirect cost rates for for-profit firms.
In accordance with the general policy in § 603.605, the contracting officer must require a for-profit participant that has federally approved indirect cost rates for its Federal procurement contracts to use those rates to accumulate and report costs under an expenditure-based TIA. This includes both provisional and final rates that are approved up until the time that the TIA is closed out.
§ 603.635
Cost principles for nonprofit participants.
So as not to force financial system changes for any nonprofit participant, an expenditure-based TIA will provide that costs to be charged to the RD
D project by any nonprofit participant must be determined to be allowable in accordance with:
(a) OMB Circular A-87, if the participant is a State or local governmental organization;
(b) OMB Circular A-21, if the participant is an institution of higher education;
(c) 45 CFR Part 74, Appendix E, if the participant is a hospital; or
(d) OMB Circular A-122, if the participant is any other type of nonprofit organization (the cost principles in 48 CFR parts 31 and 231 are to be used by any nonprofit organization that is identified in Circular A-122 as being subject to those cost principles).
§ 603.640
Audits of for-profit participants.
If the TIA is an expenditure-based award, the contracting officer must include in it an audit provision that addresses, for each for-profit participant:
(a) Whether the for-profit participant must have periodic audits, in addition to any award-specific audits, as described in § 603.645;
(b) Whether the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) or an independent public accountant (IPA) will perform required audits, as discussed in § 603.650;
(c) How frequently any periodic audits are to be performed, addressed in § 603.655; and
(d) Other matters described in § 603.660, such as audit coverage, allowability of audit costs, auditing standards, and remedies for noncompliance.
§ 603.645
Periodic audits and award-specific audits of for-profit participants.
The contracting officer needs to consider requirements for both periodic audits and award-specific audits (as defined in § 603.1295 and § 603.1220, respectively). The way that an expenditure-based TIA addresses the two types of audits will vary, depending upon the type of for-profit participant.
(a) For for-profit participants that are audited by the DCAA or other Federal auditors, as described in §§ 603.650(b) and 603.655, specific requirements for periodic audits need not be added because the Federal audits should be sufficient to address whatever may be needed. The inclusion in the TIA of the standard access-to-records provision for those for-profit participants, as discussed in § 603.910(a), gives the necessary access in the event that the contracting officer later needs to request audits to address award-specific issues that arise.
(b) For each other for-profit participant, the contracting officer:
(1) Should require that the participant have an independent auditor (i.e., the DCAA or an independent public accountant (IPA)) conduct periodic audits of its systems if it expends $500,000 or more per year in TIAs and other Federal assistance awards. A prime reason for including this requirement is that the Federal Government, for an expenditure-based award, necessarily relies on amounts reported by the participant's systems when it sets payment amounts or adjusts performance outcomes. The periodic audit provides some assurance that the reported amounts are reliable.
(2) Must ensure that the award provides an independent auditor the access needed for award-specific audits, to be performed at the request of the contracting officer if issues arise that require audit support. However, consistent with the government-wide policies on single audits that apply to nonprofit participants (see § 603.665), the contracting officer should rely on periodic audits to the maximum extent possible to resolve any award-specific issues.
§ 603.650
Designation of auditor for for-profit participants.
The auditor identified in an expenditure-based TIA to perform periodic and award-specific audits of a for-profit participant depends on the circumstances, as follows:
(a) The Federal cognizant agency or an IPA will be the auditor for a for-profit participant that does not meet the criteria in paragraph (b) of this section. Note that the allocable portion of the costs of the IPA's audit may be reimbursable under the TIA, as described in § 603.660(b). The IPA should be the one that the participant uses to perform other audits (e.g., of its financial statement), to minimize added burdens and costs.
(b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the Federal cognizant agency (e.g., DCAA) must be identified as the auditor for a GOCO or FFRDC and for any for-profit participant that is subject to Federal audits because it is currently performing under a Federal award that is subject to the:
(1) Cost principles in 48 CFR part 31 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR); or
(2) Cost Accounting Standards in 48 CFR Chapter 99.
(c) If there are programmatic or business reasons that justify the use of an auditor other than the Federal cognizant agency for a for-profit participant that meets the criteria in paragraph (b) of this section, the contracting officer may provide that an IPA will be the auditor for that participant in which case the reasons for this decision must be documented in the award file.
§ 603.655
Frequency of periodic audits of for-profit participants.
If an expenditure-based TIA provides for periodic audits of a for-profit participant by an IPA, the contracting officer must specify the frequency for those audits. The contracting officer should consider having an audit performed during the first year of the award, when the participant has its IPA do its next financial statement audit, unless the participant already had a systems audit due to other Federal awards within the past two years. The frequency thereafter may vary depending upon the dollars the participant is expending annually under the award, but it is not unreasonable to require an updated audit every two to three years to verify that the participant's systems continue to be reliable (the audit then would cover the two or three-year period between audits).
§ 603.660
Other audit requirements.
If an expenditure-based TIA provides for audits of a for-profit participant by an IPA, the contracting officer also must specify:
(a) What periodic audits are to cover. It is important to specify audit coverage that is only as broad as needed to provide reasonable assurance of the participant's compliance with award terms that have a direct and material effect on the RD
D project.
(b) Who will pay for periodic and award-specific audits. The allocable portion of the costs of any audits by IPAs may be reimbursable under the TIA. The costs may be direct charges or allocated indirect costs, consistent with the participant's accounting system and practices.
(c) The auditing standards that the IPA will use. The contracting officer must provide that the IPA will perform the audits in accordance with the Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards.
(d) The available remedies for noncompliance. The agreement must provide that the participant may not charge costs to the award for any audit that the contracting officer determines was not performed in accordance with the Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards or other terms of the agreement. It also must provide that the Government has the right to require the participant to have the IPA take corrective action and, if corrective action is not taken, that the agreements officer has recourse to any of the remedies for noncompliance identified in 10 CFR 600.352(a).
(e) Where the IPA is to send audit reports. The agreement must provide that the IPA is to submit audit reports to the contracting officer. It also must require that the IPA report instances of fraud directly to the Office of Inspector General (OIG), DOE.
(f) The retention period for the IPA's working papers. The contracting officer must specify that the IPA is to retain working papers for a period of at least three years after the final payment, unless the working papers relate to an audit whose findings are not fully resolved within that period or to an unresolved claim or dispute (in which case, the IPA must keep the working papers until the matter is resolved and final action taken).
(g) Who will have access to the IPA's working papers. The agreement must provide for Government access to working papers.
§ 603.665
Periodic audits of nonprofit participants.
An expenditure-based TIA is an assistance instrument subject to the Single Audit Act (31 U.S.C. 7501-7507), so nonprofit participants are subject to the requirements under that Act and OMB Circular A-133. Specifically, the requirements are those in:
(a) 10 CFR 600.226 for State and local governments; and
(b) 10 CFR 600.126 for other nonprofit organizations.
§ 603.670
Flow down audit requirements to subrecipients.
(a) In accordance with § 603.610, an expenditure-based TIA must require participants to flow down the same audit requirements to a subrecipient that would apply if the subrecipient were a participant.
(b) For example, a for-profit participant that is audited by the DCAA:
(1) Would flow down to a university subrecipient the Single Audit Act requirements that apply to a university participant;
(2) Could enter into a subaward allowing a for-profit participant, under the circumstances described in § 603.650(a), to use an IPA to do its audits.
(c) This policy applies to subawards for substantive performance of portions of the RD
D project supported by the TIA, and not to participants' purchases of goods or services needed to carry out the RD
D.
§ 603.675
Reporting use of IPA for subawards.
An expenditure-based TIA should require participants to report to the contracting officer when they enter into any subaward allowing a for-profit subawardee to use an IPA, as described in § 603.670(b)(2).

# Property
§ 603.680
Purchase of real property and equipment by for-profit firms.
(a) With the two exceptions described in paragraph (b) of this section, the contracting officer must require a for-profit firm to purchase real property or equipment with its own funds that are separate from the RD
D project. The contracting officer should allow the firm to charge to an expenditure-based TIA only depreciation or use charges for real property or equipment (and the cost estimate for a fixed-support TIA only would include those costs). Note that the firm must charge depreciation consistently with its usual accounting practice. Many firms treat depreciation as an indirect cost. Any firm that usually charges depreciation indirectly for a particular type of property must not charge depreciation for that property as a direct cost to the TIA.
(b) In two situations, the contracting officer may grant an exception and allow a for-profit firm to use project funds, which includes both the Federal Government and recipient shares, to purchase real property or equipment (i.e., to charge to the project the full acquisition cost of the property). The two circumstances, which should be infrequent for equipment and extremely rare for real property, are those in which either:
(1) The real property or equipment will be dedicated to the project and has a current fair market value that is less than $5,000 by the time the project ends; or
(2) The contracting officer gives prior approval for the firm to include the full acquisition cost of the real property or equipment as part of the cost of the project (see § 603.535).
(c) If the contracting officer grants an exception in either of the circumstances described in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section, the real property or equipment must be subject to the property management standards in 10 CFR 600.321(b) through (e). As provided in those standards, the title to the real property or equipment will vest conditionally in the for-profit firm upon acquisition. A TIA, whether it is a fixed-support or expenditure-based award, must specify that any item of equipment that has a fair market value of $5,000 or more at the conclusion of the project also will be subject to the disposition process in 10 CFR 600.321(f), whereby the Federal Government will recover its interest in the property at that time.
§ 603.685
Management of real property and equipment by nonprofit participants.
For nonprofit participants, a TIA's requirements for vesting of title, use, management, and disposition of real property or equipment acquired under the award are the same as those that apply to the participant's other Federal assistance awards. Specifically, the requirements are those in:
(a) 10 CFR 600.231 and 600.232, for participants that are States and local governmental organizations; and
(b) 10 CFR 600.132 and 600.134, for other nonprofit participants, with the exception of nonprofit GOCOs and FFRDCs that are exempted from the definition of “recipient” in 10 CFR 600.101. If a GOCO or FFRDC is a participant, the contracting officer must specify appropriate standards that conform as much as practicable with the requirements in its procurement contract. Note also that:
(1) If the TIA is a cooperative agreement, 31 U.S.C. 6306 provides authority to vest title to tangible personal property in a nonprofit institution of higher education or in a nonprofit organization whose primary purpose is conducting scientific research, without further obligation to the Federal Government; and
(2) A TIA therefore must specify any conditions on the vesting of title to real property or equipment acquired by any such nonprofit participant.
§ 603.690
Requirements for Federally-owned property.
If DOE provides Federally-owned property to any participant for the performance of RD
D under a TIA, the contracting officer must require that participant to account for, use, and dispose of the property in accordance with:
(a) 10 CFR 600.322, if the participant is a for-profit firm.
(b) 10 CFR 600.232(f), if the participant is a State or local governmental organization. Note that 10 CFR 600.232(f) contains additional requirements for managing the property.
(c) 10 CFR 600.133(a) and 600.134(f), if the participant is a nonprofit organization other than a GOCO or FFRDC (requirements for GOCOs and FFRDCs should conform with the property standards in their procurement contracts).
§ 603.695
Requirements for supplies.
An expenditure-based TIA's provisions should permit participants to use their existing procedures to account for and manage supplies. A fixed-support TIA should not include requirements to account for or manage supplies.

# Purchasing
§ 603.700
Standards for purchasing systems of for-profit firms.
(a) If the TIA is an expenditure-based award, it should require for-profit participants that currently perform under DOE assistance instruments subject to the purchasing standards in 10 CFR 600.331 to use the same requirements for the TIA, unless there are programmatic or business reasons to do otherwise (in which case the reasons must be documented in the award file).
(b) Other for-profit participants under an expenditure-based TIA should be allowed to use their existing purchasing systems, as long as they flow down the applicable requirements in Federal statutes, Executive Orders or Government-wide regulations (see Appendices A and B to this part for a list of those requirements).
§ 603.705
Standards for purchasing systems of nonprofit organizations.
So as not to force system changes for any nonprofit participant, an expenditure-based TIA should provide that each nonprofit participant's purchasing system comply with:
(a) 10 CFR 600.236, if the participant is a State or local governmental organization.
(b) 10 CFR 600.140 through 10 CFR 600.149, if the participant is a nonprofit organization other than a GOCO or FFRDC that is excepted from the definition of “recipient” in 10 CFR 600.101. If a GOCO or FFRDC is a participant, the TIA must specify appropriate standards that conform as much as practicable with requirements in its procurement contract.

# Subpart G—Award Terms Related to Other Administrative Matters
§ 603.800
Scope.
This subpart addresses administrative matters that do not impose organization-wide requirements on a participant's financial management, property management, or purchasing system. Because an organization does not
have to redesign its systems to accommodate award-to-award variations in these requirements, TIAs may differ in the requirements that they specify for a given participant, based on the circumstances of the particular RD
D project. To eliminate needless administrative complexity, the contracting officer should handle some requirements, such as the payment method, in a uniform way for the agreement as a whole.

# Payments
§ 603.805
Payment methods.
A TIA may provide for:
(a)
Reimbursement,
as described in 10 CFR 600.312(a)(1), if it is an expenditure-based award.
(b)
Advance payments,
as described in 10 CFR 600.312(a)(2), subject to the conditions in 10 CFR 600.312(b)(2)(i) through (iii).
(c)
Payments based on payable milestones.
These are payments made according to a schedule that is based on predetermined measures of technical progress or other payable milestones. This approach relies upon the fact that, as the RD
D progresses throughout the term of the agreement, observable activity will be taking place. The recipient is paid upon the accomplishment of a predetermined measure of progress. A fixed-support TIA must use this payment method (this does not preclude use of an initial advance payment, if there is no alternative to meeting immediate cash needs). Payments based on payable milestones is the preferred method of payment for an expenditure-based TIA if well-defined outcomes can be identified.
§ 603.810
Method and frequency of payment requests.
The procedure and frequency for payment requests depend upon the payment method, as follows:
(a) For either reimbursements or advance payments, the TIA must allow recipients to submit requests for payment at least monthly. The contracting officer may authorize the recipients to use the forms or formats described in 10 CFR 600.312(d).
(b) If the payments are based on payable milestones, the recipient will submit a report or other evidence of accomplishment to the program official at the completion of each predetermined activity. If the award is an expenditure-based TIA that includes minimum cost sharing percentages for milestones (see 10 CFR 603.570(c)), the recipient must certify in the report that the minimum cost sharing requirement has been met. The contracting officer may approve payment to the recipient after receiving validation from the program manager that the milestone was successfully reached.
§ 603.815
Withholding payments.
A TIA must provide that the contracting officer may withhold payments in the circumstances described in 10 CFR 600.312(g), but not otherwise.
§ 603.820
Interest on advance payments.
If an expenditure-based TIA provides for either advance payments or payable milestones, the agreement must require the recipient to:
(a) Maintain in an interest-bearing account any advance payments or milestone payment amounts received in advance of needs to disburse the funds for program purposes unless:
(1) The recipient receives less than $120,000 in Federal grants, cooperative agreements, and TIAs per year;
(2) The best reasonably available interest-bearing account would not be expected to earn interest in excess of $1,000 per year on the advance or milestone payments; or
(3) The depository would require an average or minimum balance so high that it would not be feasible within the expected Federal and non-Federal cash resources for the project.
(b) Remit annually the interest earned to the contracting officer.

# Revision of Budget and Program Plans
§ 603.825
Government approval of changes in plans.
If it is an expenditure-based award, a TIA must require the recipient to obtain the contracting officer's prior approval if there is to be a change in
plans that may result in a need for additional Federal funding (this is unnecessary for a fixed-support TIA because the recipient is responsible for additional costs of achieving the outcomes). Other than that, the program official's substantial involvement in the project should ensure that the Government has advance notice of changes in plans.
§ 603.830
Pre-award costs.
Pre-award costs, as long as they are otherwise allowable costs of the project, may be charged to an expenditure-based TIA only with the specific approval of the contracting officer. All pre-award costs are incurred at the recipient's risk (e.g., DOE is not obligated to reimburse the costs if, for any reason, the recipient does not receive an award, or if the award is less than anticipated and inadequate to cover the costs).

# Program Income
§ 603.835
Program income requirements.
A TIA must apply the standards of 10 CFR 600.314 for program income that may be generated. The TIA must also specify if the recipient is to have any obligation to the Federal Government with respect to program income generated after the end of the project period (i.e., the period, as established in the award document, during which Federal support is provided).

# Intellectual Property
§ 603.840
Negotiating data and patent rights.
(a) The contracting officer must confer with program officials and assigned intellectual property counsel to develop an overall strategy for intellectual property that takes into account inventions and data that may result from the project and future needs the Government may have for rights in them. The strategy should take into account program mission requirements and any special circumstances that would support modification of standard patent and data terms, and should include considerations such as the extent of the recipient's contribution to the development of the technology; expected Government or commercial use of the technology; the need to provide equitable treatment among consortium or team members; and the need for the DOE to engage non-traditional Government contractors with unique capabilities.
(b) Because a TIA entails substantial cost sharing by recipients, the contracting officer must use discretion in negotiating Government rights to data and patentable inventions resulting from the RD
D under the agreements. The considerations in §§ 603.845 through 603.875 are intended to serve as guidelines, within which there is considerable latitude to negotiate provisions appropriate to a wide variety of circumstances that may arise.
§ 603.845
Data rights requirements.
(a) If the TIA is a cooperative agreement, the requirements at 10 CFR 600.325(d), Rights in data-general rule, apply. The “Rights in Data—General” provision in Appendix A to Subpart D of 10 CFR 600 normally applies. This provision provides the Government with unlimited rights in data first produced in the performance of the agreement, except as provided in paragraph (c) Copyright. However, in certain circumstances, the “Rights in Data—Programs Covered Under Special Protected Data Statutes” provision in Appendix A may apply.
(b) If the TIA is an assistance transaction other than a cooperative agreement, the requirements at 10 CFR 600.325(e), Rights in data—programs covered under special protected data statutes, normally apply. The “Rights in Data—Programs Covered Under Special Data Statutes” provision in Appendix A to Subpart D of 10 CFR 600 may be modified to accommodate particular circumstances (e.g., access to or expanded use rights in protected data among consortium or team members), or to list data or categories of data that the recipient must make available to the public. In unique cases, the contracting officer may negotiate special data rights requirements that vary from those in 10 CFR 600.325. Modifications to the standard data provisions must be approved by intellectual property counsel.
§ 603.850
Marking of data.
To protect the recipient's interests in data, the TIA should require the recipient to mark any particular data that it wishes to protect from disclosure as specified in 10 CFR 600.15(b).
[76 FR 26582, May 9, 2011]
§ 603.855
Protected data.
In accordance with law and regulation, the contracting officer must not release or disclose data marked with a restrictive legend (as specified in 603.850) to third parties, unless they are parties authorized by the award agreement or the terms of the legend to receive the data and are subject to a written obligation to treat the data in accordance with the marking.
§ 603.860
Rights to inventions.
(a) The contracting officer should negotiate rights in inventions that represent an appropriate balance between the Government's interests and the recipient's interests.
(1) The contracting officer has the flexibility to negotiate patent rights requirements that vary from that which the Bayh-Dole statute (Chapter 18 of Title 35, U.S.C.) and 42 U.S.C. 2182 and 5908 require. A TIA becomes an assistance transaction other than a cooperative agreement if its patent rights requirements vary from those required by these statutes.
(2) If the TIA is a cooperative agreement, the patent rights provision of 10 CFR 600.325(b) or (c) or 10 CFR 600.136 applies, depending on the type of recipient. Unless a class waiver has been issued under 10 CFR 784.7, it will be necessary for a large, for-profit business to request a patent waiver to obtain title to subject inventions.
(b) The contracting officer may negotiate Government rights that vary from the statutorily-required patent rights requirements described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section when necessary to accomplish program objectives and foster the Government's interests. Doing so would make the TIA an assistance transaction other than a cooperative agreement. The contracting officer must decide, with the help of the program manager and assigned intellectual property counsel, what best represents a reasonable arrangement considering the circumstances, including past investments and anticipated future investments of the recipient to the development of the technology, contributions under the current TIA, and potential commercial and Government markets. Any change to the standard patent rights provisions must be approved by assigned intellectual property counsel.
(c) Taking past investments as an example, the contracting officer should consider whether the Government or the recipient has contributed more substantially to the prior RD
D that provides the foundation for the planned effort. If the predominant past contributor to the particular technology has been:
(1) The Government, then the TIA's patent rights provision should be the standard provision as set forth in 10 CFR 600.325(b) or (c), or 10 CFR 600.136, as applicable.
(2) The recipient, then less restrictive patent requirements may be appropriate, which would make the TIA an assistance transaction other than a cooperative agreement. The contracting officer normally would, with the concurrence of intellectual property counsel, allow the recipient to retain title to subject inventions without going through the process of obtaining a patent waiver as required by 10 CFR 784. For example, with the concurrence of intellectual property counsel, the contracting officer also could eliminate or modify the nonexclusive paid-up license for practice by or on behalf of the Government to allow the recipient to benefit more directly from its investments.
(d) For subawards under a TIA that is other than a cooperative agreement, the TIA should normally specify that subrecipients' invention rights are to be negotiated between recipient and subrecipient; that subrecipients will get title to inventions they make; or some other disposition of invention rights. Factors to be considered by the contracting officer in addressing subrecipient's invention rights include: the extent of cost sharing by parties at all tiers; a subrecipient's status as a small business, nonprofit, or FFRDC; and whether an appropriate field of use
licensing requirement would meet the needs of the parties.
(e) Consortium members may allocate invention rights in their collaboration agreement, subject to the review of the contracting officer (See § 603.515). The contracting officer, in performing such review, should consider invention rights to be retained by the Government and rights that may be obtained by small business, nonprofit or FFRDC consortium members.
§ 603.865
March-in rights.
A TIA's patent rights provision should include the Bayh-Dole march-in rights set out in paragraph (j) of the Patent Rights (Small Business Firms and Nonprofit Organization) provision in Appendix A to subpart D of 10 CFR 600, or an equivalent clause, concerning actions that the Government may take to obtain the right to use subject inventions, if the recipient fails to take effective steps to achieve practical application of the subject inventions within a reasonable time. The march-in provision may be modified to best meet the needs of the program. However, only infrequently should the march-in provision be entirely removed (
e.g.
, if a recipient is providing most of the funding for a RD
D project, with the Government providing a much smaller share).
§ 603.870
Marking of documents related to inventions.
To protect the recipient's interest in inventions, the TIA should require the recipient to mark documents disclosing inventions it desires to protect by obtaining a patent. The recipient should mark the documents with a legend identifying them as intellectual property subject to public release or public disclosure restrictions, as provided in 35 U.S.C. 205.
§ 603.875
Foreign access to technology and U.S. competitiveness provisions.
(a) Consistent with the objective of enhancing national security and United States competitiveness by increasing the public's reliance on the United States commercial technology, the contracting officer must include provisions in a TIA that addresses foreign access to technology developed under the TIA.
(b) A provision must provide, as a minimum, that any transfer of the technology must be consistent with the U.S. export laws, regulations and the Department of Commerce Export Regulation at Chapter VII, Subchapter C, Title 15 of the CFR (15 CFR parts 730-774), as applicable.
(c) A provision should also provide that any products embodying, or produced through the use of, any created intellectual property, will be manufactured substantially in the United States, and that any transfer of the right to use or sell the products must, unless the Government grants a waiver, require that the products will be manufactured substantially in the United States. In individual cases, the contracting officer, with the approval of the program official and intellectual property counsel, may waive or modify the requirement of substantial manufacture in the United States at the time of award, or subsequent thereto, upon a showing by the recipient that:
(1) Alternative benefits are being secured for the United States taxpayer (
e.g.
, increased domestic jobs notwithstanding foreign manufacture);
(2) Reasonable but unsuccessful efforts have been made to transfer the technology under similar terms to those likely to manufacture substantially in the United States; or
(3) Under the circumstances domestic manufacture is not commercially feasible.

# Financial and Programmatic Reporting
§ 603.880
Reports requirements.
A TIA must include requirements that, as a minimum, provide for periodic reports addressing program performance and, if it is an expenditure-based award, business/financial status. The contracting officer must require submission of the reports at least annually, and may require submission as frequently as quarterly (this does not preclude a recipient from electing to submit more frequently than quarterly the financial information that is required to process payment requests if the award is an expenditure-based TIA
that uses reimbursement or advance payments under § 603.810(a)). The requirements for the content of the reports are as follows:
(a) The program portions of the reports must address progress toward achieving performance goals and milestones, including current issues, problems, or developments.
(b) The business/financial portions of the reports, applicable only to expenditure-based awards, must provide summarized details on the status of resources (federal funds and non-federal cost sharing), including an accounting of expenditures for the period covered by the report. The report should compare the resource status with any payment and expenditure schedules or plans provided in the original award; explain any major deviations from those schedules; and discuss actions that will be taken to address the deviations. The contracting officer may require a recipient to separately identify in these reports the expenditures for each participant in a consortium and for each programmatic milestone or task, if the contracting officer, after consulting with the program official, judges that those additional details are needed for good stewardship.
§ 603.885
Updated program plans and budgets.
In addition to reports on progress to date, a TIA may include a provision requiring the recipient to annually prepare an updated technical plan for future conduct of the research effort and a revised budget if there is a significant change from the initial budget.
§ 603.890
Final performance report.
A TIA must require a final performance report that addresses all major accomplishments under the TIA.
§ 603.895
Protection of information in programmatic reports.
If a TIA is awarded under the authority of 42 U.S.C. 7256(g) (
i.e.
, it is a type of assistance transaction “other than” a contract, grant or a cooperative agreement), the contracting officer may inform a participant that the award is covered by a special protected data statute, which provides for the protection from public disclosure, for a period of up to 5 years after the date on which the information is developed, any information developed pursuant to this transaction that would be trade secret, or commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential, if the information had been obtained from a non-Federal party.
§ 603.900
Receipt of final performance report.
The TIA should make receipt of the final report a condition for final payment. If the payments are based on payable milestones, the submission and acceptance of the final report by the Government representative will be incorporated as an event that is a prerequisite for one of the payable milestones.

# Records Retention and Access Requirements
§ 603.905
Record retention requirements.
A TIA must require participants to keep records related to the TIA (for which the agreement provides Government access under § 603.910) for a period of three years after submission of the final financial status report for an expenditure-based TIA or final program performance report for a fixed-support TIA, with the following exceptions:
(a) The participant must keep records longer than three years after submission of the final financial status report if the records relate to an audit, claim, or dispute that begins but does not reach its conclusion within the 3-year period. In that case, the participant must keep the records until the matter is resolved and final action taken.
(b) Records for any real property or equipment acquired with project funds under the TIA must be kept for three years after final disposition.
§ 603.910
Access to a for-profit participant's records.
(a) If a for-profit participant currently grants access to its records to the DCAA or other Federal Government auditors, the TIA must include for that participant the standard access-to-records requirements at 10 CFR 600.342(e). If the agreement is a fixed-
support TIA, the language in 10 CFR 600.342(e) may be modified to provide access to records concerning the recipient's technical performance, without requiring access to the recipient's financial or other records. Note that any need to address access to technical records in this way is in addition to, not in lieu of, the need to address rights in data (see § 603.845).
(b) For other for-profit participants that do not currently give the Federal Government direct access to their records and are not willing to grant full access to records pertinent to the award, the contracting officer may negotiate limited access to the recipient's financial records. For example, if the audit provision of an expenditure-based TIA gives an IPA access to the recipient's financial records for audit purposes, the Federal Government must have access to the IPA's reports and working papers and the contracting officer need not include a provision requiring direct Government access to the recipient's financial records. For both fixed-support and expenditure-based TIAs, the TIA must include the access-to-records requirements at 10 CFR 600.342(e) for records relating to technical performance.
§ 603.915
Access to a nonprofit participant's records.
A TIA must include for any nonprofit participant the standard access-to-records requirement at:
(a) 10 CFR 600.242(e), for a participant that is a State or local governmental organization;
(b) 10 CFR 600.153(e), for a participant that is a nonprofit organization. The same requirement applies to any GOCO or FFRDC, even though nonprofit GOCOs and FFRDCs are exempted from the definition of “recipient” in 10 CFR 600.101.

# Termination and Enforcement
§ 603.920
Termination and enforcement requirements.
(a)
Termination.
A TIA must include the following conditions for termination:
(1) An award may be terminated in whole or in part by the contracting officer, if a recipient materially fails to comply with the terms and conditions of the award.
(2) Subject to a reasonable determination by either party that the project will not produce beneficial results commensurate with the expenditure of resources, that party may terminate in whole or in part the agreement by providing at least 30 days advance written notice to the other party, provided such notice is preceded by consultation between the parties. The two parties will negotiate the termination conditions, including the effective date and, in the case of partial termination, the portion to be terminated. If either party determines in the case of partial termination that the reduced or modified portion of the award will not accomplish the purpose for which the award was made, the award may be terminated in its entirety.
(3) Unless otherwise negotiated, for terminations of an expenditure based TIA, DOE's maximum liability is the lesser of:
(i) DOE's share of allowable costs incurred up to the date of termination, or
(ii) The amount of DOE funds obligated to the TIA.
(4) Unless otherwise negotiated, for terminations of a fixed-support based TIA, DOE shall pay the recipient a proportionate share of DOE's financial commitment to the project based on the percent of project completion as of the date of termination.
(5) Notwithstanding paragraphs (3) and (4) of this section, if the award includes milestone payments, the Government has no obligation to pay the recipient beyond the last completed and paid milestone if the recipient decides to terminate.
(b) Enforcement. The standards of 10 CFR 600.352 (for enforcement) and the procedures in 10 CFR 600.22 (for disputes and appeals) apply.

# Subpart H—Executing the Award
§ 603.1000
Contracting officer's responsibilities at time of award.
At the time of the award, the contracting officer must:
(a) Ensure that the award document contains the appropriate terms and
conditions and is signed by the appropriate parties, in accordance with §§ 603.1005 through 603.1015.
(b) Document the analysis of the agreement in the award file, as discussed in § 603.1020.
(c) Provide information about the award to the office responsible for reporting on TIAs.

# The Award Document
§ 603.1005
General responsibilities.
The contracting officer is responsible for ensuring that the award document is complete and accurate. The document should:
(a) Address all issues;
(b) State requirements directly. It is not helpful to readers to incorporate statutes or rules by reference, without sufficient explanation of the requirements. The contracting officer generally should not incorporate clauses from the Federal Acquisition Regulation (48 CFR parts 1-53) or Department of Energy Acquisition Regulation (48 CFR parts 901-970) because those provisions are designed for procurement contracts that are used to acquire goods and services, rather than for a TIA or other assistance instruments.
(c) Be written in clear and concise language, to minimize potential ambiguity.
§ 603.1010
Substantive issues.
Each TIA is designed and negotiated individually to meet the specific requirements of the particular project, so the list of substantive issues that will be addressed in the award document may vary. Every award document must address:
(a)
Project scope.
The scope is an overall vision statement for the project, including a discussion of the project's purpose, objectives, and detailed commercial goals. It is a critical provision because it provides a context for resolving issues that may arise during post-award administration. In a fixed-support TIA, the well-defined outcomes that reliably indicate the amount of effort expended and serve as the basis for the level of the fixed support must be clearly specified (see §§ 603.305 and 603.560(a)).
(b)
Project management.
The TIA should describe the nature of the relationship between the Federal Government and the recipient; the relationship among the participants, if the recipient is an unincorporated consortium; and the overall technical and administrative management of the project. A TIA is used to carry out collaborative relationships between the Federal Government and the recipient. Consequently, there must be substantial involvement of the DOE program official (see § 603.220) and usually the contracting officer. The program official provides technical insight, which differs from the usual technical oversight of a project. The management provision also should discuss how modifications to the TIA are made.
(c)
Termination, enforcement, and disputes.
A TIA must provide for termination, enforcement remedies, and disputes and appeals procedures, in accordance with § 603.920.
(d)
Funding.
The TIA must:
(1) Show the total amount of the agreement and the total period of performance.
(2) If the TIA is an expenditure-based award, state the Government's and recipient's agreed-upon cost shares for the project period and for each budget period. The award document should identify values for any in-kind contributions, determined in accordance with §§ 603.530 through 603.555, to preclude later disagreements about them.
(3) Specify the amount of Federal funds obligated and the performance period for those obligated funds.
(4) State, if the agreement is to be incrementally funded, that the Government's obligation for additional funding is contingent upon the availability of funds and that no legal obligation on the part of the Government exists until additional funds are made available and the agreement is amended. The TIA also must include a prior approval requirement for changes in plans requiring additional Government funding, in accordance with § 603.825.
(e)
Payment.
The TIA must identify the payment method and tell the recipient how, when, and where to submit payment requests, as discussed in §§ 603.805 through 603.815. The payment method must take into account sound
cash management practices by avoiding unwarranted cash advances. For an expenditure-based TIA, the payment provision must require the return of interest should excess cash balances occur, in accordance with § 603.820. For any TIA using the milestone payment method described in § 603.805(c), the TIA must include language notifying the recipient that the contracting officer may adjust amounts of future milestone payments if a project's expenditures fall too far below the projections that were the basis for setting the amounts (see § 603.575(c) and § 603.1105(c)).
(f)
Records retention and access to records.
The TIA must include the records retention requirement at § 603.910. The TIA also must provide for access to for-profit and nonprofit participants' records, in accordance with § 603.915 and § 603.920.
(g)
Patents and data rights.
In designing the patents and data rights provision, the TIA must set forth the minimum required Federal Government rights in intellectual property generated under the award and address related matters, as provided in §§ 603.840 through 603.875. It is important to define all essential terms in the patent rights provision.
(h)
Foreign access to technology and U.S. competitiveness.
The TIA must include provisions, in accordance with § 603.875, concerning foreign access and domestic manufacture of products using technology generated under the award.
(i)
Title to, management of, and disposition of tangible property.
The property provisions for for-profit and nonprofit participants must be in accordance with §§ 603.685 through 603.700.
(j)
Financial management systems.
For an expenditure-based award, the TIA must specify the minimum standards for financial management systems of both for-profit and nonprofit participants, in accordance with §§ 603.615 and 603.620.
(k)
Allowable costs.
If the TIA is an expenditure-based award, it must specify the standards that both for-profit and nonprofit participants are to use to determine which costs may be charged to the project, in accordance with §§ 603.625 through 603.635, as well as § 603.830.
(l)
Audits.
If a TIA is an expenditure-based award, it must include an audit provision for both for-profit and nonprofit participants and subrecipients, in accordance with §§ 603.640 through 603.670 and § 603.675.
(m)
Purchasing system standards.
The TIA should include a provision specifying the standards in §§ 603.700 and 603.705 for purchasing systems of for-profit and nonprofit participants, respectively.
(n)
Program income.
The TIA should specify requirements for program income, in accordance with § 603.835.
(o)
Financial and programmatic reporting.
The TIA must specify the reports that the recipient is required to submit and tell the recipient when and where to submit them, in accordance with §§ 603.880 through 603.900.
(p)
Assurances for applicable national policy requirements.
The TIA must incorporate assurances of compliance with applicable requirements in Federal statutes, Executive Orders, or regulations (except for national policies that require certifications). Appendix A to this part contains a list of commonly applicable requirements that should be augmented with any specific requirements that apply to a particular TIA (e.g., general provisions in the appropriations act for the specific funds that are being obligating).
(q)
Other matters.
The agreement should address any other issues that need clarification, including the name of the contracting officer who will be responsible for post-award administration and the statutory authority or authorities for entering into the TIA. In addition, the agreement must specify that it takes precedence over any inconsistent terms and conditions in collateral documents such as attachments to the TIA or the recipient's articles of collaboration.
§ 603.1015
Execution.
(a) If the recipient is a consortium that is not formally incorporated and the consortium members prefer to have the agreement signed by all of them individually, the agreement may be executed in that manner.
(b) If they wish to designate one consortium member to sign the agreement on behalf of the consortium as a whole, the determination whether to execute the agreement in that way should not be made until the contracting officer reviews the consortium's articles of collaboration with legal counsel.
(1) The purposes of the review are to:
(i) Determine whether the articles properly authorize one participant to sign on behalf of the other participants and are binding on all consortium members with respect to the RD
D project; and
(ii) Assess the risk that otherwise could exist when entering into an agreement signed by a single member on behalf of a consortium that is not a legal entity. For example, the contracting officer should assess whether the articles of collaboration adequately address consortium members' future liabilities related to the RD
D project (e.g., whether they will have joint and severable liability).
(2) After the review, in consultation with legal counsel, the contracting officer should determine whether it is better to have all of the consortium members sign the agreement individually or to allow them to designate one member to sign on all members' behalf.

# Reporting Information About the Award
§ 603.1020
File documents.
The award file should include an analysis which:
(a) Briefly describes the program and details the specific commercial benefits that should result from the project supported by the TIA. If the recipient is a consortium that is not formally incorporated, a copy of the signed articles of collaboration should be attached.
(b) Describes the process that led to the award of the TIA, including how DOE solicited and evaluated proposals and selected the one supported through the TIA.
(c) Explains the basis for the decision that a TIA was the most appropriate instrument, in accordance with the factors in Subpart B of this part. The explanation must include the answers to the relevant questions in § 603.225(a) through (d).
(d) Explains how the recipient's cost sharing contributions was valued in accordance with §§ 603.530 through 603.555. For a fixed-support TIA, the file must document the analysis required (see § 603.560) to set the fixed level of Federal support; the documentation must explain how the recipient's minimum cost share was determined and how the expenditures required to achieve the project outcomes were estimated.
(e) Documents the results of the negotiation, addressing all significant issues in the TIA's provisions.

# Subpart I—Post-Award Administration
§ 603.1100
Contracting officer's post-award responsibilities.
Generally, the contracting officer's post-award responsibilities are the same responsibilities as those for any cooperative agreement. Responsibilities for a TIA include:
(a) Participating as the business partner to the DOE program official to ensure the Government's substantial involvement in the RD
D project. This may involve attendance with program officials at kickoff meetings or post-award conferences with recipients. It also may involve attendance at the consortium management's periodic meetings to review technical progress, financial status, and future program plans.
(b) Tracking and processing of reports required by the award terms and conditions, including periodic business status reports, programmatic progress reports, and patent reports.
(c) Handling payment requests and related matters. For a TIA using advance payments, that includes reviews of progress to verify that there is continued justification for advancing funds, as discussed in § 603.1105(b). For a TIA using milestone payments, it includes making any needed adjustments in future milestone payment amounts, as discussed in § 603.1105(c).
(d) Making continuation awards for subsequent budget periods, if the agreement includes separate budget periods. See 10 CFR 600.26(b). Any continuation award is contingent on availability of
funds, satisfactory progress towards meeting the performance goals and milestones, submittal of required reports, and compliance with the terms and conditions of the award.
(e) Coordinating audit requests and reviewing audit reports for both single audits of participants' systems and any award-specific audits that may be needed, as discussed in §§ 603.1115 and 603.1120.
(f) Responding, after coordination with program officials and intellectual property counsel, to recipient requests for permission to assign or license intellectual property to entities that do not agree to manufacture substantially in the United States, as described in § 603.875(b). Before granting approval for any technology, the contracting officer must secure assurance that any such assignment is consistent with license rights for Government use of the technology, and that other conditions for any such transfer are met.
§ 603.1105
Advance payments or payable milestones.
The contracting officer must:
(a) For any expenditure-based TIA with advance payments or payable milestones, forward to the responsible payment office any interest that the recipient remits in accordance with § 603.820(b). The payment office will return the amounts to the Department of the Treasury's miscellaneous receipts account.
(b) For any expenditure-based TIA with advance payments, consult with the program official and consider whether program progress reported in periodic reports, in relation to reported expenditures, is sufficient to justify the continued authorization of advance payments under § 603.805(b).
(c) For any expenditure-based TIA using milestone payments, work with the program official at the completion of each payable milestone or upon receipt of the next business status report to:
(1) Compare the total amount of project expenditures, as recorded in the payable milestone report or business status report, with the projected budget for completing the milestone; and
(2) Adjust future payable milestones, as needed, if expenditures lag substantially behind what was originally projected and the contracting officer judges that the recipient is receiving Federal funds sooner than necessary for program purposes. Before making adjustments, the contracting officer should consider how large a deviation is acceptable at the time of the milestone. For example, suppose that the first milestone payment for a TIA is $50,000, and that the awarding official set the amount based on a projection that the recipient would have to expend $100,000 to reach the milestone (
i.e.
, the original plan was for the recipient's share at that milestone to be 50% of project expenditures). If the milestone payment report shows $90,000 in expenditures, the recipient's share at this point is 44% ($40,000 out of the total $90,000 expended, with the balance provided by the $50,000 milestone payment of Federal funds). For this example, the contracting officer should adjust future milestones if a 6% difference in the recipient's share at the first milestone is judged to be too large, but not otherwise. Remember that milestone payment amounts are not meant to track expenditures precisely at each milestone and that a recipient's share will increase as it continues to perform RD
D and expend funds, until it completes another milestone to trigger the next Federal payment.
§ 603.1110
Other payment responsibilities.
Regardless of the payment method, the contracting officer should ensure that:
(a) The request complies with the award terms;
(b) Available funds are adequate to pay the request;
(c) The recipient will not have excess cash on hand, based on expenditure patterns; and
(d) Payments are not withheld, except in one of the circumstances described in 10 CFR 600.312(g).
§ 603.1115
Single audits.
For audits of for-profit participant's systems, under §§ 603.640 through 603.660, the contracting officer is the
focal point for ensuring that participants submit audit reports and for resolving any findings in those reports. The contracting officer's responsibilities regarding single audits of nonprofit participant's systems are identified in the DOE “Guide to Financial Assistance.”
§ 603.1120
Award-specific audits.
Guidance on when and how the contracting officer should request additional audits for an expenditure-based TIA is identical to the guidance in 10 CFR 600.316(d). If the contracting officer requires an award-specific examination or audit of a for-profit participant's records related to a TIA, the contracting officer must use the auditor specified in the award terms and conditions, which should be the same auditor who performs periodic audits of the participant.

# Subpart J—Definitions of Terms Used in this Part
§ 603.1200
Definitions.
The terms defined in 10 CFR 600.3 apply to all DOE financial assistance, including a TIA. In addition to those terms, the following terms are used in this part.
§ 603.1205

§ 603.1210
Articles of collaboration.
An agreement among the participants in a consortium that is not formally incorporated as a legal entity, by which they establish their relative rights and responsibilities (see § 603.515).
§ 603.1215
Assistance.
The transfer of a thing of value to a recipient to carry out a public purpose of support or stimulation authorized by a law of the United States (see 31 U.S.C. 6101(3)). Grants, cooperative agreements, and technology investment agreements are examples of legal instruments used to provide assistance.
§ 603.1220
Award-specific audit.
An audit of a single TIA, usually done at the cognizant contracting officer's request, to help resolve issues that arise during or after the performance of the RD
D project. An award-specific audit of an individual award differs from a periodic audit of a participant (as defined in § 603.1295).
§ 603.1225
Cash contributions.
A recipient's cash expenditures made as contributions toward cost sharing, including expenditures of money that third parties contributed to the recipient.

D-performing organizations that either is formally incorporated or that otherwise agrees to jointly carry out a RD
D project (see definition of “articles of collaboration,” in § 603.1210).
§ 603.1240
Cooperative agreement.
A legal instrument which, consistent with 31 U.S.C. 6305, is used to enter into the same kind of relationship as a grant (see definition of “grant,” in § 603.1270), except that substantial involvement is expected between the DOE and the recipient when carrying out the activity contemplated by the cooperative agreement. The term does not include “cooperative research and development agreements” as defined in 15 U.S.C. 3710a.
§ 603.1245
Cost sharing.
A portion of project costs from non-Federal sources that are borne by the recipient or non-Federal third parties on behalf of the recipient, rather than by the Federal Government.
§ 603.1250
Data.
Recorded information, regardless of form or the media on which it may be recorded. The term includes technical data and computer software. It does not include information incidental to administration, such as financial, administrative, cost or pricing, or other management information related to the administration of a TIA.

Equipment.
Tangible property, other than real property, that has a useful life of more than one year and an acquisition cost of $5,000 or more per unit.
§ 603.1260
Expenditure-based award.
A Federal Government assistance award for which the amounts of interim payments or the total amount ultimately paid (
i.e.
, the sum of interim payments and final payment) are subject to redetermination or adjustment, based on the amounts expended by the recipient in carrying out the purposes for which the award was made, as long as the redetermination or adjustment does not exceed the total Government funds obligated to the award. Most Federal Government grants and cooperative agreements are expenditure-based awards.
§ 603.1265
Expenditures or outlays.
Charges made to the project or program. They may be reported either on a cash or accrual basis, as shown in the following table:
If reports are prepared on a . . .

(a) Cash basis
(1) Cash disbursements for direct charges for goods and services;
(2) The amount of indirect expense charge;
(3) The value of third party in-kind contributions applied; and
(4) The amount of cash advances and payments made to any other organizations for the performance of a part of the RD
D effort.
(b) Accrual basis
(1) Cash disbursements for direct charges for goods and services;
(2) The amount of indirect expense incurred;
(3) The value of in-kind contributions applied; and
(4) The net increase (or decrease) in the amounts owed by the recipient for goods and other property received, for services performed by employees, contractors, and other payees and other amounts becoming owed under programs for which no current services or performance are required.
§ 603.1270
Grant.
A legal instrument which, consistent with 31 U.S.C. 6304, is used to enter into a relationship:
(a) The principal purpose of which is to transfer a thing of value to the recipient to carry out a public purpose of support or stimulation authorized by a law of the United States, rather than to acquire property or services for the Department of Energy's direct benefit or use.

(b) Is subject to the provisions of OMB Circular A-110, “Administrative Requirements for Grants and Agreements with Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals, and Other Non-Profit Organizations,” as implemented by the Department of Energy at 10 CFR 600, Subpart B.
§ 603.1285
Intellectual property.
Patents, trademarks, copyrights, mask works, protected data, and other forms of comparable property protected by Federal law and foreign counterparts.
§ 603.1290
Participant.
A consortium member or, in the case of an agreement with a single for-profit entity, the recipient. Note that a for-profit participant may be a firm or a segment of a firm (
e.g.
, a division or other business unit).
§ 603.1295
Periodic audit.
An audit of a participant, performed at an agreed-upon time (usually a regular time interval), to determine whether the participant as a whole is managing its Federal awards in compliance with the terms of those awards. Appendix A to this part describes what such an audit may cover. A periodic audit of a participant differs from an award-specific audit of an individual award (as defined in § 603.1220).
§ 603.1300
Procurement contract.
A Federal Government procurement contract. It is a legal instrument which, consistent with 31 U.S.C. 6303, reflects a relationship between the Federal Government and a State, a local government, or other non-government entity when the principal purpose of the instrument is to acquire property or services for the direct benefit or use of the Federal Government. See the more detailed definition of the term “contract” at 48 CFR 2.101.
§ 603.1305
Program income.
Gross income earned by the recipient or a participant that is generated by a supported activity or earned as a direct result of a TIA. Program income includes but is not limited to: income from fees for performing services; the use or rental of real property, equipment, or supplies acquired under a TIA; the sale of commodities or items fabricated under a TIA; and license fees and royalties on patents and copyrights. Interest earned on advances of Federal funds is not program income.
§ 603.1310
Program official.
A Federal Government program manager, project officer, scientific officer, or other individual who is responsible for managing the technical program being carried out through the use of a TIA.
§ 603.1315

e.g.
, a division or other business unit).
§ 603.1330
Supplies.
Tangible property other than real property and equipment. Supplies have a useful life of less than one year or an acquisition cost of less than $5,000 per unit.
§ 603.1335
Termination.
The cancellation of a TIA, in whole or in part, at any time prior to either:
(a) The date on which all work under the TIA is completed; or
(b) The date on which Federal sponsorship ends, as given in the award document or any supplement or amendment thereto.
§ 603.1340
Technology investment agreement.
A TIA is a special type of assistance instrument used to increase involvement of commercial firms in the DOE research, development and demonstration (RD
D) programs. A TIA, like a cooperative agreement, requires substantial Federal involvement in the technical or management aspects of the project. A TIA may be either a type of cooperative agreement or a type of assistance transaction other than a cooperative agreement, depending on the intellectual property provisions. A TIA is either:
(a) A type of cooperative agreement with more flexible provisions tailored for involving commercial firms (as distinct from a cooperative agreement subject to all of the requirements in 10 CFR Part 600), but with intellectual property provisions in full compliance
with the DOE intellectual property statutes (
i.e.
, Bayh-Dole statute and 42 U.S.C. §§ 2182 and 5908, as implemented in 10 CFR 600.325); or
(b) An assistance transaction other than a cooperative agreement, if its intellectual property provisions vary from the Bayh-Dole statute and 42 U.S.C. §§ 2182 and 5908, which require the Government to retain certain intellectual property rights, and require differing treatment between large businesses and nonprofit organizations or small businesses.
Pt. 603, App. A

# Appendix A to Part 603—Applicable Federal Statutes, Executive Orders, and Government-wide Regulations
Whether the TIA is a cooperative agreement or a type of assistance transaction other than a cooperative agreement, the terms and conditions of the agreement must provide for recipients' compliance with applicable Federal statutes, Executive Orders and Government-wide regulations. This appendix lists some of the more common requirements to aid in identifying ones that apply to a specific TIA. The list is not intended to be all-inclusive, however; the contracting officer may need to consult legal counsel to verify whether there are others that apply (
e.g.
, due to a provision in the appropriations act for the specific funds in use or due to a statute or rule that applies to a particular program or type of activity).

# A. Certifications
All financial assistance applicants, including applicants requesting a TIA must comply with the prohibitions concerning lobbying in a Government-wide common rule that the DOE has codified at 10 CFR part 601. The “List of Certifications and Assurances for SF 424(R
R)” on the DOE Applicant and Recipient page at
http://grants.pr.doe.gov
includes the Government-wide certification that must be provided with a proposal for a financial assistance award, including a TIA.

# B. Assurances That Apply to a TIA
Currently the DOE approach to communicating Federal statutes, Executive Orders and Government-wide regulations is to provide potential applicants a list of “National Policies Assurances to be Incorporated as Award Terms” in the program announcement (This list is available on the Applicant and Recipient Page at
http://grants.pr.doe.gov
under Award Terms). The contracting officer should follow this approach for announcements that allow for the award of a TIA. The contracting officer should normally incorporate by reference or attach the list of national policy assurances to a TIA award. Of these requirements, the following four assurances apply to all TIA:
1. Prohibitions on discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin in Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d,
et seq.
) as implemented by DOE regulations at 10 CFR part 1040. These apply to all financial assistance. They require recipients to flow down the prohibitions to any subrecipients performing a part of the substantive RD
D program (as opposed to suppliers from whom recipients purchase goods or services).
2. Prohibitions on discrimination on the basis of age, in the Age Discrimination Act of 1975 (42 U.S.C. 6101,
et seq.
) as implemented by DOE regulations at 10 CFR part 1040. They apply to all financial assistance and require flow down to subrecipients.
3. Prohibitions on discrimination on the basis of handicap, in section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794) as implemented by DOE regulations at 10 CFR part 1041. They apply to all financial assistance and require flow down to subrecipients.
4. Preferences for use of U.S.-flag air carriers in the International Air Transportation Fair Competitive Practices Act of 1974 (49 U.S.C. 40118), which apply to uses of U.S. Government funds.

# C. Other Assurances
Additional assurance requirements may apply in certain circumstances, as follows:
1. If construction work is to be done under a TIA or its subawards, it is subject to the prohibitions in Executive Order 11246 on discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.
2. If the RD
D involves human subjects or animals, it is subject to the requirements codified by the Department of Health and Human Services at 45 CFR part 46 and implemented by DOE at 10 CFR part 745 and rules on animal acquisition, transport, care, handling and use in 9 CFR parts 1 through 4, Department of Agriculture rules and rules of the Department of Interior at 50 CFR parts 10 through 24 and Commerce at 50 CFR parts 217 through 277, respectively. See item a. or b., respectively, under the heading “Live organisms” included on the DOE “National Policy Assurances To Be Incorporated As Award Terms” on the Applicant and Recipient Page.
3. If the RD
D involves actions that may affect the environment, it is subject to the National Environmental Policy Act, and may also be subject to national policy requirements for flood-prone areas, coastal zones, coastal barriers, wild and scenic rivers, and underground sources of drinking water.
4. If the project may impact a historic property, it is subject to the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (16 U.S.C. 470,
et seq.
).

# Appendix B to Part 603—Flow Down Requirements for Purchases of Goods and Services
A. As discussed in § 603.705, the contracting officer must inform recipients of any requirements that flow down to their purchases of goods or services (e.g., supplies or equipment) under their TIA. Note that purchases of goods or services differ from subawards, which are for substantive RD
D program performance.
B. Appendix A to 10 CFR part 600, subpart D lists eight requirements that commonly apply to firms' purchases under grants or cooperative agreements. Of those eight, two that apply to all recipients' purchases under a TIA are:
1.
Byrd Anti-Lobbying Amendment (31 U.S.C. 1352).
A contractor submitting a bid to the recipient for a contract award of $100,000 or more must file a certification with the recipient that it has not and will not use Federal appropriations for certain lobbying purposes. The contractor also must disclose any lobbying with non-Federal funds that takes place in connection with obtaining any Federal award. For further details, see 10 CFR part 601, the DOE's codification of the Government-wide common rule implementing this amendment.
2.
Debarment and suspension.
Recipients may not make contract awards that exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (currently $100,000) and certain other contract awards may not be made to parties listed on the General Services Administration (GSA) “List of Parties Excluded from Federal Procurement and Nonprocurement Programs.” The GSA list contains the names of parties debarred, suspended, or otherwise excluded by agencies, and parties declared ineligible under statutory or regulatory authority other than Executive Orders 12549 (3 CFR, 1986 Comp., p. 189) and 12689 (3 CFR, 1989 Comp., p. 235). For further details, see subparts A through E of 10 CFR part 606, which is the DOE's codification of the Government-wide common rule implementing Executive Orders 12549 and 12689.
C. One other requirement applies only in cases where construction work is to be performed under the TIA with Federal funds or recipient funds counted toward required cost sharing:
1.
Equal Employment Opportunity.
If the TIA includes construction work, the contracting officer should inform the recipient that Department of Labor regulations at 41 CFR 60-1.4(b) prescribe a clause that must be incorporated into construction awards and subawards. Further details are provided in Appendix B to 10 CFR 600 subpart D, item 1.

§ 605.15
Fee.
(a) Notwithstanding 2 CFR part 200 as amended by 2 CFR part 910, a fee may be paid, in appropriate circumstances, to a recipient which is a small business concern as qualified under the criteria and size standards of 13 CFR part 121 in order to permit the concern to participate in the ER Financial Assistance Program. Whether or not it is appropriate to pay a fee shall be determined by the Contracting Officer who shall, at a minimum, apply the following guidelines:
(1) Whether the acceptance of an award will displace other work the small business is currently engaged in or committed to assume in the near future; or
(2) Whether the acceptance of an award will, in the absence of paying a fee, cause substantial financial distress to the business. In evaluating financial distress, the Contracting Officer shall balance current displacement against reasonable future benefit to the company. (If the award will result in the beneficial expansion of the existing business base of the company, then no fee would generally be appropriate.) Fees shall not be paid to other entities except as a exceptionfrom 2 CFR part 200 as amended by 2 CFR part 910, nor shall fees be paid under awards in support of conferences.
(b) To request a fee, a small business concern shall submit with its application a written self certification that it is a small business concern qualified under the criteria and size standards in 13 CFR part 121. In addition, the application must state the amount of fee requested for the entire project period and the basis for requesting the amount, and must also state why payment of a fee by DOE would be appropriate.
(c) If the Contracting Officer determines that payment of a fee is appropriate under paragraph (a) of this section, the amount of fee shall be that determined to be reasonable by the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer shall, at a minimum, apply the following guidelines in determining the fee amount:
(1) The fee base shall include the estimated allowable cost of direct salaries and wages and allocable fringe benefits. This fee base shall exclude all other direct and indirect costs.
(2) The fee amount expressed as a percentage of the appropriate fee base pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section, shall not exceed the percentage rate of fee that would result if a Federal agency contracted for the same amount of salaries, wages, and allocable fringe benefits under a cost reimbursement contract.
(3) Fee amounts, determined pursuant to paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section, shall be appropriately reduced when:
(i) Advance payments are provided; and/or
(ii) Title to property acquired with DOE funds vests in the recipient (10 CFR part 600).
(d) Notwithstanding 2 CFR part 200 as amended by 2 CFR part 910, any fee awarded shall be a fixed fee and shall be payable on an annual basis in proportion to the work completed, as determined by the Contracting Officer, upon satisfactory submission and acceptance by DOE of the progress report. If the project period is shortened
due to termination, or the project period is not fully funded, the fee shall be reduced by an appropriate amount.
[57 FR 40583, Sept. 3, 1992, as amended at 79 FR 76047, Dec. 19, 2014]
§ 605.16
Indirect cost limitations.
Awards issued under this part for conferences and scientific/technical meetings will not include payment for indirect costs.
§ 605.17
[Reserved]
§ 605.18
National security.
Activities under SC's Financial Assistance Program shall not involve classified information (i.e., Restricted Data, formerly Restricted Data, National Security Information). However, if in the opinion of the recipient or DOE such involvement becomes expected prior to the closeout of the award, the recipient or DOE shall notify the other in writing immediately. If the recipient believes any information developed or acquired may be classifiable, the recipient shall not provide the potentially classifiable information to anyone, including the DOE officials with whom the recipient normally communicates, except the Director of Classification, and shall protect such information as if it were classified until notified by DOE that a determination has been made that it does not require such handling. Correspondence which includes the specific information in question shall be sent by registered mail to U.S. Department of Energy, Attn: Director of Classification, DP-32, Washington, DC 20585. If the information is determined to be classified, the recipient may wish to discontinue the project in which case the recipient and DOE shall terminate the award by mutual agreement. If the award is to be terminated, all material deemed by DOE to be classified shall be forwarded to DOE, in a manner specified by DOE, for proper disposition. If the recipient and DOE wish to continue the award, even though classified information is involved, the recipient shall be required to obtain both personnel and facility security clearances through the Office of Safeguards and Security for Headquarters awards, or from the cognizant field office Division of Safeguards and Security for awards obtained through DOE field organizations. Costs associated with handling and protecting any such classified information shall be negotiated at the time that the determination to proceed is made.
[57 FR 40583, Sept. 3, 1992, as amended at 79 FR 76047, Dec. 19, 2014]
§ 605.19
Continuation funding and reporting requirements.
(a) A recipient shall periodically report to DOE on the project's progress in meeting the project objectives of the award. The following types of reports shall be used:
(1)
Progress reports.
After issuance of an initial award and if future support is recommended, recipients must submit a satisfactory progress report in order to receive continuation awards for the remainder of the project period. The original and two copies of the required report (generally not to exceed two pages per project or task) must be submitted to the SC program manager 90 days prior to the anticipated continuation funding date and contain the following information: on the first page, provide the project title, principal investigator/project director name, period of time report covers, name and address of recipient organization, DOE award number, the amount of unexpended funds, if any, that are anticipated to be left at the end of the current budget period, and if the amount exceeds 10 percent of the funds available for the budget period, provide information as to why the excess funds are anticipated to be available and how they will be used in the next budget period. Report should state whether aims have changed from original application and if they have, provided revised aims. Include results of work to date. Emphasize findings and their significance to the field, and any real or anticipated problems. A completed budget page must be submitted with the continuation progress report when a change to anticipated future costs will exceed 25 percent of the original recommended future budget.
(2)
Notice of Energy R
D Project.
A Notice of Energy R
D Project, DOE Form 1430.22, which summarizes the purpose and scope of the project, must
be submitted in accordance with the Distribution and Schedule of Documents set forth at the end of this section. Copies of the form may be obtained from a DOE Contracting Office.

# Appendix A to Part 605—The Energy Research Program Office Descriptions

# 1. Basic Energy Sciences
This program supports basic science research efforts in a variety of disciplines to broaden the energy supply and technological base knowledge. The major science division and its objectives are as follows:

# (a) Energy Biosciences
The primary objective of this program is to generate a basis of understanding of fundamental biological mechanisms in the areas of botanical and microbiological sciences that will support biotechnology development related to energy. The research serves as the basic information foundation with respect to renewable resource productivity for fuels and chemicals, microbial conversions or renewable materials and biological systems for the conservation of energy. This office has special requirements on the submission of preapplications, when to submit, and the length of the preapplication/application; applicants are encouraged to contact the office regarding these requirements.

# (b) Chemical Sciences
This program sponsors experimental and theoretical research on liquids, gases, plasmas, and solids. The focus is on their chemical properties and the interactions of their component molecules, atoms, ions, and electrons. The subprogram objective is to expand, through support of basic research, our knowledge in the various areas of chemistry; the long-term goal is to contribute to new or improved processes for developing and using domestic energy resources in an efficient and environmentally sound manner. Disciplinary areas covered include physical, organic, and inorganic chemistry; chemical physics; atomic physics; photochemistry; radiation chemistry; thermodynamics; thermophysics; separations science; analytical chemistry; and actinide chemistry.

# (c) Geosciences
The goal of this program is to develop a quantitative and predictive understanding of the energy-related aspects of processes within the earth and at the solar-terrestrial interface. The emphasis is on the upper levels of the earth's crust and the focus is on geophysics and geochemistry of rock-fluid systems and interactions. Specific topical areas receiving emphasis include: High resolution geophysical imaging; fundamental properties of rocks, minerals, and fluids; scientific drilling; and sedimentary basin systems. The resulting improved understanding and knowledge base are needed to assist efforts in the utilization of the Nation's energy resources in an environmentally acceptable fashion.

# (d) Engineering Research
This program's objectives are: (1) To extend the body of knowledge underlying current engineering practice in order to open new ways for enhancing energy savings and production, prolonging useful equipment life, and reducing costs while maintaining output and performance quality; and (2) to broaden the technical and conceptual base for solving future engineering problems in the energy technologies. Long-term research topics of current interest include: foundations of bioprocessing of fuels and energy related wastes, fracture mechanics, experimental and theoretical studies of multiphase flows, intelligent machines, and diagnostics and control for plasma processing of materials.

§ 609.4
Submission of applications.
(a) DOE may direct that Applications be submitted in more than one part; provided, that the parts of such Application, taken as a whole, contain such information published by DOE in guidance on the Title XVII Loan Guarantee Program website pursuant to § 609.19. In such event, subsequent parts of an Application may be filed only after DOE invites an Applicant to make an additional submission. If DOE directs that Applications be submitted in more than one part, the initial part of an Application shall contain information sufficient for DOE to determine that the project proposed by an Applicant will be, or may reasonably become, an Eligible Project, and to evaluate such project's readiness to proceed. If there have been any material amendments, modifications, or additions made to the information previously submitted by an Applicant, the Applicant shall provide a detailed description thereof, including any changes in the proposed project's financing structure or other terms, promptly upon request by DOE.
(b) An Applicant may submit Applications for multiple proposed projects and for projects using different technologies; provided that an Applicant
for an Innovative Energy Project or Innovative Supply Chain Project may not submit an Application or Applications for multiple Innovative Energy Projects or multiple Innovative Supply Chain Projects using the same technology. For purposes of this paragraph (b), the term “Applicant” shall include the Project Sponsor and any subsidiaries or affiliates of the Project Sponsor.
(c) DOE has no obligation to evaluate an Application that is not complete, and may proceed with such evaluation, or a partial evaluation, only in its discretion. DOE will not design an Eligible Project for Applicants, but may respond, in its discretion, in general terms to specific proposals. DOE's response to questions from potential Applicants are pre-decisional and preliminary in nature.
(d) Unless an Applicant requests an extension and such an extension is granted by DOE in its discretion, an Application may be rejected if it is not complete within two years from the date of submission (or date of submission of the first part thereof, in the case of Applications made in more than one part).
(e) DOE shall respond, in writing, to any inquiry by an Applicant about the status of its Application within ten (10) days of receipt of such request. If an Application has been pending before DOE for 180 days or more, such response shall include:
(1) A description of the current status of review of the Application;
(2) A summary of any factors that are delaying a final decision on the Application, a list of what items are required in order to reach a final decision, citations to authorities stating the reasons why such items are required, and a list of actions the Applicant can take to expedite the process; and
(3) An estimate of when a final decision on the Application will be made.
§ 609.5
Evaluation of applications.
(a) Applications will be considered in a merit-based review process, considering such factors determined and published by DOE in guidance on its Title XVII Loan Guarantee Program website pursuant to § 609.19. At any time, DOE may request additional information or supporting documentation from an Applicant.
(b) Applications will be denied if:
(1) The proposed project is not an Eligible Project;
(2) With respect to applications for Innovative Energy Projects and Innovative Supply Chain Projects, the applicable technology is not ready to be deployed commercially in the United States, cannot yield a commercially viable product or service in the use proposed in the Application, does not have the potential to be deployed in other commercial projects in the United States, or is not or will not be available for further commercial use in the United States;
(3) The Person proposed to issue the loan or purchase other debt obligations constituting the Guaranteed Obligations is not an Eligible Lender;
(4) The proposed project is for demonstration, research, or development;
(5) Significant Equity for the proposed project will not be provided by the date of issuance of the Guaranteed Obligations, or such later time as DOE in its discretion may determine;
(6) The proposed project does not present a Reasonable Prospect of Repayment of the Guaranteed Obligations;
(7) With respect to applications for Energy Infrastructure Reinvestment Projects such application fails to include an analysis of how the proposed project will engage with and affect associated communities or, where the Applicant is an electric utility, an assurance that Applicant will pass on the financial benefit from the Guarantee to the customers of, or associated communities served by, the electric utility; or
(8) The Applicant or Project Sponsor does not satisfy DOE's “know your customer” requirements.
(c) If an Application has not been denied pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, DOE will evaluate the proposed project based on the criteria published by DOE in guidance on its Title XVII Loan Guarantee Program website pursuant to § 609.19.
(d) After DOE completes its review and evaluation of a proposed project, DOE will notify the Applicant in writing of its determination whether to
proceed with due diligence and negotiation of a Term Sheet. DOE will proceed only if it determines that the proposed project is highly qualified and suitable for a Guarantee. Upon written confirmation from the Applicant that it desires to proceed, DOE and the Applicant will commence negotiations.
(e) DOE shall provide all Applicants with a reasonable opportunity to correct or amend any Application in order to meet the criteria set forth in this part or any other conditions required by DOE, prior to any denial of such Application. A determination by DOE not to proceed with a proposed project shall be final and non-appealable, but shall not prejudice the Applicant or other affected Persons from applying for a Guarantee in respect of a different proposed project pursuant to another, separate Application. Prior to DOE's denial of any Application, DOE shall advise the Applicant in writing, not less than ten (10) business days prior to the effective date of such denial. If an Application could be amended or corrected such that DOE would determine that the project is highly qualified and suitable for a Guarantee, DOE may set forth the reasons for such proposed denial along with a list of items that may be corrected or amended by the Applicant. If requested by any Applicant, DOE shall meet with such Applicant in order to address questions or concerns raised by the Applicant.
§ 609.6
