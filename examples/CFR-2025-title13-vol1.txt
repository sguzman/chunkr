# Explanation
The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
Title 1 through Title 16
as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27
as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41
as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50
as of October 1
The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.

# LEGAL STATUS
The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

# HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, January 1, 2025), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

# EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.

# OMB CONTROL NUMBERS
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request.
Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.

# PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.

# “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.

# INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
What is incorporation by reference?
Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
What is a proper incorporation by reference?
The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
(b) The matter incorporated is adequately summarized in the preamble of the final rule and is available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?
If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or email fr.inspection@nara.gov.

# CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES
A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR
Index and Finding Aids.
This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.
An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

# REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

§ 101.100
What is the purpose of SBA?
The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) aids, counsels, assists, and protects the interests of small business concerns, and advocates on their behalf within the Government. It also helps victims of disasters. It provides financial assistance, contractual assistance, and business development assistance. For a more detailed description of the functions of SBA see The United States Government Manual, a special publication of the
Federal Register,
which is available from Superintendent of Documents, P.O. Box 371954, Pittsburgh, PA 15250-7954.
§ 101.101

§ 101.104
What are the functions of SBA's field offices?
(a)
Regional offices.
Regional offices are managed by a Regional Administrator who is responsible to the Administrator and to the Associate Administrator for Field Operations. They are located in major cities and have geographical boundaries which cover multi-state areas. Regional offices exercise limited authority over field activities within their region.

The Office of Disaster Assistance maintains five permanent field offices which are named according to the particular functions they perform in the disaster loan making process. The office names are: Disaster Assistance Customer Service Center, Disaster Assistance Processing and Disbursement Center, Disaster Assistance Field Operations Center East, Disaster Assistance Field Operations Center West, and the Disaster Assistance Personnel and Administrative Services Center. Each office is managed by a Center Director who reports to the Deputy Associate Administrator for Disaster Assistance.

Temporary disaster offices may be established in areas where disasters have occurred.
(e)
Responsibilities.
Each field office has responsibilities within a defined geographical area as periodically set forth in the
Federal Register.

Authorized Use.
The official seal and reproductions of the seal may only be used as follows:

Reproduction of Official Seal.
Requests for permission to reproduce the SBA seal in circumstances other than those listed in paragraph (c) of this section must be made in writing to the Administrator. The decision whether to grant permission will be made in writing on a case-by-case basis, in consultation with the General Counsel, with consideration of any relevant factors which may include the benefit or cost to the Agency of granting the request; the unintended appearance of endorsement or authentication by SBA; the potential for misuse; the reputability of the use; the extent of control by SBA over the use; and the extent of control by SBA over distribution of any products or publications bearing the SBA seal.

(4) Contracts or agreements to which SBA is a party, unless expressly provided otherwise.
(c) To the extent feasible, SBA uses local or state procedures, especially for recordation and notification purposes, in implementing and facilitating SBA's loan programs. This use of local or state procedures is not a waiver by SBA of any Federal immunity from any local or state control, penalty, tax, or liability.
(d) No person, corporation, or organization that applies for and receives any benefit or assistance from SBA, or that offers any assurance or security upon which SBA relies for the granting of such benefit or assistance, is entitled to claim or assert any local or state law to defeat the obligation incurred in obtaining or assuring such Federal benefit or assistance.

(a) SBA uses forms approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501
et seq.
), as amended. You may obtain approved forms for use by the public when applying for or obtaining SBA assistance, or
when providing services for SBA, from any field office (see § 101.103). You may also use forms which you have prepared yourself, or have obtained from another source, if those forms are identical in every respect to the forms approved by OMB for the same purpose.
(b) Any member of the public who has reason to believe any SBA office or agent is in violation of the Public Protection Clause of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3512 and see 5 CFR 1320.6) should notify SBA.

(2) The return Postal Service receipt for a document that was registered or certified and mailed, the signed receipt for a document delivered by an overnight or express delivery service, or the Return of Service completed by the individual serving the subpoena by personal delivery shall be proof of service.

§ 101.400
What is the purpose of this subpart?
(a) This subpart implements section 401 of the Intergovernmental Cooperation Act (31 U.S.C. 6506
et seq.
) which promotes intergovernmental partnership and strengthens Federalism by relying on state processes and state, area-wide, regional, and local coordination for the review of proposed Federal financial assistance and direct Federal development.

§ 102.1
General provisions.
(a) This subpart contains the rules that SBA follows in processing requests for records under the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”), 5 U.S.C. 552. The rules in this subpart should be read in conjunction with the text of the FOIA and the Uniform Freedom of Information Fee Schedule and Guidelines published by the Office of Management and Budget (“OMB Guidelines”). Requests made by individuals for records about themselves under the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, are processed under subpart B of this part as well as under this subpart.
(b) As referenced in this subpart, “component” means each separate bureau, office, division, district office, regional office, area office, service center, loan processing center or central office duty location within the SBA that is responsible for processing FOIA requests. See appendix A to this subpart for a list of information generally exempt from disclosure. For contact information for each office visit
https://www.sba.gov/foia
and for a detailed description of the function of each office to help ascertain the types of records maintained by each component, please visit
https://www.sba.gov/about-sba.
The rules described in this regulation that apply to SBA also apply to its components.
(c) The SBA has a decentralized system for processing requests, with each component handling requests for its records.
(d) The term record means:
(1) Any information that would be an agency record subject to the requirements of this section when maintained by SBA in any format, including written or electronic format; and
(2) Any information described under paragraph (d)(1) of this section that is maintained for SBA by an entity under Government contract, for purposes of records management.
§ 102.2
Proactive disclosure of records.
Records that are required by the FOIA to be made available for public inspection in an electronic format may be accessed through the SBA's Web site at
https://www.sba.gov/foia.
Each component of SBA is responsible for determining which of its records are required to be made publicly available, as well as for identifying additional records of interest to the public that are appropriate for public disclosure, and for posting and indexing such records. Each component shall ensure that its Web site of posted records and indices is reviewed and updated on an ongoing basis. Each component has a FOIA Public Liaison who can assist individuals in locating records particular to a component. A list of the SBA's FOIA Public Liaisons is available at
https://www.sba.gov/foia.
§ 102.3
Requirements pertaining to the submission of requests.
(a)
General information.
(1) The SBA has a decentralized system for responding to FOIA requests, with each component handling requests for its records. All components have the capability to receive requests electronically either through email or a web portal. To make a request for records, a requester should write directly to the Freedom of Information/Privacy Acts (FOI/PA) Office by mail to 409 3rd St SW., Washington, DC 20416 or submit a fax to 202-205-7059 or email to
foia@sba.gov.
Requesters may also submit their request through the FOIA online portal at
https://foiaonline.regulations.gov/foia/action/public/home.
Additional information for submitting a request to SBA is listed at
https://www.sba.gov/foia.
However, a request will receive the quickest possible response if it is addressed to the component that maintains the records sought.
(2) A requester who is making a request for records about himself or herself must comply with the verification of identity provision set forth in subpart B of this part. The Certification of Identity form, available at
http://www.justice.gov/oip/forms/cert_ind.pdf,
may be used by individuals who are making requests for records pertaining to themselves.
(3) Where a request for records pertains to another individual, a requester may receive greater access by submitting either a notarized authorization signed by that individual or a declaration made in compliance with the requirements set forth in 28 U.S.C. 1746 by that individual authorizing disclosure of the records to the requester, or by submitting proof that the individual is deceased (e.g., a copy of a death certificate or an obituary). As an exercise of administrative discretion, each component can require a requester to supply additional information if necessary in order to verify that a particular individual has consented to disclosure.
(b)
Description of records sought.
Requesters must describe the records sought in sufficient detail to enable agency personnel to locate them with a reasonable amount of effort. To the extent possible, requesters should include specific information that may help the component in identifying the requested records, such as the date, title or name, author, recipient, subject matter of the record, case number, file designation, reference number, the timeframe for which the records are sought, the office that created the records, or any other information that will assist the component in locating documents responsive to the request. Before submitting their requests, requesters may contact the component's FOIA Contact or FOIA Public Liaison to discuss the records they are seeking and to receive assistance in describing the records. If, after receiving a request, a component determines that the request does not adequately describe the records sought, the component will inform the requester what additional information is needed or why the request is otherwise insufficient. The component will also notify the requester that it will not be able to comply with their request unless the additional information it has requested is received from them in writing within 20 working days after the component has requested it. If this type of notification is received, a requester may wish to discuss it with the FOIA Public Liaison. If the component does not receive a written response containing the additional information within 20 working days after it has been requested, the SBA will presume that the requester is no longer interested in the records and will close the file on the request. Requesters who are attempting to reformulate or modify such a request may discuss their request with the component's designated FOIA Contact or its FOIA Public Liaison, or a representative of the FOI/PA Office, each of whom is available to assist the requester in reasonably describing the records sought. If a request does not reasonably describe the records sought, the SBA's response to the request may be delayed.
(c)
Form or format.
Requests may specify the preferred form or format (including electronic formats) for the records sought. The SBA will accommodate the request if the record is readily reproducible in that form or format.
(d)
Contact information.
Requesters must provide contact information, such as their phone number, email address, and mailing address, to assist the SBA in communicating with the requester and providing the released records.
§ 102.4
Responsibility for responding to requests.
(a)
In general.
Except in the instances described in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, the component that first receives a request for a record and maintains that record is the component responsible for responding to the request. In determining which records are responsive to a request, a component ordinarily will include only records in its possession as of the date
that it begins its search. If any other date is used, the component shall inform the requester of that date. A record that is excluded from the requirements of the FOIA pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(c) is not considered responsive to a request.
(b)
Authority to grant or deny requests.
The head of a component, or designee, is authorized to grant or to deny any requests for records that are maintained by that component.
(c)
Re-routing of misdirected requests.
Where a component determines that a request was misdirected within the SBA, the receiving component shall route the request to the proper component(s).
(d)
Consultation, referral, and coordination.
When reviewing records located by a component in response to a request, the component shall determine whether another component of SBA or another agency of the Federal Government is better able to determine whether the record is exempt from disclosure under the FOIA. As to any such record, the component shall proceed in one of the following ways:
(1)
Consultation.
When records originated with the component processing the request, but contain within them information of interest to another component, agency, or other Federal Government office, the component processing the request should typically consult with that other component or agency prior to making a release determination.
(2)
Referral.
(i) When the component processing the request believes that a different component, agency, or other Federal Government office is best able to determine whether to disclose the record, the component typically should refer the responsibility for responding to the request regarding that record, as long as the referral is to a component or agency that is subject to the FOIA. Ordinarily, the component or agency that originated the record will be presumed to be best able to make the disclosure determination. However, if the component processing the request and the originating component or agency jointly agrees that the former is in the best position to respond regarding the record, then the record may be handled as a consultation.
(ii) Whenever a component refers any part of the responsibility for responding to a request to another component or agency, it shall document the referral, maintain a copy of the record that it refers, and notify the requester of the referral and inform the requester of the name(s) of the component or agency to which the record was referred, including that component's or agency's FOIA Contact information.
(3)
Coordination.
The standard referral procedure is not appropriate where disclosure of the identity of the component or agency to which the referral would be made could harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption, such as the exemptions that protect personal privacy or national security interests. For example, if a non-law enforcement component responding to a request for records on a living third party locates within its files records originating with a law enforcement agency, and if the existence of that law enforcement interest in the third party was not publicly known, then to disclose that law enforcement interest could cause an unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of the third party. Similarly, if a component locates within its files material originating with an Intelligence Community agency and the involvement of that agency in the matter is classified and not publicly acknowledged, then to disclose or give attribution to the involvement of that Intelligence Community agency could cause national security harms. In such instances, in order to avoid harm to an interest protected by an applicable exemption, the component that received the request should coordinate with the originating component or agency to seek its views on the disclosure of the record. The release determination for the record that is the subject of the coordination should then be conveyed to the requester by the component that originally received the request.
(e)
Classified information.
On receipt of any request involving classified information, the component shall determine whether the information is currently and properly classified and take appropriate action to ensure compliance. Whenever a request involves a record containing information that has been classified or may be appropriate
for classification by another component or agency under any applicable executive order concerning the classification of records, the receiving component shall refer the responsibility for responding to the request regarding that information to the component or agency that classified the information, or that should consider the information for classification. Whenever a component's record contains information that has been derivatively classified (for example, when it contains information classified by another component or agency), the component shall refer the responsibility for responding to that portion of the request to the component or agency that classified the underlying information.
(f)
Agreements regarding consultations and referrals.
Components of SBA may establish agreements with other components of SBA or other Federal agencies to eliminate the need for consultations or referrals with respect to particular types of records.
(g)
Timing of responses to consultations and referrals.
All consultations and referrals received by the SBA will be handled according to the date that the FOIA request initially was received by the first component or agency.
§ 102.5
Timing of responses to requests.
(a)
In general.
Components ordinarily will respond to requests according to their order of receipt. In instances involving misdirected requests that are re-routed pursuant to § 102.4(c), the response time will commence on the date that the request is received by the proper component's office that is designated to receive requests, but in any event not later than 10 working days after the request is first received by any component's office that is designated by these regulations to receive requests.
(b)
Multitrack processing.
All components will designate a specific track for requests that are granted expedited processing, in accordance with the standards set forth in paragraph (e) of this section. A component may also designate additional processing tracks that distinguish between simple and more complex requests based on the estimated amount of work or time needed to process the request. Among the factors that may be considered are the number of records requested, the number of pages involved in processing the request and the need for consultations or referrals. Components shall advise requesters of the track into which their request falls and, when appropriate, should offer the requester an opportunity to narrow or modify the request so that it can be placed in a different processing track.
(c)
Unusual circumstances.
Whenever the statutory time limit for processing a request cannot be met because of “unusual circumstances,” as defined in the FOIA, and the component extends the time limit on that basis, the component shall, before expiration of the 20-working day period to respond, notify the requester in writing of the unusual circumstances involved and of the date by which the component estimates processing of the request will be completed. Where the extension exceeds 10 working days, the component shall, as prescribed by the FOIA, provide the requester with an opportunity to modify the request or to arrange an alternative time period for processing the original or modified request. The component shall make available its designated FOIA Contact or its FOIA Public Liaison for this purpose. The component must also alert requesters to the availability of the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) to provide dispute resolution services.
(d)
Aggregating requests.
For the purposes of determining unusual circumstances under the FOIA, components may aggregate requests in cases where it reasonably appears that multiple requests, submitted either by a requester or by a group of requesters acting in concert, constitute a single request that would otherwise involve unusual circumstances. Components shall not aggregate multiple requests that involve unrelated matters.
(e)
Expedited processing.
(1) Requests and appeals shall be processed on an expedited basis whenever it is determined that they involve:
(i) Circumstances in which the lack of expedited processing could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual;
(ii) An urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged Federal Government activity, if made by a person who is primarily engaged in disseminating information.
(iii) The loss of substantial due process rights; or
(iv) A matter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government's integrity that affect public confidence.
(2) A request for expedited processing may be made at any time. Requests based on paragraphs (e)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section must be submitted to the component that maintains the records requested. When making a request for expedited processing of an administrative appeal, the request should be submitted to the FOI/PA Office. Requests for expedited processing that are based on paragraph (e)(1)(iv) of this section must be submitted to the component processing the request. A component that receives a misdirected request for expedited processing under the standard set forth in paragraph (e)(1)(iv) of this section shall forward it immediately to the FOI/PA Office for its determination. The time period for making the determination on the request for expedited processing under paragraph (e)(1)(iv) of this section shall commence on the date that the FOI/PA Office receives the request, provided that it is routed within 10 working days.
(3) A requester who seeks expedited processing must submit a notarized statement, such as an affidavit or declaration, certified to be true and correct, explaining in detail the basis for making the request for expedited processing. For example, under paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section, a requester who is not a full-time member of the news media must establish that the requester is a person whose primary professional activity or occupation is information dissemination, though it need not be the requester's sole occupation. Such a requester also must establish a particular urgency to inform the public about the government activity involved in the request—one that extends beyond the public's right to know about government activity generally. The existence of numerous articles published on a given subject can be helpful in establishing the requirement that there be an “urgency to inform” the public on the topic. As a matter of administrative discretion, the SBA may waive the formal certification requirement.
(4) A component shall notify the requester within 10 working days of the receipt of a request for expedited processing of its decision whether to grant or deny expedited processing. If expedited processing is granted, the request must be given priority, placed in the processing track for expedited requests, and must be processed as soon as practicable. If a request for expedited processing is denied, any appeal of that decision shall be acted on expeditiously.
§ 102.6
Responses to requests.
(a)
In general.
Components should, to the extent practicable, communicate with requesters having access to the Internet using electronic means, such as email or web portal.
(b)
Acknowledgments of requests.
A component shall acknowledge the request in writing and assign it an individualized tracking number. Components shall include in the acknowledgment a brief description of the records sought to allow requesters to more easily keep track of their requests.
(c)
Estimated dates of completion and interim responses.
Upon request, components shall provide an estimated date by which they expect to provide a response to the requester. If a request involves a voluminous amount of material, or searches in multiple locations, the SBA or component may provide interim responses, releasing the records on a rolling basis.
(d)
Grants of requests.
Once a component determines it will grant a request in full or in part, it will notify the requester in writing. The component shall inform the requester of any fees charged under § 102.8 and shall disclose the requested records to the requester promptly upon payment of any applicable fees. The component must inform the requester of the availability of its FOIA Public Liaison to offer assistance.
(e)
Adverse determinations of requests.
A component making an adverse determination denying a request in any respect shall notify the requester of that determination in writing. Adverse determinations, or denials of requests, include denials involving fees or fee waiver matters, denials of requests for expedited processing, and decisions where:
(1) The requested record is exempt, in whole or in part;
(2) The request does not reasonably describe the records sought;
(3) The information requested is not a record subject to the FOIA;
(4) The requested record does not exist, cannot be located, or has been destroyed; or
(5) The requested record is not readily reproducible in the form or format sought by the requester.
(f)
Content of denial.
The denial must be signed by the head of the component or designee and must include:
(1) The name and title or position of the person responsible for the denial;
(2) A brief statement of the reasons for the denial, including any FOIA exemption applied by the component in denying the request;
(3) An estimate of the volume of any records or information withheld, such as the number of pages or some other reasonable form of estimation, although such an estimate is not required if the volume is otherwise indicated by deletions marked on records that are disclosed in part or if providing an estimate would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption;
(4) A statement that the denial may be appealed under § 102.9, and a description of the appeal requirements; and
(5) A statement notifying the requester of the assistance available from the component's FOIA Public Liaison or designee, and the dispute resolution services offered by OGIS.
(g)
Markings on released documents.
Records disclosed in part must be marked clearly to show the amount of information deleted and the exemption under which the deletion was made unless doing so would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption.
§ 102.7
Confidential commercial information.
(a)
Definitions.
For purposes of this section:
Confidential commercial information
means commercial or financial information obtained by the SBA from a submitter that may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4 of the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4).
Submitter
means any person or entity, including a corporation, State, or foreign government, but not including another Federal Government entity, that provides information, either directly or indirectly to the Federal Government.
(b)
Designation of confidential commercial information.
A submitter of confidential commercial information must use good faith efforts to designate by appropriate markings, either at the time of submission or within a reasonable time thereafter, any portion of its submission that it considers to be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4. These designations shall expire 10 years after the date of the submission unless the submitter requests and provides justification for a longer designation period.
(c)
When notice to submitters is required.
(1) A component shall promptly provide written notice to a submitter of confidential commercial information whenever records containing such information are requested under the FOIA if, after reviewing the request, the responsive records, and any appeal by the requester, the component determines that it may be required to disclose the records, provided:
(i) The requested information has been designated in good faith by the submitter as information considered protected from disclosure under Exemption 4; or
(ii) The component has a reason to believe that the requested information may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4, but has not yet determined whether the information is protected from disclosure under that exemption or any other applicable exemption.
(2) The notice shall either describe the commercial information requested or include a copy of the requested
records or portions of records containing the information. In cases involving a voluminous number of submitters, notice may be made by posting or publishing the notice in a place or manner reasonably likely to accomplish it.
(d)
Exceptions to submitter notice requirements.
The notice requirements of this section shall not apply if:
(1) The component determines that the information is exempt under the FOIA;
(2) The information has been lawfully published or has been officially made available to the public;
(3) Disclosure of the information is required by a statute other than the FOIA or by a regulation issued in accordance with the requirements of Executive Order 12600 of June 23, 1987; or
(4) The designation made by the submitter under paragraph (b) of this section appears obviously frivolous, except that, in such a case, the component shall give the submitter written notice of any final decision to disclose the information and must provide that notice within a reasonable number of days prior to a specified disclosure date.
(e)
Opportunity to object to disclosure.
(1) A component shall specify a reasonable time period within which the submitter must respond to the notice referenced above. If the submitter has any objections to disclosure, it should provide the component a detailed written statement that specifies all grounds for withholding the particular information under any exemption of the FOIA. In order to rely on Exemption 4 as the basis for nondisclosure, the submitter must explain why the information constitutes a trade secret or commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential.
(2) A submitter who fails to respond within the time period specified in the notice shall be considered to have no objection to disclosure of the information. Information received by the component after the date of any disclosure decision shall not be considered by the component. Any information provided by a submitter under this subpart may itself be subject to disclosure under the FOIA.
(f)
Analysis of objections.
A component shall consider a submitter's objections and specific grounds for nondisclosure in deciding whether to disclose the requested information.
(g)
Notice of intent to disclose.
Whenever a component decides to disclose information over the objection of a submitter, the component shall provide the submitter written notice, which shall include:
(1) A statement of the reasons why each of the submitter's disclosure objections was not sustained;
(2) A description of the information to be disclosed; and
(3) A specified disclosure date, which shall be a reasonable time subsequent to the notice.
§ 102.8
Fees.
(a)
In general.
Components shall charge for processing requests under the FOIA in accordance with the provisions of this section and with the OMB Guidelines. In order to resolve any fee issues that arise under this section, a component may contact a requester for additional information. Components shall ensure that searches, review, and duplication are conducted in the most efficient and the least expensive manner. A component ordinarily will collect all applicable fees before sending copies of records to a requester. Requesters must pay fees by check or money order made payable to the Small Business Administration, addressed to the component assessing the fee.
(b)
Categories of requesters.
Different fees are assessed depending on the requester category. Requesters may seek a fee waiver. Requests for fee waivers will be considered in accordance with the requirements in paragraph (l) of this section. For purposes of assessing fees, the FOIA establishes four categories of requesters:
(1) Commercial use requesters;
(2) Non-commercial scientific/educational institutions requesters;
(3) News media requesters, and;
(4) All other requesters.
(c)
Definitions.
For purposes of this section:
(1)
Commercial use request
is a request that asks for information for a use or a purpose that furthers a commercial,
trade, or profit interest, which can include furthering those interests through litigation. A component's decision to place a requester in the commercial use category will be made on a case-by-case basis based on the requester's intended use of the information.
(2)
Direct costs
are those expenses that the SBA incurs in searching for and duplicating (and, in the case of commercial use requests, reviewing) records in order to respond to a FOIA request. For example, direct costs include the salary of the employee performing the work (
i.e.,
the basic rate of pay for the employee, plus 16 percent of that rate to cover benefits) and the cost of operating computers and other electronic equipment, such as photocopiers and scanners. Direct costs do not include overhead expenses such as the costs of space, and of heating or lighting a facility. This will be in addition to search, review, and duplication fees, and shall be paid by requesters categorized as commercial and other.
(3)
Duplication
is reproducing a copy of a record, or of the information contained in it, necessary to respond to a FOIA request. Copies can take the form of paper, audiovisual materials, or electronic records, among others.
(4)
Educational institution
is any school that operates a program of scholarly research. A requester in this fee category must show that the request is made in connection with his or her role at the educational institution. Components may seek verification from the requester that the request is in furtherance of scholarly research and will advise requesters of their placement in this category.

# Example 1 to paragraph (c)(4).
A request from a professor of geology at a university for records relating to soil erosion, written on letterhead of the Department of Geology, would be presumed to be from an educational institution.

# Example 2 to paragraph (c)(4).
A request from the same professor of geology seeking drug information from the Food and Drug Administration in furtherance of a murder mystery he is writing would not be presumed to be an institutional request, regardless of whether it was written on institutional stationery.

# Example 3 to paragraph (c)(4).
A student, who makes a request in furtherance of their coursework or other school-sponsored activities and provides a copy of a course syllabus or other reasonable documentation to indicate the research purpose for the request, would qualify as part of this fee category.
(5)
Noncommercial scientific institution
is an institution that is not operated on a“commercial” basis, as defined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section and that is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research, the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry. A requester in this category must show that the request is authorized by and is made under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are sought to further scientific research and are not for a commercial use.
(6)
Representative of the news media
is any person or entity that gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience. The term “news” means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news media entities include television or radio stations that broadcast “news” to the public at large and publishers of periodicals that disseminate “news” and make their products available through a variety of means to the general public, including news organizations that disseminate solely on the Internet. A request for records supporting the news-dissemination function of the requester will not be considered to be for a commercial use. “Freelance” journalists who demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through a news media entity will be considered as a representative of the news media. A publishing contract would provide the clearest evidence that publication is expected; however, a requester's past publication record will be considered in making a determination.
(7)
Review
is the examination of a record located in response to a request in order to determine whether any portion of it is exempt from disclosure. Review time includes processing any record for disclosure, such as doing all that is necessary to prepare the record for disclosure, including the process of
redacting the record and marking the appropriate exemptions. Review costs are properly charged even if a record ultimately is not disclosed. Review time also includes time spent both obtaining and considering any formal objection to disclosure made by a confidential commercial information submitter under § 102.7, but it does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions.
(8)
Search
is the process of looking for and retrieving records or information responsive to a request. Search time includes page-by-page or line-by-line identification of information within records and the reasonable efforts expended to locate and retrieve information from electronic records.
(d)
Charging fees.
In responding to FOIA requests, components will charge the following fees unless a waiver or reduction of fees has been granted under paragraph (l) of this section. Because the fee amounts provided below already account for the direct costs associated with a given fee type, components will not add any additional costs to charges calculated under this section.
(1)
Search.
(i) Requests made by educational institutions, noncommercial scientific institutions, or representatives of the news media are not subject to search fees. Search fees shall be charged for all other requesters, subject to the restrictions of paragraph (e) of this section. Components may properly charge for time spent searching even if they do not locate any responsive records or if they determine that the records are entirely exempt from disclosure.
(ii) For each hour spent by personnel searching for requested records, including electronic searches that do not require new programming, the fees will be charged as follows: Professional (GS 9-14)—$46; and managerial (GS 15 and above)—$83.
(iii) Requesters shall be charged the direct costs associated with conducting any search that requires the creation of a new computer program to locate the requested records. Requesters shall be notified of the costs associated with creating such a program and must agree to pay the associated costs before the costs may be incurred.
(iv) For requests that require the retrieval of records stored by SBA at a Federal Records Center operated by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), additional costs shall be charged in accordance with the Transactional Billing Rate Schedule established by NARA.
(2)
Duplication.
Duplication fees will be assessed to all requesters, subject to the restrictions of paragraph (e) of this section. A component shall honor a requester's preference for receiving a record in a particular form or format where it can be readily reproduced in the form or format requested. Where photocopies are supplied, SBA will provide one copy per request at the cost of $.10 per page. For copies of records produced on tapes, disks, or other media, SBA will charge the direct costs of producing the copy, including operator time. Where paper documents must be scanned in order to comply with a requester's preference to receive the records in an electronic format, the requester must also pay the direct costs associated with scanning those materials. For other forms of duplication, components shall charge the direct costs.
(3)
Review.
(i) Review fees will be assessed to requesters who make commercial use requests. Review fees will be assessed in connection with the initial review of the record,
i.e.,
the review conducted by a component to determine whether an exemption applies to a particular record or portion of a record. No charge will be made for review at the administrative appeal stage of exemptions applied at the initial review stage. However, if a particular exemption is deemed to no longer apply, any costs associated with SBA's re-review of the records in order to consider the use of other exemptions may be assessed as review fees. Review fees will be charged at the same rates as those charged for a search under paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section.
(ii) The following table summarizes the fees for each type of requester.

(e)
Restrictions on charging fees.
(1) When a component determines that a requester is an educational institution, non-commercial scientific institution, or representative of the news media, and the records are not sought for commercial use, it will not charge search fees.
(i) If a component fails to comply with the time limits in which to respond to a request, it may not charge search fees, or, in the instances of requests from requesters described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, may not charge duplication fees, except as described in paragraphs (d)(1)(ii) through (iv) of this section.
(ii) If a component has determined that unusual circumstances as defined by the FOIA apply and SBA provided timely written notice to the requester in accordance with the FOIA, a failure to comply with the time limit shall be excused for an additional 10 working days.
(iii) If a component has determined that unusual circumstances, as defined by the FOIA, apply and more than 5,000 pages are necessary to respond to the request, the component may charge search fees, or, in the case of requesters described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, may charge duplication fees, if the following steps are taken. The component shall provide a timely written notice of unusual circumstances to the requester in accordance with the FOIA and SBA must have discussed with the requester via written mail, email, or telephone (or made not less than three good-faith attempts to do so) how the requester could effectively limit the scope of the request in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B)(ii). If this exception is satisfied, the component may charge all applicable fees incurred in the processing of the request.
(iv) If a court has determined that exceptional circumstances exist, as defined by the FOIA, a failure to comply with the time limits shall be excused for the length of time provided by the court order.
(2) No search or review fees will be charged for a quarter-hour period unless more than half of that period is required for search or review.
(3) Except for requesters seeking records for a commercial use, components shall provide without charge:
(i) The first 100 pages of duplication (or the cost equivalent for other media); and
(ii) The first two hours of search.
(4) No fee will be charged when the total fee, after deducting the 100 free pages (or its cost equivalent) and the first two hours of search, is equal to or less than $46.00.
(f)
Notice of anticipated fees in excess of $46.00.
(1) When a component determines or estimates that the fees to be assessed in accordance with this section will exceed $46.00, the component shall notify the requester of the actual or estimated amount of the fees, including a breakdown of the fees for search, review, or duplication, unless the requester has indicated a willingness to pay fees as high as those anticipated. If only a portion of the fee can be estimated readily, the component shall advise the requester accordingly. If the request is not for noncommercial use, the notice will specify that the requester is entitled to the statutory entitlements of 100 pages of duplication at no charge and, if the requester is charged search fees, two hours of search time at no charge, and will advise the requester whether those entitlements have been provided.
(2) In cases in which a requester has been notified that the actual or estimated fees are in excess of $46.00, the
request shall not be considered received and further work will not be completed until the requester commits in writing to pay the actual or estimated total fee, or designates some amount of fees the requester is willing to pay, or in the case of a noncommercial use requester who has not yet been provided with the requester's statutory entitlements, designates that the requester seeks only that which can be provided by the statutory entitlements. The requester must provide the commitment or designation in writing, and must, when applicable, designate an exact dollar amount the requester is willing to pay. Components are not required to accept payments in installments.
(3) If the requester has indicated a willingness to pay some designated amount of fees, but the component estimates that the total fee will exceed that amount, the component will toll the processing of the request when it notifies the requester of the estimated fees in excess of the amount the requester has indicated a willingness to pay. The component shall inquire whether the requester wishes to revise the amount of fees the requester is willing to pay or modify the request. Once the requester responds, the time to respond will resume from where it was at the date of the notification.
(4) Components shall make available their FOIA Public Liaison or other designee to assist any requester in reformulating a request to meet the requester's needs at a lower cost.
(g)
Charges for other services.
Although not required to provide special services, if a component chooses to do so as a matter of administrative discretion, the direct costs of providing the service will be charged. Examples of such services include certifying that records are true copies, providing multiple copies of the same document, or sending records by means other than first class mail.
(h)
Charging interest.
Components may charge interest on any unpaid bill starting on the 31st day following the date of billing the requester. Interest charges will be assessed at the rate provided in 31 U.S.C. 3717 and will accrue from the billing date until payment is received by the component. Components shall follow the provisions of the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-365, 96 Stat. 1749), as amended, and its administrative procedures, including the use of consumer reporting agencies, collection agencies, and offset.
(i)
Aggregating requests.
When a component reasonably believes that a requester or a group of requesters acting in concert is attempting to divide a single request into a series of requests for the purpose of avoiding fees, the component may aggregate those requests and charge accordingly. Components may presume that multiple requests of this type made within a 30-day period have been made in order to avoid fees. For requests separated by a longer period, components shall aggregate them only where there is a reasonable basis for determining that aggregation is warranted in view of all the circumstances involved. Multiple requests involving unrelated matters cannot be aggregated.
(j)
Advance payments.
(1) For requests other than those described in paragraphs (j)(2) or (j)(3) of this section, components cannot require the requester to make an advance payment before work is commenced or continued on a request. Payment owed for work already completed (
i.e.,
payment before copies are sent to a requester) is not an advance payment.
(2) When a component determines or estimates that a total fee to be charged under this section will exceed $250.00, it may require that the requester make an advance payment up to the amount of the entire anticipated fee before beginning to process the request. Components may elect to process the request prior to collecting fees when it receives a satisfactory assurance of full payment from a requester with a history of prompt payment.
(3) Where a requester has previously failed to pay a properly charged FOIA fee to any component or SBA within 30 working days of the billing date, a component may require that the requester pay the full amount due, plus any applicable interest on that prior request, and the component may require that the requester make an advance payment of the full amount of any anticipated fee before SBA begins
to process a new request or continues to process a pending request or any pending appeal. When a component has a reasonable basis to believe that a requester has misrepresented the requester's identity in order to avoid paying outstanding fees, it may require that the requester provide proof of identity.
(4) In cases in which advanced payment is required, the request will not be considered received and further work will not be completed until the required payment is received. If the requester does not pay the advance payment within 30 working days after the date of the fee determination, the request will be closed.
(k)
Other statutes specifically providing for fees.
The fee schedule of this section does not apply to fees charged under any statute that specifically requires SBA to set and collect fees for particular types of records. In instances where records responsive to a request are subject to a statutorily-based fee schedule program, the requester will be informed of the contact information for that program.
(l)
Requirements for waiver or reduction of fees.
(1) Requesters may seek a waiver of fees by submitting written correspondence demonstrating how disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. Records responsive to a request shall be furnished without charge or at a reduced rate below the rate established under paragraph (d) of this section, where a component determines, based on all available information, that the requester has demonstrated that:
(i) Disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government, and
(ii) Disclosure of the information is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.
(2) Components shall furnish records responsive to a request without charge or at a reduced rate when it determines, based on all available information, that the factors described in paragraphs (l)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section are satisfied:
(i) Disclosure of the requested information would shed light on the operations or activities of the government. The subject of the request must concern identifiable operations or activities of the Federal Government with a connection that is direct and clear, not remote or attenuated.
(ii) Disclosure of the requested information is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations or activities. This factor is satisfied when the following criteria are met:
(A) Disclosure of the requested records must be meaningfully informative about government operations or activities. The disclosure of information that already is in the public domain, in either the same or a substantially identical form, would not be meaningfully informative if nothing new would be added to the public's understanding.
(B) The disclosure must contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. A requester's expertise in the subject area as well as the requester's ability and intention to effectively convey information to the public must be considered. Components shall presume that a representative of the news media will satisfy this consideration.
(iii) The disclosure must not be primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. To determine whether disclosure of the requested information is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester, the following criteria will be considered:
(A) Identify whether the requester has any commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure. A commercial interest includes any commercial, trade, or profit interest. Requesters must be given an opportunity to provide explanatory information regarding this consideration.
(B) If there is an identified commercial interest, a determination will be made whether the primary interest is furthered by the request. A waiver or
reduction of fees is justified when the requirements of paragraphs (l)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section are satisfied and any commercial interest is not the primary interest furthered by the request. Ordinarily there will be a presumption, that when a news media requester has satisfied factors (l)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section, the request is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. Disclosure to data brokers or others who merely compile and market government information for direct economic return will not be presumed to primarily serve the public interest.
(3) Where only some of the records to be released satisfy the requirements for a waiver of fees, a waiver must be granted for those records.
(4) Requests for a waiver or reduction of fees should be made when the request is first submitted and should address the criteria referenced above. A requester may submit a fee waiver request at a later time so long as the underlying record request is pending or on administrative appeal. When a requester who has committed to pay fees subsequently asks for a waiver of those fees and that waiver is denied, the requester must pay any costs incurred up to the date the fee waiver request was received.
§ 102.9
Administrative appeals.
(a)
Requirements for making an appeal.
A requester may appeal any adverse determinations to the FOI/PA Office. The contact information is contained in § 102.3(a)(1). Examples of adverse determinations are provided in § 102.6(e). The requester must make the appeal in writing and to be considered timely it must be postmarked, or in the case of electronic submissions, transmitted, within 90 working days after the date of the response. The appeal should clearly identify the component's determination that is being appealed and the assigned request number. To facilitate handling, the requester should mark both the appeal letter and envelope, or subject line of the electronic transmission, “Freedom of Information Act Appeal.”
(b)
Adjudication of appeals.
(1) The Chief, FOI/PA or designee will act on behalf of the SBA on all appeals under this section.
(2) An appeal ordinarily will not be adjudicated if the request becomes a matter of FOIA litigation.
(3) On receipt of any appeal involving classified information, the FOI/PA Office shall take appropriate action to ensure compliance with Executive Orders 13467 and 13526.
(c)
Decisions on appeals.
A decision on an appeal will be made in writing. A decision that upholds a component's determination will contain a statement that identifies the reasons for the affirmance, including any FOIA exemptions applied. The decision will provide the requester with notification of the statutory right to file a lawsuit and will inform the requester of the mediation services offered by OGIS as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation. If a component's decision is remanded or modified on appeal, the requester will be notified of that determination in writing. The component will thereafter, further process the request in accordance with that appeal determination and respond directly to the requester.
(d) Time limit for issuing appeal decision. The statutory time limit for responding to appeals is generally 20 working days after receipt. However, the Appeals Officer may extend the time limit for responding to an appeal provided the circumstances set forth in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B)(i) are met.
(e)
Engaging in dispute resolution services provided by OGIS.
Mediation is a voluntary process. If a component agrees to participate in the mediation services provided by OGIS, it will actively engage as a partner to the process in an attempt to resolve the dispute.
(f)
When an appeal is required.
Before seeking review by a court of a component's adverse determination, a requester generally must first submit a timely administrative appeal.
§ 102.10
Preservation of records.
Each component shall preserve all correspondence pertaining to the requests that it receives under this subpart, as well as copies of all requested records, until disposition or destruction is authorized pursuant to title 44
of the United States Code or the General Records Schedule 14 of the National Archives and Records Administration. Records shall not be disposed of or destroyed while they are the subject of a pending request, appeal, or lawsuit under the FOIA.
§ 102.11
Subpoenas.
(a) The person to whom the subpoena is directed must consult with SBA counsel in the relevant SBA office, who will seek approval for compliance from the Associate General Counsel for Litigation. Except where the subpoena requires the testimony of an employee of the Inspector General's office, or records within the possession of the Inspector General, the Associate General Counsel may delegate the authorization for appropriate production of documents or testimony to local SBA counsel.
(b) If SBA counsel approves compliance with the subpoena, SBA will comply.
(c) If SBA counsel disapproves compliance with the subpoena, SBA will not comply, and will base such noncompliance on an appropriate legal basis such as privilege or a statute.
(d) SBA counsel must provide a copy of any subpoena relating to a criminal matter to SBA's Inspector General prior to its return date.

§ 102.24
Requests for access to records.
(a)
How made and addressed.
An individual, or his or her legal guardian, may make a request for access to an SBA record about himself or herself by appearing in person or by writing directly to the SBA office that maintains the record or to the FOI/PA Office by mail to 409 3rd St., SW., Washington, DC 20416 or fax to 202-205-7059. A request received by the FOI/PA Office will be forwarded to the appropriate SBA Office where the records are located.
(b)
Description of records sought.
A request for access to records must describe the records sought in sufficient detail to enable SBA personnel to locate the system of records containing them with a reasonable amount of effort. A request should also state the date of the record or time period in which the record was compiled, and the name or identifying number of each system of records in which the requester believes the record is kept. The SBA publishes notices in the
Federal Register
that describe its systems of records. A description of the SBA's systems of records also may be found at
http://www.sba.gov/foia/systemrecords.doc.
(c)
Verification of identity.
Any individual who submits a request for access to records must verify his or her identity. No specific form is required; however, the requester must state his or her full name, current address, and date and place of birth. The request must be signed and the requester's signature must either be notarized or submitted under 28 U.S.C. 1746. This law
permits statements to be made under penalty of perjury as a substitute for notarization, the language states:
(1) If executed outside the United States: “I declare (or certify, verify, or state) under penalty of perjury under the laws of the United States of America that the foregoing is true and correct. Executed on (date). Signature”; or
(2) If executed within the Untied States, its territories, possessions or commonwealths: “I declare (or certify, verify, or state) under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. Executed on (date). Signature”.
(d)
Verification of guardianship.
When making a request as a legal agent or the parent or guardian of a minor or as the guardian of someone determined by a court to be incompetent, for access to records about that individual, the requester must establish:
(1) The identity of the individual who is the subject of the record, by stating the name, current address, date and place of birth, and, at the requester's option, the social security number of the individual;
(2) The requester's own identity, as required in paragraph (c) of this section;
(3) That the requester is the legal agent or parent or guardian of that individual, which may be proven by providing a copy of the individual's birth certificate showing his parentage or by providing a court order establishing guardianship; and
(4) That the requester is acting on behalf of that individual in making the request.
§ 102.25
Responsibility for responding to requests for access to records.
(a)
In general.
Except as stated in paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section and in § 102.24(a), the office that first receives a request for access to a record, and has possession of that record, is the office responsible for responding to the request. That office shall acknowledge receipt of the request not later than 10 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) after the date of receipt of the request in writing. In determining which records are responsive to a request, an office ordinarily shall include only those records in its possession as of the date the office begins its search for them. If any other date is used, the office shall inform the requester of that date.
(b)
Authority to grant or deny requests.
The Program/Support Office Head, or designee, is authorized to grant or deny any request for access to a record of that office.
(c)
Consultations and referrals.
When an office receives a request for access to a record in its possession, it shall determine whether another office, or another agency of the Federal Government, is better able to determine whether the record is exempt from access under the Privacy Act. If the receiving office determines that it is best able to process the record in response to the request, then it shall do so. If the receiving office determines that it is not best able to process the record, then it shall either:
(1) Respond to the request regarding that record, after consulting with the office or agency best able to determine whether the record is exempt from access and with any other office or agency that has a substantial interest in it; or
(2) Refer the responsibility for responding to the request to the office best able to determine whether the record is exempt from access or to another agency that originated the record (but only if that agency is subject to the Privacy Act). Ordinarily the office or agency that originated a record will be presumed to be best able to determine whether it is exempt from access.
(d)
Law enforcement information.
Whenever a request is made for access to a record containing information that relates to an investigation of a possible violation of law and that was originated by SBA's Office of the Inspector General (OIG) or another agency, the receiving office shall refer the responsibility for responding to the request regarding that information to either SBA's OIG or the other agency “depending on where the investigation originated.”
(e)
Classified information.
Whenever a request is made for access to a record containing information that has been classified by or may be appropriate for
classification by another office or agency under Executive Order 12958 or any other executive order concerning the classification of records, the receiving office shall refer the responsibility for responding to the request regarding that information to the office or agency that classified the information, should consider the information for classification, or has the primary interest in it, as appropriate. Whenever a record contains information that has been derivatively classified by an office because it contains information classified by another office or agency, the office shall refer the responsibility for responding to the request regarding that information to the office or agency that classified the underlying information. Information determined to no longer require classification shall not be withheld from a requester on the basis of Exemption (k)(1) of the Privacy Act.
(f)
Notice of referral.
Whenever an office refers all or any part of the responsibility for responding to a request to another office or agency, it shall notify the requester of the referral and inform the requester of the name of each office or agency to which the request has been referred and of the part of the request that has been referred.
(g)
Responses to consultations and referrals.
All consultations and referrals shall be processed according to the date the access request was initially received by the first office or agency, not any later date.
(h)
Agreements regarding consultations and referrals.
Offices may make agreements with other offices or agencies to eliminate the need for consultations or referrals for particular types of records.
§ 102.26
Responses to requests for access to records.
(a)
Acknowledgements of requests.
On receipt of a request, an office shall send an acknowledgement letter to the requester.
(b)
Grants of requests for access.
Once an office makes a determination to grant a request for access in whole or in part, it shall notify the requester in writing. The Program/Support Office Head or designee shall inform the requester in the notice of any fee charged under § 102.31 and shall disclose records to the requester promptly on payment of any applicable fee. If a request is made in person, the office may disclose records to the requester directly, in a manner not unreasonably disruptive of its operations, on payment of any applicable fee and with a written record made of the grant of the request. If a requester is accompanied by another person, he or she shall be required to authorize in writing any discussion of the records in the presence of the other person.
(c)
Adverse determinations of requests for access.
A Program/Support Office Head or designee making an adverse determination denying a request for access in any respect shall notify the requester of that determination in writing. Adverse determinations, or denials of requests, consist of: a determination to withhold any requested record in whole or in part; a determination that a requested record does not exist or cannot be located; a determination that the requested information is not a record subject to the Privacy Act; a determination on any disputed fee matter; and a denial of a request for expedited treatment. The notification letter shall be signed by the Program/Support Office Head or designee, and shall include:
(1) The name and title or position of the person responsible for the denial;
(2) A brief statement of the reason(s) for the denial, including any FOIA or Privacy Act exemption(s) applied in denying the request; and
(3) A statement that the denial may be appealed under § 102.27(a) and a description of the requirements of § 102.27(a).
§ 102.27
Appeals from denials of requests for access to records.
(a)
Appeals.
If the requester is dissatisfied with an office's response to his or her request for access to records, the requester may make a written appeal of the adverse determination denying the request in any respect to the SBA's FOI/PA Office, 409 3rd St., SW., Washington, DC 20416. The appeal must be received by the FOI/PA Office within 60 days of the date of the letter denying the request. The requester's appeal letter should include as much information
as possible, including the identity of the office whose adverse determination is being appealed. Unless otherwise directed, the Chief, FOI/PA will decide all appeals under this subpart.
(b)
Responses to appeals.
The decision on a requester's appeal will be made in writing not later than 30 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) after the date of receipt of such appeal. A decision affirming an adverse determination in whole or in part will include a brief statement of the reason(s) for the affirmation, including any Privacy Act exemption applied, and will inform the requester of the Privacy Act provisions for court review of the decision. If the adverse determination is reversed or modified on appeal in whole or in part, the requester will be notified in a written decision and his request will be reprocessed in accordance with that appeal decision.
(c)
Judicial review.
In order to seek judicial review by a court of any adverse determination or denial of a request, a requester must first appeal it to the FOI/PA Office under this section.
§ 102.28
Requests for amendment or correction of records.
(a)
How made and addressed.
Unless the record is not subject to amendment or correction as stated in paragraph (f) of this section, an individual may make a request for amendment or correction of an SBA record about himself or herself by writing directly to the office that maintains the record, following the procedures in § 102.24. The request should identify each particular record in question, state the amendment or correction sought, and state why the record is not accurate, relevant, timely, or complete. The requester may submit any documentation that he or she thinks would be helpful. If the requester believes that the same record is in more than one system of records, that should be stated and the request should be sent to each office that maintains a system of records containing the record.
(b)
Office responses.
Within ten (10) days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) of receiving a request for amendment or correction of records, an office shall send the requester a written acknowledgment of receipt, and the office shall notify the requester within 30 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) of receipt of the request whether it is granted or denied. If the Program/Support Office Head or designee grants the request in whole or in part, the amendment or correction must be made, and the requester advised of his or her right to obtain a copy of the corrected or amended record. If the office denies a request in whole or in part, it shall send the requester a letter signed by the Program/Support Office Head or designee that shall state:
(1) The reason(s) for the denial; and
(2) The procedure for appeal of the denial under paragraph (c) of this section, including the name and business address of the official who will act on your appeal.
(c)
Appeals.
An individual may appeal a denial of a request for amendment or correction to the FOI/PA Office in the same manner as a denial of a request for access to records (see § 102.27), and the same procedures shall be followed. If the appeal is denied, the requester shall be advised of his or her right to file a Statement of Disagreement as described in paragraph (d) of this section and of his or her right under the Privacy Act for court review of the decision.
(d)
Statement of Disagreement.
If an appeal under this section is denied in whole or in part, the requester has the right to file a Statement of Disagreement that states the reason(s) for disagreeing with the SBA's denial of his or her request for amendment or correction. A Statement of Disagreement must be concise, must clearly identify each part of any record that is disputed, and should be no longer than one typed page for each fact disputed. An individual's Statement of Disagreement must be sent to the office that maintains the record involved, which shall place it in the system of records in which the disputed record is maintained and shall mark the disputed record to indicate that a Statement of Disagreement has been filed and where in the system of records it may be found.
(e)
Notification of amendment/correction or disagreement.
Within 30 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) of the amendment or correction of a record, the office that maintains the record shall notify all persons, organizations, or agencies to which it previously disclosed the record, if an accounting of that disclosure was made, that the record has been amended or corrected. If an individual has filed a Statement of Disagreement, the office shall append a copy of it to the disputed record whenever the record is disclosed and may also append a concise statement of its reason(s) for denying the request to amend or correct the record.
(f)
Records not subject to amendment or correction.
The following records are not subject to amendment or correction:

Except where accountings of disclosures are not required to be kept (as stated in paragraph (b) of this section), an individual may make a request for an accounting of any disclosure that has been made by the SBA to another person, organization, or agency of any record in a system of records about him or her. This accounting contains the date, nature, and purpose of each disclosure, as well as the name and address of the person, organization, or agency to which the disclosure was made.

Preservation of records.
Each office will preserve all correspondence pertaining to the requests that it receives under this subpart, as well as copies of all requested records, until disposition or destruction is authorized by title 44 of the United States Code or the National Archives and Records Administration's General Records Schedule 14. Records will not be disposed of while they are the subject of a pending request, appeal, or lawsuit under the Privacy Act.
§ 102.31

(ii) Until the subsequent expiration of any notice period provided by the program's governing statute or regulations, or 30 days. Such opportunity to contest may be satisfied by notice, hearing, and appeal rights governing such Federal benefit program. The exercise of any such rights shall not affect rights available under the Privacy Act.
(3) SBA may take any appropriate action otherwise prohibited by the above if SBA determines that the public health or safety may be adversely affected or significantly threatened during the notice period required by paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section.
(d)
Sanctions.
Notwithstanding any other provision of law, SBA may not disclose any record which is contained in a system of records to a recipient agency or non-Federal agency for a matching program if SBA has reason to believe that the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section, or any matching agreement entered into pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section or both, are not being met by such recipient agency.
(1) SBA shall not renew a matching agreement unless,
(i) The recipient agency or non-Federal agency has certified that it has complied with the provisions of that agreement; and
(ii) SBA has no reason to believe that the certification is inaccurate.
(e) Review annually each ongoing matching program in which the Agency has participated during the year, either as a source or as a matching agency in order to assure that the requirements of the Privacy Act, OMB guidance, and any Agency regulations and standard operating procedures, operating instructions, or guidelines have been met.

The Board shall:

(5) Serve as clearinghouse for receiving and providing information on the accuracy, completeness, and reliability of records used in matching programs;
(6) Provide interpretation and guidance to SBA offices and personnel on the requirements for matching programs;
(7) Review Agency recordkeeping and disposal policies and practices for matching programs to assure compliance with the Privacy Act; and
(8) May review and report on any SBA matching activities that are not matching programs.
(g)
Cost-benefit analysis.
Except as provided in paragraphs (e)(2) and (3) of this section, the Data Integrity Board shall not approve any written agreement for a matching program unless SBA has completed and submitted to such Board a cost-benefit analysis of the proposed program and such analysis demonstrates that the program is likely to be cost effective. The Board may waive these requirements if it determines, in writing, and in accordance with OMB guidelines, that a cost-benefit analysis is not required. Such an analysis also shall not be required prior to the initial approval of a written agreement for a matching program that is specifically required by statute.
(h)
Disapproval of matching agreements.
If a matching agreement is disapproved by the Data Integrity Board, any party to such agreement may appeal to OMB. Timely notice of the filing of such an appeal shall be provided by OMB to the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Government Operations of the House of Representatives.
(1) OMB may approve a matching agreement despite the disapproval of the Data Integrity Board if OMB determines that:
(i) The matching program will be consistent with all applicable legal, regulatory, and policy requirements;
(ii) There is adequate evidence that the matching agreement will be cost-effective; and
(iii) The matching program is in the public interest.
(2) The decision of OMB to approve a matching agreement shall not take effect until 30 days after it is reported to the committees described in paragraph (h) of this section.

Changes in systems.
The SBA shall provide adequate advance notice to Congress and OMB of any proposal to establish or alter any system of records in order to permit an evaluation of the probable or potential effect of such proposal on the privacy and other personal or property rights of individuals or the disclosure of information relating to such individuals, and its effect on the preservation of the constitutional principles of federalism and separation of powers.
(d)
Medical records.
Medical records shall be disclosed to the individual to whom they pertain. SBA may, however, transmit such information to a medical doctor named by the requesting individual. In regard to medical

§ 103.1
Key definitions.
(a)
Agent
means an authorized representative, including an attorney, accountant, consultant, packager, lender service provider, or any other person representing an Applicant or Participant by conducting business with SBA.
(b) The term
conduct business with SBA
means:
(1) Preparing or submitting on behalf of an applicant an application for financial assistance of any kind, assistance from the Investment Division of SBA, or assistance in procurement and technical matters;
(2) Preparing or processing on behalf of a lender or a participant in any of SBA's programs an application for federal financial assistance;
(3) Participating with or communicating in any way with officers or employees of SBA on an applicant's, participant's, or lender's behalf;
(4) Acting as a lender service provider; and
(5) Such other activity as SBA reasonably shall determine.
(c)
Applicant
means any person, firm, concern, corporation, partnership, cooperative or other business enterprise applying for any type of assistance from SBA.
(d)
Lender Service Provider
means an Agent who carries out lender functions in originating, disbursing, servicing, or liquidating a specific SBA business loan or loan portfolio for compensation from the lender. SBA determines whether or not one is a “Lender Service Provider” on a loan-by-loan basis.
(e)
Packager
means an Agent who is employed and compensated by an Applicant or lender to prepare the Applicant's application for financial assistance from SBA. SBA determines whether or not one is a “Packager” on a loan-by-loan basis.
(f)
Referral Agent
means a person or entity who identifies and refers an Applicant to a lender or a lender to an Applicant. The Referral Agent may be employed and compensated by either an Applicant or a lender.
(g)
Participant
means a person or entity that is participating in any of the financial, investment, or business development programs authorized by the Small Business Act or Small Business Investment Act of 1958.
[61 FR 2681, Jan. 29, 1996, as amended at 85 FR 7647, Feb. 10, 2020; 85 FR 80587, Dec. 14, 2020]
§ 103.2
Who may conduct business with SBA?
(a) If you are an Applicant, a Participant, a partner of an Applicant or Participant partnership, or serve as an officer of an Applicant, Participant corporation, or limited liability company, you may conduct business with SBA without a representative.
(b) If you are an Agent, you may conduct business with SBA on behalf of an Applicant, Participant or lender, unless representation is otherwise prohibited by law or the regulations in this part or any other part in this chapter. For example, persons debarred under the SBA or Government-wide debarment regulations may not conduct business with SBA. SBA may request that any Agent supply written evidence of his or her authority to act on behalf of an Applicant, Participant, or lender as a condition of revealing any information about the Applicant's, Participant's, or lender's current or prior dealings with SBA.
§ 103.3
May SBA suspend or revoke an Agent's privilege?
The Administrator of SBA or designee may, for good cause, suspend or revoke the privilege of any Agent to conduct business with SBA. Part 134 of this chapter states the procedures for appealing the decision to suspend or revoke the privilege. The suspension or
revocation remains in effect during the pendency of any administrative proceedings under part 134 of this chapter.
§ 103.4
What is “good cause” for suspension or revocation?
Any unlawful or unethical activity is good cause for suspension or revocation of the privilege to conduct business. This includes:
(a) Attempting to influence any employee of SBA or a lender, by gifts, bribes or other unlawful or unethical activity, with respect to any matter involving SBA assistance.
(b) Soliciting for the provision of services to an Applicant by another entity when there is an undisclosed business relationship between the two parties.
(c) Violating ethical guidelines which govern the profession or business of the Agent or which are published at any time by SBA.
(d) Implying or stating that the work to be performed for an Applicant will include use of political or other special influence with SBA. Examples include indicating that the entity is affiliated with or paid, endorsed or employed by SBA, advertising using the words
Small Business Administration
or
SBA
in a manner that implies SBA's endorsement or sponsorship, use of SBA's seal or symbol, and giving a “guaranty” to an Applicant that the application will be approved.
(e) Charging or proposing to charge any fee that does not bear a necessary and reasonable relationship to the services actually rendered or expenses actually incurred in connection with a matter before SBA or which is materially inconsistent with the provisions of an applicable compensation agreement or Lender Service Provider agreement. A fee based solely on a percentage of a loan or guarantee amount can be reasonable, depending on the circumstances of a case and the services actually rendered.
(f) Engaging in any conduct indicating a lack of business integrity or business honesty, including debarment, criminal conviction, or civil judgment within the last seven years for fraud, embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, false statements, conspiracy, receiving stolen property, false claims, or obstruction of justice.
(g) Acting as both a Lender Service Provider or Referral Agent and a Packager for an Applicant on the same SBA business loan and receiving compensation for such activity from both the Applicant and lender. A limited exception to the “two master” prohibition in this paragraph (g) exists when an Agent acts as a Packager and is compensated by the Applicant for packaging services; also acts as a Referral Agent and is compensated by the lender for those activities; discloses the referral activities to the Applicant; and discloses the packaging activities to the lender.
(h) Violating materially the terms of any compensation agreement or Lender Service Provider agreement provided for in § 103.5.
(i) Violating or assisting in the violation of any SBA regulations, policies, or procedures of which the Applicant has been made aware.
[61 FR 2681, Jan. 29, 1996, as amended at 85 FR 7647, Feb. 10, 2020; 85 FR 80587, Dec. 14, 2020]
§ 103.5
How does SBA regulate an Agent's fees and provision of service?
(a) Any Applicant, Agent, or Packager must execute and provide to SBA a compensation agreement, and any Lender Service Provider must execute and provide to SBA a Lender Service Provider agreement. Each agreement governs the compensation charged for services rendered or to be rendered to the Applicant or lender in any matter involving SBA assistance. SBA provides the form of compensation agreement and a suggested form of Lender Service Provider agreement to be used by Agents.
(b) Compensation agreements must provide that in cases where SBA deems the compensation unreasonable, the Agent or Packager must: Reduce the charge to an amount SBA deems reasonable, refund any sum in excess of the amount SBA deems reasonable to the Applicant, and refrain from charging or collecting, directly or indirectly, from the Applicant an amount in excess of the amount SBA deems reasonable.
(c) Each Lender Service Provider must enter into a written agreement with each lender for whom it acts in that capacity. SBA will review all such agreements. Such agreements need not contain each and every provision found in the SBA's suggested form of agreement. However, each agreement must indicate that both parties agree not to engage in any sharing of secondary market premiums, that the services to be provided are accurately described, and that the agreement is otherwise consistent with SBA requirements. Subject to the prohibition on splitting premiums, lenders have reasonable discretion in setting compensation for Lender Service Providers. However, such compensation may not be directly charged to an Applicant or Borrower.

# Subpart C—Qualifying for an SBIC License

# Organizing an SBIC
§ 107.100
Organizing a Section 301(c) Licensee.
Section 301(c) Licensee means a company licensed under section 301(c) of the Act. It may be organized as a for-profit corporation or as a limited partnership created in accordance with the special rules of § 107.160.
§ 107.115
1940 Act and 1980 Act Companies.
A 1940 Act or 1980 Act Company is eligible to apply for an SBIC license, and an existing Licensee is eligible to apply for SBA's approval to convert to a 1940 Act or 1980 Act Company. In either case, the 1940 Act or 1980 Act Company may elect to be taxed as a regulated investment company under section 851 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (26 U.S.C. 851). However, a Licensee making such election may make Distributions only as permitted under the applicable sections of this part (see the definition of Retained Earnings Available for Distribution, § 107.585, and §§ 107.1540 through 107.1580).
§ 107.120
Special rules for a Section 301(d) Licensee owned by another Licensee.
With SBA's prior written approval, a Section 301(d) Licensee may operate as the subsidiary of one or more Licensees (participant Licensees), subject to the following:
(a) Each participant Licensee must own at least 20 percent of the voting securities of the Section 301(d) Licensee.
(b) A participant Licensee must treat its entire capital contribution to the subsidiary as a reduction of its Leverageable Capital. The participant Licensee's remaining Leverageable Capital must be sufficient to support its outstanding Leverage.
(c) A participant Licensee may not transfer its Leverage to a subsidiary Section 301(d) Licensee.
[63 FR 5865, Feb. 5, 1998]
§ 107.130
Requirement for qualified management.
When applying for a license, and while you have a license, you must show, to the satisfaction of SBA, that your current or proposed management team is qualified and has the knowledge, experience and capability necessary for investing in the types of businesses contemplated by the Act, the regulations in this part 107, and your business plan. You must designate at least one individual as the official responsible for contact with SBA.
[61 FR 3189, Jan. 31, 1996, as amended at 77 FR 25051, Apr. 27, 2012]
§ 107.140
SBA approval of initial Management Expenses.
If you plan to obtain Leverage, you must have your Management Expenses approved by SBA at the time of licensing. (See § 107.520 for the definition of Management Expenses.)
§ 107.150
Management-ownership diversification requirement.
(a)
Diversification requirement.
(Also referenced in this part as the “diversity requirement.”) You must satisfy the requirements in paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of this section:
(1) In order to obtain an SBIC license (unless you do not plan to obtain Leverage),
(2) If at the time you were licensed you did not plan to obtain Leverage, but you now wish to be eligible for Leverage, or
(3) If SBA so requires as a condition of approval of your transfer of Control under § 107.440.
(b)
Percentage ownership requirement.
(1)
General rule.
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, no Person or group of Persons who are Affiliates of one another may own, directly or indirectly, more than 70 percent of your Regulatory Capital or your Leverageable Capital.
(2)
Exception.
An investor that is a traditional investment company, as determined by SBA, may own and control more than 70 percent of your Regulatory Capital and your Leverageable Capital. For purposes of this section, a traditional investment company must be a non-profit entity, or a professionally managed firm organized exclusively to pool capital from more than one source for the purpose of investing in businesses that are expected to generate substantial returns to the firm's investors. In determining whether a firm is a traditional investment company for purposes of this section, SBA will also consider:
(i) The degree to which the managers of the firm are unrelated to and unaffiliated with the investors in the firm or non-profit entity.
(ii) Whether the managers of the firm are authorized and motivated to make investments that, in their independent judgment, are likely to produce significant returns to all investors in the firm or non-profit entity.
(iii) Whether the firm or non-profit entity serving as the management company of a for-profit SBIC benefits from the use of the SBIC through the financial performance of the SBIC.
(iv) Other related factors.
(c)
Non-affiliation requirement
—(1)
General rule.
At least 30 percent of your Regulatory Capital and Leverageable Capital must be owned and controlled by three Persons unaffiliated with your management and unaffiliated with each other, and whose investments are significant in dollar and percentage terms as determined by SBA. Such Persons must not be your Associates (except for their status as your shareholders, limited partners, or members). A single “acceptable” Institutional Investor may be substituted for two or three of the three Persons who are otherwise required under this paragraph. The following Institutional Investors are “acceptable” for this purpose:
(i) Entities whose overall activities are regulated and periodically examined by state, Federal or other governmental authorities satisfactory to SBA;
(ii) Entities listed on the New York Stock Exchange;
(iii) Entities that are publicly-traded and that meet both the minimum numerical listing standards and the corporate governance listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange;
(iv) Public or private employee pension funds;
(v) Trusts, foundations, or endowments, but only if exempt from Federal income taxation; and
(vi) Other Institutional Investors satisfactory to SBA.
(2)
Look-through for Traditional Investment Company investors.
SBA, in its sole discretion, may consider the requirement in paragraph (c)(1) of this section to be satisfied if at least 30 percent of your Regulatory Capital and Leverageable Capital is owned and controlled indirectly, through a Traditional Investment Company, by Persons unaffiliated with your management.
(d)
Voting requirement.
(1) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the investors required for you to satisfy diversity may not delegate their voting rights to any Person who is your Associate, or who Controls, is Controlled by, or is under Common Control with any of your Associates, without prior SBA approval.
(2)
Exception.
Paragraph (d)(1) of this section does not apply to investors in publicly-traded Licensees, to proxies given to vote in accordance with specific instructions for single specified meetings, or to any delegation of voting rights to a Person who is neither a diversity investor in the Licensee nor affiliated with management of the Licensee.
(e)
Requirement to maintain diversity.
If you were required to have management-ownership diversity at any time, you must maintain such diversity while you have outstanding Leverage or Earmarked Assets. To maintain management-ownership diversity, you may continue to satisfy the diversity requirement as in effect at the time it was first applicable to you or you may satisfy the management-ownership diversity requirement as currently in effect. If, at any time, you no longer have the required management-ownership diversity, you must:
(1) Notify SBA within 10 days; and
(2) Re-establish diversity within six months. For the consequences of failure to re-establish diversity, see §§ 107.1810(g) and 107.1820(f).

§ 107.160
Special rules for Licensees formed as limited partnerships.
A limited partnership organized under State law solely for the purpose of performing the functions and conducting the activities contemplated under the Act may apply for a license under section 301(c) or section 301 (d) of the Act (“Partnership Licensee”).
(a)
Number of Licensee's General Partners.
If you are a Partnership Licensee, you must have as your general partner(s) at least two individuals, or at least one corporation, partnership, or limited liability company (LLC), or any combination of individuals, corporations, partnerships, or LLCs.
(b)
Entity General Partner of Licensee.
A general partner which is a corporation, limited liability company or partnership (an “Entity General Partner”) shall be organized under state law solely for the purpose of serving as the general partner of one or more Licensees.
(1) SBA must approve any person who will serve as an officer, director, manager, or general partner of the Entity General Partner. This provision must be stated in an Entity General Partner's Certificate of Incorporation, member agreement, Limited Partnership Agreement or other similar governing instrument which must, in each case, accompany the license application.
(2) An Entity General Partner is subject to the same examination and reporting requirements as a Licensee under section 310(b) of the Act. The restrictions and obligations imposed upon a Licensee by §§ 107.1800 through 107.1820, and 107.30, 107.410 through 107.450, 107.470, 107.475, 107.500, 107.510, 107.585, 107.600, 107.680, 107.690 through 107.692, 107.865, and 107.1910 apply also to an Entity General Partner of a Licensee.
(3) The general partner(s) of your Entity General Partner(s) will be considered your general partner.
(4) If your Entity General Partner is a limited partnership, its limited partners may be considered your Control Person(s) if they meet the definition for Control Person in § 107.50.
(5) If your Entity General Partner is a limited partnership, it is subject to paragraph (a) of this section.
(c)
Other requirements for Partnership Licensees.
If you are a Partnership Licensee:
(1) You must have a minimum duration of ten years or two years following the maturity of your last-maturing Leverage security, whichever is longer. After 10 years, if all Leverage has been repaid or redeemed and all amounts due SBA, its agent, or Trustee have been paid, the Partnership Licensee may be terminated by a vote of your partners. (For purposes of this provision SBA is not considered a partner.);
(2) None of your general partner(s) may be removed or replaced by your limited partners without prior written approval of SBA;
(3) Any transferee of, or successor in interest to, your general partner shall have only the rights and liabilities of a limited partner pending SBA's written approval of such transfer or succession; and
(4) You must incorporate all the provisions in this paragraph (c) in your Limited Partnership Agreement.
(d)
Obligations of a Control Person.
All Control Persons are bound by the disciplinary provisions of sections 313 and 314 of the Act and by the conflict-of-interest rules under section 312 of the Act. The term Licensee, as used in §§ 107.30, 107.460, and 107.680 includes all of the Licensee's Control Persons. The term Licensee as used in § 107.670 includes only the Licensee's general partner(s). The conditions specified in §§ 107.1800 through 107.1820 and § 107.1910 apply to all general partners.
(e)
Liability of general partner for partnership debts to SBA.
Subject to section 314 of the Act, your general partner is not liable solely by reason of its status as a general partner for repayment of any Leverage or debts you owe to SBA unless SBA, in the exercise of reasonable investment prudence, and with regard to your financial soundness, determines otherwise prior to the purchase or guaranty of your Leverage.
(f)
Reorganization of Licensee.
A corporate Licensee wishing to reorganize as a Partnership Licensee, or a Partnership Licensee wishing to reorganize as a Corporate Licensee, may apply to SBA for approval under § 107.470.
(g)
Special Leverage requirement.
Before your first issuance of Leverage, you must furnish SBA with evidence that you qualify as a partnership for tax purposes, either by a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service, or by an opinion of counsel.

§ 107.230
Permitted sources of Private Capital for Licensees.
Private Capital means the contributed capital of a Licensee, plus unfunded binding commitments by Institutional Investors (including commitments evidenced by a promissory note) to contribute capital to a Licensee.
(a)
Contributed capital.
For purposes of this section, contributed capital means the paid-in capital and paid-in surplus of a Corporate Licensee, or the partners' contributed capital of a Partnership Licensee, in either case subject to the limitations in paragraph (b) of this section.
(b)
Exclusions from Private Capital.
Private Capital does not include:
(1) Funds borrowed by a Licensee from any source.
(2) Funds obtained through the issuance of Leverage.
(3) Funds obtained directly or indirectly from any Federal, State, or local government agency or instrumentality, except for:
(i) Funds invested by a public pension fund;
(ii) Funds obtained from the business revenues (excluding any governmental appropriation) of any federally chartered or government-sponsored corporation established before October 1, 1987, to the extent that such revenues are reflected in the retained earnings of the corporation; and

Qualified Non-private Funds.
Private Capital includes “Qualified Non-private Funds” as defined in this paragraph (d); however, investors of Qualified Non-private Funds must not control, directly or indirectly, a Licensee's management, or its board of directors or general partner(s). Qualified Non-private Funds are:
(1) Funds directly or indirectly invested in any Licensee on or before August 16, 1982 by any Federal agency except SBA, under a statute explicitly mandating the inclusion of such funds in “Private Capital”;
(2) Funds directly or indirectly invested in any Licensee by any Federal agency under a statute that is enacted after September 4, 1992, explicitly mandating the inclusion of such funds in “Private Capital”;
(3) Funds invested in any Licensee or license applicant by one or more State or local government entities (including any guarantee extended by such entities) in an aggregate amount that does not exceed 33 percent of Regulatory Capital; and
(4) Funds invested in or committed in writing to any Section 301(d) Licensee prior to October 1, 1996, from the following sources:
(i) A State financing agency, or similar agency or instrumentality, if the funds invested are derived from such agency's net income and not from appropriated State or local funds; and
(ii) Grants made by a state or local government agency or instrumentality into a nonprofit corporation or institution exercising discretionary authority with respect to such funds, if SBA determines that such funds have taken
on a private character and the nonprofit corporation or institution is not a mere conduit.
(e)
Borrowed funds exclusion.
You may not accept any capital contribution made with funds borrowed by a Person seeking to own an equity interest (whether direct or indirect, beneficial or of record) of at least 10 percent of your Private Capital. This exclusion does not apply if:
(1) Such Person's net worth is at least twice the amount borrowed; or
(2) SBA gives its prior written approval of the capital contribution.
(f)
Public sector contributions.
The Act limits the extent to which funds invested directly or indirectly by local, State or Federal Government entities are eligible to qualify as Leverageable Capital. However, SBICs are not restricted from accepting funds invested directly or indirectly from local, State or Federal Government entities. The funds contributed by such entities may be included in an SBIC applicant's proposed formula to calculate management fees.
[61 FR 3189, Jan. 31, 1996, as amended at 63 FR 5866, Feb. 5, 1998; 64 FR 70995, Dec. 20, 1999; 89 FR 3547, Jan. 19, 2024]

(e) Other non-cash assets approved by SBA.
§ 107.250
Exclusion of stock options issued by Licensee from Management Expenses.
Stock options issued by any Licensee, including a 1940 or 1980 Act Company, are not considered compensation and therefore do not count as part of a Licensee's Management Expenses.

# Applying for an SBIC License
§ 107.300
License application form and fee.
SBA evaluates license applicants, giving first priority to applicants headquartered in Underlicensed States with below median SBIC Financing dollars per State, as determined by SBA and published periodically in a notice on the SBIC website. Once priority is established, such applicants will continue to receive priority throughout the licensing process. SBA reviews and processes applications in two review phases (initial review and final licensing), as follows:
(a)
Initial review.
Except as provided in this paragraph (a), SBIC applicants must submit a Management Assessment Questionnaire (“MAQ”) c and the Initial Licensing Fee, as defined in paragraph (c) of this section. An applicant under Common Control with one or more Licensees must submit a written request to SBA, and the Initial Licensing Fee, to be considered for a license and is exempt from the requirement in this paragraph (a) to submit a MAQ, unless otherwise determined by SBA in SBA's discretion. Eligible “Expedited Subsequent Funds” as described in § 107.305(e) are permitted to submit a streamlined “Short-Form” Subsequent Fund MAQ.
(b)
Final licensing.
An applicant may proceed to the final licensing phase only if notified in writing by SBA that it may do so. Following receipt of such notice, in order to proceed to the final licensing phase, the applicant must submit a complete license application with all required appendices, within the timeframe identified by SBA and the Final Licensing Fee, as defined in paragraph (c) of this section. If you are seeking to be licensed as a Leveraged Licensee and SBA approves your License, SBA will also approve your
Total Intended Leverage Commitment amount and ratio as defined in § 107.50 based on the target fund size stated in the MAQ, which means the total Leverage commitments available to you for the life of your SBIC, subject to the provisions of §§ 107.320 and 107.1150. A Licensee is permitted to hold multiple fund closings within and for up to 12 months of receiving a License to reach the target fund size. SBA will then determine the final Total Intended Leverage Commitment which is either the dollar amount or ratio to targeted Private Capital provided at the Green Light. SBA will determine the Total Private Capital Commitment (defined as the total Private Capital committed to a Licensee within 12 months after licensure or upon the Licensee's final closing, whichever occurs first) amount for the Accrual Debenture SBA Share calculation.
(c)
Licensing Fees.
SBIC Initial and Final Licensing Fees are non-refundable fees determined as set forth in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section.
(1)
Initial Licensing Fee.
The Initial Licensing Fee is based on the applicant's fund sequence, where the fund sequence means the order of succession of private equity or private credit funds for the same fund management team and same strategy. SBA will determine the applicant's fund sequence based on the management team's composition and experience as a team. The Initial Licensing Fees are as follows:
Table 1 to Paragraph (
c
)(1)
Fund sequence
Initial licensing fee
Fund I
$5,000
Fund II
10,000
Fund III
15,000
Fund IV+
20,000
Example 1 to paragraph (c)(1):
If the management team members of applicant DEF I consists primarily of the same team members of fund ABC II and ABC II represented the second fund for those team members, SBA will consider the fund sequence of DEF I as a Fund III, regardless of the number in the applicant's name.
(2)
Final Licensing Fee.
The Final Licensing Fee is calculated as the Final Licensing Base Fee plus 1.25 basis points multiplied by the Leverage dollar amount requested by the applicant, where the Final Licensing Base Fee is based on the applicant's Fund Sequence as follows:
Table 2 to Paragraph (
c
)(2)
Fund sequence
Final licensing base fee
Fund I
$10,000
Fund II
15,000
Fund III
25,000
Fund IV+
30,000
(3)
Resubmission Penalty Fee.
The Resubmission Penalty Fee means a $10,000 penalty fee assessed to an applicant that has previously withdrawn or is otherwise not approved for a license that must be paid
in addition
to the Initial and Final Licensing Fees at the time the applicant resubmits its application.
(4)
Inflation Adjustments.
SBA annually adjusts the Initial Licensing Fee, Final Licensing Base Fee, and Resubmission Penalty Fee using the Inflation Adjustment and will publish notification prior to such adjustment in the
Federal Register
identifying the amount of the fees.
[88 FR 46007, July 18, 2023]
§ 107.305
Evaluation of license applicants.
SBA will evaluate a license applicant based on the submitted application materials, any interviews with the applicant's management team, and the results of background investigations, public record searches, and other due diligence conducted by SBA and other Federal agencies. SBA's evaluation will consider factors including the following:
(a)
Management qualifications.
Management qualifications, including demonstrated investment skills and experience as a principal investor, or a combination of investment skill and relevant industry operational experience; business reputation; adherence to legal and ethical standards; record of active involvement in making and monitoring investments and assisting portfolio companies; managing a regulated business, if applicable; successful history of working as a team; and experience in developing appropriate processes for
evaluating investments and implementing best practices for investment firms.
(b)
Demonstrated investment acumen.
Performance of proposed investment team's prior relevant industry investments as well as any supporting operating experience, including investment returns measured both in percentage terms and in comparison to appropriate industry benchmarks; the extent to which investments have been realized as a result of sales, repayments, or other exit mechanisms; evidence of previous investment or operational experience contributing to U.S. domestic job creation and, when applicable, demonstrated past adherence to statutory and regulatory SBIC program requirements. While a track record is required to apply for an SBIC license, a “certified” track record is not required.
(c)
Strategy and fit.
Applicant's proposed investment strategy as presented in its business plan, including adherence to the Statement of Policy as stated in section 102 of the Act, clarity of objectives; strength of management's rationale for pursuing the selected strategy; compliance with this part and applicable provisions of part 121 of this chapter; fit with management's skills and experience; and the availability of sufficient resources to carry out the proposed strategy. As determined by SBA, a Licensee may not materially deviate from the proposed investment strategy after three years of Licensure.
(d)
Structure and economics.
Applicant's proposed organizational structure and fund economics, including compliance with this part 107; soundness of financial projections and underlying assumptions; a compensation plan that provides managers with appropriate economic incentives; a reasonable basis for allocations of profits and fees to Persons not involved in management; and governance procedures that provide appropriate checks and balances.
(e)
Subsequent fund applicants.
(1) Applicants operating an active Licensee that meet the following eligibility criteria can apply under an “Expediated Subsequent Fund” evaluation process. Should an applicant fulfill and formally attest to meeting all of the following eligibility criteria, the applicant can apply for an “Expediated Subsequent Fund” evaluation process:
(i)
Consistent strategy and fund size.
Targeted Regulatory Capital to be raised is ≤133% the size of their most recent SBIC fund (inflation adjustments will be considered). Same asset class and investment strategy as most recent license.
(ii)
Clean regulatory history.
No major findings, significant “other matters,” or unresolved “other matters” related to licensees managed by the principals of applicant in the previous ten years.
(iii)
Consistent limited partnership (LP)-general partnership (GP) dynamics.
No new limited partner will represent ≥33 percent of the Private Capital of the licensee upon reaching final close at target fund size or hard cap. SBA would expect to see that a meaningful proportion of a prior SBIC fund's institutional investor base would return to support an anticipated subsequent SBIC fund. The most recent limited partnership agreement (LPA) of the active Licensee and all side letters will have no substantive changes for the applicant fund.
(iv)
Investment performance stability.
The most recent licensee net distributions to paid-in capital (DPI) and net total value to paid-in capital (TVPI) TVPI are at or above median vintage year and strategy performance benchmarks for the prior three quarters. The principals of the applicant are not managing a licensee in default or with high Capital Impairment (CIP).
(v)
Consistent or reduced leverage management.
The applicant is requesting a leverage to Private Capital ratio ≤ the current or most recent SBIC licensee at target fund size or hard cap.

# Borrowing by Licensees From Non-SBA Sources
§ 107.550
Prior approval of secured third-party debt of Leveraged Licensees.
(a)
Definition.
In this section,
secured third-party debt
means any non-SBA debt secured by any of your assets, including secured guarantees and other contingent obligations that you voluntarily assume, and secured lines of credit.
(b)
General rule.
If you are a Leveraged Licensee, you must get SBA's written approval before you incur any secured third-party debt or refinance any debt with secured third-party debt, including any renewal of a secured line of credit, increase in the maximum amount available under a secured line of credit, or expansion of the scope of a security interest or lien. For purposes of this paragraph (b), “expansion of the scope of a security interest or lien” does not include the substitution of one asset or group of assets for another, provided the asset values (as reported on your most recent annual Form 468) are comparable.
(c)
Capital Call Line.
Without obtaining SBA's written approval, a Leveraged Licensee may obtain from a federally regulated financial institution, a line of credit (“Capital Call Line”) that meets all of the following conditions:
(1) The maximum amount available under the Capital Call Line is no more than your unfunded Regulatory Capital, as reflected on your most recent Capital Certificate;
(2) Your payment obligations under the Capital Call Line may be secured, but only by your unfunded Regulatory Capital;
(3) The lender under the Capital Call Line may have a right to debit your depository account(s) at the lender's institution, so long as such lender's right to debit is limited to circumstances involving a default of your obligation to pay principal, interest, or fees due (“Payment Default”) under the Capital Call Line and only to the amount of such Payment Default;
(4) Each borrowing under the Capital Call Line must be repaid, in full, within 120 days after it is drawn;
(5) The term of the Capital Call Line may not exceed 12 months, but may be renewable, provided that each renewal does not exceed 12 months and you remain in compliance with the conditions of this paragraph (c); and
(6) Consistent with § 107.410, the Capital Call Line contains no provision permitting the lender to dictate when capital calls are made or otherwise ceding to the lender any control of the Licensee or its operations; provided, however, that the Capital Call Line may include a provision authorizing the lender, in the event of a Payment Default, to endorse, on your behalf, checks and other forms of payment in the Lender's possession and to apply the proceeds of such instruments to such Payment Default, with unapplied and remaining proceeds promptly to be paid to you.
(d)
Conditions for SBA approval.
Excluding Capital Call Lines defined in paragraph (c) of this section, SBA approval is required for secured third-party debt. As a condition of granting such approval under this section, SBA may impose such restrictions or limitations as it deems appropriate, taking into account your historical performance, current financial position, proposed terms of the secured debt and amount of aggregate debt you will have outstanding (including Leverage). SBA will not favorably consider any requests for approval which include a blanket lien on all your assets, or a security interest in your investor commitments in excess of 125 percent of the proposed borrowing.
[88 FR 46009, July 18, 2023]
§ 107.560
Subordination of SBA's creditor position.
(a)
Debentures purchased or guaranteed on or before July 1, 1991.
Under the terms of any Debenture purchased or guaranteed by SBA on or before July 1, 1991, SBA's unsecured claims against you, as a Debenture-holder or as subrogee, are subordinated in favor of all your other creditors, except to the extent that such claims may be subject to equitable subordination in SBA's favor.
(b)
Debentures purchased or guaranteed after July 1, 1991, including refinancings of Debentures previously purchased or
guaranteed.
(1) Under the terms of any Debenture purchased or guaranteed by SBA after July 1, 1991, SBA's unsecured claims against you, as a Debenture-holder or as subrogee, are subordinated only in favor of non-Associate lenders; and, to the extent that your indebtedness to such lenders exceeds the lesser of $10,000,000 or 200 percent of your Regulatory Capital (determined as of the date your Debentures were purchased or guaranteed), SBA's unsecured claims enjoy parity with those of other unsecured creditors, except with respect to indebtedness created on or before July 1, 1991.
(2) In order to induce others to lend you money after your Debenture has been purchased or guaranteed, SBA may agree in writing on a case-by-case basis to subordinate its unsecured claims, on such terms as it may determine, in favor of one or more of your Associates, or in favor of other lenders in excess of the amounts mentioned in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(3) SBA reserves the authority to refuse to subordinate its claims if it determines, at the time you request your Debenture be purchased or guaranteed, that the exercise of reasonable investment prudence and your financial condition warrant such refusal.
§ 107.565
Restrictions on third-party debt of Early Stage SBICs.
If you are an Early Stage SBIC and you have outstanding Leverage or a Leverage commitment, you must get SBA's prior written approval to have, incur, or refinance any third-party debt other than accounts payable from routine business operations.

[Reserved]

# Distributions and Reductions in Regulatory Capital
§ 107.585
Distributions and reductions in Regulatory Capital.
(a)
Non-leveraged Licensees.
If you are a Non-leveraged Licensee, you may make distributions to your private investors without SBA prior approval. At all times, you must retain sufficient Regulatory Capital to meet the minimum capital requirements in the Act and in § 107.210, unless such amounts are in accordance with your SBA approved Wind-down Plan (see § 107.590). You must report any reductions of Regulatory Capital to SBA within 30 days via an updated Capital Certificate (see § 107.300).
(b)
Non-Accrual Leveraged Licensees.
If you are a Standard Debenture Leveraged Licensee that is also an Early Stage SBIC, you are subject to the distributions identified in § 107.1180. If you are a Standard Debenture Leveraged Licensee, you may distribute READ to your private investors without SBA approval only after considering any material adverse changes to your portfolio. You must obtain SBA's prior written approval to reduce your Regulatory Capital by more than two percent in any fiscal year. In seeking SBA's prior written approval, you must disclose any material adverse changes or certify that you have no material adverse changes and provide an updated Wind-down Plan. You must retain sufficient Regulatory Capital to meet the minimum capital requirements of § 107.210 and sufficient Leverageable Capital to avoid having excess Leverage in violation of section 303 of the Act and § 107.1150. You must report any reductions of Regulatory Capital to SBA within 30 days via an updated Capital Certificate (see § 107.300).
(c)
Accrual SBICs and Reinvestor SBICs.
If you are an Accrual SBIC or Reinvestor SBIC, unless you receive prior written approval from SBA to make a distribution solely to cover tax liabilities, you may only distribute as follows:
(1)
Payment of Annual Charges and accrued interest.
Prior to any non-tax distribution, you must pay any Annual Charges owed to SBA and all accrued interest on your outstanding Leverage.
(2)
Calculate SBA's share of distribution.
Prior to any non-tax distribution, you must make payments to SBA on a pro rata basis with any distributions based on your SBA Total Intended Leverage Commitment relative to your Total Private Capital Commitments, inclusive of Qualified Non-Private Funds, determined within 12 months of Licensure calculated as follows: SBA's Share = Total Distributions × [Total
Intended Leverage Commitment/(Total Intended Leverage Commitment + Total Private Capital Commitments)] where:
(i) Total Distributions means any prior tax distributions plus the total amount of distributions, whether profit or return of capital, you intend to make after paying all accrued interest and Annual Charges;
(ii) Total Intended Leverage Commitment is as defined in § 107.300.
(iii) Total Private Capital Commitments is as defined in § 107.300.
(3)
Apply SBA Share.
You must repay SBA outstanding Leverage in an amount no less than SBA's Share to the extent of Outstanding Leverage and report the SBA calculation to SBA. If SBA's Share is greater than Outstanding Leverage and you have unfunded Leverage commitments, you must submit a Leverage commitment cancellation equal to SBA's Share minus the SBA Leverage redemption up to the unfunded Leverage commitments.
(4)
Distribute to private investors.
You must report SBA's Share calculation to SBA prior to distributing READ to your private investors without SBA approval and only after considering any adverse changes to your portfolio. You must pay Annual Charges to SBA prior to distributing READ. After repaying all accrued interest, Annual Charges, and outstanding Leverage calculated as SBA's Share, you may distribute READ to your private investors without SBA approval only after considering any adverse changes to your portfolio. You must obtain SBA's prior written approval to reduce your Regulatory Capital by more than two percent in any fiscal year. In seeking SBA's prior written approval, you must disclose any material adverse changes or certify that you have no material adverse changes and provide an updated Wind-down Plan. You must retain sufficient Regulatory Capital to meet the minimum capital requirements of § 107.210 and sufficient Leverageable Capital to avoid having excess Leverage in violation of section 303 of the Act and § 107.1150. You must report any reductions of Regulatory Capital to SBA within 30 days. Prior to any reduction in Regulatory Capital, if you have made a tax distribution, you must make a distribution to SBA pursuant to the formula set forth in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, as if you had made a non-tax distribution.
(5)
Report distribution to SBA.
You must report to SBA the distribution, the calculations, and the amounts distributed to each party as part of your annual and quarterly Form 468 (see §§ 107.630 and 107.1220).
Example 1 to paragraph (c):
Your Total Intended Leverage Commitment is $50 million, and your Total Private Capital Commitments are $25 million. You currently have $25 million in Outstanding Leverage, $25 million in unfunded Leverage commitments, and $15 million in Leverageable Capital. You owe $1 million in accrued interest and Annual Charges. You have $61 million to distribute.
Step 1:
Payment of Annual Charges and all accrued interest. You would first pay the $1 million in accrued interest and Annual Charges.
Step 2:
Calculate SBA's Share of Distribution. SBA's share is calculated as: $60 million × [$50 million/($50 million + $25 million)] = $40 million.
Step 3:
Apply SBA Share. You would repay $25 million in Outstanding Leverage and cancel $15 million of your unfunded Leverage commitments.
Step 4:
Distribute to Private Investors. You would distribute $35 million to Private Investors.
Step 5:
Report Distribution to SBA. You would then report the distribution to SBA, detailing the amounts and calculations from steps 1 through 4 of this example 1.

# Requirement To Conduct Active Investment Operations
§ 107.590
Licensee's requirement to maintain active operations.
(a)
Activity test.
You must conduct active operations, as determined under this § 107.590, as a condition of your license. You will be considered active if:

(2) Your idle funds did not exceed 20 percent of your total assets (at cost) at your most recent fiscal year end.
(b)
Permitted exceptions to activity requirements.
You are considered active if
your failure to meet the requirements in paragraph (a) of this section is the result of one or more of the following factors:
(1) Your excess idle funds are the result of the receipt, within the previous nine months, of realized gains, repayments, additional capital contributions, or Leverage.
(2) It is necessary for you to maintain excess idle funds to conduct your operations because:
(i) Your unfunded commitments from investors are no more than 20 percent of your Regulatory Capital; and
(ii) You cannot receive additional Leverage, solely because SBA has insufficient funds available.
(3) You have not made sufficient Financings because of a lack of available funds, evidenced by Loans and Investments (at cost) equal to at least 90 percent of your Combined Capital as of your most recent fiscal year end.
(4) You have not made sufficient Financings solely because SBA has restricted your ability to make investments.
(c)
Applicability of activity requirements.
The activity requirements in paragraph (a) of this section do not apply if you have filed a Wind-down Plan approved by SBA. Wind-down Plan means a plan that you prepare when you decide that you will no longer make any Financings other than follow-on investments, and that you update annually when you file your SBA Form 468. The plan must contain your best estimates of the following:
(1) The remaining number of years you expect to operate.
(2) For each of your Loans and Investments, the expected liquidation date and anticipated proceeds.
(3) The timing of your repayment of obligations to SBA.

# Subpart G—Financing of Small Businesses by Licensees

# Determining the Eligibility of a Small Business for SBIC Financing
§ 107.700
Compliance with size standards in part 121 of this chapter as a condition of Assistance.
You are permitted to provide financial assistance and management services only to a Small Business. To determine whether an applicant is a Small Business, you may use either the financial size standards in § 121.301(c)(2) of this chapter or the industry standard covering the industry in which the applicant is primarily engaged, as set forth in § 121.301(c)(1) of this chapter.

§ 107.710
Requirement to finance smaller enterprises.
Your Portfolio must include Financings to Smaller Enterprises.
(a)
Definition of Smaller Enterprise.
A Smaller Enterprise means any small business concern that:

(2) Together with its affiliates has a net worth of not more than $6 million and average net income after Federal income taxes (excluding any carry-over losses) for the preceding two years no greater than $2 million. If the applicant is not required by law to pay Federal income taxes at the enterprise level, but is required to pass income through to its shareholders, partners, beneficiaries, or other equitable owners, the applicant's “net income after Federal income taxes” will be its net income reduced by an amount computed as follows:
(i) If the applicant is not required by law to pay State (and local, if any) income taxes at the enterprise level, multiply its net income by the marginal State income tax rate (or by the combined State and local income tax rates, as applicable) that would have applied if it were a taxable corporation.
(ii) Multiply the applicant's net income, less any deduction for State and local income taxes calculated under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, by the marginal Federal income tax rate that would have applied if the applicant were a taxable corporation.
(iii) Add the results obtained in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (a)(2)(ii) of this section.
(b)
Smaller Enterprise Financings.
At the close or each of your fiscal years, and at the time of any application to draw Leverage, you must satisfy the Smaller Enterprise financing requirement in this paragraph (b) that applies to you.

In addition, 100 percent of all Financings made in whole or in part with Leverage in excess of $90 million (including aggregate Leverage over $90 million issued by two or more Licensees under Common Control) must have been invested in Smaller Enterprises.
(3) If you were licensed on or before February 17, 2009, and you have received an SBA Leverage commitment after February 17, 2009:
(i) For all Financings made after the date of the first Leverage commitment issued after February 17, 2009, at least 25 percent (in dollars) of your Financings must have been invested in Smaller Enterprises, and
(ii) For all Financings made before February 17, 2009, at least 20 percent (in dollars) of your Financings, excluding Financings made in whole or in part with Leverage in excess of $90 million, must have been invested in Smaller Enterprises. In addition, 100 percent of all Financings made in whole or in part with Leverage in excess of $90 million (including aggregate Leverage over $90 million issued by two or more Licensees under Common Control) must have been invested in Smaller Enterprises.
(c)
Special requirement for certain leveraged Licensees.
(1) This paragraph (c) applies if you were licensed on or before September 30, 1996, and you issued Leverage after that date, and you have Regulatory Capital of:
(i) Less than $10,000,000 if such Leverage included Participating Securities; or
(ii) Less than $5,000,000 if such Leverage was Debentures only.
(2) At the close of each of your fiscal years, at least 50 percent of the total dollar amount of the Financings you extended after September 30, 1996 must have been invested in Smaller Enterprises.
(d) Financing a change of ownership which results in the creation of a Smaller Enterprises. The Financing of a change of ownership under § 107.750 which results in the creation of a Smaller Enterprise qualifies as a Smaller Enterprise Financing.
(e)
Non-compliance with this section.
If you have not reached the required percentage of Smaller Enterprise Financings at the end of any fiscal year, then you must be in compliance by the end of the following fiscal year. However, you will not be eligible for additional Leverage until you reach
the required percentage (
see
§ 107.1120(c) and (g)).

means a Section 301(c) Partnership licensed as a Reinvestor SBIC under § 107.300 and approved by SBA at the time of licensing to issue Accrual Debentures and shall provide a meaningful percentage of Equity Capital Investments to underserved Small Business reinvestors (except banks, savings and loans not insured by agencies of the Federal Government, and agricultural credit companies) that make direct financings solely to Small Businesses with at least 50% of employees in the United States, Small Businesses Concerns headquartered in the United States, owned and controlled by United States citizens and/or entities, and Small Businesses eligible for investment based on SBA size standards defined in § 121.301 of this chapter or SBIC alternative size standards defined in § 121.301(c) of this chapter at the time of initial investment. SBA may require that each Reinvestor SBIC obtain from each such Small Business reinvestor a written agreement that such Small Business reinvestor has only provided and will only provide financing in compliance with this paragraph (a)(2)(i) and will provide to such Reinvestor SBIC information reasonably necessary to verify compliance with this paragraph (a)(2)(i). A Reinvestor SBIC may make Equity Capital Investments to Disadvantaged Businesses that are relenders or reinvestors, including Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) and Minority Deposit Institutions (MDIs), and any such investments in CDFIs or MDIs pursuant to this section are not subject to the requirement that such CDFIs or MDIs make direct financings solely to Small Businesses. In addition to Equity Capital Investments, Reinvestor SBIC Licensees may provide long-term debt or loan financing to CDFIs and MDIs.
(ii)
Equity Capital Investments to Disadvantaged Businesses.
Licensees may provide Equity Capital Investments to Disadvantaged Businesses that are relenders or reinvestors (except banks or savings and loans not insured by agencies of the Federal Government, and agricultural credit companies).
(b)
Passive Businesses.
You are not permitted to finance a passive business.
(1)
Definition.
A business is passive if:
(i) It is not engaged in a regular and continuous business operation (for purposes of this paragraph (b), the mere receipt of payments such as dividends, rents, lease payments, or royalties is not considered a regular and continuous business operation); or
(ii) Its employees are not carrying on the majority of day to day operations, and the company does not provide effective control and supervision, on a day to day basis, over persons employed under contract; or
(iii) It passes through substantially all of the proceeds of the Financing to another entity.
(2)
Exception for pass-through of proceeds to subsidiary.
You may provide Financing directly to passive businesses, including passive businesses that you have formed, if it is a Small Business and it passes substantially all the proceeds through to (or uses substantially all the proceeds to acquire) one or more subsidiary companies, each of which is an eligible Small Business that is not passive. For the purpose of this paragraph (b)(2), “subsidiary company” means a company in which the financed passive business either:
(i) Directly owns, or will own as a result of the Financing, at least 50 percent of the outstanding voting securities; or
(ii) Indirectly owns, or will own as a result of the Financing, at least 50 percent of the outstanding voting securities (by directly owning the outstanding voting securities of another passive Small Business that is the direct owner of the outstanding voting securities of the subsidiary company).
(3)
Exception for certain Partnership Licensees.
If you are a Partnership Licensee, you may form one or more blocker entities in accordance with this paragraph (b)(3). For the purposes of this paragraph, a “blocker entity” means a corporation or a limited liability company that elects to be taxed as a corporation for Federal income tax purposes. The sole purpose of a blocker entity must be to provide Financing to one or more eligible, unincorporated Small Businesses. You may form such blocker entities only if a direct Financing to such Small Businesses would cause any of your investors to incur “unrelated business taxable income” under section 511 of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 511) or to incur “effectively connected income” to foreign investors under sections 871 and 882 of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 871 and 882) or (for an investor that has elected to be taxed as a regulated investment company) receive or be deemed to receive gross income that does not qualify under section 851(b)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 851(b)(2)). Your ownership and investment of funds in such blocker entities will not constitute a violation of § 107.730(a). For each passive business financed under this section 107.720(b)(3), you must provide a certification to SBA as required under § 107.610(g). A blocker entity formed under this paragraph may provide Financing:
(i) Directly to one or more eligible non-passive Small Businesses; or
(ii) Directly to a passive Small Business that passes substantially all the proceeds directly to (or uses substantially all the proceeds to acquire) one or more eligible non-passive Small Businesses in which the passive Small Business directly owns, or will own as a result of the Financing, at least 50% of the outstanding voting securities.
(4)
Additional conditions for permitted passive business financings.
Financings permitted under paragraphs (b)(2) or (3) of this section must meet all of the following conditions:
(i) For the purposes of this paragraph (b), “substantially all” means at least 99 percent of the Financing proceeds after deduction of actual application fees, closing fees, and expense reimbursements, which may not exceed those permitted by § 107.860.
(ii) If you and/or your Associate charge fees permitted by § 107.860 and/or § 107.900, the total amount of such fees charged to all passive and non-passive businesses that are part of the same Financing may not exceed the fees that would have been permitted if the Financing had been provided directly to a non-passive Small Business. Any such fees received by your Associate must be paid to you in cash within 30 days of the receipt of such fees.
(iii) For the purposes of this part 107, each passive and non-passive business included in the Financing is a Portfolio Concern and subject to the provisions set forth in the Act. The terms of the financing must also provide SBA with access to Portfolio Concern information in compliance with this part 107, including without limitation §§ 107.600 and 107.620.
(c)
Real Estate Businesses.
(1) You are not permitted to finance any business classified under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes 531110 (lessors of residential buildings and dwellings), 531120 (lessors of nonresidential buildings except miniwarehouses), 531190 (lessors of other real estate property), 237210 (land subdivision), or 236117 (new housing for-sale builders). You are not permitted to finance any business classified under NAICS codes 236118 (residential remodelers), 236210 (industrial building construction), or 236220 (commercial and institutional building construction), if such business is primarily engaged in construction or renovation of properties on its own account rather than as a hired contractor. You are permitted to finance a business classified under NAICS codes 531210 (offices of real estate agents and brokers), 531311 (residential property managers), 531312 (nonresidential property managers), 531320 (offices of real estate appraisers), or 531390 (other activities related to
real estate), only if such business derives at least 80 percent of its revenue from non-Affiliate sources.
(2) You are not permitted to finance a Small Business, regardless of NAICS classification, if the Financing is to be used to acquire or refinance real property, unless the Small Business:
(i) Is acquiring an existing property and will use at least 51 percent of the usable square footage for an eligible business purpose; or
(ii) Is building or renovating a building and will use at least 67 percent of the usable square footage for an eligible business purpose; or
(iii) Occupies the subject property and uses at least 67 percent of the usable square footage for an eligible business purpose.
(d)
Project Financing.
You are not permitted to finance a business if:
(1) The assets of the business are to be reduced or consumed, generally without replacement, as the life of the business progresses, and the nature of the business requires that a stream of cash payments be made to the business's financing sources, on a basis associated with the continuing sale of assets. Examples include real estate development projects and oil and gas wells; or
(2) The primary purpose of the Financing is to fund production of a single item or defined limited number of items, generally over a defined production period, and such production will constitute the majority of the activities of the Small Business. Examples include motion pictures and electric generating plants.
(e)
Farm land purchases.
You are not permitted to finance the acquisition of farm land. Farm land means land which is or is intended to be used for agricultural or forestry purposes, such as the production of food, fiber, or wood, or is so taxed or zoned.

General rule.
You are not permitted to finance a business if:
(i) The funds will be used substantially for a foreign operation; or
(ii) At the time of the Financing or within one year thereafter, more than 49 percent of the employees or tangible assets of the Small Business are located outside the United States (unless you can show, to SBA's satisfaction, that the Financing was used for a specific domestic purpose).
(2)
Exception.
This paragraph (g) does not prohibit a Financing used to acquire foreign materials and equipment or foreign property rights for use or sale in the United States.
(h)
Associated supplier.
You are not permitted to finance a business that purchases, or will purchase, goods or services from a supplier who is your Associate, except under the following conditions:
(1) The amount of goods and services purchased (or to be purchased) from your Associate with the proceeds of the Financing, or with funds released as a result of the Financing, is less than 50 percent of the total amount of the Financing (75 percent for a Section 301(d) Licensee);
(2) The price of such goods and services is no higher than that charged other customers of your Associate; and
(3) The Small Business purchases no capital goods from your Associate.
(i)
Financing Licensees.
You are not permitted to provide funds, directly or indirectly, that the Small Business will use:
(1) To purchase stock in or provide capital to a Licensee, provided that a Reinvestor SBIC is permitted to make Equity Capital Investments in Non-leveraged Licensees.
(2) To repay an indebtedness incurred for the purpose of investing in a Licensee.

§ 107.730
Financings which constitute conflicts of interest.
(a)
General rule.
You must not self-deal to the prejudice of a Small Business, the Licensee, its shareholders or partners, or SBA. Unless you obtain a prior written exemption from SBA for
special instances in which a Financing may further the purposes of the Act despite presenting a conflict of interest, you must not directly or indirectly:
(1) Provide Financing to any of your Associates, except for when the Small Business that receives the Financing is your Associate, pursuant to paragraph (8)(ii) of

(i) You and the Associate investment fund previously invested in the Small Business at the same time and on the same terms and conditions; and you and the Associate investment fund are providing follow-on financing to the Small Business at the same time, on the same terms and conditions, and in the same proportionate dollar amounts as your respective investments in the previous round(s) of financing.
Example 1 to paragraph (a)(1)(i):

(3)
Exceptions to paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section.

Special rules for Loans and Debt Securities
—(1)
Term.
The minimum term for Loans and Debt Securities starts with the first disbursement of the Financing.

Prepayment.
You must permit voluntary prepayment of Loans and Debt Securities by the Small Business. You must obtain SBA's prior written approval of any restrictions on the ability of the Small Business to prepay other than the imposition of a reasonable prepayment penalty under paragraph (c)(3) of this section. For purposes of evaluating prepayment restrictions under this section, requirements to apply prepayments pro rata among a group of lenders participating in such Financing that is pari passu in rights to payment will not be deemed to constitute a restriction on prepayments.
(3)
Prepayment penalties.
You may charge a reasonable prepayment penalty which must be agreed upon at the time of the Financing. If SBA determines that a prepayment penalty is unreasonable, you must refund the entire penalty to the Small Business. A prepayment penalty equal to 5 percent of the outstanding balance during the first year of any Financing, declining by one percentage point per year through the fifth year, is considered reasonable.
[61 FR 3189, Jan. 31, 1996, as amended at 69 FR 8098, Feb. 23, 2004; 88 FR 46012, July 18, 2023]

(i) A reasonable formula that reflects the performance of the concern (such as one based on earnings or book value); or
(ii) The fair market value of the concern at the time of redemption, as determined by a professional appraisal performed under an agreement acceptable to both parties.
(c) Any method for determining the redemption price must be agreed upon no later than the date of the first (or only) closing of the Financing.
[61 FR 3189, Jan. 31, 1996, as amended at 64 FR 52646, Sept. 30, 1999; 69 FR 8098, Feb. 23, 2004]
§ 107.855
Interest rate ceiling and limitations on fees charged to Small Businesses (“Cost of Money”).
“Cost of Money” means the interest and other consideration that you receive from a Small Business. Subject to lower ceilings prescribed by local law, the Cost of Money to the Small Business must not exceed the ceiling determined under this section.
(a)
Financings to which the Cost of Money rules apply.
This section applies to all Loans and Debt Securities. As required by § 107.800(b), you must include as Debt Securities any equity interests with redemption provisions that do not meet the restrictions in § 107.850.
(b)
When to determine the Cost of Money ceiling for a Financing.
You may determine your Cost of Money ceiling for a particular Financing as of the date you issue a Commitment or as of the date of the first closing of the Financing. Once determined, the Cost of Money ceiling remains fixed for the duration of the Financing.
(c)
How to determine the Cost of Money ceiling for a Financing.
At a minimum, you may use a Cost of Money ceiling of 19 percent for a Loan and 14 percent for a Debt Security. To determine whether you may charge more, do the following:
(1) Choose a base rate for your Cost of Money computation. The base rate may be either the Debenture Rate currently in effect plus the applicable Charge determined under § 107.1130(d)(1), or your own “Cost of Capital” as determined under paragraph (d) of this section.
(2) For a Loan, add 11 percentage points to the base rate; for a Debt Security, add 6 percentage points. In either case, round the sum down to the nearest eighth of one percent.
(3) If the result is more than 19 percent (for a Loan) or 14 percent (for a Debt Security), you may use it as your Cost of Money ceiling.
(4) If two or more Licensees participate in the same Financing of a Small Business, the base rate used in this paragraph (c) is the highest of the following:
(i) The current Debenture Rate plus the applicable Charge determined under § 107.1130(d)(1);
(ii) The Cost of Capital of the lead Licensee; or
(iii) The weighted average of the Cost of Capital for all Licensees participating in the Financing.
(d)
How to determine your Cost of Capital.
“Cost of Capital” is an optional computation of the weighted average interest rate you pay on your “qualified borrowings”. “Qualified borrowings” means your Debentures together with your borrowings at or below the usual interest rate charged by banks in your locality on the date your loan was made.
(1) For any fiscal year, you may compute your Cost of Capital:
(i) As of the first day of your fiscal year, to remain in effect for the entire year; or
(ii) As of the first day of every fiscal quarter during the fiscal year, to remain in effect for the duration of the quarter.
(2) For each qualified borrowing outstanding at your last fiscal year or fiscal quarter end, multiply the ending principal balance (net of related unamortized fees) by the number of days during the past four fiscal quarters that the borrowing was outstanding, and divide the result by 365.
(3) Add together the amounts computed for all borrowings under paragraph (d)(2) of this section. The result is your weighted average borrowings.
(4) For all qualified borrowings outstanding at your last fiscal year or fiscal quarter end, determine the aggregate interest expense for the past four fiscal quarters, excluding amortization of loan fees. For the purposes of this paragraph (d)(4):
(i) Interest expense on Debentures includes the 1 percent Charge paid by a Licensee under § 107.1130(d)(1); and
(ii) Section 301(d) Licensees with outstanding subsidized Debentures are presumed to have paid interest at the rate stated on the face of such Debentures, without regard to any subsidy paid by SBA.
(5) Divide the interest expense from paragraph (d)(4) of this section by the weighted average borrowings from paragraph (d)(3) of this section, and multiply by 100. The result is your Cost of Capital, which you may use to compute a Cost of Money ceiling under paragraph (c) of this section.
(e)
SBA review of Cost of Capital computation.
You must keep your Cost of Capital computations in a separate file available for SBA's review.
(1) A computation that is kept in such a file and is audited by your independent public accountant is considered correct unless SBA demonstrates otherwise.
(2) If a computation is not kept in such a file or is unaudited, you must prove its accuracy to SBA's satisfaction.
(f)
Charges included in the Cost of Money.
The Cost of Money includes all interest, points, discounts, fees, royalties, profit participation, and any other consideration you receive from a Small Business, except for the specific exclusions in paragraph (g) of this section. For equity interests subject to the Cost of Money rules (see paragraph (a) of this section), you must include:
(1) The portion of the fixed redemption price that exceeds your original cost.
(2) Any amount of a redemption that is paid out of accounts other than the Small Business's capital accounts (capital, paid-in surplus, or retained earnings of a corporation; or partners' capital of a partnership).
(g)
Charges excluded from the Cost of Money.
You may exclude from the Cost of Money:
(1) Discount on the loan portion of a Debt Security, if such discount exists solely as the result of the allocation of value to detachable stock purchase
warrants in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
(2) Closing fees, application fees, and expense reimbursements, each as permitted under § 107.860.
(3) Reasonable prepayment penalties permitted under § 107.830(d)(3).
(4) Out-of-pocket conveyance and/or recordation fees and taxes.
(5) Reasonable closing costs.
(6) Fees for management services as permitted under § 107.900.
(7) Reasonable and necessary out-of-pocket expenses you incur to monitor the Financing.
(8) Board of director fees not in excess of those paid to other outside directors, if your board representation meets the requirements of § 107.730(e).
(9) A reasonable fee for arranging financing for a Small Business from a source that is neither a Licensee nor an Associate of yours. The Small Business must agree in writing to pay such a fee before you arrange the financing.
(10) The difference between the contractual interest rate of the Financing and a default rate of interest permitted as follows:
(i) If a Small Business is in default, you may charge a default rate of interest as much as 7 percentage points higher than the contractual rate until the default is cured.
(ii) For this purpose, “default” means either failure to pay an amount when due or failure to provide information required under the Financing documents.
(11) Royalty payments based on improvement in the performance of the Small Business after the date of the Financing.
(12) Gains realized on the disposition of Equity Securities issued by the Small Business.
(h)
How to evaluate compliance with the Cost of Money ceiling.
You must determine whether a Financing is within the Cost of Money ceiling based on its discounted cash flows, as follows:
(1) Beginning with the date of the first disbursement (“period zero”), identify your cash inflows and cash outflows for each period of the Financing. The appropriate period to use (such as years, quarters, or months) depends on how you have structured the disbursements and payments.
(2) Discount the cash flows back to the first disbursement date using the Cost of Money ceiling from paragraph (c) of this section as the discount rate.
(3) If the result is zero or less, the Financing is within the Cost of Money ceiling; if it is greater than zero, the Financing exceeds the Cost of Money ceiling.
[61 FR 3189, Jan. 31, 1996, as amended at 63 FR 5867, Feb. 5, 1998; 64 FR 52646, Sept. 30, 1999; 65 FR 69432, Nov. 17, 2000; 77 FR 20294, Apr. 4, 2012; 89 FR 3548, Jan. 19, 2024]
§ 107.860
Financing fees and expense reimbursements a Licensee may receive from a Small Business.
You may collect Financing fees and receive expense reimbursements from a Small Business only as permitted under this § 107.860.
(a)
Application fee.
You may collect a nonrefundable application fee from a Small Business to review its Financing application. The application fee may be collected at the same time as the closing fee under paragraph (c) or (d) of this section, or earlier. The fee must be:
(1) No more than 1 percent of the amount of Financing requested (or, if two or more Licensees participate in the Financing, their combined application fees are no more than 1 percent of the total Financing requested); and
(2) Agreed to in writing by the Financing applicant.
(b)
SBA review of application fees.
For any fiscal year, if the number of application fees you collect is more than twice the number of Financings closed, SBA in its sole discretion may determine that you are engaged in activities not contemplated by the Act, in violation of § 107.500.
(c)
Closing fee—Loans.
You may charge a closing fee on a Loan if:
(1) The fee is no more than 2 percent of the Financing amount (or, if two or more Licensees participate in the Financing, their combined closing fees are no more than 2 percent of the total Financing amount); and
(2) You charge the fee no earlier than the date of the first disbursement.
(d)
Closing fee—Debt or Equity Financings.
You may charge a Closing Fee on a Debt Security or Equity Security Financing if:
(1) The fee is no more than 4 percent of the Financing amount (or, if two or more Licensees participate in the Financing, their combined closing fees are no more than 4 percent of the total Financing amount); and
(2) You charge the fee no earlier than the date of the first disbursement.
(e)
Limitation on dual fees.
If another Licensee or an Associate of yours collects a transaction fee under § 107.900(e) in connection with your Financing of a Small Business, the sum of the transaction fee and your application and closing fees cannot exceed the maximum application and closing fees permitted under this § 107.860.
(f)
Expense reimbursements.
You may charge a Small Business for the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, other than Management Expenses, that you incur to process its Financing application. If SBA determines that any of your reimbursed expenses are unreasonable or are Management Expenses, SBA will require you to include such amounts in the Cost of Money or refund them to the Small Business.
(g)
Breakup fee.
If a Small Business accepts your Commitment and then fails to close the Financing because it has accepted funds from another source, you may charge a “breakup fee” equal to the closing fee that you would have been permitted to charge under paragraph (c) or (d) of this section.
[61 FR 3189, Jan. 31, 1996; 61 FR 41496, Aug. 9, 1996]

§ 107.1120
General eligibility requirements for Leverage.
To be eligible for Leverage, you must:

[61 FR 3189, Jan. 31, 1996, as amended at 63 FR 5868, Feb. 5, 1998; 77 FR 25053, Apr. 27, 2012; 88 FR 46012, July 18, 2023; 89 FR 3549, Jan. 19, 2024]
§ 107.1140
Licensee's acceptance of SBA remedies under §§ 107.1800 through 107.1820.
If you issue Leverage after April 25, 1994, you automatically agree to the terms and conditions in §§ 107.1800 through 107.1820 as they exist at the time of issuance. The effect of these terms and conditions is the same as if they were fully incorporated in the terms of your Leverage.

# Maximum Amount of Leverage for Which a Licensee Is Eligible
§ 107.1150
Maximum amount of Leverage.
A Leveraged Licensee, other than an Early Stage SBIC, may have maximum outstanding Leverage as set forth in paragraphs (a), (b), (d), and (e) of this section. An Early Stage SBIC may have maximum outstanding Leverage as set forth in paragraph (c) of this section. In general, SBA will approve Leverage commitment requests in excess of 200 percent of Regulatory Capital and draw requests in excess of 200 percent of Leverageable Capital only after a Licensee has demonstrated consistent, sustainable profitability based on a conservative investment strategy that limits downside risk. Any such Leverage request must be supported by an up-to-date business plan that reflects continuation of the Licensee's successful investment strategy and demonstrates the Licensee's ability to pay all SBA obligations in accordance with their terms.
(a)
Individual Licensee.
Subject to SBA's credit policies, if you are a Leveraged Licensee and not an Accrual SBIC, the maximum amount of Leverage you may have outstanding at any time is the Individual Maximum. If you are an Accrual SBIC, the maximum amount of Leverage and accrued interest you may have outstanding at any time is the Individual Maximum. The
Individual Maximum
means the lesser of:
(1) 300 percent of your Leverageable Capital;
(2) 100 percent of your Leverageable Capital if you have less than $5 Million in Regulatory Capital and you were Licensed because you are headquartered in an Underlicensed State; or
(3) The maximum Leverage available to a single Licensee under section 303(b) of the Act.
(b)
Multiple Licensees under Common Control.
Subject to SBA's credit policies, two or more Licenses under Common Control may have maximum aggregate outstanding Leverage as permitted under the Act. For any Accrual SBIC or Reinvestor SBIC under Common Control, the aggregate accrued interest associated with Accrual Debentures will be included in determining whether this maximum has been exceeded. However, for any Leverage draw(s) by one or more such Licensees that would cause the aggregate outstanding Leverage to exceed the Individual Maximum, each of the Licensees under Common Control must certify that it does not have a condition of Capital Impairment.
See
also § 107.1120(d).
Example 1 to paragraph (b):
If a fund manager has both a regular Leveraged Licensee with $250 million in outstanding Leverage and an Accrual SBIC with $50 million in Accrual Debentures that could accrue interest of $25 million at maturity, SBA will apply the principal from the regular Leverage plus the $50 million from the Accrual Debenture plus the $25 million in potential accrued interest for a combined total of $325 million.
(c)
Early Stage SBICs.
Subject to SBA's credit policies, if you are an Early Stage SBIC:
(1) The total amount of any and all Leverage commitments you receive from SBA shall not exceed 100 percent of your highest Regulatory Capital or $50 million, whichever is less;
(2) On a cumulative basis, the total amount of Leverage you have issued shall not exceed the total amount of capital paid in by your investors; and
(3) The maximum amount of Leverage you may have outstanding at any time is the lesser of:
(i) 100 percent of your Leverageable Capital, or
(ii) $50 million.
(d)
Additional Leverage based on investment in low-income geographic areas.
Subject to SBA's credit policies, you may have outstanding Leverage in excess of the amounts permitted by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section in accordance with this paragraph (d). If you were licensed before October 1, 2009, you may seek additional Leverage under paragraph (d)(1) only. If you were licensed on or after October 1, 2009, you may seek additional Leverage under paragraph (d)(1) or (2), but not both. In this paragraph (d), “low income geographic areas” are as defined in § 108.50 of this chapter. Any investment that you use as a basis to seek additional leverage under this paragraph (d) cannot also be used to seek additional leverage under paragraph (e) of this section.
(1)
Investment in Smaller Enterprises located in low-income geographic areas.
To determine whether you may request a draw that would cause you to have outstanding Leverage in excess of the amount determined under paragraph (a) of this section:
(i) Determine the cost basis, as reported on your most recent filing of SBA Form 468, of any investments in the Equity Securities of a Smaller Enterprise located in a low-income geographic area.
(ii) Calculate the amount that equals 50 percent of your Leverageable Capital.
(iii) Subtract from your outstanding Leverage the lesser of paragraph (d)(1)(i) or (ii).
(iv) If the amount calculated in paragraph (d)(1)(iii) is less than the maximum leverage determined under paragraph (a) of this section, the difference between the two amounts equals your additional Leverage availability.
(2)
Investment in Small Businesses located in low-income geographic areas.
This paragraph (d)(2) applies only to Licensees licensed on or after October 1, 2009. You may substitute a maximum Leverage amount of $175,000,000 for the $150,000,000 set forth in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, and a maximum Leverage amount of $250,000,000 for the $225,000,000 set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, if you satisfy the following conditions:
(i) At least 50 percent (in dollars) of your Financings preceding the date of such request must have been invested in Small Businesses located in low-income geographic areas. In addition, you must certify that at least 50 percent (in dollars) of your Financings on or after the date of such request will be invested in Small Businesses located in low-income geographic areas.
(ii) If you are requesting a draw that would cause you and any other Licensees under Common Control to have aggregate outstanding Leverage in excess of $225,000,000, at least 50 percent (in dollars) of the Financings made by each Licensee under Common Control preceding the date of such request must have been invested in Small Businesses located in low-income geographic areas. In addition, each such Licensee must certify that at least 50 percent (in dollars) of its Financings on or after the date of such request will be invested in Small Businesses located in low-income geographic areas.
(e)
Additional Leverage based on Energy Saving Qualified Investments in Smaller Enterprises.
(1) Subject to SBA's credit policies, if you were licensed on or after October 1, 2008, you may have outstanding Leverage in excess of the amounts permitted by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section in accordance with this paragraph (e). Any investment that you use as a basis to seek additional Leverage under this paragraph (e) cannot also be used to seek additional Leverage under paragraph (d) of this section.
(2) To determine whether you may request a draw that would cause you to have outstanding Leverage in excess of the amount determined under paragraph (a) of this section:
(i) Determine the cost basis, as reported on your most recent filing of SBA Form 468, of any Energy Saving Qualified Investments in a Smaller Enterprise that individually do not exceed 20% of your Regulatory Capital.
(ii) Calculate the amount that equals 33% of your Leverageable Capital.
(iii) Subtract from your outstanding Leverage the lesser of paragraph (e)(2)(i) or (ii).
(iv) If the amount calculated in paragraph (e)(2)(iii) is less than the maximum Leverage determined under paragraph (a) of this section, the difference between the two amounts equals your additional Leverage availability.

§ 107.1160
Maximum amount of Leverage for a Section 301(d) Licensee.
This section applies to Leverage issued by a Section 301(d) Licensee on or before September 30, 1996. Effective October 1, 1996, a Section 301(d) Licensee may apply to issue new Leverage, or refinance existing Leverage, only on the same terms permitted under § 107.1150.
(a)
Maximum amount of subsidized Leverage.
(1) “Subsidized Leverage” means Debentures with a reduced interest rate and Preferred Securities. If you are a Section 301(d) Licensee:
(i) The maximum amount of subsidized Leverage you may have outstanding at any time is the lesser of 400 percent of your Leverageable Capital, or $35,000,000. The same limit applies to a group of Section 301(d) Licensees under Common Control.
(ii) The maximum amount of Preferred Securities you may have outstanding at any time is 200 percent of your Leverageable Capital.
(2) Certain types and amounts of subsidized Leverage have special eligibility requirements (see paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section).
(b)
Maximum amount of total Leverage.
Use § 107.1150 to determine your maximum amount of Leverage as if you were a Section 301(c) Licensee. If the result is more than your maximum subsidized Leverage, then this is your maximum total (subsidized plus non-subsidized) Leverage. Otherwise, your maximum total Leverage is the same as your maximum subsidized Leverage. For Participating Securities, see § 107.1170.
(c)
Special eligibility requirements for fourth tier of Leverage.
A “fourth tier of Leverage” is any amount of outstanding Leverage in excess of 300 percent of your Leverageable Capital.
(1) To qualify for a fourth tier of Leverage, you must have invested (or have Commitments to invest) at least
30 percent of your “Total Funds Available for Investment” in “Venture Capital Financings” (see the definitions in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section).
(2) While you have a fourth tier of Leverage, you must maintain Venture Capital Financings (at cost) that equal at least 30 percent of your Total Funds Available for Investment.
(d)
Special eligibility requirements for second tier of Preferred Securities.
A “second tier of Preferred Securities” is any amount of outstanding Preferred Securities in excess of 100 percent of your Leverageable Capital.
(1) To qualify for a second tier of Preferred Securities:
(i) If your license was issued after October 13, 1971, you must have at least $500,000 of Leverageable Capital.
(ii) You must have invested (or have Commitments to invest) at least the same dollar amount in Venture Capital Financings.
(2) While you have a second tier of Preferred Securities, you must maintain at least the same dollar amount of Venture Capital Financings (at cost).
(e)
Definition of “Total Funds Available for Investment”.
Total Funds Available for Investment means the result obtained from the following formula:
T = .90 × (CA + LI)
Where:
T = Total funds available for investment
CA = Total current assets
LI = Total Loans and Investment at cost (as reported on SBA Form 468), net of current maturities
(f)
Definition of “Venture Capital Financing”.
Venture Capital Financing means an investment represented by common or preferred stock, a limited partnership interest, or a similar ownership interest; or by an unsecured debt instrument that is subordinated by its terms to all other borrowings of the issuer.
(1) A debt secured by any agreement with a third party is not a Venture Capital Financing, whether or not you have a security interest in any asset of the third party or have recourse against the third party.
(2) A Financing that originally qualified as a Venture Capital Financing will continue to qualify (at its original cost), even if you later must report it on SBA Form 468 under either Assets Acquired in Liquidation of Portfolio Securities or Operating Concerns Acquired.
[61 FR 3189, Jan. 31, 1996, as amended at 63 FR 5868, Feb. 5, 1998; 74 FR 33916, July 14, 2009]
§ 107.1170
Maximum amount of Participating Securities for any Licensee.
The maximum amount of Participating Securities you may have outstanding at any time is 200 percent of your Leverageable Capital. If you are a Section 301(d) Licensee, the maximum combined amount of Participating Securities and Preferred Securities you may have outstanding at any time is 200 percent of your Leverageable Capital.

# Special Rules for Leverage Issued by an Early Stage SBIC
§ 107.1180
Required distributions to SBA by Early Stage SBICs.
(a)
Distribution requirement.
If you are an Early Stage SBIC with outstanding Leverage, you may make Distributions to your investors and to SBA only as permitted under this section. See also § 107.585. For the purposes of this section, “Distributions” do not include required payments to SBA of interest and Charges and payments of Leverage principal at maturity, all of which shall be paid in accordance with the terms of the Leverage. You may make a Distribution on any Payment Date. Unless SBA permits otherwise, you must notify SBA in writing of any planned distribution under this section, including computations of the amounts distributable to SBA and your investors, at least 10 business days before the distribution date.
(b)
How SBA will apply Distributions.
Any amounts you distribute to SBA, or its designated agent or Trustee, under this section will be applied to repayment of principal of outstanding Debentures in order of issue. You may prepay any Debenture in whole, but not in part, on any Payment Date without penalty.
(c)
Condition for making a Distribution.
You may make a Distribution under this section only if you have paid all
interest and Charges on your outstanding Debentures that are due and payable, or will pay such interest and Charges simultaneously with your Distribution.
(d)
SBA's share of Distribution.
For each proposed Distribution, determine SBA's share of the Distribution as follows:
(1) Determine the highest ratio of outstanding Leverage to Leverageable Capital that you have ever attained (your “Highest Leverage Ratio”). For the purpose of determining your Highest Leverage Ratio, any deferred interest Debentures issued at a discount must be included in the computation at their face value.
(2) Determine SBA's percentage share of cumulative Distributions:
(i) If your Capital Impairment Percentage under § 107.1840 is less than 50 percent as of the Distribution date or your Highest Leverage Ratio equals 0.5 or less, except as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section, SBA's percentage share of cumulative Distributions equals:
[Highest Leverage Ratio/(Highest Leverage Ratio + 1)] × 100
For example, if your Highest Leverage Ratio equals 1, then SBA's share of any distribution you make will be 50 percent.
(ii) If your Capital Impairment Percentage under § 107.1840 is 50 percent or greater as of the Distribution date and your Highest Leverage Ratio is greater than 0.5, SBA's percentage share of cumulative Distributions equals 100 percent.
(iii) If you have a condition of Capital Impairment under § 107.1830 and your Highest Leverage Ratio equals 0.5 or less as of the Distribution date, SBA's percentage share of cumulative Distributions equals 100 percent.
(3) Multiply the sum of all your prior Distributions and your current proposed Distribution (including Distributions to SBA, your limited partners and your General Partner) by SBA's percentage share of cumulative Distributions as determined in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
(4) From the result in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, subtract the sum of all your prior Distributions to SBA under this § 107.1180.
(5) The amount of your Distribution to SBA will be the least of:
(i) The result in paragraph (d)(4) of this section;
(ii) Your current proposed Distribution; or
(iii) Your outstanding Leverage.
(e)
Additional Leverage prepayment.
On any Payment Date, subject to the terms of your Leverage, you may make a payment to SBA to be applied to repayment of the principal of one or more outstanding Debentures in order of issue, without making any Distribution to your investors.
[77 FR 25053, Apr. 27, 2012]
§ 107.1181
Interest reserve requirements for Early Stage SBICs.
(a)
Reserve requirement.
If you are an Early Stage SBIC with outstanding Leverage, for each Debenture which requires periodic interest payments to SBA during the first five years of its term, you must maintain a reserve sufficient to pay the interest and Charges on such Debenture for the first 21 Payment Dates following the date of issuance. This reserve may consist of any combination of the following:
(1) Binding unfunded commitments from your Institutional Investors that cannot be called for any purpose other than the payment of interest and Charges to SBA, or the payment of any amounts due to SBA; and
(2) Cash maintained in a separate bank account or separate investment account permitted under § 107.530 of this part and separately identified in your financial statements as “restricted cash” available only for the purpose of paying interest and Charges to SBA, or for the payment of any amounts due to SBA.
(b) The required reserve associated with an individual Debenture shall be reduced on each Payment Date upon payment of the required interest and Charges. If you prepay a Debenture prior to the 21st Payment Date following its date of issuance, the reserve requirement associated with that Debenture shall be correspondingly eliminated.
(c) Your limited partnership agreement must incorporate the reserve requirement in paragraph (a) of this section.
[77 FR 25053, Apr. 27, 2012]
§ 107.1182
Valuation requirements for Early Stage SBICs based on Capital Impairment Percentage.
(a) If you are an Early Stage SBIC, you must compute your Capital Impairment Percentage and determine whether you have a condition of Capital Impairment in accordance with §§ 107.1830 and 107.1840 of this part.
(b) You must promptly notify SBA in writing if your Capital Impairment Percentage is at least 50 percent, even if your maximum permitted Capital Impairment Percentage is higher.
(c) Upon receipt of your notification under paragraph (b) of this section, or upon making its own determination that your Capital Impairment Percentage is at least 50 percent, SBA has the right to require you to engage, at your expense, an independent third party, acceptable to SBA, to prepare valuations of some or all of your Loans and Investments, as designated by SBA.

(2)
Exception to general rule.
If you are not in compliance, you may still be eligible for draws if:
(i) SBA determines that your outstanding violations are of non-substantive provisions of the Act or regulations and that you have not repeatedly violated any non-substantive provisions; or
(ii) You have agreed with SBA on a course of action to resolve your violations and such agreement does not prevent you from issuing Leverage.

# Preferred Securities Leverage—Section 301(
d

# ) Licensees
§ 107.1400
Dividends or partnership distributions on 4 percent Preferred Securities.
If you issued Preferred Securities to SBA on or after November 21, 1989, you must pay SBA a dividend or partnership distribution of 4 percent per year, from the date you issued Preferred Securities to the date you repay them, both inclusive. The dividend or partnership distribution is:
(a) Computed on the par value of the outstanding stock or the face value of the outstanding limited partnership interest.
(b) Cumulative. This means that if you do not pay the entire dividend or partnership distribution for a given fiscal year, the unpaid balance accumulates as a distribution in arrears. You do not have to pay interest on distributions in arrears.
(c) Preferred. This means that you must pay SBA in full (including distributions in arrears) before setting aside or paying any amount to any other equity holder.
(d) Payable at the discretion of your Board of Directors or General Partner(s), except that all distributions in arrears must be paid in full when you redeem the Preferred Securities.
[61 FR 3189, Jan. 31, 1996, as amended at 63 FR 5869, Feb. 5, 1998]
§ 107.1410
Requirement to redeem 4 percent Preferred Securities.
You must redeem 4 percent Preferred Securities not later than 15 years from the date of issuance. At the redemption date, you must pay to SBA:
(a) The par value (of preferred stock) or face value (of a preferred limited partnership interest); plus
(b) Any unpaid dividends or partnership distributions accrued to the redemption date.
§ 107.1420
Articles requirements for 4 percent Preferred Securities.
If you have outstanding 4 percent Preferred Securities, your Articles must contain all the provisions in §§ 107.1400 and 107.1410.
[63 FR 5869, Feb. 5, 1998]
§ 107.1430
Redeeming 4 percent Preferred Securities with proceeds of non-subsidized Debentures.
If SBA approves, a Section 301(d) Licensee may use the proceeds of a Debenture to redeem Preferred Securities at their mandatory redemption date, including any accrued unpaid dividends or partnership distributions.
[61 FR 3189, Jan. 31, 1996, as amended at 63 FR 5869, Feb. 5, 1998]
§ 107.1440
Three percent preferred stock issued before November 21, 1989.
Before November 21, 1989, Preferred Securities were available only in the
form of preferred stock and had a preferred and cumulative dividend of 3 percent. If you have such preferred stock outstanding, you must follow § 107.1400 (except for § 107.1400(d)), substituting “3 percent” for “4 percent” throughout.) Dividends on 3 percent preferred stock are payable at the discretion of your Board of Directors or General Partner(s), except that all dividends in arrears must be paid in full before any non-SBA investor receives any distribution. Upon your liquidation, SBA is entitled to payment of all dividends in arrears even if you have no Retained Earnings Available for Distribution at such time.
§ 107.1450
Optional redemption of Preferred Securities.
(a)
Redemption at par or face value.
A Section 301(d) Licensee may redeem Preferred Securities at any time, provided you give SBA at least 30 days written notice. You may redeem all or only part of your Preferred Securities, but the par value or face value of the securities being redeemed must be at least $50,000. At the redemption date, you must pay to SBA:
(1) The par value (of preferred stock) or face value (of a preferred limited partnership interest); plus
(2) Any unpaid dividends or partnership distributions accrued to the redemption date.
(b)
Repurchase of 3 percent preferred stock for less than par value.
If you issued 3 percent preferred stock to SBA, you may ask SBA to sell it back to you at a price less than its par value. The terms and conditions of any such transaction will be as set forth in the Notice published in the
Federal Register
on April 1, 1994 (Copies of this notice are available from SBA, 409 3rd Street, SW., Washington, DC, 20416). SBA has sole discretion to:
(1) Approve or disapprove the sale.
(2) Determine the sale price after considering any factors SBA considers appropriate.
(3) Determine the form of payment SBA will accept. SBA is not authorized to accept the proceeds of a subsidized Debenture as payment.

# Participating Securities Leverage
§ 107.1500
General description of Participating Securities.
(a)
Types of Participating Securities.
Participating Securities are redeemable, preferred, equity-type securities. SBA may purchase or guarantee Participating Securities issued by Licensees in the form of limited partnership interests, preferred stock, or debentures with interest payable only to the extent of earnings.

(b)
Special eligibility requirements for Participating Securities.
In addition to the general eligibility requirements for Leverage under § 107.1120, Participating Securities issuers must also comply with special rules on:
(1) Minimum capital (see § 107.210).
(2) Liquidity (see § 107.1505).
(3) Non-SBA borrowing (see § 107.570).

(2)
Adjustments to Prioritized Payments.
If you have unpaid Prioritized Payments, you must compute Adjustments, which are additional contingent obligations determined under § 107.1520. The conditions for paying Adjustments are the same as for Prioritized Payments.
(3)
SBA Profit Participation.
Profit Participation is an amount payable to SBA under § 107.1530 in consideration for SBA's guarantee of your Participating Securities.

(e)
Mandatory redemption of Participating Securities.
You must redeem Participating Securities at the redemption date, which is the same as the maturity date of the Trust Certificates for the Trust containing such securities. The redemption date can never be later than 15 years after the issue date. You must pay the Redemption Price plus any unpaid Earned Prioritized Payments and any earned Adjustments and earned Charges (see § 107.1520).
(f)
Priority of Participating Securities in liquidation of Licensee.
In the event of your liquidation, the following are senior in priority, for all purposes, to all other equity interests you have issued at any time:
(1) The Redemption Price of Participating Securities;

If you have outstanding Participating Securities, you must maintain sufficient liquidity to avoid a condition of Liquidity Impairment. Such a condition will constitute noncompliance with the terms of your Leverage under § 107.1820(e).
(a)
Definition of Liquidity Impairment.
A condition of Liquidity Impairment exists when your Liquidity Ratio, as determined in paragraph (b) of this section, is less than 1.20. You are responsible for calculating whether you have a condition of Liquidity Impairment:
(1) As of the close of your fiscal year;
(2) At the time you apply for Leverage, unless SBA permits otherwise; and
(3) At such time as you contemplate making any Distribution.
(b)
Computation of Liquidity Ratio.
Your Liquidity Ratio equals your Total Current Funds Available (A) divided by your Total Current Funds Required (B), as determined in the following table:

§ 107.1510
How a Licensee computes Earmarked Profit (Loss).
Computing your Earmarked Profit (Loss) is the first step in determining your obligations to pay Prioritized Payments, Adjustments and Charges under § 107.1520 and Profit Participation under § 107.1530.
(a)
Requirement to compute your Earmarked Profit (Loss).
While you have Participating Securities outstanding or have Earmarked Assets (as defined in paragraph (b) of this section), you must compute your Earmarked Profit (Loss) for:
(1) Each full fiscal year.
(2) Any interim period (consisting of one or more fiscal quarters) for which you want to make a Distribution.
(b)
How to determine your Earmarked Assets.
“Earmarked Assets” means all the Loans and Investments that you have when you issue Participating Securities or that you acquire while you have Participating Securities outstanding, and any non-cash assets that you receive in exchange for such Loans and Investments.
(1) An Earmarked Asset remains earmarked until you dispose of it, even if you no longer have any outstanding Participating Securities.
(2) Investments you make after redeeming all your Participating Securities are not Earmarked Assets. However, if you issue new Participating Securities, all of your Loans and Investments again become Earmarked Assets.
(3) If you were licensed before March 31, 1993, you may be permitted to exclude Loans and Investments held at that date from Earmarked Assets under § 107.1590.
(c)
How to compute your Earmarked Asset Ratio.
You must determine your Earmarked Asset Ratio each time you compute Earmarked Profit (Loss). If all your Loans and Investments are Earmarked Assets, your Earmarked Asset Ratio equals 100 percent. Otherwise, compute your Earmarked Asset Ratio using the following formula:
EAR = (EA ÷ LI) × 100
where:
EAR = Earmarked Asset Ratio.
EA = Average Earmarked Assets (at cost) for the fiscal year or interim period.
LI = Average Loans and Investments (at cost) for the fiscal year or interim period.
(d)
How to compute your Earmarked Profit (Loss) if Earmarked Asset Ratio is 100 percent.
(1) (i) If your Earmarked Asset Ratio from paragraph (b) of this section is 100 percent, use the following formula to compute your Earmarked Profit (Loss):
EP = NI + IK + EME
where:
EP = Earmarked Profit (Loss)
NI = Net Income (Loss), as reported on SBA Form 468 except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (d)(1)
IK = Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) on Earmarked Assets that you are distributing as an In-Kind Distribution under § 107.1580
EME = Excess Management Expenses
(ii) For the purpose of determining Net Income (Loss), leverage fees paid to SBA and partnership syndication costs that you incur must be capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over not less than five years.
(2) “Excess Management Expenses” are those that exceed the following limit:
(i) For a full fiscal year, the limit is the lower of:
(A) 2.5 percent of your weighted average Combined Capital for the year, plus $125,000 if Combined Capital is below $20,000,000; or
(B) Your Management Expenses approved by SBA.
(ii) For less than a full fiscal year, you must prorate the annual amounts in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section to determine the limit.
(e)
How to compute your Earmarked Profit (Loss) if Earmarked Asset Ratio is less than 100 percent.
If your Earmarked Asset Ratio is less than 100 percent, compute your Earmarked Profit (Loss) as follows:
(1) Do the Earmarked Profit (Loss) computation in paragraph (d) of this section.
(2) Subtract your net realized gain (loss) (as reported on SBA Form 468) on Loans and Investments that are not Earmarked Assets.
(3) Separate the result from paragraph (e)(2) of this section into:
(i) Net realized gain (loss) (as reported on SBA Form 468) on Earmarked Assets (“EGL”); and
(ii) The remainder (“R”).
(4) Your Earmarked Profit (Loss) equals:
EGL + (R × Earmarked Asset Ratio)
(f)
How to compute your cumulative Earmarked Profit (Loss).
Sum your Earmarked Profit (Loss) for all fiscal years and for any interim period following the end of your last fiscal year. The total is your cumulative Earmarked Profit (Loss), which you must use in the Prioritized Payment computations under § 107.1520.

§ 107.1520
How a Licensee computes and allocates Prioritized Payments to SBA.
This section tells you how to compute Prioritized Payments, Adjustments and Charges on Participating Securities and determine the amounts you must pay. To distribute these amounts, see § 107.1540.
(a)
How to compute Prioritized Payments and Adjustments
—(1)
Prioritized Payments.
For a full fiscal year, the Prioritized Payment on an outstanding Participating Security equals the Redemption Price times the related Trust Certificate Rate. For an interim period, you must prorate the annual Prioritized Payment. If your Participating Security was sold to a short-term investor in accordance with § 107.1240, the Prioritized Payment for the short-term period equals the Redemption Price times the short-term rate.
(2)
Adjustments.
Compute Adjustments using paragraph (f) of this section.
(3)
Charges.
Compute Charges in accordance with § 107.1130(d)(2).
(b)
Licensee's obligation to pay Prioritized Payments, Adjustments and Charges.
You are obligated to pay Prioritized Payments, Adjustments and Charges only if you have profit as determined in paragraph (d) of this section.
(1) Prioritized Payments that you must pay (or have already paid) because you have sufficient profit are “Earned Prioritized Payments”.
(2) Prioritized Payments that have not become payable because you lack sufficient profit are “Accumulated Prioritized Payments”. Treat all Prioritized Payments as “Accumulated” until they become “Earned” under this section.
(3) Adjustments (computed under paragraph (f) of this section) and Charges (computed under § 107.1130(d)(2)) are “earned” according to the same criteria applied to Prioritized Payments.
(c)
How to keep track of Prioritized Payments.
You must establish three accounts to record your Accumulated and Earned Prioritized Payments:
(1)
Accumulation Account.
The Accumulation Account is a memorandum account. Its balance represents your Accumulated Prioritized Payments, unearned Adjustments and unearned Charges.
(2)
Distribution Account.
The Distribution Account is a liability account. Its balance represents your unpaid Earned Prioritized Payments, earned Adjustments and earned Charges.
(3)
Earned Payments Account.
The Earned Payments Account is a memorandum account. Each time you add to the Distribution Account balance, add the same amount to the Earned Payments Account. Its balance represents your total (paid and unpaid) Earned Prioritized Payments, earned Adjustments and earned Charges.
(d)
How to determine your profit for Prioritized Payment purposes.
As of the end of each fiscal year and any interim period for which you want to make a Distribution:
(1) Bring the Accumulation Account up to date by adding to it all Prioritized Payments and Charges through the end of the appropriate fiscal period.
(2) Determine whether you have profit for the purposes of this section by doing the following computation:
(i) Cumulative Earmarked Profit (Loss) under § 107.1510(f); minus
(ii) The Earned Payments Account balance; minus
(iii) All Distributions previously made under §§ 107.1550, 107.1560 and 107.1570(a); minus
(iv) Any Profit Participation previously allocated to SBA under § 107.1530, but not yet distributed.
(3) The amount computed in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, if greater than zero, is your profit. If the amount is zero or less, you have no profit.
(4) If you have a profit, continue with paragraph (e) of this section. Otherwise, continue with paragraph (f) of this section.
(e)
Allocating Prioritized Payments to the Distribution Account.
(1) If you have a profit under paragraph (d) of this section, determine the lesser of:
(i) Your profit; or
(ii) The balance in your Accumulation Account.
(2) Subtract the result in paragraph (e)(1) of this section from the Accumulation Account and add it to the Distribution Account and the Earned Payments Account.
(f)
How to compute Adjustments.
You must compute Adjustments as of the end of each fiscal year if you have a balance greater than zero in either your Accumulation Account or your Distribution Account, after giving effect to any Distribution that will be made no later than the second Payment Date following the fiscal year end.
(1) Determine the combined average Accumulation Account and Distribution Account balances for the fiscal year, assuming that Prioritized Payments accumulate on a daily basis without compounding.
(2) Multiply the average balance computed in paragraph (f)(1) of this section by the average of the Trust Certificate Rates for all the Participating Securities poolings during the fiscal year.
(3) Add the amounts computed in this paragraph (f) to your Accumulation Account.
(g)
Licensee's obligation to pay Prioritized Payments after redeeming Participating Securities.
This paragraph (g) applies if you have redeemed all your Participating Securities, but you still hold Earmarked Assets and still have a balance in your Accumulation Account.
(1) You must continue to perform all the procedures in this section as of the end of each fiscal quarter and prior to making any Distribution. You must distribute any Earned Prioritized Payments, earned Adjustments and earned Charges in accordance with § 107.1540.
(2) After you dispose of all your Earmarked Assets and make any required Distributions in accordance with § 107.1540, your obligation to pay any remaining Accumulated Prioritized Payments, unearned Adjustments and unearned Charges will be extinguished.
[63 FR 5870, Feb. 5, 1998]
§ 107.1530
How a Licensee computes SBA's Profit Participation.
This section tells you how to compute SBA's Profit Participation. Profit Participation is included in the Distributions you make to SBA under §§ 107.1550 and 107.1560.
(a)
How to compute Profit Participation.
Profit Participation equals your “Base” times your “Profit Participation Rate” (if the Base is zero or less, you do not owe SBA Profit Participation). Compute the Base using paragraph (c) of this section and the Profit Participation Rate using paragraphs (d) through (g) of this section. You must compute your Earmarked Profit (Loss) under § 107.1510 and your Prioritized Payments and Adjustments under § 107.1520 before you can compute Profit Participation.
(b)
How to keep track of Profit Participation.
You must establish a Profit Participation Account to record your computations under this section and payments under §§ 107.1550 and 107.1560. Its balance represents your unpaid Profit Participation.
(c)
How to compute the Base.
As of the end of each fiscal year and any year-to-date interim period for which you want to make a Distribution, compute your Base using the following formula:
B = EP − PPA − UL
where:
B = Base.
EP = Earmarked Profit (Loss) for the period from § 107.1510.
PPA = Prioritized Payments for the period from § 107.1520(a)(1), Adjustments (if applicable) from § 107.1520(f), and Charges (if applicable) from § 107.1130(d)(2).
UL = “Unused Loss” from prior periods as determined in this paragraph (c).
(1) If the Base computed as of the end of your previous fiscal year (your “Previous Base”) was less than zero, your Unused Loss equals your Previous Base.
(2) If your Previous Base was zero or greater, your Unused Loss equals zero, with the following exception: If you made an interim Distribution of Profit Participation during your previous fiscal year, and your Previous Base was lower than the interim Base on which your Distribution was computed, then your Unused Loss equals the difference between the interim Base and the Previous Base. For example, assume you are computing your Base as of December 31, 1997, your fiscal year end. Your Previous Base, computed as of December 31, 1996, was $3,000,000. During 1996, you made an interim Distribution which was computed on a Base of $3,500,000 as of June 30, 1996. The $500,000 difference between the 1996 interim and year-end Bases would be carried forward as Unused Loss in the computation of your Base as of December 31, 1997.
(3) If you had no Participating Securities outstanding as of the end of your last fiscal year, you may request SBA's approval to treat your Undistributed Net Realized Loss, as reported on SBA Form 468 for that year, as Unused Loss. If you did not file SBA Form 468 because you were not yet licensed as of the end of your last fiscal year, you may request SBA's approval to treat pre-licensing losses as Unused Loss.
(d)
How to compute the Profit Participation Rate.
You must determine your Profit Participation Rate each time you compute a Base that is greater than zero. Compute the Rate by following the steps in paragraphs (e) through (g) of this section.
(e)
Compute the “PLC ratio”
—(1)
General rule.
The “PLC ratio” is the highest ratio of outstanding Participating Securities to Leverageable Capital that you have ever attained.
(2)
Exception.
You may reduce the ratio computed under paragraph (e)(1) of this section if you have increased your Leverageable Capital above its highest previous level. The increase must have taken place at least 120 days before the date as of which your Base is computed. In addition, the increase must have been expressly provided for in a plan of operations submitted to and approved by SBA in writing, or must be the result of the takedown of commitments or the conversion of non-cash assets that were included in your Private Capital. If these conditions are satisfied, compute your reduced PLC ratio as follows:
(i) Divide the highest dollar amount of Participating Securities you have ever had outstanding by your increased Leverageable Capital.
(ii) If the result in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section is lower than your PLC ratio currently in effect, such result will become your new PLC ratio.
(f)
Compute the Profit Participation Rate (before indexing).
Compute the Profit Participation Rate (before indexing) using the table in this paragraph (f). Then go to paragraph (g) of this section to determine whether to index the Profit Participation Rate.
If your PLC ratio is:
Then your Profit Participation Rate is:
1 or less
9% × PLC Ratio.
More than 1
9% + [3% × (PLC ratio-1)].
(g)
Indexing the Profit Participation Rate.
The Profit Participation Rate is indexed, up or down, to the yield-to-maturity on Treasury bonds with a remaining term of ten (10) years (the “Treasury Rate”). You must perform the indexing procedures in this paragraph (g) unless the Treasury Rate was exactly 8 percent on every date that you issued Participating Securities.
(1)
Licensees that have issued Participating Securities on only one occasion.
Determine the Treasury Rate for the date you issued your Participating Security. Adjust the Profit Participation Rate from paragraph (f) of this section by the percentage difference between the Treasury Rate and 8 percent. For example, assume that you issued Participating Securities when the Treasury Rate was 10 percent. The percentage difference between 10 percent and 8 percent is 25 percent. If you had a PLC ratio of 1, the Profit Participation Rate before indexing would be 9 percent. You would increase this rate by 25 percent, giving you a Profit Participation Rate of 11.25 percent.
(2)
Licensees that have issued Participating Securities on more than one occasion.
Determine the Treasury Rate for each of the dates you issued Participating Securities.
(i) Compute an average of all such Treasury Rates, weighted to reflect the dollar amount of each issuance (ignoring any redemptions) and the number of days from the date of each issuance to the date as of which you are computing the Profit Participation Rate.

# Example to paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section.
If you issued $10 million of Participating Securities on the 60th day of Fiscal Year 1 when the Treasury Rate was 8 percent, and another $15 million on the 100th day of Fiscal Year 3 when the Treasury Rate was 10 percent, then the weighted average Treasury Rate computed as of the end of Fiscal Year 3 would be 8.55 percent. [Days elapsed since first issuance of Participating Securities = 1,035; days elapsed since second issuance of Participating Securities = 265; weighted amount of first issuance = $10,000,000 × 1,035/1,035 = $10,000,000; weighted amount of second issuance = $15,000,000 × 265/1035 = $3,840,579; weighted average amount of Participating Securities issued = $10,000,000 + $3,840,579 = $13,840,579; weighted average Treasury Rate= {(.08 × $10,000,000) + (.10 × $3,840,579)} / $13,840,579 = 8.55%]
(ii) Adjust the Profit Participation Rate from paragraph (f) of this section by the percentage difference between the weighted average Treasury Rate and 8 percent. In the example given in paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section, if the PLC ratio were equal to 2, the Profit Participation Rate for the fiscal year would be 12.83 percent. [{((.0855−.08) ÷ .08) + 1} × .12 × 100 = 12.83%]
(h)
Computing SBA's Profit Participation.
If the Base from paragraph (c) of this section is greater than zero, you must compute SBA's Profit Participation as follows:
(1) Multiply the Base from paragraph (c) of this section by the Profit Participation Rate from paragraph (g) of this section.
(2) If your last Profit Participation computation was for an interim period during the same fiscal year and used a higher Profit Participation Rate than the Rate you just used in paragraph (h)(1) of this section, you must adjust the amount computed in paragraph (h)(1) of this section as follows:
(i) Determine the difference between the Profit Participation Rate you just used in paragraph (h)(1) of this section and the Rate used in your previous computation;
(ii) Multiply the difference by the Base from your last Profit Participation computation; and
(iii) Add the result to the amount you computed in paragraph (h)(1) of this section.
(3) Reduce the Profit Participation computed in paragraphs (h)(1) and (h)(2) of this section by any amounts of Profit Participation that you distributed or reserved for distribution to SBA, or its designated agent or Trustee, for any previous interim period(s) during the fiscal year. The result is SBA's Profit Participation (unless it is less than zero, in which case SBA's Profit Participation is zero).
(i)
Allocation of Profit Participation.
Before any Distribution and in any case within 120 days following the end of your fiscal year, you must add the amount of Profit Participation computed under this § 107.1530 to the Profit Participation Account. You must reserve funds equal to this amount for distribution to SBA, or its designated agent or Trustee; you may not reinvest these funds or use them for any other purpose.
[61 FR 3189, Jan. 31, 1996; 61 FR 41496, Aug. 9, 1996, as amended at 63 FR 5871, Feb. 5, 1998]
§ 107.1540
Distributions by Licensee—Prioritized Payments and Adjustments.
After you compute Prioritized Payments and Adjustments under § 107.1520, you must distribute them in accordance with this § 107.1540. You must notify SBA of any planned distribution under this section 10 business days before the distribution date, unless SBA permits otherwise.
[61 FR 3189, Jan. 31, 1996, as amended at 63 FR 5871, Feb. 5, 1998; 88 FR 46012, July 18, 2023]
§ 107.1550
Distributions by Licensee—permitted “tax Distributions” to private investors and SBA.
If you have outstanding Participating Securities or Earmarked Assets, and you are a limited partnership, “S Corporation,” or equivalent pass-
through entity for tax purposes, you may make “tax Distributions” to your investors in accordance with this § 107.1550, whether or not they have an actual tax liability. SBA receives a share of any tax Distribution you make. This section tells you when you may make a “tax Distribution” and how to compute it. You must notify SBA of any planned distribution under this section 10 business days before the distribution date, unless SBA permits otherwise.
(a)
Conditions for making a tax Distribution.
You may make a tax Distribution only if:
(1) You have paid all your Prioritized Payments, Adjustments, and Charges, so that the balance in both your Distribution Account and your Accumulation Account is zero (see § 107.1520).
(2) You satisfy the liquidity requirement in § 107.1505.
(3) The tax Distribution does not exceed your Retained Earnings Available for Distribution.
(4) The tax Distribution does not exceed the Maximum Tax Liability from paragraph (b) of this section.
(b)
How to compute the Maximum Tax Liability.
(1) You may compute your Maximum Tax Liability for a full fiscal year or for any calendar quarter. Use the following formula:
M = (TOI × HRO) + (TCG × HRC)
where:
M = Maximum Tax Liability
TOI = Net ordinary income allocated to your partners or other owners for Federal income tax purposes for the fiscal year or calendar quarter for which the Distribution is being made, excluding Prioritized Payments allocated to SBA.
HRO = The highest combined marginal Federal and State income tax rate for corporations or individuals on ordinary income, determined in accordance with paragraphs (b)(2) through (b)(4) of this section.
TCG = Net capital gains allocated to your partners or other owners for Federal income tax purposes for the fiscal year or calendar quarter for which the Distribution is being made, excluding Prioritized Payments allocated to SBA.
HRC = The highest combined marginal Federal and State income tax rate for corporations or individuals on capital gains, determined in accordance with paragraphs (b)(2) through (b)(4) of this section.
(2) You may compute the highest combined marginal Federal and State income tax rate on ordinary income and capital gains using either individual or corporate rates. However, you must apply the same type of rate, either individual or corporate, to both ordinary income and capital gains.
(3) In determining the combined Federal and State income tax rate, you must assume that State income taxes are deductible from Federal income taxes. For example, if the Federal tax rate was 35 percent and the State tax rate was 5 percent, the combined tax rate would be [35% × (1−.05)] + 5% = 38.25%.
(4) For purposes of this paragraph (b), the “State income tax” is that of the State where your principal place of business is located, and does not include any local income taxes.
(c)
SBA's share of the tax Distribution.
(1) SBA's percentage share of the tax Distribution is equal to the Profit Participation Rate computed under § 107.1530.
(2) SBA may direct you to pay its share of the tax Distribution to its designated agent or Trustee.
(3) SBA will apply its share of the tax Distribution in the order set forth in § 107.1560(g).
(d)
Paying a tax Distribution.
You may make an annual tax Distribution on the first or second Payment Date following the end of your fiscal year. You may make a quarterly tax Distribution on the first Payment Date following the end of the calendar quarter for which the Distribution is being made. See also § 107.1575(a).
(e)
Excess tax Distributions.
(1) As of the end of your fiscal year, you must determine whether you made any excess tax Distributions for the year in accordance with paragraph (e)(2) of this section. Any tax Distributions that you make for a subsequent period must be reduced by the excess amount distributed.
(2) Determine your excess tax Distributions by adding together all your quarterly tax Distributions for the year (ignoring any required reductions for excess tax Distributions made in prior years), and subtracting the maximum tax Distribution that you would have been permitted to make based
upon a single computation performed for the entire fiscal year. The result, if greater than zero, is your excess tax Distribution for the year.
[61 FR 3189, Jan. 31, 1996, as amended at 63 FR 5871, Feb. 5, 1998; 64 FR 70996, Dec. 20, 1999]
§ 107.1560
Distributions by Licensee—required Distributions to private investors and SBA.
You must make Distributions under this § 107.1560 if you have outstanding Participating Securities or Earmarked Assets and you satisfy the conditions in paragraph (a) of this section. Distributions under this section are determined as of the end of each fiscal year. You must notify SBA of any planned distribution under this section 10 business days before the distribution date, unless SBA permits otherwise.
(a)
Conditions for making Distributions.
Distributions under this section are subject to the following conditions:
(1) You must have paid all Prioritized Payments, Adjustments and Charges, so that the balance in both your Distribution Account and your Accumulation Account is zero (see §§ 107.1520 and 107.1540).
(2) You must have made any permitted tax Distribution that you choose to make under § 107.1550.
(3) You must satisfy the liquidity requirement in § 107.1505.
(4) The amount you distribute under this section must not exceed your remaining Retained Earnings Available for Distribution.
(b)
Total amount you must distribute.
Unless SBA permits otherwise, the total amount you must distribute equals the result (if greater than zero) of the following computation:
(1) Your Retained Earnings Available for Distribution as of the end of your fiscal year, after giving effect to any Distribution under §§ 107.1540 and 107.1550; minus
(2) All previous Distributions under this section and § 107.1570(a) that were applied as redemptions or repayments of Leverage; plus
(3) All previous Distributions under § 107.1570(b) that reduced your Retained Earnings Available for Distribution.
(c)
When you must make Distributions.
You must make the required Distributions on either the first or second Payment Date following the end of your fiscal year.
(d)
Effect of Distributions on Retained Earnings Available for Distribution.
Distributions under this § 107.1560 have the following effect on your Retained Earnings Available for Distribution:
(1) All Distributions to private investors reduce Retained Earnings Available for Distribution.
(2) Distributions to SBA, or its designated agent or Trustee, reduce Retained Earnings Available for Distribution if they are applied as payments of Profit Participation or distributions on Preferred Securities (see paragraph (g) of this section).
(3) Distributions to SBA, or its designated agent or Trustee, do not reduce Retained Earnings Available for Distribution if they are applied as a repayment or redemption of Leverage (see paragraph (g) of this section).
(e)
SBA's share of the total Distribution.
Use the following table to determine the percentage share of the total Distribution (from paragraph (b) of this section) that goes to SBA (or its designated agent or Trustee):
SBA's Percentage Share of Total Distribution
If your ratio of Leverage to Leverageable Capital as of the fiscal period end is:
Then SBA's percentage share of the Distribution is:
Over 200%
[Leverage / (Leverage + Leverageable Capital)] × 100.
Over 100% but not over 200%
50%.
100% or less
Profit Participation Rate from § 107.1530.
(f)
Exceptions to the Distribution requirement.
(1) With SBA's prior written approval, you may withhold from distribution reasonable reserves necessary to protect your investments or relative position in Loans and Investments and to meet contingent liabilities.
(i) If you submit a written request for SBA approval, you may consider it approved unless SBA notifies you otherwise within 30 days from receipt.
(ii) Reserves that you withhold from distribution may not be used to make investments in additional portfolio companies.
(iii) Withholding of reserves under this paragraph (f)(1) is not a “payment failure” in violation of § 107.1820(e)(6).
(2) SBA may restrict Distributions under this § 107.1560 if SBA determines that the value of your assets is materially overstated. SBA must give you notice of such a determination in advance of your proposed Distribution.
(g)
How SBA will apply your Distributions.
Your Distributions to SBA (or its designated agent or Trustee) under this § 107.1560 will be applied in the following order:
(1) First, to Profit Participation;
(2) Second, to the extent there remain any Retained Earnings Available for Distribution, to distributions on Preferred Securities;
(3) Third, as a redemption of Participating Securities in order of issue;
(4) Fourth, as a redemption of Preferred Securities; and
(5) Fifth, as the repayment of principal of any outstanding Debentures, with such repayment to be made into escrow on terms and conditions SBA determines.

§ 107.1570
Distributions by Licensee—optional Distribution to private investors and SBA.
If you have outstanding Participating Securities or Earmarked Assets, you may make two types of optional Distributions under this § 107.1570: quarterly Distributions determined the same way as the required annual Distributions in § 107.1560, and Distributions allocated between SBA and your private investors in proportion to the capital contributions of each. You must notify SBA of any planned distribution under this section 10 business days before the distribution date, unless SBA permits otherwise.
(a)
Quarterly Distributions subject to conditions in § 107.1560.
(1) You may make Distributions under this paragraph (a) as of the end of any fiscal quarter, giving SBA (or its designated agent or Trustee) a percentage share determined under § 107.1560(e).

Other optional Distributions.
On any Payment Date, you may make additional Distributions to your private investors and to SBA (or its designated agent or Trustee) under this paragraph (b).
(1)
Conditions for making a Distribution.

SBA's share of Distribution.

Election to exclude pre-existing portfolio.
You may choose to exclude all (but not a portion) of your Loans and Investments as of March 31, 1993, from classification as Earmarked Assets if:
(1) The proceeds of your first issuance of Participating Securities are not used to refinance outstanding Debentures (see § 107.1585(a)). SBA will consider payment or prepayment of any outstanding Debenture to be a refinancing unless you demonstrate to SBA's satisfaction that you can pay the Debenture principal without relying on the proceeds of the Participating Securities.

(b)
Treatment of pre-existing portfolio if not excluded.
If you do not choose to exclude your Loans and Investments as of March 31, 1993, they will be Earmarked Assets for all purposes.

For purposes of this paragraph (d)(3), “limited scope audit” means auditing procedures sufficient to enable the independent public accountant to express an opinion on the Statement of Financial Position and the accompanying Schedule of Loans and Investments.

SBA authority to issue and guarantee Trust Certificates.
(a)
Authorization.
Sections 319(a) and (b) of the Act authorize SBA or its CRA to issue TCs, and SBA to guarantee the timely payment of the principal and interest thereon. Any guarantee by SBA of such TC is limited to the principal and interest due on the Debentures or the Redemption Price of and Prioritized Payments on Participating Securities in any Trust or Pool backing such TC. The full faith and credit of the United States is pledged to the payment of all amounts due under the guarantee of any TC.
(b)
Periodic exercise of authority.

(c)
SBA authority to arrange public or private fundings of Leverage.
SBA in its discretion may arrange for public or private financing under its guarantee authority. Such financing arranged by SBA may be accomplished by the sale of individual Debentures or Participating Securities, aggregations of Debentures or Participating Securities, or Pools or Trusts of Debentures or Participating Securities.
(d)

Formation of a Pool or Trust holding Leverage Securities.
SBA shall approve the formation of each Pool or Trust.

(c) Any prepayment of a Debenture or early redemption of a Participating Security pursuant to the terms of the Guaranty Agreement relating to such securities, shall reduce the SBA guarantee of timely payment of principal and interest on a TC in proportion to the amount of principal or Redemption Price that such prepaid Debenture or redeemed Participating Security represents in the Trust or Pool backing such TC.
(d) SBA shall be discharged from its guarantee obligation to the holder or holders of any TC, or any successor or transferee of such holder, to the extent of any such prepayment, whether or not such successor or transferee shall have notice of any such prepayment.
(e) Interest on prepaid Debentures and Prioritized Payments on Participating Securities shall accrue only through the date of such voluntary prepayment or SBA payment, as the case may be.
(f) In the event that all Debentures or Participating Securities constituting a Trust or Pool are prepaid, the TCs backed by such Trust or Pool shall be redeemed by payment of the unpaid principal and interest on the TCs;
Provided, however,
that in the case of the prepayment of a Debenture pursuant to the provisions of the Guaranty Agreement relating to the Debenture, the CRA shall pass through pro rata to the holders of the TCs any such prepayments including any prepayment penalty paid by the obligor Licensee pursuant to the terms of the Debenture.

The Articles of any Licensee issuing Debentures after April 25, 1994 must include the following provisions as a condition to the purchase or guarantee by SBA of such Leverage. Upon the occurrence of any of the events specified in paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(6) or (f)(1) through (f)(3) of this section as determined by SBA, SBA shall have the right, and your consent to SBA's exercise of such right:

# Computation of Licensee's Capital Impairment
§ 107.1830
Licensee's Capital Impairment—definition and general requirements.
(a)
Applicability of this section.
This section applies to Leverage issued on or after April 25, 1994. For Leverage issued before April 25, 1994, you must comply with paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section and the Capital Impairment regulations in this part in effect when you issued your Leverage. For all Leverage issued, you must also comply with any contractual provisions to which you have agreed.
(b)
Significance of Capital Impairment condition.
If you have a condition of Capital Impairment, you are not in compliance with the terms of your Leverage. As a result, SBA has the right to impose the applicable remedies for noncompliance in §§ 107.1810(g) and 107.1820(f).
(c)
Definition of Capital Impairment condition.
You have a condition of Capital Impairment if your Capital Impairment Percentage, as computed in § 107.1840, exceeds:
(1) For Section 301(d) Licensees, 75 percent.
(2) For Section 301(c) Licensees, the appropriate percentage from the following table:
Maximum Permitted Capital Impairment Percentages for Section 301(
c
) Licensees
If the percentage of equity capital investments (at cost) in your portfolio is:
And your ratio of outstanding leverage to leverageable capital is:
Then your maximum permitted capital impairment percentage is:
67%
100% or less
70
Over 100% but not over 200%
60
Over 200%
50
At least 40% but under 67%
100% or less
55
Over 100% but not over 200%
50
Over 200%
40
Under 40%
100% or less
45
Over 100% but not over 200%
40
Over 200%
35
(d)
Phase-in of maximum permitted Capital Impairment Percentages for Section 301(c) Licensees.
If you are a Section 301(c) Licensee, regardless of your maximum permitted Capital Impairment Percentage under paragraph (c) of this section, you will not have a condition of Capital Impairment if:
(1) Your Capital Impairment Percentage does not exceed 50 percent; and
(2) You have not reached your first fiscal year end occurring after April 25, 1995.
(e)
Quarterly computation requirement and procedure.
SBA will determine whether you have a condition of Capital Impairment as of the end of each fiscal quarter. If SBA finds you capitally impaired, they will notify you.
(f)
SBA's right to determine Licensee's Capital Impairment condition.
SBA may make its own determination of your Capital Impairment condition at any time.
[61 FR 3189, Jan. 31, 1996, as amended at 63 FR 5873, Feb. 5, 1998; 88 FR 46012, July 18, 2023]
§ 107.1840
Computation of Licensee's Capital Impairment Percentage.
(a)
General.
This section contains the procedures SBA will use to determine your Capital Impairment Percentage. SBA will compare your Capital Impairment Percentage to the maximum permitted under § 107.1830(c) to determine whether you have a condition of Capital Impairment.
(b)
Preliminary impairment test.
If you satisfy the preliminary impairment test, your Capital Impairment Percentage is zero and SBA will not have to perform any more procedures in this section. Otherwise, SBA will continue with paragraph (c) of this section. You satisfy the test if the following amounts are both zero or greater:
(1) The sum of Undistributed Net Realized Earnings, as reported on SBA Form 468, and Includible Non-Cash Gains.
(2) Unrealized Gain (Loss) on Securities Held.
(c)
How to compute Capital Impairment Percentage.
(1) If you have an Unrealized Gain on Securities Held, SBA will compute your Adjusted Unrealized Gain using paragraph (d) of this section. If you have an Unrealized Loss on Securities Held, SBA will continue with paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
(2) Add together your Undistributed Net Realized Earnings, your Includible Non-cash Gains, and either your Unrealized Loss on Securities Held or your Adjusted Unrealized Gain.
(3) If the sum in paragraph (c)(2) of this section is zero or greater, your Capital Impairment Percentage is zero.
(4) If the sum in paragraph (c)(2) of this section is less than zero, drop the negative sign, divide by your Regulatory Capital (excluding Treasury Stock), and multiply by 100. The result is your Capital Impairment Percentage.
(d)
How to compute your Adjusted Unrealized Gain.
(1) Subtract Unrealized Depreciation from Unrealized Appreciation. This is your “Net Appreciation”.
(2) Determine your Unrealized Appreciation on Publicly Traded and Marketable securities. This is your “Class 1 Appreciation”.
(3) Determine your Unrealized Appreciation on securities that are not Publicly Traded and Marketable and meet the following criteria, which must be substantiated to the satisfaction of SBA (this is your “Class 2 Appreciation”):
(i) The Small Business that issued the security received a significant subsequent equity financing by an investor whose objectives were not primarily strategic and at a price that conclusively supports the Unrealized Appreciation;
(ii) Such financing represents a substantial investment in the form of an arm's length transaction by a sophisticated new investor in the issuer's securities; and
(iii) Except as provided for Early Stage SBICs in § 107.1845, such financing occurred within 24 months of the date of the Capital Impairment computation, or the Small Business's pre-tax cash flow from operations for its most recent fiscal year was at least 10 percent of the Small Business's average contributed capital for such fiscal year.
(4) Except as provided for Early Stage SBICs in § 107.1845, perform the appropriate computation from the following table:
Adjusted Unrealized Gain Before Estimated Tax Effects
If:
And:
Then adjusted unrealized gain
before taxes is:
Class 1 Appreciation ≤Net Appreciation
Class 1 Appreciation + Class 2 Appreciation ≤Net Appreciation
(80% × Class 1 Appreciation) + (50% × Class 2 Appreciation).
Class 1 Appreciation ≤Net Appreciation
Class 1 Appreciation + Class 2 Appreciation
Net Appreciation
(80% × Class 1 Appreciation) + [(50% × (Net Appreciation − Class 1 Appreciation)].
Class 1 Appreciation
Net Appreciation
80% × Net Appreciation.
(5) Reduce the gain computed in paragraph (d)(4) of this section by your estimate of related future income tax expense. Subject to any adjustment required by paragraph (d)(6) of this section, the result is your Adjusted Unrealized Gain for use in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
(6) If any securities that are the source of either Class 1 or Class 2 Appreciation are pledged or encumbered in any way, SBA will reduce the Adjusted Unrealized Gain computed in paragraph (d)(5) of this section by the amount of the related borrowing or other obligation, up to the amount of the Unrealized Appreciation on the securities.
[61 FR 3189, Jan. 31, 1996, as amended at 77 FR 25054, Apr. 27, 2012; 88 FR 46013, July 18, 2023]
§ 107.1845
Determination of Capital Impairment Percentage for Early Stage SBICs.
This section applies to Early Stage SBICs only. Except as modified by this section, all provisions of § 107.1840 apply to an Early Stage SBIC.
(a) To determine your Class 2 Appreciation under § 107.1840(d)(3), SBA will use the following provisions instead of § 107.1840(d)(3)(iii):
(1) Such financing occurred within 24 months of the date of the Capital Impairment computation. At the end of the 24 month period following the financing, you may request SBA's written approval to retain the use of the original Class 2 Appreciation on the investment for up to 24 additional months.
(2) In considering your request, SBA may obtain its own valuation of the investment, require you to obtain a valuation performed by an independent third party acceptable to SBA, and may consider any other information that it deems relevant. To the extent that the valuation and any other relevant information conclusively support the original Class 2 appreciation, SBA may approve an extension to use all or part of the original Class 2 Appreciation for up to an additional 24 months (the “extension period”).
(3) At the end of any extension period, you may submit a new request to retain the use of the original Class 2 Appreciation, repeating the steps in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section.
(4) SBA may reconsider its approval to retain the use of the original Class 2 Appreciation at any time based on information that may affect the value of an investment.
(b) Any time you submit a request for SBA approval to retain the use of the original Class 2 Appreciation under paragraph (a) of this section, you may also request SBA's written approval to modify your computation of Adjusted Unrealized Gain under § 107.1840(d)(4) as provided in paragraph (c) of this section.
(c) If SBA determines that the appreciation on an investment, based on its current fair value, is at least two times the original Class 2 Appreciation on the investment, SBA may allow you, based on relevant information, to compute your Adjusted Unrealized Gain for the duration of the extension period as follows:
(1) Compute Adjusted Unrealized Gain in accordance with § 107.1840(d)(4).
(2) If your result in paragraph (c)(1) of this section was computed using the first line of the table in § 107.1840(d)(4):
(i) Calculate 50 percent of the original Class 2 Appreciation on the individual investment that is the subject of this paragraph (c), and
(ii) Add it to the result from paragraph (c)(1) of this section to determine your Adjusted Unrealized Gain.
(3) If your result in paragraph (c)(1) of this section was computed using the
second line of the table in § 107.1840(d)(4):
(i) Calculate 50 percent of the original Class 2 Appreciation on the individual investment that is the subject of this paragraph (c).
(ii) Subtract your Class 1 Appreciation from your Net Appreciation, and multiply the result by 50 percent.
(iii) Add the lesser of (c)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section to the result from paragraph (c)(1) of this section to determine your Adjusted Unrealized Gain.
[77 FR 25054, Apr. 27, 2012, as amended at 88 FR 46013, July 18, 2023]
§ 107.1850
Watchlist.
Under certain circumstances, SBA may place Licensees on a Watchlist as a process to increase proactive communication between SBA and the Licensee to help mitigate the potential for a future default or significant regulatory violation. Being on a Watchlist means that SBA has determined, based on certain triggers discussed in this section, a Licensee will provide a heightened level of reporting and communication with SBA.
(a)
Watchlist triggers.
SBA may place you on the Watchlist for any of the following:
(1) You perform an investment that is a direct violation of your fund's stated investment policy as identified in its limited partnership agreement (or other governing agreement) or as presented to SBA in its license application under § 107.300.
(2) The key person clause in your limited partnership agreement (or other governing agreement) is invoked due to a change in personnel of management team members identified as key persons.
(3) You or your General Partner has been named as a party in litigation proceedings brought by a Federal agency, involving felony charges, or allegations of dishonesty, fraud, or breach of fiduciary duty.
(4) You have violated a material provision in your limited partnership agreement (or other governing agreement) or any side letter agreement.
(5) You rank in the bottom quartile for the primary strategy benchmark, as identified by the Licensee at the time of licensure, by vintage year, defined as the year in which you were licensed as an SBIC, after three years based on the private investor's total value to paid-in capital (TVPI), where TVPI is calculated as (cumulative distributions to private investors plus net asset value minus expenses and carried interest)/cumulative private investor paid in capital.
(6) Your leverage coverage ratio (LCR) falls below 1.25, where LCR is calculated as ((Total Assets−Liabilities excluding SBA Leverage−Other Assets) + Unfunded Private Commitments)/Outstanding Leverage, or a Capital Impairment Percentage approaching your threshold set forth in § 107.1830.
(7) You default on your interest payment and fail to pay within 30 days of the date it is due. (
Note:
This event represents an event of default under § 107.1810(f) for which SBA maintains its rights under § 107.1810(g) if the Licensee does not cure to SBA's satisfaction.)
(8) Outstanding or unresolved regulatory matters.
(b)
Requirements for Licensees on the Watchlist.
If SBA places you on the Watchlist, you will be required to comply with any or all of the following:
(1) You must submit Portfolio Company Financing Reports (SBA Form 1031s), required under § 107.640, within 30 calendar days of the financing date.
(2) You must participate in monthly portfolio reviews with SBA.
(3) You must file quarterly valuation reports on specific or all of your portfolio company holdings, as requested by SBA.
(4) You must submit a letter formally requesting whether you may submit a request for a subsequent fund if you are currently on the Watchlist or have managed any Licensee on a Watchlist within the last 12 months. If you have already submitted a request or are otherwise in the Licensing process (see § 107.300), SBA may suspend processing your request until it is satisfied that SBA's concerns are resolved or otherwise disapprove your request for a subsequent fund. SBA maintains the right to deny approval of any request to submit a subsequent fund request or any subsequent fund request submitted under § 107.300.
(c)
Removal from the Watchlist.
SBA will remove you from the Watchlist if the event that triggered your addition to the Watchlist (see paragraph (a) in this section) is resolved to SBA's satisfaction. Accordingly, SBA may require any or all of the following resolutions:
(1) Successful completion of a portfolio review to confirm compliance of your adherence to your investment policy.
(2) SBA's written approval of your key person resolution.
(3) SBA's written acknowledgement of pending litigation.
(4) SBA's written consent to the resolution of the LPA or side letter violation.
(5) Two quarters of performance above a bottom quartile industry benchmark based on the TVPI by vintage year and strategy, as calculated under paragraph (a) of this section.
(6) Two quarters of consistent reporting of your LCR, as calculated under paragraph (a) of this section, exceeding 1.25.
(7) You are current on your Leverage interest payments.
(8) A completed regulatory examination acceptable to SBA.
(d)
Watchlist communications
—(1)
Notification to Licensee.
If you trigger any of the events under paragraph (a) of this section, SBA will notify you in writing that you have been placed on the Watchlist, identify the event(s) which triggered your placement on the Watchlist, the actions you must take as noted under paragraph (b) of this section, and the remedies as identified under paragraph (c) of this section.
(2)
Watchlist status disclosure.
SBA will not disclose your Watchlist status publicly.
(3)
Removal from Watchlist status notification.
SBA will provide you with written notice after SBA determines that you have resolved all matter identified in your notification letter and satisfied the applicable requirements set forth in paragraph (c) of this section.

# Subpart K—Ending Operations as a Licensee
§ 107.1900
Surrender of license.
You may not surrender your license without SBA's prior written approval. Your request for approval must be accompanied by an offer of immediate repayment of all of your outstanding Leverage (including any prepayment penalties thereon), or by a plan satisfactory to SBA for the orderly liquidation of the Licensee.

# Subpart L—Miscellaneous
§ 107.1910
Non-waiver of SBA's rights or terms of Leverage security.
SBA's failure to exercise or delay in exercising any right or remedy under the Act or the regulations in this part does not constitute a waiver of such right or remedy. SBA's failure to require you to perform any term or provision of your Leverage does not affect SBA's right to enforce such term or provision. Similarly, SBA's waiver of, or failure to enforce, any term or provision of your Leverage or of any event or condition set forth in § 107.1810 or § 107.1820 does not constitute a waiver of any succeeding breach of such term or provision or condition.
§ 107.1920
Licensee's application for exemption from a regulation in this part 107.
You may file an application in writing with SBA to have a proposed action exempted from any procedural or substantive requirement, restriction, or prohibition to which it is subject under this part, unless the provision is mandated by the Act. SBA may grant an exemption for such applicant, conditionally or unconditionally, provided the exemption would not be contrary to the purposes of the Act. Your application must be accompanied by supporting evidence which demonstrates to SBA's satisfaction that:
(a) The proposed action is fair and equitable; and
(b) The exemption requested is reasonably calculated to advance the best interests of the SBIC program in a manner consonant with the policy objectives of the Act and the regulations in this part.
§ 107.1930
Effect of changes in this part 107 on transactions previously consummated.
The legality of a transaction covered by the regulations in this part is governed by the regulations in this part in effect at the time the transaction was consummated, regardless of later changes. Nothing in this part bars SBA enforcement action with respect to any transaction consummated in violation of provisions applicable at the time, but no longer in effect.

(1) Upon written notice to you of the occurrence (as determined by SBA) of one or more of the events of default in paragraph (f) of this section, and subject to the conditions in paragraph (g)(2) of this section:
(i) SBA may declare the entire indebtedness evidenced by your Debentures, including accrued interest, and/ or any other amounts owed SBA with respect to your Debentures, immediately due and payable; and
(ii) SBA may avail itself of any remedy available under the Act, specifically including institution of proceedings for the appointment of SBA or its designee as your receiver under section 363(c) of the Act.
(2) SBA may invoke the remedies in paragraph (g)(1) of this section only if:
(i) It has given you at least 15 days to cure the default(s); and
(ii) You fail to cure the default(s) to SBA's satisfaction within the allotted time.
(h)
Repeated non-substantive violations.
If you repeatedly fail to comply with one or more of the non-substantive provisions of the Act or any non-substantive regulation promulgated under the Act, SBA, after written notification to you and until you cure such condition to SBA's satisfaction, may deny you additional Leverage and/or require you to take such actions as SBA may determine to be appropriate under the circumstances.
(i)
Consent to removal of officers, directors, or general partners and/or appointment of receiver.
The Articles of each NMVC Company must include the following provisions as a condition to the purchase or guarantee by SBA of Leverage. Upon the occurrence of any of the events specified in paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(6) or (f)(1) through (f)(3) of this section as determined by SBA, SBA shall have the right, and you consent to SBA's exercise of such right:
(1) With respect to a Corporate NMVC Company, upon written notice, to require you to replace, with individuals approved by SBA, one or more of your officers and/or such number of directors of your board of directors as is sufficient to constitute a majority of such board; or

# Computation of NMVC Company's Capital Impairment
§ 108.1830
NMVC Company's Capital Impairment definition and general requirements.
(a)
Significance of Capital Impairment condition.
If you have a condition of Capital Impairment, you are not in compliance with the terms of your Leverage. As a result, SBA has the right to impose the applicable remedies for noncompliance in § 108.1810(g).
(b)
Definition of Capital Impairment condition.
You have a condition of Capital Impairment if your Capital Impairment Percentage, as computed in § 108.1840, exceeds 70 percent.
(c)
Quarterly computation requirement and procedure.
You must determine whether you have a condition of Capital Impairment as of the end of each fiscal quarter. You must notify SBA promptly if you are capitally impaired.
(d)
SBA's right to determine NMVC Company's Capital Impairment condition.
SBA may make its own determination
of your Capital Impairment condition at any time.
§ 108.1840
Computation of NMVC Company's Capital Impairment Percentage.
(a)
General.
This section contains the procedures you must use to determine your Capital Impairment Percentage. You must compare your Capital Impairment Percentage to the maximum permitted under § 108.1830(b) to determine whether you have a condition of Capital Impairment.
(b)
Preliminary impairment test.
If you satisfy the preliminary impairment test, your Capital Impairment Percentage is zero and you do not have to perform any more procedures in this section. Otherwise, you must continue with paragraph (c) of this section. You satisfy the test if the following amounts are both zero or greater:
(1) The sum of Undistributed Net Realized Earnings, as reported on SBA Form 468, and Includible Non-Cash Gains.
(2) Unrealized Gain (Loss) on Securities Held.
(c)
How to compute your Capital Impairment Percentage.
(1) If you have an Unrealized Gain on Securities Held, compute your Adjusted Unrealized Gain using paragraph (d) of this section. If you have an Unrealized Loss on Securities Held, continue with paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
(2) Add together your Undistributed Net Realized Earnings, your Includible Non-cash Gains, and either your Unrealized Loss on Securities Held or your Adjusted Unrealized Gain.
(3) If the sum in paragraph (c)(2) of this section is zero or greater, your Capital Impairment Percentage is zero.
(4) If the sum in paragraph (c)(2) of this section is less than zero, drop the negative sign, divide by your Regulatory Capital (excluding Treasury Stock), and multiply by 100. The result is your Capital Impairment Percentage.
(d)
How to compute your Adjusted Unrealized Gain.
(1) Subtract Unrealized Depreciation from Unrealized Appreciation. This is your “Net Appreciation”.
(2) Determine your Unrealized Appreciation on Publicly Traded and Marketable securities. This is your ”Class I Appreciation”.
(3) Determine your Unrealized Appreciation on securities that are not Publicly Traded and Marketable and meet the following criteria, which must be substantiated to the satisfaction of SBA (this is your “Class 2 Appreciation”):
(i) The Small Business that issued the security received a significant subsequent equity financing by an investor whose objectives were not primarily strategic and at a price that conclusively supports the Unrealized Appreciation;
(ii) Such financing represents a substantial investment in the form of an arm's length transaction by a sophisticated new investor in the issuer's securities; and
(iii) Such financing occurred within 24 months of the date of the Capital Impairment computation, or the Small Business' pre-tax cash flow from operations for its most recent fiscal year was at least 10 percent of the Small Business' average contributed capital for such fiscal year.
(4) Perform the appropriate computation from the table in § 107.1840(d)(4) of this chapter.
(5) Reduce the gain computed in paragraph (d) (4) of this section by your estimate of related future income tax expense. Subject to any adjustment required by paragraph (d)(6) of this section, the result is your Adjusted Unrealized Gain for use in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
(6) If any securities that are the source of either Class 1 or Class 2 Appreciation are pledged or encumbered in any way, you must reduce the Adjusted Unrealized Gain computed in paragraph (d)(5) of this section by the amount of the related borrowing or other obligation, up to the amount of the Unrealized Appreciation on the securities.

# Subpart L—Ending Operations as a NMVC Company
§ 108.1900
Termination of participation as a NMVC Company.
You may not terminate your participation as a NMVC Company without
SBA's prior written approval. Your request for approval must be accompanied by an offer of immediate repayment of all of your outstanding Leverage (including any prepayment penalties thereon), or by a plan satisfactory to SBA for the orderly liquidation of the NMVC Company.

# Subpart M—Miscellaneous
§ 108.1910
Non-waiver of SBA's rights or terms of Leverage security.
SBA's failure to exercise or delay in exercising any right or remedy under the Act or the regulations in this part does not constitute a waiver of such right or remedy. SBA's failure to require you to perform any term or provision of your Leverage does not affect SBA's right to enforce such term or provision. Similarly, SBA's waiver of, or failure to enforce, any term or provision of your Leverage or of any event or condition set forth in § 108.1810 does not constitute a waiver of any succeeding breach of such term or provision or condition.
§ 108.1920
NMVC Company's application for exemption from a regulation in this part 108.
(a)
General.
You may file an application in writing with SBA to have a proposed action exempted from any procedural or substantive requirement, restriction, or prohibition to which it is subject under this part, unless the provision is mandated by the Act. SBA may grant an exemption for such applicant, conditionally or unconditionally, provided the exemption would not be contrary to the purposes of the Act.
(b)
Contents of application.
Your application must be accompanied by supporting evidence that demonstrates to SBA's satisfaction that:
(1) The proposed action is fair and equitable; and
(2) The exemption requested is reasonably calculated to advance the best interests of the NMVC program in a manner consistent with the policy objectives of the Act and the regulations in this part.
§ 108.1930
Effect of changes in this part 108 on transactions previously consummated.
The legality of a transaction covered by the regulations in this part is governed by the regulations in this part in effect at the time the transaction was consummated, regardless of later changes. Nothing in this part bars SBA enforcement action with respect to any transaction consummated in violation of provisions applicable at the time, but no longer in effect.
§ 108.1940
Procedures for designation of additional Low-Income Geographic Areas
(a)
General.
On its own initiative or upon written request by a Person which addresses the relevant factor(s) set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, SBA may consider whether to designate additional census tracts (or equivalent county divisions) as LI Areas.
(b)
Criteria.
SBA will consider one or more of the following factors in determining whether to designate a particular census tract (or equivalent county division) as an additional LI Area:
(1) A substantial number of Low-Income Individuals reside in that census tract (or equivalent county division).
(2) As adequately supported by studies or other analyses or reliable data, that census tract (or equivalent county division) has a pattern of unmet needs for investment capital.
(3) As adequately supported by studies or other analyses or reliable data, that census tract (or equivalent county division) has indications of economic distress.
(c)
Procedure for designation.
(1) If SBA decides to consider the designation of an additional LI Area, SBA will publish in the
Federal Register
a notice that it is considering such designation. SBA will advise the public that it will consider any comments supporting or opposing the designation, submitted within a specified time period.
(2) In making a final decision on whether to designate a particular census tract (or equivalent county division) as an additional LI Area, SBA will consider evidence submitted by any requester, SBA's own research, any
public comments submitted, and any other information deemed relevant by SBA.
(3) If SBA designates a particular census tract (or equivalent county division) as an additional LI Area, SBA will publish a notice in the
Federal Register
and, if appropriate, will amend this part to include the additional LI Area.

This reserve must be maintained at not less than 5% of the principal balance of all outstanding loans to Eligible Small Business Concerns made from the ILP Relending Fund. The AA/CA or designee may require the ILP Intermediary to maintain a larger loss reserve if the AA/CA determines that the ILP Intermediary's loss reserve level is potentially inadequate to protect SBA from loss.

Small business concerns and development companies which apply for or receive any financial assistance of the kind described in § 112.2(a) (1) and (2), including concerns which are identifiable beneficiaries of loans made under § 112.2(a)(2), may not discriminate on the grounds of race, color, or national origin in their employment practices. Such assistance is deemed to have as a primary objective the providing of employment. Where a primary objective of the Federal financial assistance is not to provide employment, but discrimination on the grounds of race, color, or national origin in the employment practices of the recipient or other persons subject to the regulation tends, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin, to exclude individuals from participation in, to deny them the
benefits of, or to subject them to discrimination under any program to which this regulation applies, the provisions of § 112.7(a) shall apply to the employment practices of the recipient or other persons subject to the regulation, to the extent necessary to assure equality of opportunity and nondiscriminatory treatment.
[38 FR 17934, July 5, 1973]
§ 112.5
Discrimination in providing financial assistance.
Development companies and small business investment companies which apply for or receive any of the financial assistance described in § 112.2(a) may not discriminate, on the ground of race, color or national origin, in providing financial assistance to small business concerns.
§ 112.6
Discrimination in accommodations or services.
Small business concerns which apply for or receive any financial assistance of the kind described in § 112.2(a)(1), concerns which are identifiable beneficiaries of loans made under § 112.2(a)(2), and physicians, hospitals, schools, libraries, and other individuals or organizations which apply for or receive financial assistance of the kind described in § 112.2(a)(5), may not discriminate in the treatment accommodations or services they provide to their patients, students, visitors, guests, members, passengers, or patrons in the conduct of such businesses or other enterprises, whether or not operated for profit.
[31 FR 2374, Feb. 4, 1966]
§ 112.7
Illustrative applications.
(a)
Employment.
The discrimination prohibited by § 112.4 includes but is not limited to any action (taken directly or through contractual or other arrangements) which subjects an individual to discrimination on the ground of race, color or national origin in any employment practice, including recruitment or recruitment advertising, employment, layoff or termination, upgrading, demotion, or transfer, rates of pay or other forms of compensation, and use of facilities.
(b)
Financial assistance.
The discrimination prohibited by § 112.5 includes but is not limited to the failure or refusal, because of the race, color, or national origin of a person, to extend a loan or equity financing to him or to any business concern of which he is an owner or employee; or, in the case of financing which has actually been extended, the failure or refusal, because of the race, color, or national origin of the borrower or of an owner or employee of the borrower, to accord the borrower fair treatment and the customary courtesies regarding such matters as default, grace periods and the like.
(c)
Accommodations or services.
The discrimination prohibited by § 112.6 includes but is not limited to the failure or refusal, because of the race, color, or national origin of a person, to accept him on a nonsegregated basis as a patient, student, visitor, guest, member, customer, passenger or patron.
(d)
Affirmative action.
(1) In some situations even though past discriminatory practices have been abandoned, the consequences of such practices continue to impede the full availability of equal opportunity. If the efforts required of the applicant or recipient under § 112.3(b)(3) to provide information as to the availability of equal opportunity, and the rights of individuals under this regulation, have failed to overcome these consequences, it will become necessary for such applicant or recipient to take additional steps to make equal opportunity fully available to racial and nationality groups previously subjected to discrimination.
(2) Even though an applicant or recipient has never used discriminatory policies, the opportunities in the business it operates may not in fact be equally available to some racial or nationality groups. In such circumstances a recipient may properly give special consideration to race, color, or national origin to make opportunity more widely available to such groups.
[30 FR 298, Jan. 9, 1965, as amended at 38 FR 17934, July 5, 1973]
§ 112.8
Assurances required.
An application for any of the financial assistance described in § 112.2(a) shall, as a condition to its approval and
the extension of such assistance, contain or be accompanied by an assurance that the recipient will comply with this part. Such an assurance shall contain provisions authorizing the acceleration of the maturity of the recipient's financial obligation to the SBA in the event of a failure to comply, and provisions which give the United States a right to seek judicial enforcement of the terms of the assurance. SBA shall specify the form of the foregoing assurance, and the extent to which like assurances will be required of contractors and subcontractors, transferees, successors in interest, and other participants.
[30 FR 298, Jan. 9, 1965, as amended at 68 FR 51349, Aug. 26, 2003]
§ 112.9
Compliance information.
(a)
Cooperation and assistance.
SBA shall to the fullest extent practicable seek the cooperation of applicants and recipients in obtaining compliance with this part and shall provide assistance and guidance to applicants and recipients to help them comply voluntarily with this part.
(b)
Compliance reports.
Each applicant or recipient shall keep such records and submit to SBA timely, complete and accurate compliance reports at such times, and in such form and containing such information, as SBA may determine to be necessary to enable SBA to ascertain whether the applicant or recipient has complied or is complying with this part. In the case of a small business concern which receives financial assistance from a development company or from a small business investment company, such concern shall submit to the company such information as may be necessary to enable the company to meet its reporting requirements under this part.
(c)
Access to sources of information.
Each applicant or recipient shall permit access by SBA during normal business hours to such of its books, records, accounts, and other sources of information, and its facilities as may be pertinent to ascertain compliance with this part. Where any information required of an applicant or recipient is in the exclusive possession of any other agency, institution or person and this agency, institution or person shall fail or refuse to furnish this information, the applicant or recipient shall so certify in its report and shall set forth what efforts it has made to obtain this information.
(d)
Information to the public.
Each recipient shall make available to persons entitled under the Act and under this part to protection against discrimination by the recipient such information as SBA may find necessary to apprise them of their rights to such protection.
[30 FR 298, Jan. 9, 1965, as amended at 38 FR 17934, July 5, 1973]
§ 112.10
Conduct of investigations.
(a)
Periodic compliance reviews.
SBA shall from time to time review the practices of recipients to determine whether they are complying with this part.
(b)
Complaints.
Any person who believes himself or any specific class of individuals to be subjected to discrimination prohibited by this part may, by himself or by a representative, file with SBA a written complaint. A complaint must be filed not later than 180 days from the date of the alleged discrimination, unless the time for filing is extended by SBA.
(c)
Investigations.
SBA will make a prompt investigation whenever a compliance review, report, complaint, or any other information indicates a possible failure to comply with this part. The investigation should include, where appropriate, a review of the pertinent practices and policies of the applicant or recipient, the circumstances under which the possible noncompliance with this part occurred, and other factors relevant to a determination as to whether the applicant or recipient has failed to comply with this part.
(d)
Resolution of matters.
(1) If an investigation pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section indicates a failure to comply with this part, SBA will so inform the applicant or recipient and the matter will be resolved by informal means whenever possible. If it has been determined that the matter cannot be resolved by informal means, action will be taken as provided for in § 112.11.
(2) If an investigation does not warrant action pursuant to paragraph
(d)(1) of this section, SBA will so inform the applicant or recipient and the complainant, if any, in writing.
(e)
Intimidatory or retaliatory acts prohibited.
No applicant or recipient or other person shall intimidate, threaten, coerce, or discriminate against any individual for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured by section 601 of the Act or by this part or because he has made a complaint, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this part. The identity of complainants shall be kept confidential except to the extent necessary to carry out the purposes of this part, including the conduct of any investigation, hearing, or judicial proceeding arising thereunder.
[30 FR 298, Jan. 9, 1965, as amended at 38 FR 17934, July 5, 1973]
§ 112.11
Procedure for effecting compliance.
(a)
General.
(1) If there appears to be a failure or threatened failure to comply with this part and if the noncompliance or threatened noncompliance cannot be corrected by informal means, compliance with this part may be effected by suspending, terminating, or refusing any financial assistance approved but not yet disbursed to an applicant or, in the case of a loan which has been partially disbursed, by refusing to make further disbursements. In addition, compliance may be effected by any other means authorized by law.
(2) Such other means may include but are not limited to (i) legal action by SBA to enforce its right, embodied in the assurances described in § 112.8, to accelerate the maturity of the recipient's obligation; (ii) a reference to the Department of Justice with a recommendation that appropriate proceedings be brought to enforce any rights of the United States under any law of the United States, including other titles of the Act; and (iii) any applicable proceedings under State or local law.
(b)
Noncompliance with § 112.8.
If an applicant fails or refuses to furnish an assurance required under § 112.8 or otherwise fails or refuses to comply with a requirement imposed by or pursuant to that section Federal financial assistance may be refused in accordance with the procedures of paragraph (c) of this section. SBA shall not be required to provide assistance in such a case during the pendency of the administrative proceedings under such paragraph except that SBA shall continue assistance during the pendency of such proceedings where such assistance is due and payable pursuant to an application therefor approved prior to the effective date of this part. Such proceedings shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of part 134 of this chapter by an Administrative Law Judge of the Office of Hearings and Appeals, who shall issue an initial decision in the case. The Administrator shall be the reviewing official for purposes of § 134.228. The applicant's failure to file a timely motion in accordance with §§ 134.222 and 134.211, requesting that the matter be scheduled for an oral hearing, shall constitute waiver of the right to an oral hearing but shall not prevent the submission of written information and argument for the record in accordance with the provisions of part 134.
(c)
Conditions precedent.
No order suspending, terminating, or refusing financial assistance shall become effective until (1) SBA has advised the applicant or recipient of his failure to comply and has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means; (2) there has been an express finding on the record after an opportunity for an oral hearing, of a failure by the applicant or recipient to comply with a requirement imposed by or pursuant to this part; (3) the initial decision has become final pursuant to § 134.227(b); and (4) the expiration of 30 days after SBA has filed with the committee of the House and the committee of the Senate having legislative jurisdiction of the form of financial assistance involved, a full written report of the circumstances and the grounds for such action.
(d)
Other means authorized by law.
No action to effect compliance by any other means authorized by law shall be taken until (1) SBA has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means; (2) the action has been approved by the Administrator or
his designee; (3) the applicant or recipient or other person has been notified of its failure to comply and of the action to be taken to effect compliance; and (4) the expiration of at least 10 days from the mailing of such notice to the applicant or recipient or other person. During this period of at least 10 days from the mailing of such notice to the applicant or recipient or other person. During this period of at least 10 days additional efforts shall be made to persuade the applicant or recipient or other person to comply with this part and to take such corrective action as may be appropriate.
[30 FR 298, Jan. 9, 1965, as amended at 38 FR 17934, July 5, 1973; 49 FR 33629, Aug. 24, 1984; 61 FR 2691, Jan. 29, 1996]
§ 112.12
Effect on other regulations; forms and instructions.
(a)
Effect on other regulations.
All regulations, orders or like directions heretofore issued by SBA which impose requirements designed to prohibit any discrimination against individuals on the grounds of race, color, or national origin and which authorize the suspension or termination of or refusal to grant to or to continue financial assistance to any applicant for or recipient of such assistance for failure to comply with such requirements, are hereby superseded to the extent that such discrimination is prohibited by this part, except that nothing in this part shall be deemed to relieve any person of any obligation assumed or imposed under any such superseded regulation, order, instruction, or like direction prior to the effective date of this part. Nothing in this part, however, shall be deemed to supersede any of the following (including future amendments thereof):
(1) Executive Order 11246 and regulations issued thereunder, or (2) any other orders, regulations or instructions, insofar as such order, regulations, or instructions prohibit discrimination on the grounds of race, color, or national origin in any program or situation to which this part is inapplicable or prohibit discrimination on any other ground.
(b)
Forms and instructions.
SBA shall issue and promptly make available to interested persons forms and detailed instructions and procedures for effectuating this part.
(c)
Supervision and coordination.
The Administrator may from time to time assign to officials of SBA or to officials of other agencies of the Government with the consent of such agencies, responsibilities in connection with the effectuation of the purpose of Title VI of the Act and this part (other than responsibility for final decision as provided in § 112.13), including the achievement of effective coordination and maximum uniformity within SBA and within the Executive Branch of the Government in the application of Title VI and this part to similar programs and in similar situations. Any action taken, determination made, or requirement imposed by an official of another Department or agency acting pursuant to an assignment of responsibility under this subsection shall have the same effect as though such action had been taken by the Administrator of SBA.

Purpose.
(a) Part 112 of this chapter, issued pursuant to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin by some recipients of financial assistance from SBA. The purpose of this part is to reflect to the fullest extent possible the nondiscrimination policies of the Federal Government as expressed in the several statutes, Executive Orders, and messages of the President dealing with civil rights and equality of opportunity, and in the previous determination of the Administrator of the Small Business Administration that discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, marital status, handicap or national origin shall be prohibited, to the extent that it is not prohibited by part 112 of this chapter, to all recipients of financial assistance from SBA.
(b) In accordance with Pub. L. 94-239, 15 U.S.C. 1691, cited as the Equal Credit Act Amendments of 1976, it is unlawful for any recipient creditor to discriminate against any applicant, with respect to any aspect of a credit transaction because of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age: (
Provided,
the applicant has the capacity to contract), because all or part of the applicant's income derives from any public assistance program, or because the applicant has in good faith exercised any right under the Consumer Credit Protection Act.
(c) It is the intention of the Administrator that the prohibitions in this part supplement those in part 112 of this chapter, that the two parts be read in pari materia, and that the procedures established herein be harmonized to the maximum extent feasible with those established in part 112 of this chapter.

§ 113.3
Discrimination prohibited.
To the extent not covered or prohibited by part 112 of this chapter, recipients of financial assistance may not:
(a) Discriminate with regard to goods, services, or accommodations offered or provided by the aided business or other enterprise, whether or not operated for profit, because of race, color, religion, sex, handicap, or national origin of a person, or fail or refuse to accept a person on a nonsegregated basis as a patient, student, visitor, guest, customer, passenger, or patron.
(b) With regard to employment practices within the aided business or other enterprise, whether or not operated for profit; fail or refuse, because of race, color, religion, sex or national origin of a person, to seek or retain the person's services, or to provide the person with opportunities for advancement or promotion, or accord an employee the rank and rate of compensation, including fringe benefits, merited by the employee's services and abilities.
(c) With regard to employment practices within the aided business or other enterprise, whether or not operated for profit; discriminate against a qualified handicapped person; or because of handicap, fail or refuse to seek or retain the person's services or to provide the person with opportunities for advancement or promotion, or accord an employee the rank and rate of compensation, including fringe benefits, merited by the employee's services and abilities. All employment decisions
shall be made in a manner which ensures that discrimination on the basis of handicap does not occur. Such decisions may not limit, segregate, or classify job applicants or employees in any way that adversely affects the opportunities or status of qualified handicapped individuals.
(d) Participate in a contractual or other relationship that has the effect of subjecting job applicants or employees to discrimination prohibited by this part. The relationships referred to in this paragraph include those with employment and referral agencies, labor unions, organizations providing or administering fringe benefits to employees of the recipient, and organizations providing training and apprenticeship programs. Activities covered by this part are as follows:
(1) Recruitment, advertising, and the processing of applications for employment;
(2) Hiring, upgrading, promotion, award of tenure, demotion, transfer, layoff, termination, right of return from layoff, and rehiring;
(3) Rates of pay or any other form of compensation and changes in compensation;
(4) Job assignments, job classifications, organizational structures, position descriptions, lines of progression, and seniority lists;
(5) Leaves of absence, sick leave, or any other leave;
(6) Fringe benefits available by virtue of employment, whether or not administered by the recipient;
(7) Selection and financial support for training, including apprenticeship, professional meetings, conferences, and other related activities, and selection for leaves of absence to pursue training;
(8) Employer sponsored activities, including social or recreational programs; and
(9) Any other term, condition, or privilege of employment.
(e) Use employment tests or criteria that discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, marital status, handicap, or national origin. Employment tests which are used for all other job applicants shall be adapted in an appropriate mode for use by persons who have handicaps that impair sensory, manual, or speaking skills.
(f) Conduct a preemployment medical examination, unless required of all job applicants, and subsequent to a conditional offer of employment. The results of all such medical examinations shall be kept confidential.
(g) Make a preemployment inquiry as to whether a job applicant is a handicapped person or as to the nature or severity of a handicap: EXCEPT when a recipient is taking remedial action to overcome the effects of conditions which resulted in past discrimination, or when a recipient is taking affirmative action pursuant to section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended.
(1) Such preemployment inquiry may only be made after the job applicant has been informed that such disclosure is for the purposes set forth in paragraph (g) of this section; that the disclosure is voluntary and will be kept confidential; and that refusal of the job applicant to provide such information will not subject the applicant to any adverse action.
(2) Information elicited from qualified handicapped job applicants concerning their medical history or condition shall be kept confidential EXCEPT that:
(i) Supervisors and managers may be informed about restrictions on or accommodations to be made for the qualified handicapped individual;
(ii) First aid and safety personnel may be informed, where appropriate, of the need for possible emergency treatment; and
(iii) Compliance officials shall be given relevant information, if requested.
(h) Discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, handicap or national origin in the use of toilets or any facilities for rest or comfort. Discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, handicap or national origin in the use of cafeterias, recreational programs or other programs sponsored by the applicant or recipient.
(i) With regard to all recipients offering credit, such as Small Business Investment Companies and Community Development Companies, discriminate against debtors on the basis of race,
color, religion, sex, marital status, handicap, or national origin.
(j) With regard to the granting of credit by all recipient creditors, discriminate against any credit applicant, with respect to any aspect of a credit transaction because of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, handicap, age (provided the applicant has the capacity to contract), because all or part of the applicant's income derives from any public assistance program, or because the applicant has in good faith exercised any right under the Consumer Credit Protection Act.
§ 113.3-1
Consideration of race, color, religion, sex, marital status, handicap, or national origin.
(a) This regulation does not prohibit the consideration of race, color, religion, sex, marital status, handicap, or national origin if the purpose and effect are to remove or overcome the consequences of practices or impediments which have restricted the availability of, or participation in, the program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance, on the grounds of race, color, religion, sex, marital status, handicap, or national origin. Where previous discriminatory practices or usage tends, on the grounds of race, color, religion, sex, marital status, handicap, or national origin, to exclude individuals from participation in, to deny them the benefits of, or to subject them to discrimination under any program or activity to which this regulation applies, the applicant or recipient has an obligation to take reasonable action to remove or overcome the consequences of the prior discriminatory practice or usage, and to accomplish the purposes of this regulation. All programs and activities shall be administered in the most integrated setting possible.
(b) Nothing in this part shall prohibit the restriction of certain jobs to members of one sex if a bona fide occupational qualification can be demonstrated by the applicant or recipient. Custom or tradition is not a bona fide occupational qualification.
(c) Recipients shall take steps to ensure that communications with job applicants and employees who have vision and/or hearing disabilities are available in appropriate modes.
(d) Recipients shall make reasonable accommodation to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified handicapped job applicant or employee UNLESS the recipient can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business. Factors to be considered in determining whether an accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of a recipient's business include:
(1) The overall size of the recipient's business with respect to number of employees, number and type of facilities, size of budget, and the financial condition of the business;
(2) The type of the recipient's operation, including the composition and structure of the recipient's workforce; and
(3) The nature and cost of the accommodation needed.
(e) Such accommodation may include making facilities used by employees readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons, job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, acquisition or modification of equipment or devices, the provision of readers or interpreters, and other similar actions.
(f) The final decision, when making a review or investigation of a complaint, as to whether an accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of a recipient business will be made by the compliance officials of the Small Business Administration.
(g) Recipients shall administer programs and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified handicapped persons, and shall not participate in a contractual relationship that has the effect of subjecting qualified handicapped job applicants or employees to discrimination prohibited by this part. The relationships referred to in this paragraph include those with referral agencies, labor unions, organizations providing or administering fringe benefits to employees of the recipient, and organizations providing training and apprenticeship programs.
(h) Nothing in this part shall apply to a religious corporation, association,
educational institution or society with respect to the membership or the employment of individuals of a particular religion to perform work connected with the carrying on by such corporation, association, educational institution or society of its religious activities.
§ 113.3-2
Accommodations to religious observance and practice.
A recipient of financial assistance must accommodate to the religious observances and practices of an employee or prospective employee unless the recipient demonstrates that it is unable to reasonably accommodate to an employee's or prospective employee's religious observance or practice without undue hardship on the conduct of the employer's business. As part of this obligation, recipient must make reasonable accommodations to the religious observances and practices of an employee or prospective employee who regularly observes Friday evening and Saturday, or some other day of the week, as Sabbath and/or who observes certain religious holidays during the year and who is conscientiously opposed to performing work or engaging in similar activity on such days, when such accommodations can be made without undue hardship on the conduct of the employer's business. In determining the extent of a recipient's obligations under this section, at least the following factors should be considered: (a) Business necessity, (b) financial costs and expenses, and (c) resulting personnel problems.
§ 113.3-3
Structural accommodations for handicapped clients.
(a)
Existing facilities.
Recipients in preexisting structures shall make their goods or services accessible to and usable by handicapped clients. Where structural changes are necessary to make the recipient's goods or services accessible, such changes shall be made as soon as practicable, but in no event later than three years after the effective date of this Regulation. A plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such structural changes shall be developed and submitted to SBA. If practical, interested persons, including handicapped persons or organizations representing handicapped persons, will be consulted.
(b)
Design, construction, and alteration.
New facilities shall be designed and constructed to be readily accessible to and usable by persons with handicaps. Alterations to existing facilities that affect usability shall, to the maximum extent feasible, be designed and constructed to be readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons.
(c)
Conformance with Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards.
(1) Effective as of January 18, 1991, design, construction, or alteration of buildings in conformance with sections 3-8 of the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS) (appendix A to 41 CFR subpart 101-19.6) shall be deemed to comply with the requirements of this section with respect to those buildings. Departures from particular technical and scoping requirements of UFAS by the use of other methods are permitted where substantially equivalent or greater access to and usability of the building is provided.
(2) For purposes of this section, section 4.1.6(1)(g) of UFAS shall be interpreted to exempt from the requirements of UFAS only mechanical rooms and other spaces that, because of their intended use, will not require accessibility to the public or beneficiaries or result in the employment or residence therein of persons with physical handicaps.
(3) This section does not require recipients to make building alterations that have little likelihood of being accomplished without removing or altering a load-bearing structural member.
[44 FR 20068, Apr. 4, 1979, as amended at 45 FR 81734, Dec. 12, 1980; 55 FR 52138, 52140, Dec. 19, 1990]
§ 113.4
Assurances required.
An application for financial assistance shall, as a condition to its approval and the extension of such assistance, contain or be accompanied by an assurance that the recipient will comply with this part. Such an assurance shall contain provisions authorizing the acceleration of the maturity of the recipient's financial obligations to SBA in the event of a failure to comply, and provisions which give the United States a right to seek judicial
enforcement of the terms of the assurance. SBA shall specify the form of the foregoing assurance for each program, and the extent to which like assurances will be required of contractors and subcontractors, transferees, successors in interest, and other participants in the program.
§ 113.5
Compliance information.
(a)
Cooperation and assistance:
SBA shall to the fullest extent practicable seek the cooperation of applicants and recipients in obtaining compliance with this part and shall provide assistance and guidance to applicants and recipients to help them comply voluntarily with this part. Recipients are expected to continually evaluate their compliance status, with the assistance of interested persons, including handicapped persons or organizations representing handicapped persons.
(b)
Compliance reports:
Each applicant or recipient shall keep such records and submit to SBA timely, complete and accurate compliance reports at such times, and in such form and containing such information, as SBA may determine to be necessary to enable SBA to ascertain whether the applicant or recipient has complied or is complying with this part. In the case of a small business concern which receives financial assistance from a development company or from a small business investment company, such concern shall submit to the company such information as may be necessary to enable the company to meet its reporting requirements under this part.
(c)
Access to sources of information:
Each applicant or recipient shall permit access by SBA during normal business hours to such of its books, records, accounts and other sources of information, and its facilities as may be pertinent to ascertain compliance with this part. Where any information required of an applicant or recipient is in the exclusive possession of any other agency, institution or person; and such agency, institution or person shall fail or refuse to furnish this information, the applicant or recipient shall so certify in its report and shall set forth what efforts it has made to obtain this information.
(d)
Information to the Public.
Each recipient shall make available to persons entitled under this part to protection against discrimination by the recipient such information as SBA may find necessary to apprise them of their rights to such protection.
(1) In some situations even though past discriminatory practices have been abandoned, the consequences of such practices continue to impede the full availability of equal opportunity. If the efforts required of the applicant or recipient under § 113.5(b) to provide information as to the availability of equal opportunity, and the rights of individuals under this regulation, have failed to overcome these consequences, it will become necessary for such applicant or recipient to take additional steps to make equal opportunity fully available to racial, qualified handicapped, nationality groups and persons who because of their sex were previously subjected to discrimination.
(2) Even though an applicant or recipient has never used discriminatory policies, the opportunities in the business it operates may not in fact be equally available to some racial, qualified handicapped, or nationality groups. In such circumstances a recipient may properly give special consideration to race, color, religion, sex, marital status, qualified handicap or national origin to make the opportunities more widely available to such groups.
§ 113.6
Conduct of investigations.
(a)
Periodic compliance reviews.
SBA shall from time to time review the practices of recipients to determine whether they are complying with this part.
(b)
Complaints.
Any person who believes that he, she or any class of individuals has been subjected to discrimination prohibited by this part may, personally or through a representative, file with SBA a written complaint. A complaint must be filed not later than 180 days from the date of the alleged discrimination, unless the time for filing is extended by SBA.
(c)
Investigations.
SBA will make a prompt investigation whenever a compliance review, report, complaint, or any other information indicates a possible failure to comply with this part.
The investigation should include, where appropriate, a review of the pertinent practices and policies of the applicant or recipient, the circumstances under which the possible noncompliance with this part occurred, and other factors relevant to a determination as to whether the applicant or recipient has failed to comply with this part.
(d)
Resolution of matters.
(1) If an investigation pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section indicates a failure to comply with this part, SBA will so inform the applicant or recipient and the matter will be resolved by informal means whenever possible. If it has been determined that the matter cannot be resolved by informal means, action will be taken as provided for in § 113.7.
(2) If an investigation does not warrant action pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this section, SBA will so inform the applicant or recipient and the complainant, if any, in writing.
(e)
Intimidatory or retaliatory acts prohibited.
No applicant or recipient or other person shall intimidate, threaten, coerce, or discriminate against any individual for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured by this part or because he has made a complaint, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this part. The identity of complainants shall be kept confidential except to the extent necessary to carry out the purposes of this part, including the conduct of any investigation, hearing, or judicial proceeding arising thereunder.
§ 113.7
Procedure for effecting compliance.
(a)
General.
(1) If there appears to be a failure or threatened failure to comply with this part and if the noncompliance or threatened noncompliance cannot be corrected by informal means, compliance with this part may be effected by suspending, terminating, or refusing any financial assistance approved but not yet disbursed to an applicant. In the case of loans partially or fully disbursed, compliance with this part may be effected by calling, canceling, terminating, accelerating repayment, or suspending in whole or in part the financial assistance provided. In addition compliance may be effected by any other means authorized by law.
(2) Such other means may include but are not limited to (i) legal action by SBA to enforce its rights, embodied in the assurances described in § 113.4; (ii) a reference to the Department of Justice with a recommendation that appropriate proceedings be brought to enforce any rights of the United States under any law of the United States; and (iii) any applicable proceedings under State or local law.
(b)
Noncompliance with § 113.4.
If an applicant fails or refuses to furnish an assurance required under § 113.4 or otherwise fails or refuses to comply with a requirement imposed by or pursuant to that section, Federal financial assistance may be refused in accordance with the procedures of paragraph (c) of this section. SBA shall not be required to provide assistance in such a case during the pendency of the administrative proceedings under such paragraph except that SBA shall continue assistance during the pendency of such proceedings where such assistance is due and payable pursuant to an application therefor approved prior to the effective date of this part. Such proceedings shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of part 134 of this chapter by an Administrative Law Judge of the Office of Hearings and Appeals, who shall issue an initial decision in the case. The Admininstrator shall be the reviewing official for purposes of § 134.228. The applicant's failure to file a timely motion in accordance with §§ 134.222 and 134.211, requesting that the matter be scheduled for an oral hearing, shall constitute waiver of the right to an oral hearing but shall not prevent the submission of written information and argument for the record in accordance with the provisions of part 134.
(c)
Condition precedent.
Under this part 113, no order suspending, terminating, refusing, calling, canceling, or accelerating repayment of financial assistance in whole or in part shall become effective until (1) SBA has advised the applicant or recipient of his failure to comply and has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means; (2) there has been an
express finding on the record after an opportunity for an oral hearing, of a failure by the applicant or recipient to comply with a requirement imposed by or pursuant to this part; and (3) the initial decision has become final pursuant to § 134.227(b).
(d) Other means authorized by law. No action to effect compliance by any other means authorized by law shall be taken until:
(1) SBA has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means.
(2) The action has been approved by the Administrator or the Administrator's designee.
(3) The applicant or recipient or other person has been notified of its failure to comply and of the action to be taken to effect compliance.
(4) The expiration of at least 10 days from the mailing of such notice to the applicant or recipient or other person. During this period of at least 10 days, additional efforts shall be made to persuade the applicant or recipient or other person to comply with this part and to take such corrective action as may be appropriate.
[44 FR 20068, Apr. 4, 1979, as amended at 49 FR 33629, Aug. 24, 1984; 61 FR 2691, Jan. 29, 1996]
§ 113.8
Effect on other regulations, forms and instructions.
(a)
Effect on other regulations.
All regulations, orders of like directions heretofore issued by SBA which impose requirements designed to prohibit any discrimination against individuals on the grounds of race, color, religion, sex, handicap, marital status, age, or national origin and which authorize the suspension or termination of a refusal to grant to or to continue financial assistance to any applicant for or recipient of such assistance for failure to comply with such requirements, are hereby superseded to the extent that such discrimination is prohibited by this part, except that nothing in this part shall be deemed to relieve any person of any obligation assumed or imposed under any such superseded regulation, order, instruction or like direction prior to the effective date of this part.
(b)
Forms and instructions.
SBA shall issue and promptly make available to interested persons forms and detailed instructions and procedures for effectuating this part.
(c)
Supervision and coordination.
The Administrator may from time-to-time assign to officials of SBA or to officials of other agencies of the Government, with the consent of such agencies, responsibilities in connection with the effectuation of the purposes of this part (other than responsibility of first decisions as provided in § 113.9) including the achievement of effective coordination and maximum uniformity within SBA and within the executive branch of the Government in the application of this part and of comparable regulations issued by other agencies of the Government to similar situations. Any action taken, determination made, or requirement imposed by an official of another department or agency acting pursuant to an assignment of responsibility under this subsection shall have the same effect as though such action had been taken by the Administrator of SBA.

An assurance of compliance with these Title IX regulations shall not be satisfactory to the designated agency official if the applicant or recipient to whom such assurance applies fails to commit itself to take whatever remedial action is necessary in accordance with § 113.110(a) to eliminate existing discrimination on the basis of sex or to eliminate the effects of past discrimination whether occurring prior to or subsequent to the submission to the designated agency official of such assurance.
(b)
Duration of obligation.

which it retains ownership or possession of the property.
(3) In all other cases such assurance shall obligate the recipient for the period during which Federal financial assistance is extended.
(c)
Form.
(1) The assurances required by paragraph (a) of this section, which may be included as part of a document that addresses other assurances or obligations, shall include that the applicant or recipient will comply with all applicable Federal statutes relating to nondiscrimination. These include but are not limited to: Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, as amended (20 U.S.C. 1681-1683, 1685-1688).
(2) The designated agency official will specify the extent to which such assurances will be required of the applicant's or recipient's subgrantees, contractors, subcontractors, transferees, or successors in interest.
§ 113.120
Transfers of property.
If a recipient sells or otherwise transfers property financed in whole or in part with Federal financial assistance to a transferee that operates any education program or activity, and the Federal share of the fair market value of the property is not upon such sale or transfer properly accounted for to the Federal Government, both the transferor and the transferee shall be deemed to be recipients, subject to the provisions of §§ 113.205 through 113.235(a).

(2) A recipient may require such a student to obtain the certification of a physician that the student is physically and emotionally able to continue participation as long as such a certification is required of all students for other physical or emotional conditions requiring the attention of a physician.
(3) A recipient that operates a portion of its education program or activity separately for pregnant students, admittance to which is completely voluntary on the part of the student as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, shall ensure that the separate portion is comparable to that offered to non-pregnant students.
(4) Subject to § 113.235(d), a recipient shall treat pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy and recovery therefrom in the same manner and under the same policies as any other temporary disability with respect to any medical or hospital benefit, service, plan, or policy that such recipient administers, operates, offers, or participates in with respect to students admitted to the recipient's educational program or activity.
(5) In the case of a recipient that does not maintain a leave policy for its students, or in the case of a student who does not otherwise qualify for leave under such a policy, a recipient shall treat pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy, and recovery therefrom as a justification for a leave of absence for as long a period of time as is deemed medically necessary by the student's physician, at the conclusion of which the student shall be reinstated to the status that she held when the leave began.
§ 113.450
Athletics.
(a)
General.
No person shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, be treated differently from another person, or otherwise be discriminated against in any interscholastic, intercollegiate, club, or intramural athletics offered by a recipient, and no recipient shall provide any such athletics separately on such basis.
(b)
Separate teams.
Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, a recipient may operate or sponsor separate teams for members of each sex where selection for such teams is based upon competitive skill or the activity involved is a contact sport. However, where a recipient operates or sponsors a team in a particular sport for members of one sex but operates or sponsors no such team for members of the other sex, and athletic opportunities for members of that sex have previously been limited, members of the excluded sex must be allowed to try out for the team offered unless the sport involved is a contact sport. For the purposes of these Title IX regulations, contact sports include boxing, wrestling, rugby, ice hockey, football, basketball, and other sports the purpose or major activity of which involves bodily contact.
(c)
Equal opportunity.
(1) A recipient that operates or sponsors interscholastic, intercollegiate, club, or intramural athletics shall provide equal athletic opportunity for members of both sexes. In determining whether equal opportunities are available, the designated agency official will consider, among other factors:
(i) Whether the selection of sports and levels of competition effectively accommodate the interests and abilities of members of both sexes;
(ii) The provision of equipment and supplies;
(iii) Scheduling of games and practice time;
(iv) Travel and per diem allowance;
(v) Opportunity to receive coaching and academic tutoring;
(vi) Assignment and compensation of coaches and tutors;
(vii) Provision of locker rooms, practice, and competitive facilities;
(viii) Provision of medical and training facilities and services;
(ix) Provision of housing and dining facilities and services;
(x) Publicity.
(2) For purposes of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, unequal aggregate expenditures for members of each sex or unequal expenditures for male and female teams if a recipient operates or sponsors separate teams will not constitute noncompliance with this section, but the designated agency official may consider the failure to provide necessary funds for teams for one sex in assessing equality of opportunity for members of each sex.
(d)
Adjustment period.
A recipient that operates or sponsors interscholastic, intercollegiate, club, or intramural athletics at the elementary school level shall comply fully with this section as expeditiously as possible but in no event later than one year from September 29, 2000. A recipient that operates or sponsors interscholastic, intercollegiate, club, or intramural athletics at the secondary or postsecondary school level shall comply fully with this section as expeditiously as possible but in no event later than three years from September 29, 2000.
§ 113.455
Textbooks and curricular material.
Nothing in these Title IX regulations shall be interpreted as requiring or prohibiting or abridging in any way the use of particular textbooks or curricular materials.

§ 113.500
Employment.
(a)
General.
(1) No person shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination in employment, or recruitment, consideration, or selection therefor, whether full-time or part-time, under any education program or activity operated by a recipient that receives Federal financial assistance.
(2) A recipient shall make all employment decisions in any education program or activity operated by such recipient in a nondiscriminatory manner and shall not limit, segregate, or classify applicants or employees in any way that could adversely affect any applicant's or employee's employment opportunities or status because of sex.

(4) A recipient shall not grant preferences to applicants for employment on the basis of attendance at any educational institution or entity that admits as students only or predominantly members of one sex, if the giving of such preferences has the effect of discriminating on the basis of sex in violation of these Title IX regulations.

(b)
Recruitment patterns.
A recipient shall not recruit primarily or exclusively at entities that furnish as applicants only or predominantly members of one sex if such actions have the effect of discriminating on the basis of sex in violation of §§ 113.500 through 113.550.

Compensation.
A recipient shall not make or enforce any policy or practice that, on the basis of sex:

A recipient shall not:
(a) Classify a job as being for males or for females;
(b) Maintain or establish separate lines of progression, seniority lists, career ladders, or tenure systems based on sex; or

§ 113.525
Fringe benefits.
(a)
“Fringe benefits” defined.
For purposes of these Title IX regulations,

§ 113.530
Marital or parental status.
(a)
General.
A recipient shall not apply any policy or take any employment action:
(1) Concerning the potential marital, parental, or family status of an employee or applicant for employment that treats persons differently on the basis of sex; or
(2) Which is based upon whether an employee or applicant for employment is the head of household or principal wage earner in such employee's or applicant's family unit.
(b)
Pregnancy.
A recipient shall not discriminate against or exclude from employment any employee or applicant for employment on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy, or recovery therefrom.
(c)
Pregnancy as a temporary disability.
Subject to § 113.235(d), a recipient shall treat pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy, recovery therefrom, and any temporary disability resulting therefrom as any other temporary disability for all job-related purposes, including commencement, duration, and extensions of leave, payment of disability income, accrual of seniority and any other benefit or service, and reinstatement, and under any fringe benefit offered to employees by virtue of employment.
(d)
Pregnancy leave.
In the case of a recipient that does not maintain a leave policy for its employees, or in the case of an employee with insufficient leave or accrued employment time to qualify for leave under such a policy, a recipient shall treat pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy, and recovery therefrom as a justification for a leave of absence without pay for a reasonable period of time, at the conclusion of which the employee shall be reinstated to the status that she held when the leave began or to a comparable position, without decrease in rate of compensation or loss of promotional opportunities, or any other right or privilege of employment.
§ 113.535
Effect of state or local law or other requirements.
(a)
Prohibitory requirements.
The obligation to comply with §§ 113.500 through 113.550 is not obviated or alleviated by the existence of any State or local law or other requirement that imposes prohibitions or limits upon employment of members of one sex that are not imposed upon members of the other sex.
(b)
Benefits.
A recipient that provides any compensation, service, or benefit to members of one sex pursuant to a State or local law or other requirement shall provide the same compensation, service, or benefit to members of the other sex.
§ 113.540
Advertising.
A recipient shall not in any advertising related to employment indicate preference, limitation, specification, or discrimination based on sex unless sex is a bona fide occupational qualification for the particular job in question.
§ 113.545
Pre-employment inquiries.
(a)
Marital status.
A recipient shall not make pre-employment inquiry as to the marital status of an applicant for employment, including whether such applicant is “Miss” or “Mrs.”
(b)
Sex.
A recipient may make pre-employment inquiry as to the sex of an applicant for employment, but only if such inquiry is made equally of such applicants of both sexes and if the results of such inquiry are not used in connection with discrimination prohibited by these Title IX regulations.
§ 113.550
Sex as a bona fide occupational qualification.
A recipient may take action otherwise prohibited by §§ 113.500 through 113.550 provided it is shown that sex is a bona fide occupational qualification for that action, such that consideration of sex with regard to such action is essential to successful operation of the employment function concerned. A recipient shall not take action pursuant to this section that is based upon alleged comparative employment characteristics or stereotyped characterizations of one or the other sex, or upon preference based on sex of the recipient, employees, students, or other persons, but nothing contained in this section shall prevent a recipient from considering an employee's sex in relation
to employment in a locker room or toilet facility used only by members of one sex.

[61 FR 2401, Jan. 26, 1996, as amended at 64 FR 40283, July 26, 1999]
§ 114.106
What if my claim exceeds $5,000?
The District Counsel or Disaster Area Counsel, as appropriate, must review and investigate your claim and forward it with a report and recommendation to the Associate General Counsel for Litigation, who may approve or deny an award, compromise, or settlement of claims in excess of $5,000, but not exceeding $25,000.

(b) SBA must consult with the Department of Justice before adjusting, determining, compromising, or settling a claim whenever the General Counsel or designee determines:
(1) The claim involves a new precedent or a new point of law; or
(2) The claim involves or may involve a question of policy; or
(3) The United States is or may be entitled to indemnity or contribution from a third party and SBA is unable to adjust the third party claim; or

What if my claim is approved?
SBA will notify you in writing if it approves your claim. The District Counsel or Disaster Area Counsel investigating your claim will forward to you, your agent or legal representative the forms necessary to indicate satisfaction of your claim and your acceptance of the payment. Acceptance by you, your agent or your legal representative of any award, compromise or settlement releases all your claims against the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act. This means that it binds you, your agent or your legal representative, and any other person on whose behalf or for whose benefit the claim was presented. It also constitutes a complete release of your claim against the United States and its employees. If you are represented by counsel, SBA will designate you and your counsel as joint payees and will deliver the check to counsel. Payment is contingent upon the waiver of your claim and is subject to the availability of appropriated funds.
[64 FR 40283, July 26, 1999]
§ 114.109
What if my claim is denied?
SBA will notify you or your agent or legal representative in writing by certified or registered mail if it denies your claim. You have a right to file suit in an appropriate U.S. District Court not later than six months after the date the notification was mailed.

# Subpart B—Representation and Indemnification of SBA Employees
§ 114.110
What is SBA's policy with respect to indemnifying and providing legal representation to SBA employees?
(a) If an SBA employee engages in conduct, within the scope of his or her employment, which gives rise to a claim, and the SBA Administrator or designee determines that any of the following actions relating to the claim are in SBA's interest, SBA may:
(1) Indemnify the employee after a verdict, judgment, or other monetary award is rendered personally against the employee in any civil suit in state or federal court or any arbitration proceeding;
(2) Settle or compromise the claim; and/or
(3) Pay for, or request that the Department of Justice provide, legal representation to the employee once personally named in such a suit.
(b) If you are an SBA employee, you may ask SBA to settle or compromise your claim, provide you with legal representation, or provide you with indemnification for a verdict, judgment or award entered against you in a suit. To do so, you must submit a timely, written request to the General Counsel, with appropriate documentation, including copies of any pleadings, verdict, judgment, award, or settlement proposal. The General Counsel will decide all requests for representation or settlement, and will forward to the Administrator, with the accompanying documentation and a recommendation, any requests for indemnification.
(c) Any payments by SBA under this section will be contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds.
§ 114.111
Does the attorney-client privilege apply when SBA employees are represented by the Government?
When attorneys employed by SBA participate in any process in which SBA seeks to determine whether SBA should request the Department of Justice to provide representation to an SBA employee sued, subpoenaed, or charged in his or her individual capacity, or whether attorneys employed by
SBA should provide representational assistance for such an employee, those attorneys undertake a full and traditional attorney-client relationship with the employee with respect to the attorney-client privilege. If representation is authorized, SBA attorneys who assist in the representation of an SBA employee also undertake a full and traditional attorney-client relationship with the employee with respect to the attorney-client privilege. Unless authorized by the employee, the attorney must not disclose to anyone other than attorneys also responsible for the employee's representation information communicated to the attorney by the client-employee during the course of the attorney-client relationship. The attorney-client privilege will continue with respect to that information whether or not representation is provided, and even if the employee's representation is denied or discontinued.

§ 115.11
Applying to participate in the Surety Bond Guarantee Program.
Sureties interested in participating as Prior Approval Sureties or PSB Sureties should apply in writing to the D/SG at 409 3rd Street, SW., Washington, DC 20416. OSG will determine the eligibility of the applicant considering its standards and procedures for underwriting, administration, claims and recovery. Each applicant must be a corporation listed by the U.S. Treasury as eligible to issue bonds in connection with Federal procurement contracts. At a minimum, each applicant must have salaried staff that is employed directly (not an agent or other individual or entity under contract with the applicant) to oversee its underwriting function and perform all claims and recovery functions other than specialized services the costs of which may be reimbursable under 13 CFR 115.16(e)(1). Final settlement authority for claims and recovery must be vested only in the applicant's salaried claims staff. The applicant must continue to comply with SBA's standards and procedures for underwriting, administration, claims, recovery, and staffing requirements while participating in SBA's Surety Bond Guarantee Programs.
[61 FR 3271, Jan. 31, 1996, as amended at 81 FR 23565, Apr. 22, 2016]
§ 115.12
General program policies and provisions.
(a)
Description of Surety Bond Guarantee Programs.
SBA guarantees Sureties participating in the Surety Bond Guarantee Programs against a portion of their Losses incurred and paid as a result of a Principal's breach of the terms of a Bid Bond, Final Bond or Ancillary Bond, on any eligible Contract. In the Prior Approval Program, the Surety must obtain SBA's approval before a guaranteed bond can be issued. In the PSB Program, selected Sureties may issue, monitor, and service SBA guaranteed bonds without further SBA approval.
(b)
Eligibility of bonds.
Bid Bonds and Final Bonds are eligible for an SBA guarantee if they are executed in connection with an eligible Contract, as defined in § 115.10, Definitions. Commercial and Fidelity bonds are not eligible for SBA guarantees. Ancillary Bonds may also be eligible for SBA's guarantee. A performance bond must not prohibit a Surety from performing the Contract upon default of the Principal.
(c)
Expiration of Bid Bond Guarantee.
A Bid Bond guarantee expires 120 days after Execution of the Bid Bond, unless
the Surety notifies SBA in writing before the 120th day that a later expiration date is required. The notification must include the new expiration date.
(d)
Guarantee agreement.
The terms and conditions of SBA's bond guarantee agreements, including the guarantee percentage, may vary from Surety to Surety, depending on past experience with SBA. If the guarantee percentage is not fixed by the Investment Act, it is determined by OSG after considering, among other things, the rating or ranking assigned to the Surety by recognized authority, and the Surety's Loss rate, average Contract amount, average bond penalty per guaranteed bond, and ratio of Bid Bonds to Final Bonds, all in comparison with other Sureties participating in the same SBA Surety Bond Guarantee Program (Prior Approval or PSB) to a comparable degree. Any guarantee agreement under this part is made exclusively for the benefit of SBA and the Surety, and does not confer any rights (such as a right of action against SBA) or benefits on any other party.
(e)
Amount of Contract
—(1)
Determination of Amount of Contract.
For a fixed price Contract, the amount of the Contract is the price excluding any options. For a requirements Contract, the amount of the Contract is the price of the total estimated quantity to be ordered under the Contract. For an indefinite quantity Contract, the amount of the Contract is the price of the specified minimum quantity to be ordered under the Contract and, for each Order issued under such Contract, the price of each such Order. The amount of the Contract or Order to be bonded must not exceed the Applicable Statutory Limit as of the date:
(i) SBA approves a Prior Approval Surety's request for a Bid Bond guarantee;
(ii) A Preferred Surety Executes a Bid Bond; or
(iii) The date Final Bonds (and any Ancillary Bonds) unrelated to an SBA-guaranteed Bid Bond are Executed by a Preferred Surety or by a Prior Approval Surety following SBA's approval of its request for a guarantee of Final Bonds.
(2)
Aggregation of Contract and Order amounts.
(i) The amounts of two or more formally separate Contracts for a single construction project are aggregated to determine the Contract amount unless the Contracts are to be performed in phases and the prior bond is released before the beginning of each succeeding phase. A bond may be considered released even if the warranty period it is covering has not yet expired. For purposes of this paragraph, a “single construction project” means one represented by two or more Contracts of one Principal or its Affiliates with one Obligee or its Affiliates for performance at the same location, regardless of job title or nature of the work to be performed.
(ii) The amounts of two or more Contracts or Orders for supplies and services awarded to the same Principal or its Affiliates are aggregated to determine the Contract or Order amount if SBA determines, after discussion with the contracting official responsible for the award of the contract, that award of a single Contract or Order could reasonably have satisfied the supply or service requirement at the time of issuance.
(3)
Federal Contracts or Orders in excess of $9,000,000
(
as adjusted for inflation in accordance with section 1908 of title 41, United States Code
). SBA is authorized to guarantee bonds on Federal Contracts or Orders greater than $9,000,000 (as adjusted for inflation in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 1908), but not exceeding $14 million, upon a signed certification of a Federal contracting officer that the SBA guarantee is necessary. The certification must be either express mailed to SBA, Office of Surety Guarantees, 409 Third Street SW, Washington, DC 20416 or sent by email to
suretybonds@sba.gov,
and include the following additional information:
(i) Name, address and telephone number of the small business;
(ii) Offer or Contract number and brief description of the contract; and
(iii) Estimated Contract value and date of anticipated award determination.
(4)
Alternative authority to guarantee bonds for Contracts and Orders related to a major disaster area.
Subject to the availability of funds appropriated in advance specifically for the purpose of guaranteeing bonds for any Contract or
Order related to a major disaster, SBA may, as an alternative to the authority otherwise set forth in this Part, guarantee bonds on any Contract or Order under the following terms and conditions:
(i) The Contract or Order does not exceed $5,000,000 at the time of bond execution, and:
(A) For products or services procured under a Federal Contract or Order, the products will be manufactured or the services will be performed in the major disaster area identified in the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Web site at
http://www.fema.gov,
or the products will be manufactured or the services will be performed outside the major disaster area and the products or services will directly assist in the recovery efforts in the major disaster area; or
(B) For products or services procured under any other Contract or Order, the products will be manufactured or the services will be performed in the major disaster area identified in the FEMA Web site at
http://www.fema.gov;
(ii) At the request of the Head of the Agency involved in reconstruction efforts in response to a major disaster, SBA may guarantee bonds on Federal Contracts or Orders in excess of $5,000,000, but not more than $10,000,000;
(iii) A guarantee may be issued under this paragraph (e)(4) for any Contract or Order for which an offer is submitted or an award is made within 12 months from the date an area is designated a major disaster area in the
Federal Register.
SBA may, at its discretion, extend this time period for any particular disaster, and will publish a notice of the extension in the
Federal Register.
(f)
Transfers or sales by Surety.
Sureties must not sell or otherwise transfer their files or accounts, whether before or after a default by the Principal has occurred, without the prior written approval of SBA. A violation of this provision is grounds for termination from participation in the program. This provision does not apply to the sale of an entire business division, subsidiary or operation of the Surety.
[61 FR 3271, Jan. 31, 1996, as amended at 66 FR 30804, June 8, 2001; 74 FR 36109, July 22, 2009; 76 FR 2572, Jan. 14, 2011; 79 FR 2086, Jan. 13, 2014; 87 FR 48083, Aug. 8, 2022; 89 FR 11712, Feb. 15, 2024]
§ 115.13
Eligibility of Principal.
(a)
General eligibility.
In order to be eligible for a bond guaranteed by SBA, the Principal must comply with the following requirements:
(1)
Size.
Together with its Affiliates, it must qualify as a small business under part 121 of this title.
(2)
Character.
It must possess good character and reputation. A Principal meets this standard if each owner of 20% or more of its equity, and each of its officers, directors, or general partners, possesses good character and reputation. A Person's good character and reputation is presumed absent when:
(i) The Person is currently incarcerated, serving a sentence of imprisonment imposed upon adjudication of guilty, or under indictment for a felony; or
(ii) A regulatory authority has revoked, canceled, or suspended a license of the Person which is necessary to perform the Contract; or
(iii) The Person has obtained a bond guarantee by fraud or material misrepresentation (as described in § 115.19(b)), or has failed to keep the Surety informed of unbonded contracts or of a contract bonded by another Surety, as required by a bonding line commitment under § 115.33.
(3)
Need for bond.
It must certify that a bond is expressly required by the bid solicitation or the original Contract in order to bid on the Contract or to serve as a prime contractor or subcontractor.
(4)
Availability of bond.
It must certify that a bond is not obtainable on reasonable terms and conditions without SBA's guarantee.
(5)
Partial subcontract.
It must certify the percentage of work under the Contract to be subcontracted. SBA will not guarantee bonds for Principals who are primarily brokers. In addition, the Principal must retain full responsibility for the oversight and management of the Contract, including any work performed by any subcontractor,
and may not subcontract the full scope of the statement of work.
(6)
Debarment.
It must certify that the Principal is not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, declared ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from transactions with any Federal department or agency, under governmentwide debarment and suspension rules.
(7)
No loss of eligibility.
Neither the Principal nor any of its Affiliates is ineligible for an SBA-guaranteed bond under § 115.14.
(b)
Conflict of interest.
A Principal is not eligible for an SBA-guaranteed bond issued by a particular Surety if that Surety, or an Affiliate of that Surety, or a close relative or member of the household of that Surety or Affiliate owns, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the Principal. This prohibition also applies to ownership interests in any of the Principal's Affiliates.
[61 FR 3271, Jan. 31, 1996, as amended at 79 FR 2087, Jan. 13, 2014; 81 FR 23565, Apr. 22, 2016; 89 FR 34101, Apr. 30, 2024]
§ 115.14
Loss of Principal's eligibility for future assistance and reinstatement of Principal.
(a)
Ineligibility.
A Principal and its Affiliates lose eligibility for further SBA bond guarantees if any of the following occurs under an SBA-guaranteed bond issued on behalf of the Principal:
(1) Legal action under the guaranteed bond has been initiated.
(2) The Obligee has declared the Principal to be in default under the Contract.
(3) The Surety has established a claim reserve for the bond of at least $10,000.
(4) The Principal, or any of its Affiliates, has defaulted on an SBA-guaranteed bond resulting in a Loss that has not been fully reimbursed to SBA, or SBA has not been fully reimbursed for any Imminent Breach payments.
(5) The guarantee fee has not been paid by the Principal.
(6) The Principal committed fraud or material misrepresentation in obtaining the guaranteed bond.
(b)
Reinstatement of Principal's eligibility.
At any time after a Principal becomes ineligible for further bond guarantees under paragraph (a) of this section:
(1) A Prior Approval Surety may recommend that such Principal's eligibility be reinstated, and OSG may agree to reinstate the Principal if:
(i) The Surety has settled its claim with the Principal, or any of its Affiliates, for an amount that results in no Loss to SBA or in no amount owed for Imminent Breach payments, or OSG finds good cause for reinstating the Principal notwithstanding the Loss to SBA or amount owed for Imminent Breach payments; or
(ii) OSG and the Surety determine that further bond guarantees are appropriate after the Principal was deemed ineligible for further SBA bond guarantees under paragraph (a)(1), (2), (3), (5) or (6) of this section.
(2) A PSB Surety may:
(i) Recommend that such Principal's eligibility be reinstated, and OSG may agree to reinstate the Principal, if the Surety has settled its claim with the Principal, or any of its Affiliates, for an amount that results in no Loss to SBA or in no amount owed for Imminent Breach payments, or OSG finds good cause for reinstating the Principal notwithstanding the Loss to SBA or amount owed for Imminent Breach payments; or
(ii) Reinstate a Principal's eligibility upon the Surety's determination that further bond guarantees are appropriate after the Principal was deemed ineligible for further SBA bond guarantees under paragraph (a)(1), (2), (3), (5) or (6) of this section.
(c)
Underwriting after reinstatement.
A guarantee application submitted after reinstatement of the Principal's eligibility is subject to a very stringent underwriting review.
[61 FR 3271, Jan. 31, 1996, as amended at 81 FR 23565, Apr. 22, 2016; 87 FR 48084, Aug. 8, 2022]
§ 115.15
Underwriting and servicing standards.
(a)
Underwriting.
(1) Sureties must evaluate the credit, capacity, and character of a Principal using standards generally accepted by the surety industry and in accordance with SBA's Standard Operating Procedures on underwriting and the Surety's principles
and practices on unguaranteed bonds. The Principal must satisfy the eligibility requirements set forth in § 115.13. The Surety must reasonably expect that the Principal will successfully perform the Contract to be bonded.
(2) The terms and conditions of the bond and the Contract must be reasonable in light of the risks involved and the extent of the Surety's participation. The bond must satisfy the eligibility requirements set forth in § 115.12(b). The Surety must be satisfied as to the reasonableness of cost and the feasibility of successful completion of the Contract.
(b)
Servicing.
The Surety must ensure that the Principal remains viable and eligible for SBA's Surety Bond Guarantee Program, must monitor the Principal's progress on bonded Contracts guaranteed by SBA, and must request job status reports from Obligees of Final Bonds guaranteed by SBA. Documentation of the job status requests must be maintained by the Surety.
§ 115.16
Determination of Surety's Loss.
Loss is determined as follows:
(a)
Loss under a Bid Bond
is the lesser of the penal sum or the amount which is the difference between the bonded bid and the next higher responsive bid. In either case, the Loss is reduced by any amounts the Surety recovers by reason of the Principal's defenses against the Obligee's demand for performance by the Principal and any sums the Surety recovers from indemnitors and other salvage.
(b)
Loss under a Payment Bond
is, at the Surety's option, the sum necessary to pay all just and timely claims against the Principal for the value of labor, materials, equipment and supplies furnished for use in the performance of the bonded Contract and other covered debts, or the penal sum of the Payment Bond. In either case, the Loss includes interest (if any), but Loss is reduced by any amounts recovered (through offset or otherwise) by reason of the Principal's claims against laborers, materialmen, subcontractors, suppliers, or other rightful claimants, and by any amounts recovered from indemnitors and other salvage.
(c)
Loss under a Performance Bond
is, at the Surety's option, the sum necessary to meet the cost of fulfilling the terms of a bonded Contract or the penal sum of the bond. In either case, the Loss includes interest (if any), but Loss is reduced by any amounts recovered (through offset or otherwise) by reason of the Principal's defenses or causes of action against the Obligee, and by any amounts recovered from indemnitors and other salvage.
(d)
Loss under an Ancillary Bond
is the amount covered by such bond which is attributable to the Contract for which guaranteed Final Bonds were Executed.
(e)
Loss includes
the following expenses if they are itemized, documented and attributable solely to the Loss under the guaranteed bond:
(1) Amounts actually paid by the Surety for specialized services that are provided under contract by an outside consultant, which is not an Affiliate of the Surety, provided that such services are beyond the capability of the Surety's salaried claims staff, and amounts actually paid by the Surety for travel expenses of the Surety's claims staff. The cost of the consultant's services and the travel expenses of the Surety's claims staff must be reasonable and necessary and must specifically concern the investigation, adjustment, negotiation, compromise, settlement of, or resistance to a claim for Loss resulting from the breach of the terms of the bonded Contract. The cost allocation method must be reasonable and must comply with generally accepted accounting principles; and
(2) Amounts actually paid by the Surety for court costs and reasonable attorney's fees incurred to mitigate any Loss under paragraphs (a) through (e)(1) of this section including suits to obtain sums due from Obligees, indemnitors, Principals and others.
(f)
Loss does not include
the following expenses:
(1) Any unallocated expenses, all direct and indirect costs incurred by the Surety's salaried claims staff (except for reasonable and necessary travel expenses of such staff), or any clear mark-up on expenses or any overhead of the Surety, its attorney, or any other consultant hired by the Surety or the attorney;
(2) Expenses paid for any suits, cross-claims, or counterclaims filed against the United States of America or any of its agencies, officers, or employees unless the Surety has received, prior to filing such suit or claim, written concurrence from SBA that the suit may be filed;
(3) Attorney's fees and court costs incurred by the Surety in a suit by or against SBA or its Administrator;
(4) Fees, costs, or other payments, including tort damages, arising from a successful tort suit or claim by a Principal or any other Person against the Surety; and
(5) Any costs that arise from the Principal's failure to secure and maintain insurance coverage required by the Contract or Order, or any costs that result from any claims or judgments that exceed the amount of any insurance coverage required by the Contract or Order, as well as any costs that arise as a result of any agreement by the Principal in the Contract or Order to indemnify the Obligee or any other Persons.
[61 FR 3271, Jan. 31, 1996, as amended at 76 FR 2572, Jan. 14, 2011; 81 FR 23566, Apr. 22, 2016]
§ 115.17
Minimization of Surety's Loss.
(a)
Indemnity agreements and collateral
—(1)
Requirements.
The Surety must take all reasonable action to minimize risk of Loss including, but not limited to, obtaining from each Principal a written indemnity agreement which covers actual Losses under the Contract and Imminent Breach payments under § 115.34(a) or § 115.69. The indemnity agreement must be secured by such collateral as the Surety or SBA finds appropriate. Indemnity agreements from other Persons, secured or unsecured, may also be required by the Surety or SBA.
(2)
Prohibitions.
No indemnity agreement may be obtained from the Surety, its agent or any other representative of the Surety. The Surety must not separately collateralize the portion of its bond which is not guaranteed by SBA.
(b)
Salvage and recovery
—(1)
General.
The Surety must pursue all possible sources of salvage and recovery. Salvage and recovery includes all payments made in settlement of the Surety's claim, even though the Surety has incurred other losses as a result of that Principal which are not reimbursable by SBA.
(2)
SBA's share.
SBA is entitled to its guaranteed percentage of all salvage and recovery from a defaulted Principal, its guarantors and indemnitors, and any other party, received by the Surety in connection with the guaranteed bond or any other bond issued by the Surety on behalf of the Principal unless such recovery is unquestionably identifiable as related solely to the non-guaranteed bond. The Surety must reimburse or credit SBA (in the same proportion as SBA's share of Loss) within 45 days of receipt of any recovery by the Surety.
(3)
Multiple Sureties.
In any dispute between two or more Sureties concerning recovery under SBA guaranteed bonds, the dispute must first be brought to the attention of OSG for an attempt at mediation and settlement.
[61 FR 3271, Jan. 31, 1996, as amended at 79 FR 2087, Jan. 13, 2014]
§ 115.18
Refusal to issue further guarantees; suspension and termination of PSB status.
(a)
Improper surety bond guarantee practices
—(1)
Imprudent practices.
SBA may refuse to issue further guarantees to a Prior Approval Surety or may suspend the preferred status of a PSB Surety, by written notice stating all reasons for such decision and the effective date. Reasons for such a decision include, but are not limited to, a determination that the Surety (in its underwriting, its efforts to minimize Loss, its claims or recovery practices, or its documentation related to SBA guaranteed bonds) has failed to adhere to prudent standards or practices, including any standards or practices required by SBA, as compared to those of other Sureties participating in the same SBA Surety Bond Guarantee Program to a comparable degree.
(2)
Regulatory violations, fraud.
Acts of wrongdoing such as fraud, material misrepresentation, breach of the Prior Approval or PSB Agreement, the Surety's failure to continue to comply with the requirements set forth in § 115.11, or regulatory violations (as defined in
§ 115.19(d) and (h)) also constitute sufficient grounds for refusal to issue further guarantees, or in the case of a PSB Surety, termination of preferred status.
(3)
Audit; records.
The failure of a Surety to consent to SBA's audit or to maintain and produce records constitutes grounds for SBA to refuse to issue further guarantees for a Prior Approval Surety, to suspend a PSB Surety from participation, and to refuse to honor claims submitted by a Prior Approval or PSB Surety until the Surety consents to the audit.
(4)
Excessive Losses.
If a Surety experiences excessive Losses on SBA guaranteed bonds relative to those of other Sureties participating in the same SBA Surety Bond Guarantee Program to a comparable degree, SBA may also require the renegotiation of the guarantee percentage and/or SBA's charge to the Surety for bonds executed thereafter.
(b)
Lack of business integrity.
A Surety's participation in the Surety Bond Guarantee Programs may be denied, suspended, or terminated upon the occurrence of any event in paragraphs (b) (1) through (5) of this section involving any of the following Persons: The Surety or any of its officers, directors, partners, or other individuals holding at least 20% of the Surety's voting securities, and any agents, underwriters, or any individual empowered to act on behalf of any of the preceding Persons.
(1) If a State or other authority has revoked, canceled, or suspended the license required of such Person to engage in the surety business, the right of such Person to participate in the SBA Surety Bond Guarantee Program may be denied, terminated, or suspended, as applicable, in that jurisdiction or in other jurisdictions. Ineligibility or suspension from the Surety Bond Guarantee Programs is for at least the duration of the license suspension.
(2) If such Person has been indicted or otherwise formally charged with a misdemeanor or felony bearing on such Person's fitness to participate in the Surety Bond Guarantee Programs, the participation of such Person may be suspended pending disposition of the charge. Upon conviction, participation may be denied or terminated.
(3) If a final civil judgment is entered holding that such Person has committed a breach of trust or violation of a law or regulation protecting the integrity of business transactions or relationships, participation may be denied or terminated.
(4) If such Person has made a material misrepresentation or willfully false statement in the presentation of oral or written information to SBA in connection with an application for a surety bond guarantee or the presentation of a claim, or committed a material breach of the Prior Approval or PSB Agreement or a material violation of the regulations (all as described in § 115.19), participation may be denied or terminated.
(5) If such Person is debarred, suspended, voluntarily excluded from, or declared ineligible for participation in Federal programs, participation may be denied or terminated.
(c)
Notification requirement.
The Prior Approval or PSB Surety must promptly notify SBA of the occurrence of any event in paragraphs (b) (1) through (5) of this section, or if any of the Persons described in paragraph (b) of this section does not, or ceases to, qualify as a Surety. SBA may require submission of a Statement of Personal History (SBA Form 912) from any of these Persons.
(d)
SBA proceedings.
Decisions to suspend, terminate, deny participation in, or deny reinstatement in the Surety Bond Guarantee program are made by the D/SG. A Surety may file a petition for review of suspensions and terminations with the SBA Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) under part 134 of this chapter. SBA's Administrator may, pending a decision pursuant to part 134 of this chapter, suspend the participation of any Surety for any of the causes listed in paragraphs (b) (1) through (5) of this section.
(e)
Effect on guarantee.
A guarantee issued by SBA before a suspension or termination under this section remains in effect, subject to SBA's right to deny liability under the guarantee.
[61 FR 3271, Jan. 31, 1996, as amended at 81 FR 23566, Apr. 22, 2016]
§ 115.19
Denial of liability.
In addition to equitable and legal defenses and remedies under contract law, the Act, and the regulations in this Part, SBA is relieved of liability in whole or in part within its discretion if any of the circumstances in paragraphs (a) through (h) of this section exist, except that SBA shall not deny liability on Prior Approval bonds based solely upon material information that was provided to SBA as part of the Surety's guarantee application.
(a)
Excess Contract or bond amount.
The total Contract or Order amount at the time of Execution of the bond exceeds the Applicable Statutory Limit (see § 115.10) or the bond amount at any time exceeds the total Contract or Order amount.
(b)
Misrepresentation or fraud.
The Surety obtained the Prior Approval or PSB Agreement, or applied for reimbursement for losses, by fraud or material misrepresentation. Material misrepresentation includes (but is not limited to) both the making of an untrue statement of material fact and the omission of a statement of material fact necessary to make a statement not misleading in light of the circumstances in which it was made. Material misrepresentation also includes the adoption by the Surety of a material misstatement made by others which the Surety knew or under generally accepted underwriting standards should have known to be false or misleading. The Surety's failure to disclose its ownership (or the ownership by any owner of at least 20% of the Surety's equity) of an interest in a Principal or an Obligee is considered the omission of a statement of material fact.
(c)
Material breach.
The Surety has committed a material breach of one or more terms or conditions of its Prior Approval or PSB Agreement. A material breach is considered to have occurred if:
(1) Such breach (or such breaches in the aggregate) causes an increase in the Contract amount or in the bond amount of at least 25% or $500,000 of the original contract or bond amount, whichever is less; or
(2) One of the conditions under Part B of Title IV of the Investment Act is not met.
(d)
Substantial regulatory violation.
The Surety has committed a “substantial violation” of SBA regulations. For purposes of this paragraph, a “substantial violation” is a violation which causes an increase in the bond amount of at least 25% or $500,000 of the original contract or bond amount, whichever is less in the aggregate, or is contrary to the purposes of the Surety Bond Guarantee Programs.
(e)
Alteration.
Without obtaining prior written approval from SBA (which may be conditioned upon payment of additional fees), the Surety agrees to or acquiesces in any material alteration in the terms, conditions, or provisions of the bond, including but not limited to the following acts:
(1) Naming as an Obligee or co-Obligee any Person that does not qualify as an Obligee under § 115.10; or
(2) In the case of a Prior Approval Surety, acquiescing in any alteration to the bond which would increase the bond amount by at least 25% or $500,000 of the original contract or bond amount, whichever is less.
(f)
Timeliness.
(1) Either:
(i) The bond was Executed prior to the date of SBA's guarantee; or
(ii) The bond was Executed (or approved, if the Surety is legally bound by such approval) after the work under the Contract had begun, unless SBA executes a “Surety Bond Guarantee Agreement Addendum” (SBA Form 991) after receiving all of the following from the Surety:
(A) Satisfactory evidence, including a certified copy of the Contract (or a sworn affidavit from the Principal), showing that the bond requirement was contained in the original Contract, or other documentation satisfactory to SBA, showing why a bond was not previously obtained and is now being required;
(B) Certification by the Principal that all taxes and labor costs are current, and listing all suppliers and subcontractors, indicating that they are all paid to date, and attaching a waiver of lien from each; or an explanation satisfactory to SBA why such documentation cannot be produced; and
(C) Certification by the Obligee that all payments due under the Contract to date have been made and that the job has been satisfactorily completed to date.
(2)(i) For purposes of paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section, work under a Contract is considered to have begun when a Principal takes any action related to the contract or bond that would have exposed its Surety to liability under applicable law had a bond been Executed (or approved, if the Surety is legally bound by such approval) at the time.
(ii) For purposes of this paragraph (f), the Surety must maintain a contemporaneous record of the Execution and approval of each bond.
(g)
Delinquent fees.
The Surety has not remitted to SBA the Principal's payment for the full amount of the guarantee fee within the time period required under § 115.30(d) for Prior Approval Sureties or § 115.66 for PSB Sureties, or has not made timely payment of the Surety's fee within the time period required by § 115.32(c). SBA may reinstate the guarantee upon showing that the contract is not in default and that a valid reason exists why a timely remittance or payment was not made.
(h)
Other regulatory violations.
The occurrence of any of the following:
(1) The Principal on the bonded Contract is not a small business;
(2) The bond was not required under the bid solicitation or the original Contract;
(3) The bond was not eligible for guarantee by SBA because the bonded contract was not a Contract as defined in § 115.10;
(4) The loss occurred under a bond that was not guaranteed by SBA;
(5) The loss incurred by the Surety was not a Loss as determined under § 115.16; or
(6) The Surety's loss under a Performance Bond did not result from the Principal's breach or Imminent Breach of the Contract.
[61 FR 3271, Jan. 31, 1996, as amended at 66 FR 30804, June 8, 2001; 72 FR 34599, July 25, 2007; 74 FR 36110, July 22, 2009; 79 FR 2087, Jan. 13, 2014; 82 FR 39501, Aug. 21, 2017; 87 FR 48084, Aug. 8, 2022]
§ 115.20
Insolvency of Surety.
(a)
Successor in interest.
If a Surety becomes insolvent, all rights or benefits conferred on the Surety under a valid and binding Prior Approval or PSB Agreement will accrue only to the trustee or receiver of the Surety. SBA will not be liable to the trustee or receiver of the insolvent Surety except for the guaranteed portion of any Loss incurred and actually paid by such Surety or its trustee or receiver under the guaranteed bonds.
(b)
Filing requirement.
The trustee or receiver must submit to SBA quarterly status reports accounting for all funds received and all settlements being considered.
§ 115.21

See § 115.18(a)(3) for consequences of failure to comply with this section.
(2)
Frequency of PSB audits.
Each PSB Surety is subject to an audit at least once every 3 years by examiners selected and approved by SBA.
(b)

The Surety must maintain the records listed in this paragraph (b) for the term of each bond, plus any additional time required to settle any claims of the Surety for reimbursement from SBA and to attempt salvage or other recovery, plus an additional 3 years. If there are any unresolved audit findings in relation to a particular bond, the Surety must maintain the related records until the findings are resolved. The records to be maintained include the following:

(9) Job status reports received from Obligees and documentation of each unanswered request for a job status report; and
(10) All documentation relating to any collateral held by or available to the Surety.
(c)
Purpose of audit.
SBA's audit will determine, but not be limited to:
(1) The adequacy and sufficiency of the Surety's underwriting and credit analysis, its documentation of claims and claims settlement procedures and activities, and its recovery procedures and practices;
(2) The Surety's minimization of Loss, including the exercise of bond options upon Contract default; and

(b)
SBA's determination.
SBA's approval or decline of a guarantee application is made in writing by an authorized SBA officer.

In the event of a conflict between the telephone notice and the written form, the written form controls.
(c)
Reconsideration-appeal of SBA determination.
A Prior Approval Surety may request reconsideration of a decline from the SBA officer who made
the decision. If the decision on reconsideration is negative, the Surety may appeal to an individual designated by the D/SG. If the decision is again adverse, the Surety may appeal to the D/SG, who will make the final decision.
(d)
Prior Approval Agreement.
To apply for a bond guarantee, a Prior Approval Surety must submit a
Surety Bond Guarantee Agreement
(SBA Form 990) and select one of the following application types:
(1)
Regular.
A Prior Approval Surety may complete and submit a

§ 115.31
Guarantee percentage.
(a)
Ninety percent.
SBA reimburses a Prior Approval Surety for 90% of the Loss incurred and paid if:
(1) The total amount of the Contract at the time of Execution of the bond is $100,000 or less; or
(2) The bond was issued on behalf of a small business owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, on behalf of a certified HUBZone small business concern, or on behalf of a small business owned and controlled by veterans or a small business owned and controlled by Service-disabled veterans.
(b)
Eighty percent.
SBA reimburses a Prior Approval Surety in an amount not to exceed 80% of the Loss incurred and paid on bonds for Contracts in excess of $100,000 which are executed on behalf of non-disadvantaged concerns.
(c)
Contract increase to over $100,000.
If the Contract amount increases to more than $100,000 after Execution of the bond, the guarantee percentage decreases by one percentage point for each $5,000 of increase or part thereof, but it does not decrease below 80%. This provision applies only to guarantees which qualify under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
(d)
Contract or Order increases exceed Applicable Statutory Limit.
If the Contract or Order amount is increased above the Applicable Statutory Limit after Execution of the bond, SBA's share of the Loss is limited to that percentage of the increased Contract or Order amount that the Applicable Statutory Limit represents multiplied by the guarantee percentage approved by SBA. For example, if a contract amount increases to $6,800,000, SBA's share of the loss under an 80% guarantee is limited to 76.5% [6,500,000/6,800,000 = 95.6% x 80% = 76.5%].
(e)
Contract or Order decrease to $100,000 or less.
If the Contract or Order amount decreases to $100,000, or less, after Execution of the bond, SBA's
guarantee percentage increases to 90% if the Surety provides SBA with evidence supporting the decrease and any other information or documents requested.

§ 115.32
Fees and Premiums.
(a)
Surety's Premium.
A Prior Approval Surety must not charge a Principal an amount greater than that authorized by the appropriate insurance department. The Surety must not require the Principal to purchase casualty or other insurance or any other services from the Surety or any Affiliate or agent of the Surety. The Surety must not charge non-Premium fees to a Principal unless the Surety performs other services for the Principal, the additional fee is permitted by State law, and the Principal agrees to the fee.
(b)
SBA charge to Principal.
SBA does not charge Principals application or Bid Bond guarantee fees. If SBA guarantees a Final Bond, the Principal must pay a guarantee fee equal to a certain percentage of the Contract amount. The percentage is determined by SBA and is published in Notices in the
Federal Register
from time to time. The Principal's fee is rounded to the nearest dollar and is to be remitted to SBA with the form submitted under § 115.30(d). See paragraph (d) of this section for additional requirements when the Contract amount changes.
(c)
SBA charge to Surety.
SBA does not charge Sureties application or Bid Bond guarantee fees. Subject to § 115.18(a)(4), the Surety must pay SBA a guarantee fee on each guaranteed bond (other than a Bid Bond) within 60 calendar days after SBA's approval of the Prior Approval Agreement. The fee is a certain percentage of the bond premium determined by SBA and published in Notices in the
Federal Register
from time to time. The fee is rounded to the nearest dollar. SBA does not receive any portion of a Surety's non-premium charges. See paragraph (d) of this section for additional requirements when the Contract or bond amount changes.
(d)
Contract or bond increases/decreases
—(1)
Notification and approval.
The Prior Approval Surety must notify SBA of any increases or decreases in the Contract or bond amount that aggregate 25% or $500,000 of the original contract or bond amount, whichever is less, as soon as the Surety acquires knowledge of the change. Whenever the original bond amount increases as a result of a single change order of at least 25% or $500,000 of the original contract or bond amount, whichever is less, the prior written approval of such increase by SBA is required on a supplemental Prior Approval Agreement and is conditioned upon payment by the Surety of the increase in the Principal's guarantee fee as set forth in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. In notifying SBA of any increase or decrease in the Contract or bond amount, the Prior Approval Surety must use SBA Form 990 and select the application type that it used in applying for the original bond guarantee.
(2)
Increases; fees.
The payment for the increase in the Principal's guarantee fee, which is computed on the increase in the Contract amount, is due upon notification of the increase in the Contract or bond amount under this paragraph (d). If the increase in the Principal's fee is less than $250, no payment is due until the total amount of increases in the Principal's fee equals or exceeds $250. The Surety's payment of the increase in the Surety's guarantee fee, computed on the increase in the bond Premium, must be submitted to SBA within 60 calendar days of SBA's approval of the Prior Approval Agreement, unless the amount of such increased guarantee fee is less than $250. When the total amount of increase in the guarantee fee equals or exceeds $250, the Surety must remit the fee within 60 calendar days.
(3)
Decreases; refunds.
Whenever SBA is notified of a decrease in the Contract or bond amount, SBA will refund to the Principal a proportionate amount of the Principal's guarantee fee and rebate to the Surety a proportionate amount of SBA's Premium share in the ordinary course of business. If the amount to be refunded or rebated is less than $250, such refund or rebate will not be made until the amounts to
be refunded or rebated, respectively, aggregate at least $250. Upon receipt of the refund, the Surety must promptly pay a proportionate amount of its Premium to the Principal.
[61 FR 3271, Jan. 31, 1996, as amended at 72 FR 34599, June 25, 2007; 77 FR 41665, July 16, 2012; 79 FR 2087, Jan. 13, 2014; 82 FR 39502, Aug. 21, 2017; 87 FR 48084, Aug. 8, 2022; 88 FR 24473, Apr. 21, 2023]
§ 115.33
Surety bonding line.
A surety bonding line is a written commitment by SBA to a Prior Approval Surety which provides for the Surety's Execution of multiple bonds for a specified small business strictly within pre-approved terms, conditions and limitations. In applying for a bonding line, the Surety must provide SBA with information on the applicant as requested. In addition to the other limitations and provisions set forth in this part 115, the following conditions apply to each surety bonding line:
(a)
Underwriting.
A bonding line may be issued by SBA for a Principal only if the underwriting evaluation is satisfactory. The Prior Approval Surety must require the Principal to keep it informed of all its contracts, whether bonded by the same or another surety or unbonded, during the term of the bonding line.
(b)
Bonding line conditions.
The bonding line contains limitations on the following:
(1) The term of the bonding line, not to exceed 1 year subject to renewal in writing;
(2) The total dollar amount of the Principal's bonded and unbonded work on hand at any time, including outstanding bids, during the term of the bonding line;
(3) The number of such bonded and unbonded contracts outstanding at any time during the term of the bonding line;
(4) The maximum dollar amount of any single guaranteed bonded Contract;
(5) The timing of Execution of bonds under the bonding line—bonds must be dated and Executed before the work on the underlying Contract has begun, or the Surety must submit to SBA the documentation required under § 115.19(f)(1)(ii); and
(6) Any other limitation related to type, specialty of work, geographical area, or credit.
(c)
Excess bonding.
If, after a bonding line is issued, the Principal desires a bond and the Surety desires a guarantee exceeding a limitation of the bonding line, the Surety must submit an application to SBA under regular procedures.
(d)
Submission of forms to SBA
—(1)
Bid Bonds.
Within 15 business days after the Execution of any Bid Bonds under a bonding line, the Surety must submit a “Surety Bond Guarantee Agreement (Form 990)” to SBA for approval. If the Surety fails to submit the form within this time period, SBA's guarantee of the bond will be void from its inception unless SBA determines otherwise upon a showing that a valid reason exists why the timely submission was not made.
(2)
Final Bonds.
Within 15 business days after the Execution of any Final Bonds under a bonding line, the Surety must submit a Surety Bond Guarantee Agreement (SBA Form 990) to SBA for approval. If the surety fails to submit this form within the time period or the guarantee fees are not paid in accordance with § 115.32, SBA's guarantee of the bond will be void from its inception unless SBA determines otherwise upon a showing that the Contract is not in default and a valid reason exists why the timely submission was not made.
(3)
Additional information.
The Surety must submit any other data SBA requests.
(e)
Cancellation of bonding line
—(1)
Optional cancellation.
Either SBA or the Surety may cancel a bonding line at any time, with or without cause, upon written notice to the other party. Upon the receipt of any adverse information concerning the Principal, the Surety must promptly notify SBA, and SBA may cancel the bonding line.
(2)
Mandatory cancellation.
Upon the occurrence of a default by the Principal, whether under a contract bonded by the same or another surety or an unbonded contract, the Surety must immediately cancel the bonding line.
(3)
Effect of cancellation.
Cancellation of a bonding line by SBA is effective upon receipt of written notice by the
Surety. Bonds issued before the effective date of cancellation remain guaranteed by SBA. Upon cancellation by SBA or the Surety, the Surety must promptly notify the Principal in writing.
[61 FR 3271, Jan. 31, 1996, as amended at 77 FR 41665, July 16, 2012; 87 FR 48084, Aug. 8, 2022]

Minimization of Surety's Loss.
(a)
Imminent Breach
—(1)
Prior approval requirement.
SBA will reimburse its guaranteed share of payments made by a Surety to avoid or attempt to avoid an Imminent Breach of the terms of a Contract covered by an SBA guaranteed bond only if the payments were made with the prior approval of OSG. OSG's prior approval will be given only if the Surety demonstrates to SBA's satisfaction that a breach is imminent and that there is no other recourse to prevent such breach.
(2)
Amount of reimbursement.
The aggregate of the payments by SBA to avoid Imminent Breach cannot exceed 10% of the Contract amount, unless the Administrator finds that a greater payment (not to exceed the guaranteed share of the bond penalty) is necessary and reasonable. In no event will SBA make any duplicate payment pursuant to this or any other provision of this part 115.
(3)
Recordkeeping requirement.
The Surety must keep records of payments made to avoid Imminent Breach.
(b)
Salvage and recovery.
A Prior Approval Surety must pursue all possible sources of salvage and recovery until SBA concurs with the Surety's recommendation for a discontinuance or for a settlement. The Surety must certify that continued pursuit of salvage and recovery would be neither economically feasible nor a viable strategy in maximizing recovery. See also § 115.17(b).
§ 115.35

(b)
Surety action.
The Surety must take all necessary steps to mitigate Losses resulting from any of the events in paragraph (a) of this section, including the disposal at fair market value of any collateral held by or available to the Surety. Unless SBA notifies the Surety otherwise, the Surety must take charge of all claims or suits arising from a defaulted bond, and compromise, settle and defend such suits. The Surety must handle and process all claims under the bond and all settlements and recoveries as it does on non-guaranteed bonds.
(c)
Claim reimbursement requests.
(1) Claims for reimbursement for Losses which the Surety has paid must be submitted (together with a copy of the bond, the bonded Contract, and any indemnity agreements) with the initial claim to OSG on a “Default Report, Claim for Reimbursement and Report of Recoveries” (SBA Form 994H), within 90 days from the time of each disbursement. Claims submitted after 90 days must be accompanied by substantiation satisfactory to SBA. The date of the claim for reimbursement is the date of receipt of the claim by SBA, or such later date as additional information requested by SBA is received.
(2) The Surety must also submit evidence of the disposal of all collateral at fair market value.
(3) SBA may request additional information prior to reimbursing the Surety for its Loss.
(4) Subject to the offset provisions of part 140, SBA pays its share of the Loss incurred and paid by the Surety within
45 days of receipt of the requisite information.
(5) Claims for reimbursement and any additional information submitted are subject to review and audit by SBA, including but not limited to the Surety's compliance with SBA's regulations and forms.
(d)
Status updates.
The Surety must submit semiannual status reports on each claim 6 months after the initial default notice, and then every 6 months. The Surety must notify SBA immediately of any substantial changes in the status of the claim or the amounts of Loss reserves.
(e)
Reservation of SBA rights.
The payment by SBA of a Surety's claim does not waive or invalidate any of the terms of the Prior Approval Agreement, the regulations set forth in this part 115, or any defense SBA may have against the Surety. Within 30 days of receipt of notification that a claim or any portion of a claim should not have been paid by SBA, the Surety must repay the specified amounts to SBA.
[61 FR 3271, Jan. 31, 1996, as amended at 79 FR 2087, Jan. 13, 2014]
§ 115.36
Indemnity settlements.
(a) An indemnity settlement occurs when a defaulted Principal and its Surety agree upon an amount, less than the actual loss under the bond, which will satisfy the Principal's indebtedness to the Surety. Sureties must not agree to any indemnity settlement proposal or enter into any such agreement without SBA's concurrence.
(b) Any settlement proposal submitted for SBA's consideration must include current financial information, including financial statements, tax returns, and credit reports, together with the Surety's written recommendations. It should also indicate whether the Principal is interested in further bonding.
(c) The Surety must pay SBA its
pro rata
share of the settlement amount within 45 days of receipt. Prior to closing the file on a Principal, the Surety must certify that SBA has received its
pro rata
share of all indemnity recovery.
[61 FR 3271, Jan. 31, 1996, as amended at 79 FR 2087, Jan. 13, 2014; 81 FR 23566, Apr. 22, 2016]

# Subpart C—Preferred Surety Bond (PSB) Guarantees
§ 115.60
Selection and admission of PSB Sureties.
(a)
Selection of PSB Sureties.
SBA's selection of PSB Sureties will be guided by, but not limited to, these factors:
(1) An underwriting limitation of at least $6,500,000 on the U.S. Treasury Department list of acceptable sureties;
(2) An agreement that the Surety will neither charge a bond premium in excess of that authorized by the appropriate State insurance department, nor impose any non-premium fee unless such fee is permitted by applicable State law and approved by SBA.
(3) Premium income from contract bonds guaranteed by any government agency (Federal, State or local) of no more than one- quarter of the total contract bond premium income of the Surety;
(4) The vesting of underwriting authority for SBA guaranteed bonds only in employees of the Surety;
(5) The rating or ranking designations assigned to the Surety by recognized authority.
(b)
Admission of PSB Sureties.
A Surety admitted to the PSB program must execute a PSB Agreement before approving SBA guaranteed bonds. No SBA guarantee attaches to bonds approved before the D/SG or designee has countersigned the Agreement. For a period of nine months following admission to the PSB program, the Surety must obtain SBA's prior written approval before executing a bond greater than $2 million so that SBA may evaluate the Surety's performance in its underwriting and claims and recovery functions. At the end of this nine month period, SBA may in its discretion extend this period to allow SBA to further evaluate the Surety's performance.
[61 FR 3271, Jan. 31, 1996, as amended at 66 FR 30804, June 8, 2001; 72 FR 34600, June 25, 2007; 81 FR 23566, Apr. 22, 2016; 82 FR 39502, Aug. 21, 2017]
§ 115.61
[Reserved]
§ 115.62
Prohibition on participation in Prior Approval program.
A PSB Surety is not eligible to submit applications under subpart B of this part. This prohibition does not extend to an Affiliate, as defined in 13 CFR § 121.103, of a PSB Surety that is not itself a PSB Surety provided that the relationship between the PSB Surety and the Affiliate has been fully disclosed to SBA and that such Affiliate has been approved by SBA to participate as a Prior Approval Surety pursuant to § 115.11.
[72 FR 34600, June 25, 2007]
§ 115.63
Allotment of guarantee authority.
(a)
General.
SBA allots to each PSB Surety a periodic maximum guarantee authority. No SBA guarantee attaches to bonds approved by a PSB Surety if the bonds exceed the allotted authority for the period in which the bonds are approved. No reliance on future authority is permitted. An allotment can be increased only by prior written permission of SBA.
(b)
Execution of Bid Bonds.
When the PSB Surety Executes a Bid Bond, SBA debits the Surety's allotment for an amount equal to the guarantee percentage of the estimated penal sum of the Final Bond SBA would guarantee if the Contract were awarded. If the Contract is then awarded for an amount other than the bid amount, or if the bid is withdrawn or the Bid Bond guarantee has expired (see § 115.12(c)), SBA debits or credits the Surety's allotment accordingly.
(c)
Execution of Final Bonds.
If the PSB Surety Executes a guaranteed Final Bond, but not the related Bid Bond, SBA debits the Surety's allotment for an amount equal to the guarantee percentage of the penal sum of the Final Bond. SBA will debit the allotment for increases, and credit the allotment for decreases, in the bond amount.
(d)
Release and non-issuance of Final Bonds.
The release of Final Bonds upon completion of the Contract does not restore the corresponding allotment. If, however, a PSB Surety approves a Final Bond but never issues the bond, SBA will credit the Surety's allotment for an amount equal to the guarantee percentage of the penal sum of the bond. In that event, the Surety must notify SBA as soon as possible, but in no event later than 5 business days after the non-issuance has been determined. Until the Surety has so notified SBA, it cannot rely on such credit.
§ 115.64
Timeliness requirement.
There must be no Execution or approval of a bond by a PSB Surety after commencement of work under a Contract unless the Surety obtains written approval from the D/SG. To apply for such approval, the Surety must submit a completed “Surety Bond Guarantee Agreement Addendum” (SBA Form 991), together with the evidence and certifications described in § 115.19(f)(1)(ii). For purposes of this section, work has commenced under a Contract when a Principal takes any action related to the contract or bond that would have exposed its Surety to liability under applicable law had a bond been Executed (or approved, if the Surety is legally bound by such approval) at the time.
[61 FR 3271, Jan. 31, 1996, as amended at 87 FR 48084, Aug. 8, 2022]
§ 115.65
General PSB procedures.
(a)
Retention of information.
A PSB Surety must comply with all applicable SBA regulations and obtain from its applicants all the information and certifications required by SBA. The PSB Surety must document compliance with SBA regulations and retain such certifications in its files, including a contemporaneous record of the date of approval and Execution of each bond. See also § 115.19(f). The certifications and other information must be made available for inspection by SBA or its agents and must be available for submission to SBA in connection with the Surety's claims for reimbursement. The PSB Surety must retain the certifications and other information for the term of the bond, plus such additional time as may be required to settle any claims of the Surety for reimbursement from SBA and to attempt salvage or other recovery, plus an additional 3 years. If there are any unresolved audit findings in relation to a
particular bond, the Surety must maintain the related certifications and other information until the findings are resolved.
(b)
Usual staff and procedures.
The approval, Execution and administration by a PSB Surety of SBA guaranteed bonds must be handled in the same manner and with the same staff as the Surety's activity outside the PSB program. The Surety must request job status reports from Obligees in accordance with its own procedures.
(c)
Notification to SBA
—(1)
Approvals.
A PSB Surety must notify SBA by electronic transmission or monthly bordereau, as agreed between the Surety and SBA, of all approved Bid and Final Bonds, and of the Surety's approval of increases and decreases in the Contract or bond amount. The notice must contain the information specified from time to time in agreements between the Surety and SBA. SBA may deny liability with respect to Final Bonds for which SBA has not received timely notice.
(2)
Other events requiring notification.
The PSB Surety must notify SBA within 30 calendar days of the name and address of any Principal against whom legal action on the bond has been instituted; whenever an Obligee has declared a default; whenever the Surety has established or added to a claim reserve; of the recovery of any amounts on the guaranteed bond; and of any decision by the Surety to bond any such Principal again.
§ 115.66
Fees.
The PSB Surety must pay SBA a certain percentage of the Premium it charges on Final Bonds. The PSB Surety must also remit to SBA the Principal's payment for its guarantee fee, equal to a certain percentage of the Contract amount. The fee percentages are determined by SBA and are published in Notices in the
Federal Register
from time to time. Each fee is rounded to the nearest dollar. The Surety must remit SBA's Premium share and the Principal's guarantee fee with the bordereau listing the related Final Bond, as required in the PSB Agreement.
§ 115.67
Changes in Contract or bond amount.
(a)
Increases.
The PSB Surety must process Contract or bond amount increases within its allotment in the same manner as initial guaranteed bond issuances (see § 115.65(c)(1)). The Surety must present checks for additional fees due from the Principal and the Surety on any increases aggregating 25% of the original Contract or bond amount or $500,000, whichever is less, and attach such payments to the respective monthly bordereau. If the additional Principal's fee or Surety's fee is less than $250, such fee is not due until all unpaid increases in such fee aggregate at least $250.
(b)
Decreases.
If the Contract or bond amount is decreased, SBA will refund to the Principal a proportionate amount of the guarantee fee, and adjust SBA's Premium share accordingly in the ordinary course of business. No refund or adjustment will be made until the amounts to be refunded or rebated, respectively, aggregate at least $250.
[61 FR 3271, Jan. 31, 1996, as amended at 79 FR 2087, Jan. 13, 2014; 82 FR 39502, Aug. 21, 2017; 87 FR 48084, Aug. 8, 2022]
§ 115.68
Guarantee percentage.
SBA reimburses a PSB Surety in the same percentages and under the same terms as set forth in § 115.31.
[82 FR 39502, Aug. 21, 2017]
§ 115.69
Imminent Breach.
(a)
No prior approval requirement.
SBA will reimburse a PSB Surety for the guaranteed portion of payments the Surety makes to avoid or attempt to avoid an Imminent Breach of the terms of a Contract covered by an SBA guaranteed bond. The aggregate of the payments by SBA under this section cannot exceed 10% of the Contract amount, unless the Administrator finds that a greater payment (not to exceed the guaranteed portion of the bond penalty) is necessary and reasonable. The PSB Surety does not need to obtain prior SBA approval to make Imminent Breach payments, except that the PSB Surety may request SBA to approve payments that exceed 10% of the Contract amount prior to the Surety
making the payment. In no event will SBA make any duplicate payment under any provision of these regulations in this part.
(b)
Recordkeeping requirement.
The PSB Surety must keep records of payments made to avoid Imminent Breach.
[79 FR 2087, Jan. 13, 2014]
§ 115.70
Claims for reimbursement of Losses.
(a)
How claims are submitted.
A PSB Surety must submit claims for reimbursement on a form approved by SBA no later than 90 days from the date the Surety paid the amount. Loss is determined as of the date of receipt by SBA of the claim for reimbursement, or as of such later date as additional information requested by SBA is received. Subject to the offset provisions of part 140, SBA pays its share of Loss within 45 days of receipt of the requisite information. Claims for reimbursement and any additional information submitted are subject to review and audit by SBA.
(b)
Surety responsibilities.
The PSB Surety must take all necessary steps to mitigate Losses when legal action against a bond has been instituted, when the Obligee has declared a default, and when the Surety has established a claim reserve. The Surety may dispose of collateral at fair market value only. Unless SBA notifies the Surety otherwise, the Surety must take charge of all claims or suits arising from a defaulted bond, and compromise, settle or defend the suits. The Surety must handle and process all claims under the bond and all settlements and recoveries in the same manner as it does on non-guaranteed bonds.
(c)
Reservation of SBA's rights.
The payment by SBA of a PSB Surety's claim does not waive or invalidate any of the terms of the PSB Agreement, the regulations in this part 115, or any defense SBA may have against the Surety. Within 30 days of receipt of notification that a claim or any portion of a claim should not have been paid by SBA, the Surety must repay the specified amounts to SBA.
[61 FR 3271, Jan. 31, 1996, as amended at 79 FR 2087, Jan. 13, 2014]
§ 115.71
Denial of liability.
In addition to the grounds set forth in § 115.19, SBA may deny liability to a PSB Surety if:
(a) The PSB Surety's guaranteed bond was in an amount which, together with all other guaranteed bonds, exceeded the allotment for the period during which the bond was approved, and no prior SBA approval had been obtained;
(b) The PSB Surety's loss was incurred under a bond which was not listed on the bordereau for the period when it was approved; or
(c) The loss incurred by the PSB Surety is not attributable to the particular Contract for which an SBA guaranteed bond was approved.

§ 117.4
Discrimination prohibited and exceptions.

(f)
Exception 3.
A recipient is permitted to take an action otherwise prohibited by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section if an age distinction is contained in that part of a Federal, State or local statute or ordinance adopted by an elected general purpose legislative body which provides any benefits or assistance to, establishes criteria for participation in, or describes intended beneficiaries or target groups in age-related terms.
(g) The burden of proving that an age distinction or other action falls within the exceptions outlined in paragraphs (d), (e), and (f) of this section on the recipient of Federal financial assistance.
§ 117.5
Illustrative applications.
(a)
Discrimination in providing financial assistance.
Development companies and small business investment companies, which apply for or receive any financial assistance may not discriminate on the ground of age in providing financial assistance to small business concerns. Such discrimination prohibited by § 117.4 includes but is not limited to the failure or refusal, because of the age of the applicant, or the age of the applicant's principal owner or operating official to extend a loan or equity financing to any business concern; or, in the case of financing which has actually been extended, the failure or refusal because of the age of the recipient, or the age of recipient's principal owner or operating official to accord the recipient fair treatment and the customary courtesies regarding such matters as default, grace periods and the like.
(b)
Discrimination in accommodations or services.
Small Business Concerns and others who or which apply for or receive any financial assistance administered by the Small Business Administration, such as but not limited to physicians, dentists, hospitals, schools, libraries, and other individuals or organizations may not discriminate in the treatment, accommodations or services they provide to their patients, students, members, passengers, or members of the public, except when the normal operation or statutory objective of the business or activity of the intended beneficiary is designated in age-related terms, whether or not operated for profit. Action by such business or activity to be excluded from compliance with this regulation must fall within the exceptions enumerated in § 117.4 (d), (e), and (f) of this part.
(c) The discrimination prohibited by § 117.5(b) includes, but is not limited to the failure or refusal, because of age, to accept a patient, student, member, customer, client, or passenger, except when the imposition of this prohibition would interfere with the normal operation of the business, e.g., pediatricians, nursery schools, geriatric clinics.
§ 117.6
Remedial and affirmative action by recipients.
(a) Where a recipient is found to have discriminated on the basis of age, the recipient shall take any remedial action which the Agency may require to overcome the effects of the discrimination. If another recipient exercises control over the recipient that has discriminated, both recipients may be required to take remedial action.
(b) Even in the absence of a finding of discrimination, a recipient may take affirmative action to overcome the effects of conditions that resulted in limited participation in the recipient's program or activity on the basis of age.
(c) If a recipient operating a program or activity which serves the elderly or children in addition to persons of other ages, provides special benefits to the elderly or to children, the provision of those benefits shall be presumed to be voluntary affirmative action provided that it does not have the effect of excluding otherwise eligible persons from
participation in the program or activity.
§ 117.7
Assurances required.
An application for financial assistance administered by the Small Business Administration shall, as a condition of its approval and the extension of such assistance, contain or be accompanied by an assurance that the recipient will comply with this part. SBA shall specify the form of the foregoing assurance, and the extent to which like assurances will be required of contractors and subcontractors, transferees, successors, and other participants.
§ 117.8
Responsibilities of SBA recipients.
(a) Each SBA recipient has the primary responsibility to ensure that its programs or activities are in compliance with the Act and these regulations, and shall take steps to eliminate violations of the Act. A recipient also has responsibility to maintain records, provide information, and to afford SBA access to its records to the extent SBA finds necessary to determine whether the recipient is in compliance with the Act and these regulations. (OMB No. 3245 0076)
(b) Where a recipient passes on Federal financial assistance from SBA to subrecipients, the recipient shall provide the subrecipients written notice of their obligations under the Act and these regulations.
(c) Each recipient shall make necessary information about the Act and these regulations available to the beneficiaries of its programs or activities in order to inform them about the protections against discrimination provided by the Act and these regulations.
(d) Whenever an assessment indicates a violation of the Act and the SBA regulations, the recipient shall take corrective action.
§ 117.9
Compliance information.
(a)
Cooperation and assistance.
SBA shall, to the fullest extent practicable, seek the cooperation of recipients in obtaining compliance with this part and shall provide assistance and guidance to recipients to help them comply voluntarily with this part.
(b)
Record Keeping.
Each recipient shall keep records in such form, and containing such information which SBA determines may be necessary to ascertain whether the recipient has complied or is complying with this part (OMB No. 3245 0076). In the case of a small business concern which receives financial assistance from a development company or from a small business investment company, the small business concern shall also keep such records and information as may be necessary to enable SBA to determine if the small business concern is complying with this part.
(c) Each recipient shall provide to SBA, upon request, information and reports which SBA determines are necessary to ascertain whether the recipient is complying with the Act and these regulations.
(d)
Access to sources of information.
Each recipient shall permit reasonable access by SBA during normal business hours to such of its books, records, accounts, and other sources of information, and its facilities as may be pertinent to ascertain compliance with this part. Where any information required of an applicant or recipient is in the exclusive possession of any other agency, institution or person and that agency, institution or person shall fail or refuse to furnish the information, the recipient shall so certify and shall set forth what efforts it has made to obtain the required information. The recipient will be held responsible for submitting the information. Failure to submit information or permit access to sources of information required by SBA will subject the recipient to enforcement procedure as provided in § 117.15 of this part.
(Information collection requirements in paragraph (c) were approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 3245-0076)

(a) SBA shall from time to time review the practices of recipients to determine whether they are complying with this part. As part of a compliance review or complaint investigation, SBA may require a recipient employing 15 or more full-time employees to complete a written self-evaluation, in a
manner specified by the Agency, of any age distinction imposed in its program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.
(b) If a compliance review or pre-award review indicates a violation of the Act or these regulations, SBA will attempt to achieve voluntary compliance with the Act. If voluntary compliance with the recipient cannot be achieved, such recipient will be subject to the enforcement procedure contained in § 117.15 of these regulations. A refusal to permit an on-site compliance review during normal working hours may constitute noncompliance with this part.
§ 117.11
Complaint procedures.
(a) Any person who believes that he/she or any specific class of individuals is being or has been subjected to discrimination by SBA, a recipient, or an applicant for assistance, prohibited by this part may, by himself/herself or by a representative, file with SBA a written complaint. The complainant has the right to have a representative at all stages of the complaint procedure.
(b) A complaint must be filed not later than 180 days from the date of the alleged discrimination, unless the time filing is extended by SBA. The Adminstrator, the Assistant Administrator, Office of Equal Employment Opportunity
Civil Rights Compliance, are the only officials who may waive the 180-day time limit for filing complaints under this part. SBA will consider the date a complaint is filed to be the date upon which the complaint is sufficient to be processed.
(c) Each complaint will be reviewed to ensure that it falls within the coverage of the Act and contains all information necessary for further processing.
(d) SBA will attempt to facilitate the filing of complaints wherever possible, including taking the following actions:
(1) Accepting as a sufficient complaint, any written statement which identifies the parties involved and the date the complainant first had knowledge of the alleged violation, describes generally the action or practice complained of, and is signed by the complainant.
(2) Freely permitting a complainant to add information to the complaint to meet the requirements of a sufficient complaint.
(3) Notifying the complainant and the recipient of their rights and obligations under the complaint procedure, including the right to have a representative at all stages of the complaint procedure.
(4) Notifying the complainant and the recipient (or their representatives) of their right to contact the Assistant Administrator, Office of Equal Employment Opportunity
Civil Rights Compliance, for information and assistance regarding the complaint resolution process.
(e) SBA will return to the complainant any complaint filed under the jurisdiction of this regulation, but found to be outside the jurisdiction of this regulation, and will state the reason(s) why it is outside the jurisdiction of this regulation.
[50 FR 41648, Oct. 11, 1985, as amended at 72 FR 50038, Aug. 30, 2007]
§ 117.12
Mediation.
(a) SBA shall, after ensuring that the complaint falls within the coverage of this Act and all information necessary for further processing is contained therein, unless the age distinction complained of is clearly within an exception, promptly refer the complaint to the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS).
(b) SBA shall, to the extent possible, require the participation of the recipient and the complainant in the mediation process in an effort to reach a mutually satisfactory settlement of the complaint or make an informed judgment that an agreement is not possible. Both parties need not meet with the mediator at the same time.
(c) If the complainant and the recipient reach a mutually satisfactory resolution of the complaint during the mediation period, the mediator shall prepare a written statement of the agreement and have the complainant and recipient sign it.
(d) A copy of the written mediation agreement will be referred to SBA, and no further action will be taken unless it appears that either the complainant
or the recipient (or other alleged discriminator subject to this part) fails to comply with the agreement.
(e) If at the end of 60 days after the receipt of a complaint by SBA, or at any time prior thereto, an agreement is reached or the mediator determines an agreement cannot be reached through mediation, the agreement or complaint will be returned to SBA.
(f) This 60-day period may be extended by the mediator, with the concurrence of SBA for not more than 30 days if the mediator determines that an agreement will likely be reached during the extended period.
(g) The mediator shall protect the confidentiality of all information obtained in the course of the mediation process. No mediator shall testify in any adjudicative proceeding, produce any document, or otherwise disclose any information obtained during the course of the mediation process without prior approval of the head of the agency appointing the mediator.
§ 117.13
Investigation and resolution of matters.
(a) SBA will make a prompt investigation whenever a compliance review indicates a possible failure to comply with this part by the recipient and additional information is needed by SBA to assure compliance with this part, or when an unresolved complaint has been returned by the FMCS, or when it appears that the complainant or the recipient is failing to comply with a mediation agreement. The investigation shall include a review of the pertinent practices and policies of the recipient, the circumstances under which the possible noncompliance with this part occurred, and other factors relevant to a determination as to whether the recipient is complying, is not complying, or has failed to comply with this part.
(b)
Resolution of matters.
If an investigation indicates a failure to comply with this part, SBA will so inform the complainant, if applicable, and the recipient that the matter will be resolved by informal means that are mutually agreeable to the parties, whenever possible.
(1) If, during the course of an investigation, the matter is resolved by informal means, SBA will put any agreement in writing and have it signed by the parties and an authorized official of SBA.
(2) If investigation indicates a violation of the Act or these regulations, SBA will attempt to achieve voluntary compliance. If SBA cannot achieve voluntary compliance, it will begin enforcement as described in § 117.15.
(3) If an investigation does not warrant action, SBA will so inform the complainant, if applicable, and the recipient in writing.
§ 117.14
Intimidating or retaliatory acts prohibited.
No complainant, recipient or other person shall intimidate, threaten, coerce, or discriminate against any individual for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured by this part or because an individual or group has made a complaint, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, review, enforcement process, or hearing under this part. The identity of complainants shall be kept confidential except to the extent necessary to carry out the purposes of this part, including the conduct of any investigation, hearing, mediation, or judicial proceeding.
§ 117.15
Procedure for effecting compliance.
(a)
General.
(1) If there appears to be a failure or threatened failure to comply with this part by an applicant or recipient and if the noncompliance or threatened noncompliance cannot be resolved by informal means, compliance with this part may be effected by suspending, terminating, or refusing any financial assistance approved but not yet disbursed to an applicant. In the case of loans partially or fully disbursed, compliance with this part may be effected by calling, canceling, terminating, accelerating repayment, or suspending in whole or in part the Federal financial assistance provided. The determination of the recipient's violation may be made only after a recipient has had an opportunity for a hearing on the record before an administrative law judge.
(2) In addition, compliance may be effected by any other means authorized
by law. Such other means may include, but are not limited to:
(i) Action by SBA to accelerate the maturity of the recipient's obligation;
(ii) Referral to the Department of Justice with a recommendation that appropriate proceedings be brought to enforce any rights of the United States under any law of the United States or obligations of the recipient created by the Act or this part; and
(iii) Use of any requirement of or referral to any Federal, State or local government agency that will have the effect of correcting a violation of the Act or these regulations.
(3) If there appears to be a failure or threatened failure to comply with this part by an SBA office or official, the Assistant Administrator, Office of Equal Employment Opportunity
Civil Rights Compliance, will recommend appropriate corrective action to the Administrator. Any resulting adverse action against an SBA employee shall follow Office of Personnel Management and SBA procedures for such action.
(b)
Noncompliance with §§ 117.7 and 117.9.
If an applicant fails or refuses to furnish an assurance required under § 117.7, or fails to provide information or allow SBA access to information under § 117.9 or otherwise fails or refuses to comply with a requirement imposed by or pursuant to those sections, Federal financial assistance may be deferred for a period not to exceed 60 days after the applicant has received a notice for an opportunity for hearing under § 117.16, or unless a hearing has begun within that time, or the time for beginning the hearing has been extended by mutual consent of the recipient and the Agency, for purposes of determining what constitutes mutual consent, the Agency shall be deemed to have consented to any extension requested by the recipient and granted by the administrative law judge (hearing officer), whether or not the Agency initially approved the extension. A deferral may not continue for more than 30 days after the close of the hearing, unless the hearing results in a finding against the applicant or recipient.
(c) SBA will not take action toward accelerating repayment, suspending, terminating, or refusing financial assistance until:
(1) SBA has advised the applicant or recipient of the failure to comply and has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means;
(2) There has been an express finding on the record, after an opportunity for hearing, of a failure by the applicant or recipient to comply with a requirement imposed by or pursuant to this part;
(3) The action has been approved by the Administrator of SBA pursuant to § 117.17; and
(4) The expiration of 30 days after SBA has filed with the committee of the House and the committee of the Senate having legislative jurisdiction over the form of financial assistance involved, a full written report of the circumstances and the grounds for such action.
(d) Other means authorized by law. No action to effect compliance by any other means authorized by law shall be taken until:
(1) SBA has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means;
(2) The action has been approved by the Administrator or designee;
(3) The expiration of 30 days after SBA has filed with the committee of the House and the committee of the Senate having legislative jurisdiction over the form of financial assistance involved, a full written report of the circumstances and the grounds for such action;
(4) The applicant or recipient has been notified of the failure to comply, and of the action to be taken to effect compliance; and
(5) The expiration of at least 10 days from the mailing of such notice to the applicant or recipient or other person. During this period of at least 10 days from the mailing of such notice to the applicant or recipient or other person, additional efforts shall be made to persuade the applicant or recipient to comply with this part and to take such corrective action as may be appropriate.
[50 FR 41648, Oct. 11, 1985, as amended at 72 FR 50038, Aug. 30, 2007]
§ 117.16
Hearings.
(a)
Opportunity for hearing.
Whenever an opportunity for a hearing is required by § 117.15, reasonable notice shall be given by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the affected applicant or recipient. This notice shall advise the applicant or recipient of the action proposed to be taken, the specific provision under which the proposed action against it is to be taken, and the matters of fact or law asserted as the basis for this action, and either.
(1) Fix a date not less than 20 days after the date of such notice within which the applicant or recipient may request the Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) that the matter be scheduled for hearing; or
(2) Advise the applicant or recipient that the matter in question has been set down for hearing at a stated place and time. The time and place so fixed shall be reasonable and shall be subject to change for cause. The complainant shall be advised of the time and place of the hearing. An applicant or recipient may waive a hearing and submit written information and argument for the record. The failure of an applicant or recipient to appear at a hearing for which a date has been set shall be deemed to be a waiver of the right to a hearing and as consent to the making of a decision on the basis of such information as is available.
(b)
Time and place of hearing.
Hearings shall be held at OHA in Washington, DC, at a time fixed by OHA unless that office determines that the convenience of the complainant, applicant, recipient or SBA requires that another place be selected. Hearings shall be held before an administrative law judge designated in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act.
(c)
Right to counsel.
In all proceedings under this section, the applicant or recipient and SBA shall have the right to be represented by counsel.
(d)
Procedures, evidence, and record.
(1) The hearings, decisions, and any administrative review shall be conducted in conformity with the Administrative Procedure Act and 13 CFR part 134. Such rules of procedure should be consistent with this section, relate to the conduct of the hearing, provide for giving of notices to those referred to in paragraph (a) of this section, taking of testimony, exhibits, arguments, and briefs, request for findings and other related matters. SBA, the complainant, if any, and the applicant or recipient shall be entitled to introduce all relevant evidence on the issues as stated in the notice for hearing, or as determined by the administrative law judge conducting the hearing at the outset of or during the hearing.
(2) Technical rules of evidence may be waived by the administrative law judge conducting a hearing pursuant to this part, but rules or principles designed to assure production of the most credible evidence available, and subject testimony to test by cross-examination shall be applied where reasonably necessary. The administrative law judge may exclude irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence. All documents and other evidence offered or taken for the record shall be open to examination by the parties and opportunity shall be given to refute facts and arguments advanced on either side of the issues. A transcript shall be made of the oral evidence except to the extent the substance thereof is stipulated for the record. All decisions shall be based upon the hearing record and written findings shall be made.
(e)
Consolidated or joint hearings.
In cases in which the same or related facts are asserted to constitute noncompliance or threatened noncompliance with this part, with respect to two or more forms of financial assistance to which this part applies, or noncompliance with this part and the regulations of one or more other Federal agencies issued under the Act, the Administrator may, by agreement with such other agencies, provide for the conduct of consolidated or joint hearings, and for the application to such hearings of rules and procedures not inconsistent with this part. Final decisions in such cases, insofar as this part is concerned, shall be made in accordance with § 117.17.
§ 117.17
Decisions and notices.
(a)
Decision by an administrative law judge.
If the hearing is held by an administrative law judge, such administrative law judge shall either make an initial decision, if so authorized, or certify the entire record, including recommended findings and proposed decision, to the Administrator for a final decision and a copy of such initial decision or certification shall be mailed to the applicant or recipient and the complainant. Where the initial decision is made by the administrative law judge, the applicant or recipient may, within 30 days of the mailing of such notice of initial decision, file with the Administrator exceptions to the initial decision, with the reasons therefor. In the absence of exceptions, the Administrator may, by motion within 45 days after the initial decision, serve on the applicant or recipient a notice that he/she will review the decision. Upon the filing of such exceptions or of such notice of review, the Administrator shall review the initial decision and issue his/her decision thereon, including the reasons therefor. The decision of the Administrator shall be mailed promptly to the applicant or recipient, and the complainant, if any. In the absence of either exceptions or a notice of review, the initial decision shall constitute the final decision of the Administrator.
(b)
Decisions on record or review by the Administrator.
Whenever a record is certified to the Administrator for decision or the Administrator reviews the decision of an administrative law judge pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, or whenever the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services or the Department of Justice conducts the hearing, the applicant or recipient shall be given reasonable opportunity to file briefs or other written statements of its contentions and a copy of the final decision of the Administrator shall be given in writing to the applicant or recipient and the complainant, if any.
(c)
Decisions on record where a hearing is waived.
Whenever a hearing is waived pursuant to § 117.16, a decision shall be made by the Administrator on the record and a copy of such decision shall be given in writing to the applicant or recipient, and to the complainant, if any.
(d)
Rulings required.
Each decision of an administrative law judge or the Administrator shall set forth the ruling on each finding, conclusion, or exception presented, and shall identify the requirement or requirements imposed by or pursuant to this part with which it is found that the applicant or recipient has failed to comply.
(e)
Decision by the Administrator.
The Administrator shall make any final decision which provides for the suspension or termination of, or the refusal to grant or continue Federal financial assistance, acceleration repayment or the imposition of any other sanction available under the regulations or taken under other means authorized by law.
(f)
Content of orders.
The final decision may provide for accelerating of repayment, suspension or termination of, or refusal to approve, disburse, or continue Federal financial assistance, in whole or in part, to which this regulation applies, and may contain such terms, conditions, and other provisions as are consistent with and will effectuate the purposes of the Act and this part, including provisions designed to assure that no Federal financial assistance to which this regulation applies will, thereafter, be extended to the applicant or recipient determined by such decision to have failed to comply with this part, unless and until it corrects its noncompliance and satisfies the Administrator that it will fully comply with this part.
(g)
Post termination proceedings.
(1) An applicant or recipient adversely affected by an order issued under paragraph (e) of this section shall be restored to full eligibility to receive Federal financial assistance only if it satisfies the terms and conditions of that order for such eligibility and it brings itself into compliance with this regulation and provides reasonable assurance that it will fully comply with this regulation.
(2) Any applicant or recipient adversely affected by an order entered
pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section may at any time request the Administrator to restore fully its eligibility to receive Federal financial assistance. Any such request shall be supported by information showing that the applicant or recipient has met the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section. If the Administrator determines that those requirements have been satisfied, he/she shall restore such eligibility.
(3) If the Administrator denies any such request, the applicant or recipient may submit a request for a hearing in writing, specifying why it believes the denial to have been in error. It shall there upon be given an expeditious hearing, with a decision on the record, in accordance with rules and procedures issued by the Administrator. The applicant or recipient shall be restored to such eligibility if it proves at such hearing that it satisfied the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section. While proceedings under this paragraph are pending, the sanctions imposed by the order issued under paragraph (f) of this section shall remain in effect.
§ 117.18
Judicial review.
(a) The complainant may file a civil action following the exhaustion of administrative remedies under the Act. Administrative remedies are exhausted if:
(1) 180 days have elapsed since the complainant filed the complaint and the Agency has made no finding with regard to the complaint; or
(2) The Agency has issued a finding in favor of the recipient.
(b) If the Agency fails to make a finding within 180 days or issues a finding in favor of the recipient, the Agency shall:
(1) Advise the complainant of this fact;
(2) Advise the complainant of the right to file a civil action for injunctive relief; and
(3) Inform the complainant:
(i) That the complainant may bring a civil action only in a United States district court for the district in which the recipient is found or transacts business;
(ii) That a complainant prevailing in a civil action has the right to be awarded the costs of the action, including reasonable attorney's fees, but that the complainant must demand these costs in the complaint;
(iii) That before commencing the action the complainant shall give 30 days notice by registered mail to the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Attorney General of the United States and the recipient;
(iv) That the notice must state: The alleged violation of the Act; the relief requested; the court in which the complainant is bringing the action; and whether or not attorney's fees are demanded in the event the complainant prevails; and
(v) That the complainant may not bring an action if the same alleged violation of the Act by the same recipient is the subject of a pending action in any court of the United States.
§ 117.19
Effect on other regulations.
(a) All regulations, orders or like directions heretofore issued by SBA which impose requirements designed to prohibit any discrimination against individuals on the grounds of age and which authorize the suspension or termination of or refusal to grant or to continue financial assistance to any applicant for or recipient of such assistance for failure to comply with such requirements, are hereby superseded to the extent that such discrimination is prohibited by this part, except that nothing in this part shall be deemed to relieve any person of any obligation assumed or imposed under any such superseded regulation, order, instruction, or like direction prior to the effective date of this part. Nothing in this part, however, shall be deemed to supersede any of the following (including future amendments thereof):
(1) Executive Order 11246, as amended, and regulations issued thereunder;
(2) Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended;
(3) The Equal Credit Opportunity Act, as amended and Regulation B of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, (12 CFR part 202);
(4) Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended;
(5) Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968;
(6) Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972;
(7) Section 633(b) of the Small Business Act;
(8) Part 113 of title 13 of the Code of Federal Regulations (13 CFR part 113); or
(9) Any other statute, order, regulation or instruction, insofar as such order, regulations, or instruction prohibits discrimination on the grounds of age in any program or activity or situation to which this part is inapplicable on any other ground.
§ 117.20
Supervision and coordination.
The Administrator may from time to time assign to officials of SBA or to officials of other agencies of the Government with the consent of such agencies, responsibilities in connection with the effectuation of the purpose of the Act and this part (other than responsibility for final decision as provided in § 117.17), including the achievement of effective coordination and maximum uniformity within SBA and within the Executive Branch of the Government in the application of the Act and this part to similar programs or activities and in similar situations. Responsibility for administering and enforcing this part is assigned by the Administrator, to the Office of Civil Rights Compliance, Office of Equal Employment Opportunity and Compliance of the Small Business Administration.

# General Descriptions of SBA's Business Loan Programs
§ 120.1
Which loan programs does this part cover?
This part regulates SBA's financial assistance to small businesses under its general business loan programs (“7(a) loans”) authorized by section 7(a) of the Small Business Act (“the Act”), 15 U.S.C. 636(a), its microloan demonstration loan program (“Microloans”) authorized by section 7(m) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. 636(m), and its development company program (“504 loans”) authorized by Title V of the Small Business Investment Act, 15 U.S.C. 695 to 697f (“Title V”). These three programs constitute the business loan programs of the SBA.
§ 120.2
Descriptions of the business loan programs.
(a)
7(a) loans.
(1) 7(a) loans provide financing for general business purposes and may be:
(i) A direct loan by SBA;
(ii) An immediate participation loan by a Lender and SBA; or
(iii) A guaranteed loan (deferred participation) by which SBA guarantees a portion of a loan made by a Lender.
(2) A guaranteed loan is initiated by a Lender agreeing to make an SBA guaranteed loan to a small business and applying to SBA for SBA's guarantee under a blanket guarantee agreement (participation agreement) between SBA and the Lender. If SBA agrees to guarantee (authorizes) a portion of the loan, the Lender funds and services the loan. If the small business defaults on the loan, SBA's guarantee requires SBA to purchase its portion of the outstanding balance, upon demand by the Lender and subject to specific conditions. Regulations specific to 7(a) loans are found in subpart B of this part.
(b)
Microloans.
SBA makes loans and loan guarantees to non-profit Intermediaries that make short-term loans up to $50,000 to eligible small businesses for general business purposes, except payment of personal debts. SBA also makes grants to Intermediaries for use in providing management assistance and counseling to small businesses. Regulations specific to these loans are found in subpart G of this part.
(c)
504 loans.
Projects involving 504 loans require long-term fixed-asset financing for small businesses. A Certified Development Company (CDC) provides the final portion of this financing with a 504 loan made from the proceeds of a Debenture issued by the CDC, guaranteed 100 percent by SBA (with the full faith and credit of the United States), and sold to investors. The regulations specific to these loans are found in subpart H of this part.
[61 FR 3235, Jan. 31, 1996, as amended at 76 FR 63545, Oct. 12, 2011]
§ 120.3
Pilot programs.
The Administrator of SBA may from time to time suspend, modify, or waive rules for a limited period of time to test new programs or ideas. The Administrator shall publish a document in the
Federal Register
explaining the reasons for these actions.
§ 120.4
Severability.
Any provision of this part held to be invalid or unenforceable as applied to any person, entity, or circumstance shall be construed so as to continue to give the maximum effect to such provision as permitted by law, including as applied to persons or entities not similarly situated or to dissimilar circumstances, unless such holding is that the provision of this part is invalid and unenforceable in all circumstances, in which event the provision shall be severable from the remainder of this part and shall not affect the remainder thereof.

# Subpart A—Policies Applying to All Business Loans

# Eligibility Requirements
§ 120.100
What are the basic eligibility requirements for all applicants for SBA business loans?
To be eligible for an SBA business loan, a small business applicant must:
(a) Be an operating business (except for loans to Eligible Passive Companies);
(b) Be organized for profit;
(c) Be located in the United States;
(d) Be small under the size requirements of part 121 of this chapter (including affiliates). See subpart H of this part for the size standards of part 121 of this chapter which apply only to 504 loans; and
(e) Be able to demonstrate a need for the desired credit.
§ 120.101
Credit not available elsewhere.
SBA provides business loan assistance only to applicants for whom the desired credit is not otherwise available on reasonable terms from non-Federal, non-State, and non-local government sources. Accordingly, SBA requires the Lender or CDC to certify or otherwise show that the desired credit is unavailable to the applicant on reasonable terms and conditions from non-Federal, non-State, and non-local government sources without SBA assistance, taking into consideration factors associated with conventional lending practices, including: The business industry of the loan applicant; whether the loan applicant has been in operation two years or less; the adequacy of collateral available to secure the loan; the loan term necessary to reasonably assure repayment of the loan from actual or projected business cash flow; and any other factor relating to the particular loan application that cannot be overcome except through obtaining a Federal loan guarantee under prudent lending standards. Submission of an application to SBA by a Lender or CDC constitutes certification by the Lender or CDC that it has examined the availability of credit to the applicant, has based its certification upon
that examination, and has substantiation in its file to support the certification.
[61 FR 3235, Jan. 31, 1996, as amended at 85 FR 14780, Mar. 16, 2020]
§ 120.102
[Reserved]
§ 120.104
Are businesses financed by SBICs eligible?
SBA may make or guarantee loans to a business financed by an SBIC if SBA's collateral position will be superior to that of the SBIC. SBA may also make or guarantee a loan to an otherwise eligible small business which temporarily is owned or controlled by an SBIC under the regulations in part 107 of this chapter. SBA neither guarantees SBIC loans nor makes loans jointly with SBICs.
§ 120.105
Special consideration for veterans.
SBA will give special consideration to a small business owned by a veteran or, if the veteran chooses not to apply, to a business owned or controlled by one of the veteran's dependents. If the veteran is deceased or permanently disabled, SBA will give special consideration to one survivor or dependent. SBA will process the application of a business owned or controlled by a veteran or dependent promptly, resolve close questions in the applicant's favor, and pay particular attention to maximum loan maturity. For SBA loans, a veteran is a person honorably discharged from active military service.

# Ineligible Businesses and Eligible Passive Companies

What businesses are ineligible for SBA business loans?
The following types of businesses are ineligible:
(a) Non-profit businesses (for-profit subsidiaries are eligible);

(o) Businesses in which the Lender or CDC, or any of its Associates owns an equity interest;
(p) Businesses which:
(1) Present live performances of a prurient sexual nature; or

For purposes of this section,
a compromise agreement shall also be considered a loss;
(r) Businesses primarily engaged in political or lobbying activities; and
(s) Speculative businesses (such as oil wildcatting).
[61 FR 3235, Jan. 31, 1996, as amended at 82 FR 39502, Aug. 21, 2017; 87 FR 38908, June 30, 2022; 89 FR 34101, Apr. 30, 2024]
§ 120.111
What conditions must an Eligible Passive Company satisfy?
An Eligible Passive Company must use loan proceeds only to acquire or lease, and/or improve or renovate, real or personal property (including eligible refinancing), that it leases to one or more Operating Companies for conducting the Operating Company's business, or to finance a change of ownership between the existing owners of the Eligible Passive Company. When the Operating Company is a co-borrower on the loan, loan proceeds also may be used by the Operating Company for working capital and/or the purchase of other assets, including intangible assets, for the Operating Company's use as provided in paragraph (a)(5) of this section. (References to Operating Company in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section mean each Operating Company.) In the 504 loan program, if the Eligible Passive Company owns assets in addition to the real estate or other eligible long-term fixed assets, loan proceeds may not be used to finance a change of ownership between existing owners of the Eligible Passive Company unless the additional assets owned by the Eligible Passive Company are directly related to the real estate or other eligible long-term fixed assets, the amount attributable to the additional assets is de minimis, and the additional assets are excluded from the Project financing. Any ownership structure or legal form may qualify as an Eligible Passive Company.
(a) Conditions that apply to all legal forms:
(1) The Operating Company must be an eligible small business, and the proposed use of the proceeds must be an eligible use if the Operating Company were obtaining the financing directly;
(2) The Eligible Passive Company (with the exception of a trust) and the Operating Company each must be small under the appropriate size standards in part 121 of this chapter;
(3) The lease between the Eligible Passive Company and the Operating Company must be in writing and must be subordinate to SBA's mortgage, trust deed lien, or security interest on the property. The Eligible Passive Company (as landlord) must furnish as collateral for the loan an assignment of all rents paid under the lease. The rent or lease payments cannot exceed the amount necessary to make the loan payment to the lender, and an additional amount to cover the Eligible Passive Company's direct expenses of holding the property, such as maintenance, insurance and property taxes;
(4) The lease between the Eligible Passive Company and the Operating Company, including options to renew exercisable solely by the Operating Company, must have a remaining term at least equal to the term of the loan;
(5) The Operating Company must be a guarantor or co-borrower with the Eligible Passive Company. In a 7(a) loan that includes working capital and/or the purchase of other assets, including intangible assets, for the Operating Company's use, the Operating Company must be a co-borrower.
(6) Each holder of an ownership interest constituting at least 20 percent of either the Eligible Passive Company or the Operating Company must guarantee the loan. The trustee shall execute the guaranty on behalf of any trust. When deemed necessary for credit or other reasons, SBA or, for a loan processed under an SBA Lender's delegated authority, the SBA Lender may require other appropriate individuals or entities to provide full or limited guarantees of the loan without regard to the percentage of their ownership interests, if any.
(b)
Additional conditions that apply to trusts.
The eligibility status of the trustor will determine trust eligibility. All donors to the trust will be deemed to have trustor status for eligibility purposes. A trust qualifying as an Eligible Passive Company may engage in other activities as authorized by its trust agreement. The trustee must warrant and certify that the trust will not be revoked or substantially amended for the term of the loan without the
consent of SBA. The trustor must guarantee the loan. For purposes of this section, the trustee shall certify to SBA that:
(1) The trustee has authority to act;
(2) The trust has the authority to borrow funds, pledge trust assets, and lease the property to the Operating Company;
(3) The trustee has provided accurate, pertinent language from the trust agreement confirming the above; and
(4) The trustee has provided and will continue to provide SBA with a true and complete list of all trustors and donors.

(f) A purpose which does not benefit the small business; or
(g) Any use restricted by §§ 120.201 and 120.884 (specific to 7(a) loans and 504 loans respectively).
[61 FR 3235, Jan. 31, 1996, as amended at 76 FR 9218, Feb. 17, 2011; 76 FR 63545, Oct. 12, 2011; 82 FR 39502, Aug. 21, 2017; 85 FR 7648, Feb. 10, 2020; 85 FR 80588, Dec. 14, 2020; 88 FR 21085, Apr. 10, 2023]

If the Borrower is an Eligible Passive Company which leases 100 percent of the new building's space to one or more Operating Companies, the Operating Company, or Operating Companies together, must follow the same rules set forth in this paragraph.
(b) If the SBA financing (whether 7(a) or 504) is for the acquisition, renovation, or reconstruction of an existing building, the Borrower may permanently lease up to 49 percent of the Rentable Property if the Borrower permanently occupies and uses no less than 51 percent of the Rentable Property. If the Borrower is an Eligible Passive Company which leases 100 percent of the space of the existing building to one or more Operating Companies, the Operating Company, or Operating Companies together, must follow the same rules set forth in this paragraph.
[68 FR 51679, Aug. 28, 2003]

# Ethical Requirements
§ 120.140
What ethical requirements apply to participants?
Lenders, Intermediaries, and CDCs (in this section, collectively referred to as “Participants”), must act ethically and exhibit good character. Ethical indiscretion of an Associate of a Participant or a member of a CDC will be attributed to the Participant. A Participant must promptly notify SBA if it obtains information concerning the unethical behavior of an Associate. The following are examples of such unethical behavior. A Participant may not:
(a) Self-deal;
(b) Have a real or apparent conflict of interest with a small business with which it is dealing (including any of its Associates or an Associate's Close Relatives) or SBA;
(c) Own an equity interest in a business that has received or is applying to receive SBA financing (during the term of the loan or within 6 months prior to the loan application);

(f) Engage in conduct reflecting a lack of business integrity or honesty;
(g) Be a convicted felon, or have an adverse final civil judgment (in a case involving fraud, breach of trust, or other conduct) that would cause the public to question the Participant's business integrity, taking into consideration such factors as the magnitude, repetition, harm caused, and remoteness in time of the activity or activities in question;
(h) Accept funding from any source that restricts, prioritizes, or conditions the types of small businesses that the Participant may assist under an SBA program or that imposes any conditions or requirements upon recipients of SBA assistance inconsistent with SBA's loan programs or regulations;
(i) Fail to disclose to SBA all relationships between the small business and its Associates (including Close Relatives of Associates), the Participant, and/or the lenders financing the Project of which it is aware or should be aware;
(j) Fail to disclose to SBA whether the loan will:
(1) Reduce the exposure of a Participant or an Associate of a Participant in a position to sustain a loss;
(2) Directly or indirectly finance the purchase of real estate, personal property or services (including insurance) from the Participant or an Associate of the Participant;
(3) Repay or refinance a debt due a Participant or an Associate of a Participant; or
(4) Require the small business, or an Associate (including Close Relatives of Associates), to invest in the Participant (except for institutions which require an investment from all members
as a condition of membership, such as a Production Credit Association);
(k) Issue a real estate forward commitment to a builder or developer; or
(l) Engage in any activity which taints its objective judgment in evaluating the loan.
[61 FR 3235, Jan. 31, 1996, as amended at 68 FR 57980, Oct. 7, 2003]

# Credit Criteria for SBA Loans
§ 120.150
What are SBA's lending criteria?
The applicant (including an Operating Company) must be creditworthy. Loans must be so sound as to reasonably assure repayment. Lenders and CDCs must use appropriate and prudent generally acceptable commercial credit analysis processes and procedures consistent with those used for their similarly-sized, non-SBA guaranteed commercial loans. Lenders, CDCs, and SBA may use a business credit scoring model. When approving direct or guaranteed loans, Lenders, CDCs, and SBA may consider (as applicable) the following criteria: credit score or credit history of the applicant (and the Operating Company, if applicable), its Associates and any guarantors; the earnings or cashflow of applicant; or where applicable any equity or collateral of the applicant.
[88 FR 21085, Apr. 10, 2023]
§ 120.151
What is the statutory limit for total loans to a Borrower?
The aggregate amount of the SBA portions of all loans to a single Borrower, including the Borrower's affiliates as defined in § 121.301(f) of this chapter, must not exceed a guaranty amount of $3,750,000, except as otherwise authorized by statute for a specific program. The maximum loan amount for any one 7(a) loan is $5,000,000. The amount of any loan received by an Eligible Passive Company applies to the loan limit of both the Eligible Passive Company and the Operating Company.
[61 FR 3235, Jan. 31, 1996, as amended at 68 FR 51680, Aug. 28, 2003; 76 FR 63546, Oct. 12, 2011; 81 FR 41428, June 27, 2016]
§ 120.160
Loan conditions.
The following requirements are normally required by SBA for all business loans:
(a)
Personal guarantees.
Holders of at least a 20 percent ownership interest generally must guarantee the loan. When deemed necessary for credit or other reasons, SBA or, for a loan processed under an SBA Lender's delegated authority, the SBA Lender, may require other appropriate individuals or entities to provide full or limited guarantees of the loan without regard to the percentage of their ownership interests, if any.
(b)
Appraisals.
SBA may require professional appraisals of the applicant's and principals' assets, a survey, or a feasibility study.
(c)
Hazard Insurance.
SBA requires hazard insurance for 7(a) loans greater than $500,000 and for 504 projects greater than $500,000, on all collateral.
[61 FR 3235, Jan. 31, 1996, as amended at 82 FR 39502, Aug. 21, 2017; 88 FR 21085, Apr. 10, 2023]

et seq.
)), a loan recipient must obtain flood insurance if any building (including mobile homes), machinery, or equipment acquired, installed, improved, constructed, or renovated with the proceeds of SBA financial assistance is located in a special flood hazard area. The requirement applies also to any inventory (business loan program), fixtures or furnishings contained or to be contained in the building. Mobile homes on a foundation are buildings. SBA, Lenders, CDCs, and Intermediaries must notify Borrowers that flood insurance must be maintained.
§ 120.171
Compliance with child support obligations.
Any holder of 50% or more of the ownership interest in the recipient of an SBA loan must certify that he or she is not more than 60 days delinquent on any obligation to pay child support arising under:
(a) An administrative order;
(b) A court order;
(c) A repayment agreement between the holder and a custodial parent; or
(d) A repayment agreement between the holder and a State agency providing child support enforcement services.
§ 120.172
Flood-plain and wetlands management.
(a) All loans must conform to requirements of Executive Orders 11988, “Flood Plain Management” (3 CFR, 1977 Comp., p. 117) and 11990, “Protection of Wetlands” (3 CFR, 1977 Comp., p. 121). Lenders, Intermediaries, CDCs, and SBA must comply with requirements applicable to them. Applicants must show:
(1) Whether the location for which financial assistance is proposed is in a floodplain or wetland;
(2) If it is in a floodplain, that the assistance is in compliance with local land use plans; and
(3) That any necessary construction or use permits will be issued.
(b) Generally, there is an 8-step decision making process with respect to:
(1) Construction or acquisition of anything, other than a building;
(2) Repair and restoration equal to more than 50% of the market value of a building; or
(3) Replacement of destroyed structures.
(c) SBA may determine for the following types of actions, on a case-by-case basis, that the full 8-step process is not warranted and that only the first step (determining if a proposed action is in the base floodplain) need be completed:
(1) Actions located outside the base floodplain;
(2) Repairs, other than to buildings, that are less than 50% of the market value;
(3) Replacement of building contents, materials, and equipment;
(4) Hazard mitigation measures;
(5) Working capital loans; or
(6) SBA loan assistance of $1,500,000 or less.
§ 120.174
Earthquake hazards.
When loan proceeds are used to construct a new building or an addition to an existing building, the construction must conform with the “National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (“NEHRP”) Recommended Provisions for the Development of Seismic Regulations for New Buildings” (which can be obtained from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Publications Office, Washington, DC) or a code identified by SBA as being substantially equivalent.
§ 120.175
Coastal barrier islands.
SBA and Intermediaries may not make or guarantee any loan within the Coastal Barrier Resource System.
§ 120.176
Compliance with other laws.
All SBA loans are subject to all applicable laws, including (without limitation) the civil rights laws (
see
parts 112, 113, 117 and 136 of this chapter), prohibiting discrimination on the grounds of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, marital status, disability or age. SBA requests agreements or evidence to support or document compliance with these laws, including reports required by applicable statutes or the regulations in this chapter.

# Applicability and Enforceability of Loan Program Requirements
§ 120.180
Compliance with Loan Program Requirements.
SBA Lenders and Intermediaries must comply and maintain familiarity with Loan Program Requirements for the 7(a) Loan Program, 504 Loan Program, and the Microloan Program, as applicable, and as such requirements are revised from time to time. Loan Program Requirements in effect at the time that an SBA Lender or Intermediary takes an action in connection with a particular loan govern that specific action. For example, although loan closing requirements in effect when an SBA Lender closes a loan will govern the closing actions, an SBA Lender's liquidation actions on the same loan are subject to the liquidation requirements in effect at the time that a liquidation action is taken. An SBA Lender or Intermediary must maintain sufficient documentation to
demonstrate that Loan Program Requirements have been satisfied.
[85 FR 14781, Mar. 16, 2020]
§ 120.181
Status of Lenders and CDCs.
Lenders, CDCs and their contractors are independent contractors that are responsible for their own actions with respect to a 7(a) or 504 loan. SBA has no responsibility or liability for any claim by a borrower, guarantor or other party alleging injury as a result of any allegedly wrongful action taken by a Lender, CDC or an employee, agent, or contractor of a Lender or CDC.
[72 FR 18360, Apr. 12, 2007]

# Loan Applications
§ 120.190
Where does an applicant apply for a loan?
An applicant for a business loan should apply to:
(a) A Lender for a guaranteed or immediate participation loan;
(b) A CDC for a 504 loan;
(c) An Intermediary for a Microloan; or
(d) SBA for a direct loan.
§ 120.191
The contents of a business loan application.
For most business loans, SBA requires that an application for a business loan contain, among other things, a description of the history and nature of the business, the amount and purpose of the loan, the collateral offered for the loan, current financial statements, historical financial statements (or tax returns if appropriate) for the past three years, IRS tax verification, and a business plan, when applicable. Personal histories and financial statements will be required from principals of the applicant (and the Operating Company, if applicable).
§ 120.192
Approval or denial.
Applicants receive notice of approval or denial by the Lender, CDC, Intermediary, or SBA, as appropriate. Notice of denial will include the reasons.
[61 FR 3235, Jan. 31, 1996, as amended at 88 FR 21899, Apr. 12, 2023]
§ 120.193
Reconsideration after denial.
An applicant or recipient of a business loan may request reconsideration of a denied loan or loan modification request within 6 months of denial. Applicants denied due to a size determination can appeal that determination under part 121 of this chapter. All others must be submitted to the office that denied the original request. To prevail, the applicant must demonstrate that it has overcome all legitimate reasons for denial. Six months after denial, a new application is required. If the reconsideration is denied, a second and final reconsideration may be considered by the Director, Office of Financial Assistance (D/FA) or designee(s), whose decision is final. The SBA Administrator, solely within the Administrator's discretion, may choose to review the matter and make the final decision. Such discretionary authority of the Administrator does not create additional rights of appeal on the part of an applicant not otherwise specified in SBA regulations.
[61 FR 3235, Jan. 31, 1996, as amended at 88 FR 21085, Apr. 10, 2023]

Loans more than $150,000 may receive a maximum guaranty of 75 percent, except as otherwise authorized by law.
[61 FR 3235, Jan. 31, 1996, as amended at 68 FR 51680, Aug. 28, 2003; 76 FR 63546, Oct. 12, 2011]
