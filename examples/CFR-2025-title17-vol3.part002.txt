(ii) The registrant may redact specific provisions or terms of exhibits required to be filed by paragraph (b)(2) of this section if the registrant customarily and actually treats that information as private or confidential and if the omitted information is not material. If it does so, the registrant should mark the exhibit index to indicate that portions of the exhibit or exhibits have been omitted and include a prominent statement on the first page of the redacted exhibit that certain identified information has been excluded from the exhibit because it is both not material and is the type that the registrant treats as private or confidential. The registrant also must include brackets indicating where the information is omitted from the filed version of the exhibit. If requested by the Commission or its staff, the registrant must promptly provide on a supplemental basis an unredacted copy of the exhibit and its materiality and privacy or confidentiality analyses. Upon evaluation of the registrant's supplemental materials, the Commission or its staff may require the registrant to amend its filing to include in the exhibit any previously redacted information that is not adequately supported by the registrant's analyses. The registrant may request confidential treatment of the supplemental material submitted under this paragraph (b)(2)(ii) pursuant to § 200.83 of this chapter while it is in the possession of the Commission or its staff. After completing its review of the supplemental information, the Commission or its staff will return or destroy it if the registrant complies with the procedures outlined in § 230.418 or 240.12b-4 of this chapter.
(3)(i)
Articles of incorporation.
The articles of incorporation of the registrant or instruments corresponding thereto as currently in effect and any amendments thereto. Whenever the registrant files an amendment to its articles of incorporation, it must file a complete copy of the articles as amended. However, if such amendment is being reported on Form 8-K (§ 249.308 of this chapter), the registrant is required to file only the text of the amendment as a Form 8-K exhibit. In such case, a complete copy of the articles of incorporation as amended must be filed as an exhibit to the next Securities Act registration statement or periodic report filed by the registrant to which this exhibit requirement applies. Where it is impracticable for the registrant to file a charter amendment authorizing new securities with the appropriate state authority prior to the effective date of the registration statement registering such securities, the registrant may file as an exhibit to the registration statement the form of amendment to be filed with the state authority. In such a case, if material changes are made after the copy is filed, the registrant must also file the changed copy.
(ii)
Bylaws.
The bylaws of the registrant or instruments corresponding thereto as currently in effect and any amendments thereto. Whenever the registrant files an amendment to the bylaws, it must file a complete copy of the amended bylaws. However, if such amendment is being reported on Form 8-K (§ 249.308 of this chapter), the registrant is required to file only the text of the amendment as a Form 8-K exhibit. In such case, a complete copy of the bylaws as amended must be filed as an exhibit to the next Securities Act registration statement or periodic report filed by the registrant to which this exhibit requirement applies.

This exhibit otherwise need only be filed with the other applicable registration forms where the tax consequences are material to an investor and a representation as to tax consequences is set forth in the filing. If a tax opinion is set forth in full in the filing, an indication that such is the case may be made in lieu of filing the otherwise required exhibit.

(i)(A) Every contract not made in the ordinary course of business that is material to the registrant and is to be performed in whole or in part at or after the filing of the registration statement or report.

A compensation plan assumed by a registrant in connection with a merger, consolidation or other acquisition transaction pursuant to which the registrant may make further grants or awards of its equity securities shall be considered a compensation plan of the registrant for purposes of the preceding sentence.
(C) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(10)(iii)(A) above, the following management contracts or compensatory plans, contracts or arrangements need not be filed:
(
1
) Ordinary purchase and sales agency agreements.

(iv) The registrant may redact specific provisions or terms of exhibits required to be filed by this paragraph (b)(10) if the registrant customarily and actually treats that information as private or confidential and if the omitted information is not material.

The registrant also must include brackets indicating where the information is omitted from the filed version of the exhibit. If requested by the Commission or its staff, the registrant must promptly provide on a supplemental basis an unredacted copy of the exhibit and its materiality and privacy or confidentiality analyses. Upon evaluation of the registrant's supplemental materials, the Commission or its staff may require the registrant to amend its filing to include in the exhibit any previously redacted information that is not adequately supported by the registrant's analyses. The registrant may request confidential treatment of the supplemental material submitted under this paragraph (b)(10)(iv) pursuant to § 200.83 of this chapter while it is in the possession of the Commission or its staff.

For purposes of paragraph (b)(10)(i) of this Item, a “newly reporting registrant” is:
1. Any registrant filing a registration statement that, at the time of such filing, is not subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, whether or not such registrant has ever previously been subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d),
2. Any registrant that has not filed an annual report since the revival of a previously suspended reporting obligation, and
3. Any registrant that:
a. Was a shell company, other than a business combination related shell company, as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.12b-2), immediately before completing a transaction that has the effect of causing it to cease being a shell company and
b. Has not filed a registration statement or Form 8-K as required by Items 2.01 and 5.06 of that form, since the completion of such transaction.
4. For example, newly reporting registrants would include a registrant that is filing its first registration statement under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, and a registrant that was a public shell company, other than a business combination related shell company, and completes a reverse merger transaction causing it to cease being a shell company.
Instruction 2 to paragraph (b)(10):
With the exception of management contracts, in order to comply with paragraph (b)(10)(iii) of this section, registrants need only file copies of the various compensatory plans and need not file each individual director's or executive officer's personal agreement under the plans unless there are particular provisions in such personal agreements whose disclosure in an exhibit is necessary to an investor's understanding of that individual's compensation under the plan.
Instruction 3 to paragraph (b)(10):
If a material contract is executed or becomes effective during the reporting period reflected by a Form 10-Q or Form 10-K, it must be filed as an exhibit to the Form 10-Q or Form 10-K filed for the corresponding period.

See
Rule 439 (§ 230.439 of this chapter).

Power of attorney.
If any name is signed to the registration statement or report pursuant to a power of attorney, manually signed copies of such power of attorney shall be filed.

A power of attorney that is filed with the Commission shall relate to a specific filing or an amendment thereto, provided, however, that a power of attorney relating to a registration statement under the Securities Act or an amendment thereto also may relate to any registration statement for the same offering that is to be effective upon filing pursuant to Rule 462(b) under the Securities Act (§ 230.462(b) of this chapter). A power of attorney that confers general authority shall not be filed with the Commission.
(25)
Statement of eligibility of trustee.
(i) A statement of eligibility and qualification of each person designated to act as trustee under an indenture to be qualified under the Trust Indenture
Act of 1939. Such statement of eligibility shall be bound separately from the other exhibits.
(ii)
Electronic filings.
The requirement to bind separately the statement of eligibility and qualification of each person designated to act as a trustee under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 from other exhibits shall not apply to statements submitted in electronic format. Rather, such statements must be submitted as exhibits in the same electronic submission as the registration statement to which they relate, or in an amendment thereto, except that electronic filers that rely on Trust Indenture Act Section 305(b)(2) for determining the eligibility of the trustee under indentures for securities to be issued, offered or sold on a delayed basis by or on behalf of the registrant shall file such statements separately in the manner prescribed by § 260.5b-1 through § 260.5b-3 of this chapter and by the EDGAR Filer Manual.

With respect to asset-backed issuers, the certification must be signed by either: (1) The senior officer in charge of securitization of the depositor if the depositor is signing the report on Form 10-K; or (2) The senior officer in charge of the servicing function of the servicer if the servicer is signing the report on Form 10-K on behalf of the issuing entity. See Rules 13a-14(e) and 15d-14(e) (§§ 240.13a-14(e) and 240.15d-14(e)). If multiple servicers are involved in servicing the pool assets, the senior officer in charge of the servicing function of the master servicer (or entity performing the equivalent function) must sign if a representative of the servicer is to sign the certification. If there is a master servicer and one or more underlying servicers, the references in the certification relate to the master servicer. A natural person must sign the certification in his or her individual capacity, although the title of that person in the organization of which he or she is an officer may be included under the signature.
2
The first version of paragraph 4 is to be used when the servicer is signing the report on behalf of the issuing entity. The second version of paragraph 4 is to be used when the depositor is signing the report.

plan declared effective before December 17, 1993 by the Commission under Section 11A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78k-1) and such investors receive new securities or securities in another entity that are reported under a transaction reporting plan declared effective before December 17, 1993 by the Commission under Section 11A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78k-1), except that, for purposes of this paragraph, securities that are reported under a transaction reporting plan declared effective before December 17, 1993 by the Commission under Section 11A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 shall not include securities listed on the American Stock Exchange's Emerging Company Marketplace;

means an issuer whose reporting obligation results from either the registration of an offering of asset-backed securities under the Securities Act, or the registration of a class of asset-backed securities under section 12 of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78
l
).
(c)(1)
Asset-backed security
means a security that is primarily serviced by the cash flows of a discrete pool of receivables or other financial assets, either fixed or revolving, that by their terms convert into cash within a finite time period, plus any rights or other
assets designed to assure the servicing or timely distributions of proceeds to the security holders; provided that in the case of financial assets that are leases, those assets may convert to cash partially by the cash proceeds from the disposition of the physical property underlying such leases.
(2) The following additional conditions apply in order to be considered an
asset-backed security:
(i) Neither the depositor nor the issuing entity is an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-1
et seq.
) nor will become an investment company as a result of the asset-backed securities transaction.
(ii) The activities of the issuing entity for the asset-backed securities are limited to passively owning or holding the pool of assets, issuing the asset-backed securities supported or serviced by those assets, and other activities reasonably incidental thereto.
(iii) No non-performing assets are part of the asset pool as of the measurement date.
(iv) Delinquent assets do not constitute 50% or more, as measured by dollar volume, of the asset pool as of the measurement date.
(v) With respect to securities that are backed by leases, the portion of the securitized pool balance attributable to the residual value of the physical property underlying the leases, as determined in accordance with the transaction agreements for the securities, does not constitute:

(B) For all other leases, 50% or more, as measured by dollar volume, of the securitized pool balance as of the measurement date.
(3) Notwithstanding the requirement in paragraph (c)(1) of this section that the asset pool be a discrete pool of assets, the following are considered to be a discrete pool of assets for purposes of being considered an
asset-backed security:
(i)
Master trusts.
The offering related to the securities contemplates adding additional assets to the pool that backs such securities in connection with future issuances of asset-backed securities backed by such pool. The offering related to the securities also may contemplate additions to the asset pool, to the extent consistent with paragraphs (c)(3)(ii) and (c)(3)(iii) of this section, in connection with maintaining minimum pool balances in accordance with the transaction agreements for master trusts with revolving periods or receivables or other financial assets that arise under revolving accounts.
(ii)
Prefunding periods.
The offering related to the securities contemplates a prefunding account where a portion of the proceeds of that offering is to be used for the future acquisition of additional pool assets, if the duration of the prefunding period does not extend for more than one year from the date of issuance of the securities and the portion of the proceeds for such prefunding account does not involve in excess of:
(A) For master trusts, 25% of the aggregate principal balance of the total asset pool whose cash flows support the securities; and
(B) For other offerings, 25% of the proceeds of the offering.
(iii)
Revolving periods.
The offering related to the securities contemplates a revolving period where cash flows from the pool assets may be used to acquire additional pool assets, provided, that, for securities backed by receivables or other financial assets that do not arise under revolving accounts, the revolving period does not extend for more than three years from the date of issuance of the securities and the additional pool assets are of the same general character as the original pool assets.
Instructions to Item 1101(c).
1. For purposes of determining non-performing, delinquency and residual value thresholds, the “measurement date” means either:
a. The designated cut-off date for the transaction (
i.e.
, the date on and after which collections on the pool assets accrue for the benefit of asset-backed security holders), if applicable; or
b. In the case of master trusts, the date as of which delinquency and loss information or securitized pool balance information, as applicable, is presented in the prospectus for the asset-backed securities to be filed pursuant to § 230.424(b) of this chapter.
2. Non-performing and delinquent assets that are not funded or purchased by proceeds
from the securities and that are not considered in cash flow calculations for the securities need not be considered as part of the asset pool for purposes of determining non-performing and delinquency thresholds.
3. For purposes of determining non-performing, delinquency and residual value thresholds for master trusts, calculations are to be measured against the total asset pool whose cash flows support the securities.
4. For purposes of determining residual value thresholds, residual values need not be included in measuring against the thresholds to the extent a separate party is obligated for such amounts (e.g., through a residual value guarantee, residual value insurance or where the lessee is obligated to cover any residual losses).
(d)
Delinquent
, for purposes of determining if a pool asset is delinquent, means if a pool asset is more than 30 or 31 days or a single payment cycle, as applicable, past due from the contractual due date, as determined in accordance with any of the following:
(1) The transaction agreements for the asset-backed securities;
(2) The delinquency recognition policies of the sponsor, any affiliate of the sponsor that originated the pool asset or the servicer of the pool asset; or
(3) The delinquency recognition policies applicable to such pool asset established by the primary safety and soundness regulator of any entity listed in paragraph (d)(2) of this section or the program or regulatory entity that oversees the program under which the pool asset was originated.
(e)
Depositor
means the depositor who receives or purchases and transfers or sells the pool assets to the issuing entity. For asset-backed securities transactions where there is not an intermediate transfer of the assets from the sponsor to the issuing entity, the term depositor refers to the sponsor. For asset-backed securities transactions where the person transferring or selling the pool assets is itself a trust, the depositor of the issuing entity is the
depositor
of that trust.
(f)
Issuing entity
means the trust or other entity created at the direction of the sponsor or depositor that owns or holds the pool assets and in whose name the asset-backed securities supported or serviced by the pool assets are issued.
(g)
Non-performing
, for purposes of determining if a pool asset is non-performing, means a pool asset if any of the following is true:
(1) The pool asset would be treated as wholly or partially charged-off under the requirements in the transaction agreements for the asset-backed securities;
(2) The pool asset would be treated as wholly or partially charged-off under the charge-off policies of the sponsor, an affiliate of the sponsor that originates the pool asset or a servicer that services the pool asset; or
(3) The pool asset would be treated as wholly or partially charged-off under the charge-off policies applicable to such pool asset established by the primary safety and soundness regulator of any entity listed in paragraph (g)(2) of this section or the program or regulatory entity that oversees the program under which the pool asset was originated.
(h)
NRSRO
has the same meaning as the term “nationally recognized statistical rating organization” as used in § 240.15c3-1(c)(2)(vi)(F) of this chapter.
(i)
Obligor
means any person who is directly or indirectly committed by contract or other arrangement to make payments on all or part of the obligations on a pool asset.
(j)
Servicer
means any person responsible for the management or collection of the pool assets or making allocations or distributions to holders of the asset-backed securities. The term
servicer
does not include a trustee for the issuing entity or the asset-backed securities that makes allocations or distributions to holders of the asset-backed securities if the trustee receives such allocations or distributions from a servicer and the trustee does not otherwise perform the functions of a servicer.
(k)
Significant obligor
means any of the following:
(1) An obligor or a group of affiliated obligors on any pool asset or group of pool assets if such pool asset or group of pool assets represents 10% or more of the asset pool.
(2) A single property or group of related properties securing a pool asset or a group of pool assets if such pool asset or group of pool assets represents 10% or more of the asset pool.
(3) A lessee or group of affiliated lessees if the related lease or group of leases represents 10% or more of the asset pool.
Instructions to Item 1101(k):
1. Regarding paragraph (k)(3) of this section, the calculation must focus on the leases whose cash flow supports the asset-backed securities directly or indirectly (including the residual value of the physical property underlying the leases if a portion of the securitized pool balance is attributable to the residual value of such property), regardless of whether the asset pool contains the leases themselves, mortgages on properties that are the subject of the leases or other assets related to the leases.
2. If separate pool assets, or properties underlying pool assets, are cross-defaulted and/or cross-collateralized, such pool assets are to be aggregated and considered together in determining concentration levels.
3. If the pool asset is a mortgage or lease relating to real estate, the pool asset is non-recourse to the obligor, and the obligor does not manage the property or does not own other assets and has no other operations, then the obligor need not be considered a separate significant obligor from the real estate. Otherwise, the obligor is a separate significant obligor.
4. The determination of significant obligors is to be made as of the designated cut-off date for the transaction (
i.e.
, the date on and after which collections on the pool assets accrue for the benefit of asset-backed security holders), provided, that, in the case of master trusts, the determination is to be made as of the cut-off date (or issuance date if there is not a cut-off date) for each issuance of asset-backed securities backed by the same asset pool. In addition, if disclosure is required pursuant to either Item 6.05 of Form 8-K (17 CFR 249.308) or in a Form 10-D (17 CFR 249.312) pursuant to Item 1121(b) of this Regulation AB, the determination of significant obligors is to be made against the asset pool described in such report. However, if the percentage concentration regarding an obligor falls below 10% subsequent to the determination dates discussed in this Instruction, the obligor no longer need be considered a significant obligor.
(l)
Sponsor
means the person who organizes and initiates an asset-backed securities transaction by selling or transferring assets, either directly or indirectly, including through an affiliate, to the issuing entity.
(m)
Asset representations reviewer
means any person appointed to review the underlying assets for compliance with the representations and warranties on the underlying pool assets and is not affiliated with any sponsor, depositor, servicer, or trustee of the transaction, or any of their affiliates. The asset representations reviewer shall not be the party to determine whether noncompliance with representations or warranties constitutes a breach of any contractual provision. The asset representations reviewer also shall not be the same party or an affiliate of any party hired by the sponsor or underwriter to perform pre-closing due diligence work on the pool assets.

(1) The types or categories of securities that may be offered, such as interest-weighted or principal-weighted classes (including IO (interest only) or PO (principal only) securities), planned amortization or companion classes or residual or subordinated interests.
(2) The flow of funds for the transaction, including the payment allocations, rights and distribution priorities among all classes of the issuing entity's securities, and within each class, with respect to cash flows, credit enhancement or other support and any other structural features designed to enhance credit, facilitate the timely payment of monies due on the pool assets or owing to security holders, adjust the rate of return on the asset-backed securities, or preserve monies that will or might be distributed to security holders. In addition to an appropriate narrative discussion of the allocation and priority structure of pool cash flows, present the flow of funds graphically if doing so will aid understanding. In the flow of funds discussion, provide information regarding any requirements directing cash flows from the pool assets (such as to reserve accounts, cash collateral accounts or expenses) and the purpose and operation of such requirements.
(3) In describing the interest rate or rate of return on the asset-backed securities and how such amounts are payable, explain how the rate is determined and how frequently it will be determined. If the rate to be paid can be a combination of two or more rates (such as the lesser of a variable rate or the actual weighted average net coupon on the pool assets), provide clear information regarding each rate and when each rate applies.
(4) How principal, if any, will be paid on the asset-backed securities, including maturity dates, amortization or principal distribution schedules, principal distribution dates, formulas for calculating principal distributions from the cash flows and other factors that will affect the timing or amount of principal payments for each class of securities.
(5) The denominations in which the asset-backed securities may be issued.
(6) Any specified changes to the transaction structure that would be triggered upon a default or event of default (such as a change in distribution priority among classes).
(7) Any liquidation, amortization, performance or similar triggers or events, and the rights of investors or changes to the transaction structure or flow of funds if such events were to occur.
(i) Describe how the delinquency threshold that triggers a review by the
asset representations reviewer was determined to be appropriate. In describing the appropriateness of such delinquency threshold, compare such delinquency threshold against the delinquencies disclosed for prior securitized pools of the sponsor for that asset type in accordance with Item 1105 of Regulation AB (§ 229.1105).
(ii) [Reserved]

(10) Any provisions contained in other securities that could result in a cross-default or cross-collateralization.
(11) Any minimum standards, restrictions or suitability requirements regarding potential investors in purchasing the securities or any restrictions on ownership or transfer of the securities.

If the amount of such fees or expenses is not fixed, provide the formula used to determine such fees or expenses. The tabular presentation should be accompanied by footnotes or other accompanying narrative disclosure to the extent necessary for an understanding of the timing or amount of such fees or expenses, such as any restrictions or limits on fees or whether the estimate may change in certain instances, such as in an event of default (and how the fees would change in such an instance or the factors that would affect the change). In addition, through footnote or other accompanying narrative disclosure, describe if any, and if so how, such fees or expenses can be changed without notice to, or approval by, security holders and any restrictions on the ability to change a fee or expense amount, such as due to a change in transaction party.
(d)
Excess cash flow.
(1) Describe the disposition of residual or excess cash flows. Identify who owns any residual or retained interests to the cash flows if such person is affiliated with the sponsor, depositor, issuing entity or any entity identified in Item 1119(a) of this Regulation AB or if such person has rights that may alter the transaction structure beyond receipt of residual or excess cash flows.

provided, however
, that in the case of a master trust, a title of a class of securities must include the word “callable” when an optional redemption or termination feature may be exercised when 25% or more of the original principal balance of the particular series in which the class was issued is still outstanding.
(g)
Prepayment, maturity and yield considerations.
(1) Describe any models, including the related material assumptions and limitations, used as a means to identify cash flow patterns with respect to the pool assets.
(2) Describe to the extent material the degree to which each class of securities is sensitive to changes in the rate of payment on the pool assets (e.g., prepayment or interest rate sensitivity), and describe the consequences of such changing rate of payment. Provide statistical information of such effects, such as the effect of prepayments on yield and weighted average life.
(3) Describe any special allocations of prepayment risks among the classes of securities, and whether any class protects other classes from the effects of the uncertain timing of cash flow.

(c) If the registrant has been unable to meet any significant delivery commitments in the last three years, describe the circumstances concerning such events and their impact on the registrant.
(d) For purposes of this Item,
available reserves
are estimates of the amounts of oil and gas which the registrant can produce from current proved developed reserves using presently installed equipment under existing economic and operating conditions and an estimate of amounts that others can deliver to the registrant under long-term contracts or agreements on a per-day, per-month, or per-year basis.
§ 229.1208
(Item 1208) Oil and gas properties, wells, operations, and acreage.
(a) Disclose, as of a reasonably current date or as of the end of the fiscal year, the total gross and net productive wells, expressed separately for oil and gas (including synthetic oil and gas produced through wells) and the total gross and net developed acreage (
i.e.
, acreage assignable to productive wells) by geographic area.
(b) Disclose, as of a reasonably current date or as of the end of the fiscal year, the amount of undeveloped acreage, both leases and concessions, if any, expressed in both gross and net acres by geographic area, together with an indication of acreage concentrations, and, if material, the minimum remaining terms of leases and concessions.
(c)
Definitions.
For purposes of this Item 1208, the following terms shall be defined as indicated:
(1) A
gross well or acre
is a well or acre in which the registrant owns a working interest. The number of gross wells is the total number of wells in which the registrant owns a working interest. Count one or more completions in the same bore hole as one well. In a footnote, disclose the number of wells with multiple completions. If one of the multiple completions in a well is an oil completion, classify the well as an oil well.
(2) A
net well or acre
is deemed to exist when the sum of fractional ownership working interests in gross wells or acres equals one. The number of net wells or acres is the sum of the fractional working interests owned in gross wells or acres expressed as whole numbers and fractions of whole numbers.
(3)
Productive wells
include producing wells and wells mechanically capable of production.
(4)
Undeveloped acreage
encompasses those leased acres on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of economic quantities of oil or gas regardless of whether such acreage contains proved reserves. Do not confuse undeveloped acreage with undrilled acreage held by production under the terms of the lease.

# Source:
83 FR 66448, Dec. 26, 2018, unless otherwise noted.
§ 229.1300
(Item 1300) Definitions.
As used in this subpart, these terms have the following meanings:
Adequate geological evidence,
when used in the context of mineral resource determination, means evidence that is sufficient to establish geological and grade or quality continuity with reasonable certainty.
Conclusive geological evidence,
when used in the context of mineral resource determination, means evidence that is sufficient to test and confirm geological and grade or quality continuity.
Cut-off grade
is the grade (
i.e.,
the concentration of metal or mineral in rock) that determines the destination of the material during mining. For purposes of establishing “prospects of economic extraction,” the cut-off grade is the grade that distinguishes material deemed to have no economic value (it
will not be mined in underground mining or if mined in surface mining, its destination will be the waste dump) from material deemed to have economic value (its ultimate destination during mining will be a processing facility). Other terms used in similar fashion as cut-off grade include net smelter return, pay limit, and break-even stripping ratio.
Development stage issuer
is an issuer that is engaged in the preparation of mineral reserves for extraction on at least one material property.
Development stage property
is a property that has mineral reserves disclosed, pursuant to this subpart, but no material extraction.
Economically viable,
when used in the context of mineral reserve determination, means that the qualified person has determined, using a discounted cash flow analysis, or has otherwise analytically determined, that extraction of the mineral reserve is economically viable under reasonable investment and market assumptions.
Exploration results
are data and information generated by mineral exploration programs (
i.e.,
programs consisting of sampling, drilling, trenching, analytical testing, assaying, and other similar activities undertaken to locate, investigate, define or delineate a mineral prospect or mineral deposit) that are not part of a disclosure of mineral resources or reserves. A registrant must not use exploration results alone to derive estimates of tonnage, grade, and production rates, or in an assessment of economic viability.
Exploration stage issuer
is an issuer that has no material property with mineral reserves disclosed.
Exploration stage property
is a property that has no mineral reserves disclosed.
Exploration target
is a statement or estimate of the exploration potential of a mineral deposit in a defined geological setting where the statement or estimate, quoted as a range of tonnage and a range of grade (or quality), relates to mineralization for which there has been insufficient exploration to estimate a mineral resource.
Feasibility study
is a comprehensive technical and economic study of the selected development option for a mineral project, which includes detailed assessments of all applicable modifying factors, as defined by this section, together with any other relevant operational factors, and detailed financial analysis that are necessary to demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that extraction is economically viable. The results of the study may serve as the basis for a final decision by a proponent or financial institution to proceed with, or finance, the development of the project.
(1) A feasibility study is more comprehensive, and with a higher degree of accuracy, than a pre-feasibility study. It must contain mining, infrastructure, and process designs completed with sufficient rigor to serve as the basis for an investment decision or to support project financing.
(2) The confidence level in the results of a feasibility study is higher than the confidence level in the results of a pre-feasibility study. Terms such as
full, final, comprehensive, bankable,
or
definitive
feasibility study are equivalent to a feasibility study.
Final market study
is a comprehensive study to determine and support the existence of a readily accessible market for the mineral. It must, at a minimum, include product specifications based on final geologic and metallurgical testing, supply and demand forecasts, historical prices for the preceding five or more years, estimated long term prices, evaluation of competitors (including products and estimates of production volumes, sales, and prices), customer evaluation of product specifications, and market entry strategies or sales contracts. The study must provide justification for all assumptions, which must include assumptions concerning the material contracts required to develop and sell the mineral reserves.
Indicated mineral resource
is that part of a mineral resource for which quantity and grade or quality are estimated on the basis of adequate geological evidence and sampling. The level of geological certainty associated with an indicated mineral resource is sufficient to allow a qualified person to apply modifying factors in sufficient detail to support mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the
deposit. Because an indicated mineral resource has a lower level of confidence than the level of confidence of a measured mineral resource, an indicated mineral resource may only be converted to a probable mineral reserve.
Inferred mineral resource
is that part of a mineral resource for which quantity and grade or quality are estimated on the basis of limited geological evidence and sampling. The level of geological uncertainty associated with an inferred mineral resource is too high to apply relevant technical and economic factors likely to influence the prospects of economic extraction in a manner useful for evaluation of economic viability. Because an inferred mineral resource has the lowest level of geological confidence of all mineral resources, which prevents the application of the modifying factors in a manner useful for evaluation of economic viability, an inferred mineral resource may not be considered when assessing the economic viability of a mining project, and may not be converted to a mineral reserve.
Initial assessment
is a preliminary technical and economic study of the economic potential of all or parts of mineralization to support the disclosure of mineral resources. The initial assessment must be prepared by a qualified person and must include appropriate assessments of reasonably assumed technical and economic factors, together with any other relevant operational factors, that are necessary to demonstrate at the time of reporting that there are reasonable prospects for economic extraction. An initial assessment is required for disclosure of mineral resources but cannot be used as the basis for disclosure of mineral reserves.
Investment and market assumptions,
when used in the context of mineral reserve determination, includes all assumptions made about the prices, exchange rates, interest and discount rates, sales volumes, and costs that are necessary to determine the economic viability of the mineral reserves. The qualified person must use a price for each commodity that provides a reasonable basis for establishing that the project is economically viable.
Limited geological evidence,
when used in the context of mineral resource determination, means evidence that is only sufficient to establish that geological and grade or quality continuity are more likely than not.
Material
has the same meaning as under § 230.405 or § 240.12b-2 of this chapter.
Material of economic interest,
when used in the context of mineral resource determination, includes mineralization, including dumps and tailings, mineral brines, and other resources extracted on or within the earth's crust. It does not include oil and gas resources resulting from oil and gas producing activities, as defined in § 210.4-10(a)(16)(i) of this chapter, gases (
e.g.,
helium and carbon dioxide), geothermal fields, and water.
Measured mineral resource
is that part of a mineral resource for which quantity and grade or quality are estimated on the basis of conclusive geological evidence and sampling. The level of geological certainty associated with a measured mineral resource is sufficient to allow a qualified person to apply modifying factors, as defined in this section, in sufficient detail to support detailed mine planning and final evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. Because a measured mineral resource has a higher level of confidence than the level of confidence of either an indicated mineral resource or an inferred mineral resource, a measured mineral resource may be converted to a proven mineral reserve or to a probable mineral reserve.
Mineral reserve
is an estimate of tonnage and grade or quality of indicated and measured mineral resources that, in the opinion of the qualified person, can be the basis of an economically viable project. More specifically, it is the economically mineable part of a measured or indicated mineral resource, which includes diluting materials and allowances for losses that may occur when the material is mined or extracted.
Mineral resource
is a concentration or occurrence of material of economic interest in or on the Earth's crust in
such form, grade or quality, and quantity that there are reasonable prospects for economic extraction. A mineral resource is a reasonable estimate of mineralization, taking into account relevant factors such as cut-off grade, likely mining dimensions, location or continuity, that, with the assumed and justifiable technical and economic conditions, is likely to, in whole or in part, become economically extractable. It is not merely an inventory of all mineralization drilled or sampled.
Modifying factors
are the factors that a qualified person must apply to indicated and measured mineral resources and then evaluate in order to establish the economic viability of mineral reserves. A qualified person must apply and evaluate modifying factors to convert measured and indicated mineral resources to proven and probable mineral reserves. These factors include, but are not restricted to: Mining; processing; metallurgical; infrastructure; economic; marketing; legal; environmental compliance; plans, negotiations, or agreements with local individuals or groups; and governmental factors. The number, type and specific characteristics of the modifying factors applied will necessarily be a function of and depend upon the mineral, mine, property, or project.
Preliminary feasibility study
(or
pre-feasibility study
) is a comprehensive study of a range of options for the technical and economic viability of a mineral project that has advanced to a stage where a qualified person has determined (in the case of underground mining) a preferred mining method, or (in the case of surface mining) a pit configuration, and in all cases has determined an effective method of mineral processing and an effective plan to sell the product.
(1) A pre-feasibility study includes a financial analysis based on reasonable assumptions, based on appropriate testing, about the modifying factors and the evaluation of any other relevant factors that are sufficient for a qualified person to determine if all or part of the indicated and measured mineral resources may be converted to mineral reserves at the time of reporting. The financial analysis must have the level of detail necessary to demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that extraction is economically viable.
(2) A pre-feasibility study is less comprehensive and results in a lower confidence level than a feasibility study. A pre-feasibility study is more comprehensive and results in a higher confidence level than an initial assessment.
Preliminary market study
is a study that is sufficiently rigorous and comprehensive to determine and support the existence of a readily accessible market for the mineral. It must, at a minimum, include product specifications based on preliminary geologic and metallurgical testing, supply and demand forecasts, historical prices for the preceding five or more years, estimated long term prices, evaluation of competitors (including products and estimates of production volumes, sales, and prices), customer evaluation of product specifications, and market entry strategies. The study must provide justification for all assumptions. It can, however, be less rigorous and comprehensive than a final market study, which is required for a full feasibility study.
Probable mineral reserve
is the economically mineable part of an indicated and, in some cases, a measured mineral resource.
Production stage issuer
is an issuer that is engaged in material extraction of mineral reserves on at least one material property.
Production stage property
is a property with material extraction of mineral reserves.
Proven mineral reserve
is the economically mineable part of a measured mineral resource and can only result from conversion of a measured mineral resource.
Qualified person
is an individual who is:
(1) A mineral industry professional with at least five years of relevant experience in the type of mineralization and type of deposit under consideration and in the specific type of activity that person is undertaking on behalf of the registrant; and
(2) An eligible member or licensee in good standing of a recognized professional organization at the time the
technical report is prepared. For an organization to be a recognized professional organization, it must:
(i) Be either:
(A) An organization recognized within the mining industry as a reputable professional association; or
(B) A board authorized by U.S. federal, state or foreign statute to regulate professionals in the mining, geoscience or related field;
(ii) Admit eligible members primarily on the basis of their academic qualifications and experience;
(iii) Establish and require compliance with professional standards of competence and ethics;
(iv) Require or encourage continuing professional development;
(v) Have and apply disciplinary powers, including the power to suspend or expel a member regardless of where the member practices or resides; and
(vi) Provide a public list of members in good standing.
Relevant experience
means, for purposes of determining whether a party is a qualified person, that the party has experience in the specific type of activity that the person is undertaking on behalf of the registrant. If the qualified person is preparing or supervising the preparation of a technical report concerning exploration results, the relevant experience must be in exploration. If the qualified person is estimating, or supervising the estimation of mineral resources, the relevant experience must be in the estimation, assessment and evaluation of mineral resources and associated technical and economic factors likely to influence the prospect of economic extraction. If the qualified person is estimating, or supervising the estimation of mineral reserves, the relevant experience must be in engineering and other disciplines required for the estimation, assessment, evaluation and economic extraction of mineral reserves.
(1) Relevant experience also means, for purposes of determining whether a party is a qualified person, that the party has experience evaluating the specific type of mineral deposit under consideration (
e.g.,
coal, metal, base metal, industrial mineral, or mineral brine). The type of experience necessary to qualify as relevant is a facts and circumstances determination. For example, experience in a high-nugget, vein-type mineralization such as tin or tungsten would likely be relevant experience for estimating mineral resources for vein-gold mineralization, whereas experience in a low grade disseminated gold deposit likely would not be relevant.
Note 1 to paragraph (1) of the definition of relevant experience:
It is not always necessary for a person to have five years' experience in each and every type of deposit in order to be an eligible qualified person if that person has relevant experience in similar deposit types. For example, a person with 20 years' experience in estimating mineral resources for a variety of metalliferous hard-rock deposit types may not require as much as five years of specific experience in porphyry-copper deposits to act as a qualified person. Relevant experience in the other deposit types could count towards the experience in relation to porphyry-copper deposits.
(2) For a qualified person providing a technical report for exploration results or mineral resource estimates, relevant experience also requires, in addition to experience in the type of mineralization, sufficient experience with the sampling and analytical techniques, as well as extraction and processing techniques, relevant to the mineral deposit under consideration. Sufficient experience means that level of experience necessary to be able to identify, with substantial confidence, problems that could affect the reliability of data and issues associated with processing.
(3) For a qualified person applying the modifying factors, as defined by this section, to convert mineral resources to mineral reserves, relevant experience also requires:
(i) Sufficient knowledge and experience in the application of these factors to the mineral deposit under consideration; and
(ii) Experience with the geology, geostatistics, mining, extraction and processing that is applicable to the type of mineral and mining under consideration.
§ 229.1301
(Item 1301) General instructions.
(a) As used in this section, the term
mining operations
includes operations on all mining properties that a registrant:
(1) Owns or in which it has, or it is probable that it will have, a direct or indirect economic interest;
(2) Operates, or it is probable that it will operate, under a lease or other legal agreement that grants the registrant ownership or similar rights that authorize it, as principal, to sell or otherwise dispose of the mineral; or
(3) Has, or it is probable that it will have, an associated royalty or similar right.
(b) A registrant must provide the disclosure specified in this subpart if its mining operations are material to its business or financial condition.
(c) When determining whether its mining operations are material, a registrant must:
(1) Consider both quantitative and qualitative factors, assessed in the context of the registrant's overall business and financial condition;
(2) Aggregate mining operations on all of its mining properties, regardless of the stage of the mining property, and size or type of commodity produced, including coal, metalliferous minerals, industrial materials, and mineral brines; and
(3) Include, for each property, as applicable, all related activities from exploration through extraction to the first point of material external sale, including processing, transportation, and warehousing.
(d) Upon a determination that its mining operations are material, a registrant must provide summary disclosure concerning all of its mining activities, as specified in § 229.1303, as well as individual property disclosure concerning each of its mining properties that is material to its business or financial condition, as specified in § 229.1304. When providing either summary or individual property disclosure, the registrant:
(1) Should provide an appropriate glossary if the disclosure requires the use of technical terms relating to geology, mining or related matters, which cannot readily be found in conventional dictionaries;
(2) Should not include detailed illustrations and technical reports, full feasibility studies or other highly technical data. The registrant shall, however, furnish such reports and other material supplementally to the staff upon request; and
(3) Should use plain English principles, to the extent practicable, such as those provided in §§ 230.421 and 240.13a-20 of this chapter, to enhance the readability of the disclosure for investors.
§ 229.1302
(Item 1302) Qualified person, technical report summary, and technical studies.
(a)(1) A registrant's disclosure of exploration results, mineral resources, or mineral reserves, as required by §§ 229.1303 and 229.1304, must be based on and accurately reflect information and supporting documentation prepared by a qualified person, as defined in § 229.1300. As used in this section, the term
information
includes the findings and conclusions of a qualified person relating to exploration results or estimates of mineral resources or mineral reserves.
(2) The registrant is responsible for determining that the person meets the qualifications specified under the definition of qualified person in § 229.1300, and that the disclosure in the registrant's filing accurately reflects the information provided by the qualified person.
(3) If a registrant has relied on more than one qualified person to prepare the information and documentation supporting its disclosure of exploration results, mineral resources, or mineral reserves, the registrant's responsibilities as specified in this paragraph (a) pertain to each qualified person.
(b)(1) The registrant must obtain a dated and signed technical report summary from the qualified person that, pursuant to § 229.601(b)(96), identifies and summarizes the information reviewed and conclusions reached by the qualified person about the registrant's mineral resources or mineral reserves determined to be on each material property. At its election, the registrant may also obtain a dated and signed
technical report summary from the qualified person that, pursuant to § 229.601(b)(96), identifies and summarizes the information reviewed and conclusions reached by the qualified person about the registrant's exploration results.
(i) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, if more than one qualified person has prepared the technical report summary, each qualified person must date and sign the technical report summary. The qualified person's signature must comply with § 230.402(e) or § 240.12b-11(d) of this chapter. The technical report summary must also clearly delineate the section or sections of the summary prepared by each qualified person.
(ii) A third-party firm comprising mining experts, such as professional geologists or mining engineers, may date and sign the technical report summary instead of, and without naming, its employee, member or other affiliated person who prepared the technical report summary.
(2)(i) The registrant must file the technical report summary as an exhibit to the relevant registration statement or other Commission filing when disclosing for the first time mineral reserves or mineral resources or when there is a material change in the mineral reserves or mineral resources from the last technical report summary filed for the property.
(ii) If a registrant files a technical report summary to support the disclosure of exploration results, it must also file a technical report summary when there is a material change in the exploration results from the last technical report summary filed for the property. In each instance, the registrant must file the technical report summary as an exhibit to the relevant Commission filing.
(3)(i) A registrant that has a royalty, streaming, or other similar right is not required to submit a separate technical report summary for a property that is covered by a current technical report summary filed by the producing mining registrant. In that situation, the registrant holding the royalty, streaming, or other similar right should refer to the producing registrant's previously filed technical report summary in its filing with the Commission. Such a reference will not be deemed to incorporate by reference, pursuant to § 230.411 or § 240.12b-23 of this chapter, the previously filed technical report summary into the royalty company's or other similar company's filing absent an express statement to so incorporate by reference the previously filed technical report summary.
(ii) A registrant that has a royalty, streaming, or other similar right is not required to file a technical report summary for an underlying property if the registrant lacks access to the technical report summary because:
(A) Obtaining the information would result in an unreasonable burden or expense; or
(B) It requested the technical report summary from the owner, operator, or other person possessing the technical report summary, who is not affiliated with the registrant, and who denied the request.
(4)(i) The registrant must obtain the written consent of the qualified person to the use of the qualified person's name, or any quotation from, or summarization of, the technical report summary in the relevant registration statement or report, and to the filing of the technical report summary as an exhibit to the registration statement or report.
(ii) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section, if more than one qualified person has prepared the technical report summary, the registrant must obtain the written consent required by this section from each qualified person pertaining to the particular section or sections of the technical report summary prepared by each qualified person.
(iii) If, pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, a third-party firm has signed the technical report summary, the third-party firm must provide the written consent. If a qualified person is an employee or person affiliated with the registrant, the qualified person must provide the written consent on an individual basis.
(iv) For Securities Act filings, the registrant must file the written consent as an exhibit to the registration statement pursuant to §§ 230.436 and
230.601(b)(23) of this chapter. For Exchange Act reports, the registrant is not required to file the written consent obtained from the qualified person, but should retain the written consent for as long as it is relying on the qualified person's information and supporting documentation for its current estimates regarding mineral resources, mineral reserves, or exploration results.
(5) The registrant must state in the filed registration statement or report whether each qualified person who prepared the technical report summary is an employee of the registrant. If the qualified person is not an employee of the registrant, the registrant must name the qualified person's employer, disclose whether the qualified person or the qualified person's employer is affiliated with the registrant or another entity that has an ownership, royalty, or other interest in the property that is the subject of the technical report summary, and if affiliated, describe the nature of the affiliation. As used in this section,
affiliate
or
affiliated
has the same meaning as in § 230.405 or § 240.12b-2 of this chapter.
(6)(i) A qualified person may include in the technical report summary information and documentation provided by a third-party specialist who is not a qualified person, as defined in § 229.1300, such as an attorney, appraiser, and economic or environmental consultant, upon which the qualified person has relied in preparing the technical report summary.
(ii) The qualified person may not disclaim responsibility for any information or documentation prepared by a third-party specialist upon which the qualified person has relied, or any part of the technical report summary based upon or related to that information and documentation.
(iii) A registrant is not required to file a written consent of any third-party specialist upon which a qualified person has relied pursuant to paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section.
(c)(1) A registrant may disclose an exploration target, as defined in § 229.1300, for one or more of its properties that is based upon and accurately reflects information and supporting documentation of a qualified person. The qualified person may include a discussion of an exploration target in a technical report summary.
(2) Any disclosure of an exploration target must appear in a separate section of the Commission filing or technical report summary that is clearly captioned as a discussion of an exploration target. That section must include a clear and prominent statement that:
(i) The ranges of potential tonnage and grade (or quality) of the exploration target are conceptual in nature;
(ii) There has been insufficient exploration of the relevant property or properties to estimate a mineral resource;
(iii) It is uncertain if further exploration will result in the estimation of a mineral resource; and
(iv) The exploration target therefore does not represent, and should not be construed to be, an estimate of a mineral resource or mineral reserve.
(3) Any disclosure of an exploration target must also include:
(i) A detailed explanation of the basis for the exploration target, such as the conceptual geological model used to develop the target;
(ii) An explanation of the process used to determine the ranges of tonnage and grade, which must be expressed as approximations;
(iii) A statement clarifying whether the exploration target is based on actual exploration results or on one or more proposed exploration programs, which should include a description of the level of exploration activity already completed, the proposed exploration activities designed to test the validity of the exploration target, and the time frame in which those activities are expected to be completed; and
(iv) A statement that the ranges of tonnage and grade (or quality) of the exploration target could change as the proposed exploration activities are completed.
(d)(1) A registrant's disclosure of mineral resources under this subpart must be based upon a qualified person's initial assessment, as defined in § 229.1300, which includes and supports the qualified person's determination of mineral resources.
(i) When determining the existence of a mineral resource, a qualified person must:
(A) Be able to estimate or interpret the location, quantity, grade or quality continuity, and other geological characteristics of the mineral resource from specific geological evidence and knowledge, including sampling; and
(B) Conclude that there are reasonable prospects for economic extraction of the mineral resource based on his or her initial assessment. At a minimum, the initial assessment must include the qualified person's qualitative evaluation of relevant technical and economic factors likely to influence the prospect of economic extraction to establish the economic potential of the mining property or project.
(ii) For a material property, the technical report summary submitted by the qualified person to support a determination of mineral resources must describe the procedures, findings and conclusions reached for the initial assessment, as required by § 229.601(b)(96).
(iii)(A) When determining mineral resources, a qualified person must subdivide mineral resources, in order of increasing geological confidence, into inferred, indicated, and measured mineral resources.
(B) For inferred mineral resources, a qualified person:
(
1
) Must have a reasonable expectation that the majority of inferred mineral resources could be upgraded to indicated or measured mineral resources with continued exploration; and
(
2
) Should be able to defend the basis of this expectation before his or her peers.
(iv) The qualified person should refer to Table 1 to paragraph (d) of this section for the assumptions permitted to be made when preparing the initial assessment.
(2) A qualified person must include cut-off grade estimation, based on assumed unit costs for surface or underground operations and estimated mineral prices, in the initial assessment. To estimate mineral prices, the qualified person must use a price for each commodity that provides a reasonable basis for establishing the prospects of economic extraction for mineral resources. The qualified person must disclose the price used and explain, with particularity, his or her reasons for using the selected price, including the material assumptions underlying the selection. This explanation must include disclosure of the time frame used to estimate the commodity price and unit costs for cut-off grade estimation and the reasons justifying the selection of that time frame. The qualified person may use a price set by contractual arrangement, provided that such price is reasonable, and the qualified person discloses that he or she is using a contractual price when disclosing the price used. The selected price required by this section and all material assumptions underlying it must be current as of the end of the registrant's most recently completed fiscal year.
(3) The qualified person must provide a qualitative assessment of all relevant technical and economic factors likely to influence the prospect of economic extraction to establish economic potential and justify why he or she believes that all issues can be resolved with further exploration and analysis. As provided by Table 1 to paragraph (d) of this section, those factors include, but are not limited to, to the extent material:
(i) Site infrastructure (
e.g.,
whether access to power and site is possible);
(ii) Mine design and planning (
e.g.,
what is the broadly defined mining method);
(iii) Processing plant (
e.g.,
whether all products used in assessing prospects of economic extraction can be processed with methods consistent with each other);
(iv) Environmental compliance and permitting (
e.g.,
what are the required permits and corresponding agencies and whether significant obstacles exist to obtaining those permits); and
(v) Any other reasonably assumed technical and economic factors, including plans, negotiations, or agreements with local individuals or groups, which are necessary to demonstrate reasonable prospects for economic extraction.
(4)(i) A qualified person may include cash flow analysis in an initial assessment to demonstrate economic potential. If the qualified person includes cash flow analysis in the initial assessment, then operating and capital cost
estimates must have an accuracy level of at least approximately ±50% and a contingency level of no greater than 25%, as provided by Table 1 to paragraph (d) of this section. The qualified person must state the accuracy and contingency levels in the initial assessment.
(ii) If providing an economic analysis in the initial assessment, a qualified person may include inferred mineral resources in the economic analysis, provided that the qualified person:
(A) States with equal prominence to the disclosure of mineral resource estimates that the assessment is preliminary in nature, it includes inferred mineral resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have modifying factors applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves, and there is no certainty that this economic assessment will be realized;
(B) Discloses the percentage of the mineral resources used in the cash flow analysis that was classified as inferred mineral resources; and
(C) Discloses, with equal prominence, the results of the economic analysis excluding inferred mineral resources in addition to the results that include inferred mineral resources.

1
When applied in an initial assessment, these factors pertain to the relevant technical and economic factors likely to influence the prospect of economic extraction. When applied in a preliminary or final feasibility study, these factors pertain to the modifying factors, as defined in this subpart.
2
The relevant technical and economic factors to be applied in an initial assessment, and the modifying factors to be applied in a pre-feasibility or final feasibility study, include, but are not limited to, the factors listed in this table. The number, type, and specific characteristics of the applicable factors will be a function of and depend upon the particular mineral, mine, property, or project.
3
Initial assessment, as defined in this subpart, does not require a cash flow analysis or operating and capital cost estimates. The qualified person may include a cash flow analysis at his or her discretion.
4
An initial assessment does not require capital and operating cost estimates or economic analysis, although it requires unit cost assumptions based on an assumption that the resource will be exploited with surface or underground mining methods. An economic analysis, if included, may be based only on measured and indicated mineral resources, or also may include inferred resources if additional conditions are met.
(e)(1) A registrant's disclosure of mineral reserves under this subpart must be based upon a qualified person's preliminary feasibility (pre-feasibility) study or feasibility study, each as defined in § 229.1300, which includes and supports the qualified person's determination of mineral reserves. The pre-feasibility or feasibility study must include the qualified person's detailed evaluation of all applicable modifying factors to demonstrate the economic viability of the mining property or project. For a material property, the technical report summary submitted by the qualified person to support a determination of mineral reserves must describe the procedures, findings and conclusions reached for the pre-feasibility or feasibility study, as required by § 229.601(b)(96).
(2) When determining mineral reserves, a qualified person must subdivide mineral reserves, in order of increasing confidence, into probable mineral reserves and proven mineral reserves, as defined in § 229.1300. The determination of probable or proven mineral reserves must be based on a qualified person's application of the modifying factors to indicated or measured mineral resources, which results in the qualified person's determination that part of the indicated or measured mineral resource is economically mineable.
(i) For a probable mineral reserve, the qualified person's confidence in the results obtained from the application of the modifying factors and in the estimates of tonnage and grade or quality is lower than what is sufficient for a classification as a proven mineral reserve, but is still sufficient to demonstrate that, at the time of reporting, extraction of the mineral reserve is economically viable under reasonable investment and market assumptions. The lower level of confidence is due to higher geologic uncertainty when the qualified person converts an indicated mineral resource to a probable reserve or higher risk in the results of the application of modifying factors at the time when the qualified person converts a measured mineral resource to a probable mineral reserve. A qualified person must classify a measured mineral resource as a probable mineral reserve when his or her confidence in the results obtained from the application of the modifying factors to the measured mineral resource is lower than what is sufficient for a proven mineral reserve.
(ii) For a proven mineral reserve, the qualified person must have a high degree of confidence in the results obtained from the application of the modifying factors and in the estimates of tonnage and grade or quality.
(3) The pre-feasibility study or feasibility study, which supports the qualified person's determination of mineral reserves, must demonstrate that, at the time of reporting, extraction of the mineral reserve is economically viable under reasonable investment and market assumptions. The study must establish a life of mine plan that is technically achievable and economically viable, which will be the basis of determining the mineral reserve.
(i) The term
mineral reserves
does not necessarily require that extraction facilities are in place or operational, that the company has obtained all necessary permits or that the company has entered into sales contracts for the sale of mined products. It does require, however, that the qualified person has, after reasonable investigation, not identified any obstacles to obtaining permits and entering into the necessary sales contracts, and reasonably believes that the chances of obtaining such approvals and contracts in a timely manner are highly likely.
(ii) In certain circumstances, the determination of mineral reserves may require the completion of at least a preliminary market study, as defined in § 229.1300, in the context of a pre-feasibility study, or a final market study, as defined in § 229.1300, in the context of a feasibility study, to support the qualified person's conclusions about the chances of obtaining revenues from sales. For example, a preliminary or final market study would be required where the mine's product cannot be traded on an exchange, there is no other established market for the product, and no sales contract exists. When assessing mineral reserves, the qualified person must take into account the potential adverse impacts, if any, from any unresolved material matter on
which extraction is contingent and which is dependent on a third party.
(4) For both a pre-feasibility and feasibility study, a qualified person must use a price for each commodity that provides a reasonable basis for establishing that the project is economically viable. The qualified person must disclose the price used and explain, with particularity, his or her reasons for using the selected price, including the material assumptions underlying the selection. This explanation must include disclosure of the time frame used to estimate the price and costs and the reasons justifying the selection of that time frame. The qualified person may use a price set by contractual arrangement, provided that such price is reasonable, and the qualified person discloses that he or she is using a contractual price when disclosing the price used. The selected price required by this section and all material assumptions underlying it must be current as of the end of the registrant's most recently completed fiscal year.
(5) A pre-feasibility study must include an economic analysis that supports the property's economic viability as assessed by a detailed discounted cash flow analysis or other similar financial analysis. The economic analysis must describe in detail applicable taxes and provide an estimate of revenues. The qualified person must use a price for each commodity in the economic analysis that meets the requirements of paragraph (e)(4) of this section. As discussed in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, in certain situations, estimates of revenues must be based on at least a preliminary market study.
(6) The qualified person must exclude inferred mineral resources from the pre-feasibility study's demonstration of economic viability in support of a disclosure of a mineral reserve.
(7) Factors to be considered in a pre-feasibility study are typically the same as those required for a final feasibility study, but considered at a lower level of detail or at an earlier stage of development. The list of factors is not exclusive. For example, as provided in Table 1 to paragraph (d) of this section, a pre-feasibility study must define, analyze or otherwise address in detail, to the extent material:
(i) The required access roads, infrastructure location and plant area, and the source of all utilities (
e.g.,
power and water) required for development and production;
(ii) The preferred underground mining method or surface mine pit configuration, with detailed mine layouts drawn for each alternative;
(iii) The bench lab tests that have been conducted, the process flow sheet, equipment sizes, and general arrangement that have been completed, and the plant throughput;
(iv) The environmental compliance and permitting requirements, the baseline studies, and the plans for tailings disposal, reclamation, and mitigation, together with an analysis establishing that permitting is possible; and
(v) Any other reasonable assumptions, based on appropriate testing, on the modifying factors sufficient to demonstrate that extraction is economically viable.
(8) A pre-feasibility study must also identify sources of uncertainty that require further refinement in a final feasibility study.
(9) Operating and capital cost estimates in a pre-feasibility study must, at a minimum, have an accuracy level of approximately ±25% and a contingency range not exceeding 15%, as provided in Table 1 of this section. The qualified person must state the accuracy level and contingency range in the pre-feasibility study.
(10) A feasibility study must contain the application and description of all relevant modifying factors in a more detailed form and with more certainty than a pre-feasibility study. The list of factors is not exclusive. For example, as provided in Table 1 to paragraph (d) of this section, a feasibility study must define, analyze, or otherwise address in detail, to the extent material:
(i) Final requirements for site infrastructure, including well-defined access roads, finalized plans for infrastructure location, plant area, and camp or town site, and the established source of all required utilities (
e.g.,
power and water) for development and production;
(ii) Finalized mining method, including detailed mine layouts and final development and production plan for the preferred alternative with the required
equipment fleet specified. The feasibility study must address detailed mining schedules, construction and production ramp up, and project execution plans;
(iii) Completed detailed bench lab tests and a pilot plant test, if required, based on risk. The feasibility study must further address final requirements for process flow sheet, equipment sizes, and general arrangement and specify the final plant throughput;
(iv) The final identification and detailed analysis of environmental compliance and permitting requirements, and the completion of baseline studies and finalized plans for tailings disposal, reclamation, and mitigation; and
(v) The final assessments of other modifying factors necessary to demonstrate that extraction is economically viable.
(11) A feasibility study must also include an economic analysis that describes taxes in detail, estimates revenues, and assesses economic viability by a detailed discounted cash flow analysis. The qualified person must use a price for each commodity in the economic analysis that meets the requirements of paragraph (e)(4) of this section. As discussed in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, in certain situations, estimates of revenues must be based on a final market study or letters of intent to purchase.
(12) Operating and capital cost estimates in a feasibility study must, at a minimum, have an accuracy level of approximately ±15% and a contingency range not exceeding 10%, as provided by Table 1 of this section. The qualified person must state the accuracy level and contingency range in the feasibility study.
(13) If the uncertainties in the results obtained from the application of the modifying factors that prevented a measured mineral resource from being converted to a proven mineral reserve no longer exist, then the qualified person may convert the measured mineral resource to a proven mineral reserve.
(14) The qualified person cannot convert an indicated mineral resource to a proven mineral reserve unless new evidence first justifies conversion to a measured mineral resource.
(15) The qualified person cannot convert an inferred mineral resource to a mineral reserve without first obtaining new evidence that justifies converting it to an indicated or measured mineral resource.
(f)(1) The qualified person may indicate in the technical report summary that the qualified person has relied on information provided by the registrant in preparing its findings and conclusions regarding the following aspects of modifying factors:
(i) Macroeconomic trends, data, and assumptions, and interest rates;
(ii) Marketing information and plans within the control of the registrant;
(iii) Legal matters outside the expertise of the qualified person, such as statutory and regulatory interpretations affecting the mine plan;
(iv) Environmental matters outside the expertise of the qualified person;
(v) Accommodations the registrant commits or plans to provide to local individuals or groups in connection with its mine plans; and
(vi) Governmental factors outside the expertise of the qualified person.
(2) In a separately captioned section of the technical report summary entitled “Reliance on Information Provided by the Registrant,” the qualified person must:
(i) Identify the categories of information provided by the registrant;
(ii) Identify the particular portions of the technical report summary that were prepared in reliance on information provided by the registrant pursuant to paragraph (f)(1) of this section, and the extent of that reliance; and
(iii) Disclose why the qualified person considers it reasonable to rely upon the registrant for any of the information specified in paragraph (f)(1) of this section.
(3) Notwithstanding the provisions of § 230.436(a) and (b) of this chapter, any description in the technical report summary or other part of the registration statement of the procedures, findings, and conclusions reached about matters identified by the qualified person as having been based on information provided by the registrant pursuant to this section shall not be considered a part of the registration statement prepared or certified by the
qualified person within the meaning of Sections 7 and 11 of the Securities Act.
§ 229.1303
(Item 1303) Summary disclosure.

§ 229.1304
(Item 1304) Individual property disclosure.
(a)(1) A registrant must disclose the information specified in this section for each property that is material to its business or financial condition. When determining the materiality of a property relative to its business or financial condition, a registrant must apply the standards and other considerations specified in § 229.1301(c) to each individual property that it:
(i) Owns or in which it has, or it is probable that it will have, a direct or indirect economic interest;
(ii) Operates, or it is probable that it will operate, under a lease or other legal agreement that grants the registrant ownership or similar rights that authorize it, as principal, to sell or otherwise dispose of the mineral; or
(iii) Has, or it is probable that it will have, an associated royalty or similar right.
(2) A registrant that has a royalty, streaming or other similar right, but which lacks access to any of the information specified in this section about the underlying property or properties, may omit such information, provided that the registrant:
(i) Specifies the information to which it lacks access;
(ii) Explains that it does not have access to the required information because:
(A) Obtaining the information would result in an unreasonable burden or expense; or
(B) It requested the information from a person possessing knowledge of the information, who is not affiliated with the with the royalty company or similar registrant, and who denied the request; and
(iii) Provides all required information that it does possess or which it can acquire without incurring an unreasonable burden or expense.
(b) Disclose the following information for each material property specified in paragraph (a) of this section:
(1) A brief description of the property including:
(i) The location, accurate to within one mile, using an easily recognizable coordinate system. The registrant must provide appropriate maps, with proper engineering detail (such as scale, orientation, and titles). Such maps must be legible on the page when printed;
(ii) Existing infrastructure including roads, railroads, airports, towns, ports, sources of water, electricity, and personnel; and
(iii) A brief description, including the name or number and size (acreage), of the titles, claims, concessions, mineral rights, leases or options under which the registrant and its subsidiaries have or will have the right to hold or operate the property, and how such rights are obtained at this location, indicating any conditions that the registrant must meet in order to obtain or retain the property. If held by leases or options or if the mineral rights otherwise have termination provisions, the registrant must provide the expiration dates of such leases, options or mineral rights and associated payments.
(iv) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, if the registrant holds a royalty or similar interest or will have an associated royalty or similar right, the disclosure must describe all of the information in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, including, for example, the documents under which the owner or operator holds or operates the property, the mineral rights held by the owner or operator, conditions required to be met by the owner or operator, and the expiration dates of leases, options and mineral rights. The registrant must also briefly describe the agreement under which the registrant and its subsidiaries have or will have the right to a royalty or similar interest in the property, indicating any conditions that the registrant must meet in order to obtain or retain the royalty or similar interest, and indicating the expiration date.
(2) The following information, as relevant to the particular property:
(i) A brief description of the present condition of the property, the work completed by the registrant on the property, the registrant's proposed program of exploration or development, the current stage of the property as exploration, development or production, the current state of exploration or development of the property, and the current production activities. Mines should be identified as either surface or underground, with a brief description of the mining method and processing operations. If the property is without known reserves and the proposed program is exploratory in nature or the registrant has started extraction without determining mineral reserves, the registrant must provide a statement to that effect;
(ii) The age, details as to modernization and physical condition of the equipment, facilities, infrastructure, and underground development;
(iii) The total cost for or book value of the property and its associated plant and equipment;
(iv) A brief history of previous operations, including the names of previous operators, insofar as known; and
(v) A brief description of any significant encumbrances to the property, including current and future permitting requirements and associated timelines,
permit conditions, and violations and fines.
(c) When providing the disclosure required by paragraph (b) of this section:
(1) A registrant must identify an individual property with no mineral reserves as an exploration stage property, even if it has other properties in development or production. Similarly, a registrant that does not have reserves on any of its properties cannot characterize itself as a development or production stage company, even if it has mineral resources or exploration results, or even if it is engaged in extraction without first disclosing mineral reserves.
(2) A registrant should not include extensive description of regional geology. Rather, it should include geological information that is brief and relevant to property disclosure.
(d)(1) If mineral resources or reserves have been determined, the registrant must provide a summary of all mineral resources or reserves as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal year, which, for each property, discloses in tabular form, as provided in Table 1 to paragraph (d)(1) of this section for each class of mineral resources (measured, indicated, and inferred), together with total measured and indicated mineral resources, the estimated tonnages and grades (or quality, where appropriate), and as provided in Table 2 to paragraph (d)(1) of this section for each class of mineral reserves (proven and probable), together with total mineral reserves, the estimated tonnages, grades (or quality, where appropriate), cut-off grades, and metallurgical recovery, based on a specific point of reference selected by a qualified person pursuant to § 229.601(b)(96). The registrant must disclose the selected point of reference for each of Tables 1 and 2 to paragraph (d)(1) of this section.

Instruction 1 to paragraph (d)(1):
The registrant may modify the tabular formats in Tables 1 and 2 to paragraph (d)(1) of this section for ease of presentation, to add information, or to combine two or more required tables. When combining tables, the registrant should not report mineral resources and reserves in the same table.
(2) All disclosure of mineral resources by the registrant must be exclusive of mineral reserves.
(3) A registrant with only a royalty or similar interest should provide only
the portion of the resources or reserves that are subject to the royalty or similar agreement.
(e) Compare the property's mineral resources and reserves as of the end of the last fiscal year with the mineral resources and reserves as of the end of the preceding fiscal year, and explain any material change between the two. The comparison, which may be in either narrative or tabular format, must disclose information concerning:
(1) The mineral resources or reserves at the end of the last two fiscal years;
(2) The net difference between the mineral resources or reserves at the end of the last completed fiscal year and the preceding fiscal year, as a percentage of the resources or reserves at the end of the fiscal year preceding the last completed one;
(3) An explanation of the causes of any discrepancy in mineral resources including depletion or production, changes in commodity prices, additional resources discovered through exploration, and changes due to the methods employed; and
(4) An explanation of the causes of any discrepancy in mineral reserves including depletion or production, changes in the resource model, changes in commodity prices and operating costs, changes due to the methods employed, and changes due to acquisition or disposal of properties.
(f)(1) If the registrant has not previously disclosed mineral reserve or resource estimates in a filing with the Commission or is disclosing material changes to its previously disclosed mineral reserve or resource estimates, provide a brief discussion of the material assumptions and criteria in the disclosure and cite corresponding sections of the technical report summary, which must be filed as an exhibit pursuant to § 229.1302(b).
(2) All material assumptions and information pertaining to the disclosure of a registrant's mineral resources and mineral reserves required by paragraphs (d), (e), and (f) of this section, including material assumptions relating to all modifying factors, price estimates, and scientific and technical information (
e.g.,
sampling data, estimation assumptions and methods), must be current as of the end of the registrant's most recently completed fiscal year. To the extent that the registrant is not filing a technical report summary but instead is basing the required disclosure upon a previously filed report, that report must also be current in these material respects. If the previously filed report is not current in these material respects, the registrant must file a revised or new technical report summary from a qualified person, in compliance with § 229.601(b)(96) (Item 601(b)(96) of Regulation S-K), that supports the registrant's mining property disclosures.
(3) Regarding the disclosure required by paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section, whether a change in mineral resources or mineral reserves is material is based on all facts and circumstances, both quantitative and qualitative.
(g)(1) If disclosing exploration activity for any material property specified in paragraph (a) of this section for the most recently completed fiscal year, provide a summary that describes the sampling methods used, and, for each sampling method used, disclose the number of samples, the total size or length of the samples, and the total number of assays.
(2) If disclosing exploration results for any material property specified in paragraph (a) of this section for the most recently completed fiscal year, provide a summary that, for each property, identifies the hole, trench or other sample that generated the exploration results, describes the length, lithology, and key geologic properties of the exploration results, and includes a brief discussion of the exploration results' context and relevance. If the summary only includes results from selected samples and intersections, it should be accompanied with a discussion of the context and justification for excluding other results.
(3) The information disclosed under this paragraph (g) may be presented in either narrative or tabular format.
(4) A registrant must disclose exploration results and related exploration activity for a material property under this section if they are material to investors. When determining whether exploration results and related exploration activity are material, the registrant should consider all relevant
facts and circumstances, such as the importance of the exploration results in assessing the value of a material property or in deciding whether to develop the property, and the particular stage of the property.
(5) A registrant may disclose an exploration target when discussing exploration results or exploration activity related to a material property as long as the disclosure is in compliance with the requirements of § 229.1302(c).
(6)(i) If the registrant is disclosing exploration results, but has not previously disclosed such results in a filing with the Commission, or is disclosing material changes to its previously disclosed exploration results, it must provide sufficient information to allow for an accurate understanding of the significance of the exploration results. The registrant must include information such as exploration context, type and method of sampling, sampling intervals and methods, relevant sample locations, distribution, dimensions, and relative location of all relevant assay and physical data, data aggregation methods, land tenure status, and any additional material information that may be necessary to make the required disclosure concerning the registrant's exploration results not misleading. If electing to file a technical report summary, the registrant must cite corresponding sections of the technical report summary, which must be filed as an exhibit pursuant to § 229.1302(b).
(ii) Whether a change in exploration results is material is based on all facts and circumstances, both quantitative and qualitative.
(iii) A change in exploration results that significantly alters the potential of the subject deposit is considered material.
(h) A report containing one or more estimates of the quantity, grade, or metal or mineral content of a deposit or exploration results that a registrant has not verified as a current estimate of mineral resources, mineral reserves, or exploration results, and which was prepared before the registrant acquired, or entered into an agreement to acquire, an interest in the property that contains the deposit, is not considered current and cannot be filed in support of disclosure. Notwithstanding this prohibition, a registrant may include such an estimate in a Commission filing that pertains to a merger, acquisition, or business combination if the registrant is unable to update the estimate prior to the completion of the relevant transaction. In that event, when referring to the estimate, the registrant must disclose the source and date of the estimate, and state that a qualified person has not done sufficient work to classify the estimate as a current estimate of mineral resources, mineral reserves, or exploration results and that the registrant is not treating the estimate as a current estimate of mineral resources, mineral reserves, or exploration results.
§ 229.1305
(Item 1305) Internal controls disclosure.
(a) Describe the internal controls that the registrant uses in its exploration and mineral resource and reserve estimation efforts. This disclosure should include quality control and quality assurance (QC/QA) programs, verification of analytical procedures, and a discussion of comprehensive risk inherent in the estimation.
(b) A registrant must provide the internal controls disclosure required by this section whether it is providing the disclosure under § 229.1303, § 229.1304, or under both sections.

(3) A registrant that is required to provide Scope 1 and/or Scope 2 emissions disclosure pursuant to § 229.1505 that obtains voluntary assurance over its GHG emissions disclosure prior to the first required fiscal year for assurance must comply with paragraph (e) of this section. Voluntary assurance obtained by such registrant after the first required fiscal year that is in addition to any required assurance must follow the requirements of paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section and must use the same attestation standard as the required assurance over Scope 1 and/or Scope 2 emissions disclosure.
(b)
GHG emissions attestation provider.
The GHG emissions attestation report required by paragraph (a) of this section must be prepared and signed by a GHG emissions attestation provider. A GHG emissions attestation provider means a person or a firm that has all of the following characteristics:
(1) Is an expert in GHG emissions by virtue of having significant experience in measuring, analyzing, reporting, or attesting to GHG emissions. Significant experience means having sufficient competence and capabilities necessary to:
(i) Perform engagements in accordance with attestation standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements; and
(ii) Enable the service provider to issue reports that are appropriate under the circumstances.
(2) Is independent with respect to the registrant, and any of its affiliates, for whom it is providing the attestation report, during the attestation and professional engagement period.
(i) A GHG emissions attestation provider is not independent if such attestation provider is not, or a reasonable investor with knowledge of all relevant facts and circumstances would conclude that such attestation provider is not, capable of exercising objective and impartial judgment on all issues encompassed within the attestation provider's engagement.
(ii) In determining whether a GHG emissions attestation provider is independent, the Commission will consider:
(A) Whether a relationship or the provision of a service creates a mutual or conflicting interest between the attestation provider and the registrant (or any of its affiliates), places the attestation provider in the position of attesting to such attestation provider's own work, results in the attestation provider acting as management or an
employee of the registrant (or any of its affiliates), or places the attestation provider in a position of being an advocate for the registrant (or any of its affiliates); and
(B) All relevant circumstances, including all financial or other relationships between the attestation provider and the registrant (or any of its affiliates), and not just those relating to reports filed with the Commission.
(iii) The term “affiliate” as used in this section has the meaning provided in § 210.2-01 of this chapter, except that references to “audit” are deemed to be references to the attestation services provided pursuant to this section.
(iv) The term “attestation and professional engagement period” as used in this section means both:
(A) The period covered by the attestation report; and
(B) The period of the engagement to attest to the registrant's GHG emissions or to prepare a report filed with the Commission (“the professional engagement period”). The professional engagement period begins when the GHG attestation service provider either signs an initial engagement letter (or other agreement to attest to a registrant's GHG emissions) or begins attest procedures, whichever is earlier.
(c)
Attestation report requirements.
The form and content of the attestation report must follow the requirements set forth by the attestation standard (or standards) used by the GHG emissions attestation provider.
(d)
Additional disclosure by the registrant.
In addition to including the GHG emissions attestation report required by paragraph (a) of this section, a large accelerated filer and an accelerated filer must disclose, alongside the GHG emissions disclosure to which the attestation report relates, after requesting relevant information from any GHG emissions attestation provider as necessary:
(1) Whether the GHG emissions attestation provider is subject to any oversight inspection program, and if so, which program (or programs), and whether the GHG emissions attestation engagement is included within the scope of authority of such oversight inspection program.
(2)(i) Whether any GHG emissions attestation provider that was previously engaged to provide attestation over the registrant's GHG emissions disclosure pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section for the fiscal year period covered by the attestation report resigned (or indicated that it declined to stand for re-appointment after the completion of the attestation engagement) or was dismissed. If so,
(A) State whether the former GHG emissions attestation provider resigned, declined to stand for re-appointment, or was dismissed and the date thereof; and
(B) State whether during the performance of the attestation engagement for the fiscal year period covered by the attestation report there were any disagreements with the former GHG emissions attestation provider on any matter of measurement or disclosure of GHG emissions or attestation scope of procedures. Also,
(
1
) Describe each such disagreement; and
(
2
) State whether the registrant has authorized the former GHG emissions attestation provider to respond fully to the inquiries of the successor GHG emissions attestation provider concerning the subject matter of each such disagreement.
(ii) The term “disagreements” as used in this section shall be interpreted broadly, to include any difference of opinion concerning any matter of measurement or disclosure of GHG emissions or attestation scope or procedures that (if not resolved to the satisfaction of the former GHG emissions attestation provider) would have caused it to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in connection with its report. It is not necessary for there to have been an argument to have had a disagreement, merely a difference of opinion. For purposes of this section, however, the term disagreements does not include initial differences of opinion based on incomplete facts or preliminary information that were later resolved to the former GHG emissions attestation provider's satisfaction by, and providing the registrant and the GHG emissions attestation provider do not continue to have a difference of opinion upon, obtaining
additional relevant facts or information. The disagreements required to be reported in response to this section include both those resolved to the former GHG emissions attestation provider's satisfaction and those not resolved to the former provider's satisfaction. Disagreements contemplated by this section are those that occur at the decision-making level,
i.e.,
between personnel of the registrant responsible for presentation of its GHG emissions disclosure and personnel of the GHG emissions attestation provider responsible for rendering its report.
(iii) In determining whether any disagreement has occurred, an oral communication from the engagement partner or another person responsible for rendering the GHG emissions attestation provider's opinion or conclusion (or their designee) will generally suffice as a statement of a disagreement at the “decision-making level” within the GHG emissions attestation provider and require disclosure under this section.
(e)
Disclosure of voluntary assurance.
A registrant that is not required to include a GHG emissions attestation report pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section must disclose in the filing the following information if the registrant's GHG emissions disclosure in the filing were subject to third-party assurance:
(1) Identification of the service provider of such assurance;
(2) Description of the assurance standard used;
(3) Description of the level and scope of assurance services provided;
(4) Brief description of the results of the assurance services;
(5) Whether the service provider has any material business relationships with or has provided any material professional services to the registrant; and
(6) Whether the service provider is subject to any oversight inspection program, and if so, which program (or programs) and whether the assurance services over GHG emissions are included within the scope of authority of such oversight inspection program.
(f)
Location of disclosure.
A registrant must include the attestation report and disclosure required by this section in the filing that contains the GHG emissions disclosure to which the report and disclosure relate. If, in accordance with the requirements in § 229.1505, a registrant elects to incorporate by reference its GHG emissions disclosure from its Form 10-Q (§ 249.308a of this chapter) for the second fiscal quarter in the fiscal year immediately following the year to which the GHG emissions disclosure relates or to provide this information in an amended annual report on Form 10-K (§ 249.310 of this chapter) or 20-F (§ 249.220f of this chapter), then the registrant must include an express statement in its annual report indicating its intention to incorporate by reference the attestation report from either a quarterly report on Form 10-Q or amend its annual report on Form 10-K or Form 20-F to provide the attestation report by the due date specified in § 229.1505.
Instruction 1 to Item 1506:
A registrant that obtains assurance from an attestation provider at the limited assurance level should refer to § 229.601(b)(27) and paragraph 18 of Form 20-F's Instructions as to Exhibits.

§ 230.144
Persons deemed not to be engaged in a distribution and therefore not underwriters.

# Preliminary Note:
Certain basic principles are essential to an understanding of the registration requirements in the Securities Act of 1933 (the Act or the Securities Act) and the purposes underlying Rule 144:
1. If any person sells a non-exempt security to any other person, the sale must be registered unless an exemption can be found for the transaction.
2. Section 4(1) of the Securities Act provides one such exemption for a transaction “by a person other than an issuer, underwriter, or dealer.” Therefore, an understanding of the term “underwriter” is important in determining whether or not the Section 4(1) exemption from registration is available for the sale of the securities.
The term “underwriter” is broadly defined in Section 2(a)(11) of the Securities Act to mean any person who has purchased from an issuer with a view to, or offers or sells for an issuer in connection with, the distribution of any security, or participates, or has a direct or indirect participation in any such undertaking, or participates or has a participation in the direct or indirect underwriting of any such undertaking. The interpretation of this definition traditionally has focused on the words “with a view to” in the phrase “purchased from an issuer with a view to * * * distribution.” An investment banking firm which arranges with an issuer for the public sale of its securities is clearly an “underwriter” under that section. However, individual investors who are not professionals in the securities business also may be “underwriters” if they act as links in a chain of transactions through which securities move from an issuer to the public.
Since it is difficult to ascertain the mental state of the purchaser at the time of an acquisition of securities, prior to and since the adoption of Rule 144, subsequent acts and circumstances have been considered to determine whether the purchaser took the securities “with a view to distribution” at the time of the acquisition. Emphasis has been placed on factors such as the length of time the person held the securities and whether there has been an unforeseeable change in circumstances of the holder. Experience has shown, however, that reliance upon such factors alone has led to uncertainty in the application of the registration provisions of the Act.
The Commission adopted Rule 144 to establish specific criteria for determining whether a person is not engaged in a distribution. Rule 144 creates a safe harbor from the Section 2(a)(11) definition of “underwriter.” A person satisfying the applicable conditions of the Rule 144 safe harbor is deemed not to be engaged in a distribution of the securities and therefore not an underwriter of the securities for purposes of Section 2(a)(11). Therefore, such a person is deemed not to be an underwriter when determining whether a sale is eligible for the Section 4(1) exemption for “transactions by any person other than an issuer, underwriter, or dealer.” If a sale of securities complies with all of the applicable conditions of Rule 144:
1. Any affiliate or other person who sells restricted securities will be deemed not to be engaged in a distribution and therefore not an underwriter for that transaction;
2. Any person who sells restricted or other securities on behalf of an affiliate of the issuer will be deemed not to be engaged in a distribution and therefore not an underwriter for that transaction; and
3. The purchaser in such transaction will receive securities that are not restricted securities.
Rule 144 is not an exclusive safe harbor. A person who does not meet all of the applicable conditions of Rule 144 still may claim any other available exemption under the Act for the sale of the securities. The Rule 144 safe harbor is not available to any person with respect to any transaction or series of transactions that, although in technical compliance with Rule 144, is part of a plan or scheme to evade the registration requirements of the Act.

The person filing the notice required by this paragraph shall have a bona fide intention to sell the securities referred to in the notice within a reasonable time after the filing of such notice.

(3) The term “Form 10 information” means the information that is required by Form 10 or Form 20-F (§ 249.210 or § 249.220f of this chapter), as applicable to the issuer of the securities, to register under the Exchange Act each class of securities being sold under this rule. The issuer may provide the Form 10 information in any filing of the issuer with the Commission. The Form 10 information is deemed filed when the initial filing is made with the Commission.

Private resales of securities to institutions.

# Preliminary Notes:
1. This section relates solely to the application of section 5 of the Act and not to antifraud or other provisions of the federal securities laws.
2. Attempted compliance with this section does not act as an exclusive election; any seller hereunder may also claim the availability of any other applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Act.
3. In view of the objective of this section and the policies underlying the Act, this section is not available with respect to any transaction or series of transactions that, although in technical compliance with this section, is part of a plan or scheme to evade the registration provisions of the Act. In such cases, registration under the Act is required.
4. Nothing in this section obviates the need for any issuer or any other person to comply with the securities registration or broker-dealer registration requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the
Exchange Act
), whenever such requirements are applicable.
5. Nothing in this section obviates the need for any person to comply with any applicable state law relating to the offer or sale of securities.
6. Securities acquired in a transaction made pursuant to the provisions of this section are deemed to be
restricted securities
within the meaning of § 230.144(a)(3) of this chapter.
7. The fact that purchasers of securities from the issuer thereof may purchase such securities with a view to reselling such securities pursuant to this section will not affect the availability to such issuer of an exemption under section 4(a)(2) of the Act, or Regulation D under the Act, from the registration requirements of the Act.

§ 230.145
Reclassification of securities, mergers, consolidations and acquisitions of assets.

# Preliminary Note:
Rule 145 (§ 230.145 of this chapter) is designed to make available the protection provided by registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (Act), to persons who are offered securities in a business combination of the type described in paragraphs (a) (1), (2) and (3) of the rule. The thrust of the rule is that an
offer, offer to sell, offer for sale,
or
sale
occurs when there is submitted to security holders a plan or agreement pursuant to which such holders are required to elect, on the basis of what is in substance a new investment decision, whether to accept a new or different security in exchange for their existing security. Rule 145 embodies the Commission's determination that such transactions are subject to the registration requirements of the Act, and that the previously existing
no-sale

§ 230.152
Integration.
This section provides a general principle of integration and non-exclusive safe harbors from integration of registered and exempt offerings. Because of the objectives of this section and the policies underlying the Act, the provisions of this section will not have the effect of avoiding integration for any transaction or series of transactions that, although in technical compliance with the section, is part of a plan or scheme to evade the registration requirements of the Act.
(a)
General principle of integration.
If the safe harbors in paragraph (b) of this section do not apply, in determining whether two or more offerings are to be treated as one for the purpose of registration or qualifying for an exemption from registration under the Act, offers and sales will not be integrated if, based on the particular facts and circumstances, the issuer can establish that each offering either complies with the registration requirements of the Act, or that an exemption from registration is available for the particular offering. In making this determination:
(1) For an exempt offering prohibiting general solicitation, the issuer must have a reasonable belief, based on the facts and circumstances, with respect to each purchaser in the exempt offering prohibiting general solicitation, that the issuer (or any person acting on the issuer's behalf) either:
(i) Did not solicit such purchaser through the use of general solicitation; or
(ii) Established a substantive relationship with such purchaser prior to the commencement of the exempt offering prohibiting general solicitation; and
(2) For two or more concurrent exempt offerings permitting general solicitation, in addition to satisfying the
requirements of the particular exemption relied on, general solicitation offering materials for one offering that includes information about the material terms of a concurrent offering under another exemption may constitute an offer of securities in such other offering, and therefore the offer must comply with all the requirements for, and restrictions on, offers under the exemption being relied on for such other offering, including any legend requirements and communications restrictions.
(b)
Safe harbors.
No integration analysis under paragraph (a) of this section is required, if any of the following non-exclusive safe harbors apply:
(1) Any offering made more than 30 calendar days before the commencement of any other offering, or more than 30 calendar days after the termination or completion of any other offering, will not be integrated with such other offering,
provided that
for an exempt offering for which general solicitation is not permitted that follows by 30 calendar days or more an offering that allows general solicitation, the provisions of § 230.152(a)(1) shall apply.
(2) Offers and sales made in compliance with § 230.701, pursuant to an employee benefit plan, or in compliance with §§ 230.901 through 230.905 (Regulation S) will not be integrated with other offerings;
(3) An offering for which a registration statement under the Act has been filed will not be integrated if it is made subsequent to:
(i) A terminated or completed offering for which general solicitation is not permitted;
(ii) A terminated or completed offering for which general solicitation is permitted made only to qualified institutional buyers and institutional accredited investors; or
(iii) An offering for which general solicitation is permitted that terminated or completed more than 30 calendar days prior to the commencement of the registered offering; or
(4) Offers and sales made in reliance on an exemption for which general solicitation is permitted will not be integrated if made subsequent to any terminated or completed offering.
(c)
Commencement of an offering.
For purposes of this section, an offering of securities will be deemed to be commenced at the time of the first offer of securities in the offering by the issuer or its agents. The following non-exclusive list of factors should be considered in determining when an offering is deemed to be commenced. Pursuant to the requirements for registered and exempt offerings, an issuer or its agents may commence an offering in reliance on:
(1) Section 230.241, on the date the issuer first made a generic offer soliciting interest in a contemplated securities offering for which the issuer had not yet determined the exemption under the Act under which the offering of securities would be conducted;
(2) Section 15 U.S.C. 77d(a)(2) (Section 4(a)(2)), §§ 230.501 through 230.508 (Regulation D), or § 230.147, or § 230.147A (Rules 147 or 147A), on the date the issuer first made an offer of its securities in reliance on these exemptions;
(3) Sections 230.251 through 230.263 (Regulation A), on the earlier of the date the issuer first made an offer soliciting interest in a contemplated securities offering in reliance on § 230.255, or the public filing of a Form 1-A offering statement;
(4) Sections 227.100 through 227.503 of this chapter (Regulation Crowdfunding), on the earlier of the date the issuer first made an offer soliciting interest in a contemplated securities offering in reliance on § 227.206 of this chapter, or the public filing of a Form C offering statement; and
(5) A registration statement filed under the Act, in the case of:
(i) A continuous offering that will commence promptly on the date of initial effectiveness, on the date the issuer first filed its registration statement for the offering with the Commission; or
(ii) A delayed offering, on the earliest date on which the issuer or its agents commenced public efforts to offer and sell the securities, which could be evidenced by the earlier of:
(A) The first filing of a prospectus supplement with the Commission describing the delayed offering; or
(B) The issuance of a widely disseminated public disclosure, such as a press
release, confirming the commencement of the delayed offering.

# Note 1 to paragraph (c)(5):
Offers by the issuer, or persons acting on behalf of the issuer, limited exclusively to qualified institutional buyers and institutional accredited investors, including those that would qualify for the safe harbor in § 230.163B, will not be considered the commencement of a registered offering for purposes of this section.
(d)
Termination or completion of an offering.
For purposes of this section, the termination or completion of an offering is deemed to have occurred when the issuer and its agents cease efforts to make further offers to sell the issuer's securities under such offering. The following non-exclusive list of factors should be considered in determining when an offering is deemed to be terminated or completed including for offerings made in reliance on:
(1) Section 4(a)(2), Regulation D, or Rules 147 or 147A, on the later of the date:
(i) The issuer entered into a binding commitment to sell all securities to be sold under the offering (subject only to conditions outside of the investor's control); or
(ii) The issuer and its agents ceased efforts to make further offers to sell the issuer's securities under such offering;
(2) Regulation A, on:
(i) The withdrawal of an offering statement under § 230.259(a);
(ii) The filing of a § 239.94 of this chapter (Form 1-Z) with respect to a Tier I offering under § 230.257(a);
(iii) The declaration by the Commission that the offering statement has been abandoned under § 230.259(b); or
(iv) The date, after the third anniversary of the date the offering statement was initially qualified, on which § 230.251(d)(3)(i)(F) prohibits the issuer from continuing to sell securities using the offering statement, or any earlier date on which the offering terminates by its terms;
(3) Regulation Crowdfunding, on the deadline of the offering identified in the offering materials pursuant to § 227.201(g) of this chapter, or indicated by the Regulation Crowdfunding intermediary in any notice to investors delivered under § 227.304(b) of this chapter; and
(4) A registration statement filed under the Act:
(i) On the withdrawal of the registration statement after an application is granted or deemed granted under § 230.477;
(ii) On the filing of a prospectus supplement or amendment to the registration statement indicating that the offering, or particular delayed offering in the case of a shelf registration statement, has been terminated or completed;
(iii) On the entry of an order of the Commission declaring that the registration statement has been abandoned under § 230.479;
(iv) On the date, after the third anniversary of the initial effective date of the registration statement, on which § 230.415(a)(5) prohibits the issuer from continuing to sell securities using the registration statement, or any earlier date on which the offering terminates by its terms; or
(v) Any other factors that indicate that the issuer has abandoned or ceased its public selling efforts in furtherance of the offering, or particular delayed offering in the case of a shelf registration statement, which could be evidenced by:
(A) The filing of a Current Report on Form 8-K; or
(B) The issuance of a widely disseminated public disclosure by the issuer, or its agents, informing the market that the offering, or particular delayed offering, in the case of a shelf registration statement, has been terminated or completed.

# Note 2 to paragraph (d)(4):
A particular delayed offering may be deemed terminated or completed, even though the issuer's shelf registration statement may still have an aggregate amount of securities available to offer and sell in a later delayed offering.

§ 230.152a
Offer or sale of certain fractional interests.
Any offer or sale of a security, evidenced by a scrip certificate, order form or similar document which represents a fractional interest in a share of stock or similar security shall be deemed a transaction by a person other than an issuer, underwriter or dealer, within the meaning of section 4(1) of

Delivery of prospectuses to investors at the same address.
(a)
Delivery of a single prospectus.
If you must deliver a prospectus under the federal securities laws, for purposes of sections 5(b) and 2(a)(10) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 77e(b) and 77b(a)(10)) or § 240.15c2-8(b) of this chapter, you will be considered to have delivered a prospectus to investors who share an address if:
(1) You deliver a prospectus to the shared address;

(b)
Implied consent.
You do not need to obtain written consent from an investor under paragraph (a)(3) of this section if all of the following conditions are met:
(1) The investor has the same last name as the other investors, or you reasonably believe that the investors are members of the same family;
(2) You have sent the investor a notice at least 60 days before you begin to rely on this section concerning delivery of prospectuses to that investor. The notice must be a separate written statement and:
(i) State that only one prospectus will be delivered to the shared address unless you receive contrary instructions;
(ii) Include a toll-free telephone number or be accompanied by a reply form that is pre-addressed with postage provided, that the investor can use to notify you that he or she wishes to receive a separate prospectus;
(iii) State the duration of the consent;
(iv) Explain how an investor can revoke consent;
(v) State that you will begin sending individual copies to an investor within 30 days after you receive revocation of the investor's consent; and

Investment company and registered non-variable annuity sales literature.
(a) Under the Federal securities laws, including section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77q(a)) and section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78j(b)) and § 240.10b-5 of this chapter (Rule 10b-5) thereunder, it is unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, by the use of any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce or of the mails, to use sales literature which is materially misleading in connection with the offer or sale of registered non-variable annuity securities or securities issued by an investment company. Under these provisions, sales literature is materially misleading if it:
(1) Contains an untrue statement of a material fact; or
(2) Omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make a statement made, in the light of the circumstances of its use, not misleading.
(b) Whether or not a particular description, representation, illustration, or other statement involving a material fact is misleading depends on evaluation of the context in which it is made. In considering whether a particular statement involving a material fact is or might be misleading, weight should be given to all pertinent factors, including, but not limited to, those listed below.
(1) A statement could be misleading because of:
(i) Other statements being made in connection with the offer of sale or sale of the securities in question;
(ii) The absence of explanations, qualifications, limitations or other statements necessary or appropriate to make such statement not misleading; or
(iii) General economic or financial conditions or circumstances.
(2) Representations about past or future investment performance could be misleading because of statements or omissions made involving a material fact, including situations where:
(i) Portrayals of past income, gain, or growth of assets convey an impression of the net investment results achieved by an actual or hypothetical investment which would not be justified under the circumstances, including portrayals that omit explanations, qualifications, limitations, or other statements necessary or appropriate to make the portrayals not misleading; and
(ii) Representations, whether express or implied, about future investment performance, including:
(A) Representations, as to security of capital, possible future gains or income, or expenses associated with an investment;
(B) Representations implying that future gains or income may be inferred from or predicted based on past investment performance; or
(C) Portrayals of past performance, made in a manner which would imply
that gains or income realized in the past would be repeated in the future.
(3) A statement involving a material fact about the characteristics or attributes of an investment company or registered non-variable annuity could be misleading because of:
(i) Statements about possible benefits connected with or resulting from services to be provided or methods of operation which do not give equal prominence to discussion of any risks or limitations associated therewith;
(ii) Exaggerated or unsubstantiated claims about management skill or techniques, characteristics of the investment company or registered non-variable annuity or an investment in such company or securities, services, security of investment or funds, effects of government supervision, or other attributes; and
(iii) Unwarranted or incompletely explained comparisons to other investment vehicles or to indexes.
(4) Representations about the fees or expenses associated with an investment in the fund or registered non-variable annuity could be misleading because of statements or omissions made involving a material fact, including situations where portrayals of the fees and expenses associated with an investment in the fund or registered non-variable annuity omit explanations, qualifications, limitations, or other statements necessary or appropriate to make the portrayals not misleading.
(c) For purposes of this section, the term
sales literature
shall be deemed to include any communication (whether in writing, by radio, or by television) used by any person to offer to sell or induce the sale of securities of any investment company or registered non-variable annuity. Communications between issuers, underwriters and dealers are included in this definition of sales literature if such communications, or the information contained therein, can be reasonably expected to be communicated to prospective investors in the offer or sale of securities or are designed to be employed in either written or oral form in the offer or sale of securities.
(d) Nothing in this section may be construed to prevent a business development company or a registered closed-end investment company from qualifying for an exemption under § 230.168 or § 230.169.

An issuer is considered to be engaged or proposing to engage in small business financing under this section if it is conducting or proposes to conduct an offering of securities which does not exceed the dollar limitation prescribed by section 3(b)(1) of the Securities Act.

(i) The employer is a law firm, accounting firm, investment banking firm, pension consulting firm or investment advisory firm that is engaged in furnishing services of a type that involve such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters that the employer is able to represent adequately its interests and those of its employees; or
(ii) In connection with the plan, the employer prior to adopting the plan obtains the advice of a person or entity that (A) is not a financial institution providing any funding vehicle for the plan, and is neither an affiliated person as defined in section 2(a)(3) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 of, nor a person who has a material business relationship with, a financial institution providing a funding vehicle for the plan; and (B) is, by virtue of knowledge and experience in financial and business matters, able to represent adequately the interests of the employer and its employees.

§ 230.190
Registration of underlying securities in asset-backed securities transactions.
(a) In an offering of asset-backed securities where the asset pool includes securities of another issuer (“underlying securities”), unless the underlying securities are themselves exempt from registration under section 3 of the Act (15 U.S.C. 77c), the offering of the relevant underlying securities itself must be registered as a primary offering of such securities in accordance
with paragraph (b) of this section unless all of the following are true. Terms used in this section have the same meaning as in Item 1101 of Regulation AB (§ 229.1101 of this chapter).
(1) Neither the issuer of the underlying securities nor any of its affiliates has a direct or indirect agreement, arrangement, relationship or understanding, written or otherwise, relating to the underlying securities and the asset-backed securities transaction;
(2) Neither the issuer of the underlying securities nor any of its affiliates is an affiliate of the sponsor, depositor, issuing entity or underwriter of the asset-backed securities transaction;
(3) If the underlying securities are restricted securities, as defined in § 230.144(a)(3), § 230.144 must be available for the sale of the securities, provided however, that notwithstanding any other provision of § 230.144, § 230.144 shall only be so available if at least two years have elapsed since the later of the date the securities were acquired from the issuer of the underlying securities or from an affiliate of the issuer of the underlying securities; and
(4) The depositor would be free to publicly resell the underlying securities without registration under the Act. For example, the offering of the asset-backed security does not constitute part of a distribution of the underlying securities. An offering of asset-backed securities with an asset pool containing underlying securities that at the time of the purchase for the asset pool are part of a subscription or unsold allotment would be a distribution of the underlying securities. For purposes of this section, in an offering of asset-backed securities involving a sponsor, depositor or underwriter that was an underwriter or an affiliate of an underwriter in a registered offering of the underlying securities, the distribution of the asset-backed securities will not constitute part of a distribution of the underlying securities if the underlying securities were purchased at arm's length in the secondary market at least three months after the last sale of any unsold allotment or subscription by the affiliated underwriter that participated in the registered offering of the underlying securities.
(b) If all of the conditions in paragraph (a) of this section are not met, the offering of the relevant underlying securities itself must be registered as a primary offering of such securities in accordance with the following:
(1) If the offering of asset-backed securities is registered on Form SF-3 (§ 239.45 of this chapter), the offering of the underlying securities itself must be eligible to be registered under Form SF-3, Form S-3 (§ 239.13 of this chapter), or F-3 (§ 239.33 of this chapter) as a primary offering of such securities;
(2) The plan of distribution in the registration statement for the offering of the underlying securities contemplates this type of distribution at the time of the commencement of the offering of the asset-backed securities;
(3) The prospectus for the asset-backed securities offering describes the plan of distribution for both the underlying securities and the asset-backed securities;
(4) The prospectus relating to the offering of the underlying securities is delivered simultaneously with the delivery of the prospectus relating to the offering of the asset-backed securities, and the prospectus for the asset-backed securities includes disclosure that the prospectus for the offering of the underlying securities will be delivered along with, or is combined with, the prospectus for the offering of the asset-backed securities;
(5) The prospectus for the asset-backed securities offering identifies the issuing entity, depositor, sponsor and each underwriter for the offering of the asset-backed securities as an underwriter for the offering of the underlying securities; and
(6) Neither prospectus disclaims or limits responsibility by the issuing entity, sponsor, depositor, trustee or any underwriter for information regarding the underlying securities.
(c) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, if the asset pool for the asset-backed securities includes a pool asset representing an interest in or the right to the payments or cash flows of another asset pool, then that
pool asset is not considered an “underlying security” for purposes of this section (although its distribution in connection with the asset-backed securities transaction may need to be separately registered) if the following conditions are met:
(1) Both the issuing entity for the asset-backed securities and the entity issuing the pool asset were established under the direction of the same sponsor and depositor;
(2) The pool asset is created solely to satisfy legal requirements or otherwise facilitate the structuring of the asset-backed securities transaction;
(3) The pool asset is not part of a scheme to avoid registration or the requirements of this section; and
(4) The pool asset is held by the issuing entity and is a part of the asset pool for the asset-backed securities.
(d) Notwithstanding paragraph (c) of this section (that is, although the pool asset described in paragraph (c) of this section is an not an “underlying security” for purposes of this section), if the pool assets for the asset-backed securities are collateral certificates or special units of beneficial interest, those collateral certificates or special units of beneficial interest must be registered concurrently with the registration of the asset-backed securities. However, pursuant to § 230.457(t) no separate registration fee for the certificates or special units of beneficial interest is required to be paid.

§ 230.191
Definition of “issuer” in section 2(a)(4) of the Act in relation to asset-backed securities.
The following applies with respect to asset-backed securities under the Act. Terms used in this section have the same meaning as in Item 1101 of Regulation AB (§ 229.1101 of this chapter).
(a) The depositor for the asset-backed securities acting solely in its capacity as depositor to the issuing entity is the “issuer” for purposes of the asset-backed securities of that issuing entity.
(b) The person acting in the capacity as the depositor specified in paragraph (a) of this section is a different “issuer” from that same person acting as a depositor for another issuing entity or for purposes of that person's own securities.

(B) The risk-mitigating hedging activity is subject, as appropriate, to ongoing recalibration by the securitization participant to ensure that the hedging activity satisfies the requirements set out in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and does not facilitate or create an opportunity to materially benefit from a conflicted transaction other than through risk-reduction; and
(C) The securitization participant has established, and implements, maintains, and enforces, an internal compliance program that is reasonably designed to ensure the securitization participant's compliance with the requirements set out in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, including reasonably designed written policies and procedures regarding the risk-mitigating hedging activities that provide for the specific risk and risk-mitigating hedging activity to be identified, documented, and monitored.
(2)
Liquidity commitments.
Purchases or sales of the asset-backed security made pursuant to, and consistent with, commitments of the securitization participant to provide liquidity for the asset-backed security.

(B) The securitization participant's market-making related activities are designed not to exceed, on an ongoing basis, the reasonably expected near term demands of clients, customers, or counterparties, taking into account the liquidity, maturity, and depth of the market for the relevant types of financial instruments described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section;
(C) The compensation arrangements of persons performing the foregoing activity are designed not to reward or incentivize conflicted transactions;

Solicitation of interest.
At any time before making a determination as to the exemption from registration under the Act under which an offering of securities will be conducted, an issuer or any person authorized to act on behalf of an issuer may communicate orally or in writing to determine whether there is any interest in a contemplated offering of securities exempt from registration under the Act. Such communications are deemed to be an offer of a security for sale for purposes of the antifraud provisions of the Federal securities laws.

(b)
Conditions.
The communications must state that:
(1) The issuer is considering an offering of securities exempt from registration under the Act, but has not determined a specific exemption from registration the issuer intends to rely on for the subsequent offer and sale of the securities;
(2) No money or other consideration is being solicited, and if sent in response, will not be accepted;
(3) No offer to buy the securities can be accepted and no part of the purchase price can be received until the issuer determines the exemption under which the offering is intended to be conducted and, where applicable, the filing, disclosure, or qualification requirements of such exemption are met; and
(4) A person's indication of interest involves no obligation or commitment of any kind.
(c)
Indications of interest.
Any written communication under this section may include a means by which a person may indicate to the issuer that such person is interested in a potential offering.

§ 230.251
Scope of exemption.
(a)
Tier 1 and Tier 2.
A public offer or sale of eligible securities, as defined in Rule 261 (§ 230.261), pursuant to Regulation A shall be exempt under section 3(b) from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”) (15 U.S.C. 77a
et seq.
).
(1)
Tier 1.
Offerings pursuant to Regulation A in which the sum of all cash and other consideration to be received for the securities being offered (“aggregate offering price”) plus the gross proceeds for all securities sold pursuant to other offering statements within the 12 months before the start of and during the current offering of securities (“aggregate sales”) does not exceed $20,000,000, including not more than $6,000,000 offered by all selling securityholders that are affiliates of the issuer (“Tier 1 offerings”).
(2)
Tier 2.
Offerings pursuant to §§ 230.251 through 230.263 (Regulation A) in which the sum of the aggregate offering price and aggregate sales does not exceed $75,000,000, including not more than $22,500,000 offered by all selling securityholders that are affiliates of the issuer (“Tier 2 offerings”).
(3)
Additional limitation on secondary sales in first year.
The portion of the aggregate offering price attributable to the securities of selling securityholders shall not exceed 30% of the aggregate offering price of a particular offering in:
(i) The issuer's first offering pursuant to Regulation A; or
(ii) Any subsequent Regulation A offering that is qualified within one year of the qualification date of the issuer's first offering.

# Note to paragraph (
a

Where a mixture of cash and non-cash consideration is to be received, the aggregate offering price must be based on the price at which the securities are offered for cash.

Valuations of non-cash consideration must be reasonable at the time made. If convertible securities or warrants are being offered and such securities are convertible, exercisable, or exchangeable within one year of the offering statement's qualification or at the discretion of the issuer, the underlying securities must also be qualified and the aggregate offering price must include the actual or maximum estimated conversion, exercise, or exchange price of such securities.
(b)

(6) Is not, and has not been, subject to any order of the Commission entered pursuant to Section 12(j) (15 U.S.C. 78l(j)) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) (15 U.S.C. 78a

# Note to paragraph (
d

# )(2)(
i

# )(C).
When securities underlying warrants or convertible securities are being qualified pursuant to Tier 2 of Regulation A one year or more after the qualification of an offering for which investment limitations previously applied, purchasers of the underlying securities for which investment limitations would apply at that later date may determine compliance with the ten percent (10%) investment limitation using the conversion, exercise, or exchange price to acquire the underlying securities at that later time without aggregating such price with the price of the overlying warrants or convertible securities.
(D) The issuer may rely on a representation of the purchaser when determining compliance with the ten percent (10%) investment limitation in this paragraph (d)(2)(i)(C), provided that the issuer does not know at the time of sale that any such representation is untrue.
(ii) In a transaction that represents a sale by the issuer or an underwriter, or a sale by a dealer within 90 calendar days after qualification of the offering statement, each underwriter or dealer selling in such transaction must deliver to each purchaser from it, not later than two business days following the completion of such sale, a copy of the Final Offering Circular, subject to the following provisions:
(A) If the sale was by the issuer and was not effected by or through an underwriter or dealer, the issuer is responsible for delivering the Final Offering Circular as if the issuer were an underwriter;
(B) For continuous or delayed offerings pursuant to paragraph (d)(3) of this section, the 90 calendar day period for dealers shall commence on the day of the first bona fide offering of securities under such offering statement;
(C) If the security is listed on a registered national securities exchange, no offering circular need be delivered by a dealer more than 25 calendar days after the later of the qualification date of the offering statement or the first date on which the security was bona fide offered to the public;
(D) No offering circular need be delivered by a dealer if the issuer is subject, immediately prior to the time of the filing of the offering statement, to the reporting requirements of Rule 257(b) (§ 230.257(b)); and
(E) The Final Offering Circular delivery requirements set forth in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section may be
satisfied by delivering a notice to the effect that the sale was made pursuant to a qualified offering statement that includes the uniform resource locator (“URL”), which, in the case of an electronic-only offering, must be an active hyperlink, where the Final Offering Circular, or the offering statement of which such Final Offering Circular is part, may be obtained on the Commission's Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval System (“EDGAR”) and contact information sufficient to notify a purchaser where a request for a Final Offering Circular can be sent and received in response.
(3)
Continuous or delayed offerings.
(i) Continuous or delayed offerings may be made under this Regulation A, so long as the offering statement pertains only to:
(A) Securities that are to be offered or sold solely by or on behalf of a person or persons other than the issuer, a subsidiary of the issuer, or a person of which the issuer is a subsidiary;
(B) Securities that are to be offered and sold pursuant to a dividend or interest reinvestment plan or an employee benefit plan of the issuer;
(C) Securities that are to be issued upon the exercise of outstanding options, warrants, or rights;
(D) Securities that are to be issued upon conversion of other outstanding securities;
(E) Securities that are pledged as collateral; or
(F) Securities the offering of which will be commenced within two calendar days after the qualification date, will be made on a continuous basis, may continue for a period in excess of 30 calendar days from the date of initial qualification, and will be offered in an amount that, at the time the offering statement is qualified, is reasonably expected to be offered and sold within two years from the initial qualification date. These securities may be offered and sold only if not more than three years have elapsed since the initial qualification date of the offering statement under which they are being offered and sold; provided, however, that if a new offering statement has been filed pursuant to this paragraph (d)(3)(i)(F), securities covered by the prior offering statement may continue to be offered and sold until the earlier of the qualification date of the new offering statement or 180 calendar days after the third anniversary of the initial qualification date of the prior offering statement. Before the end of such three-year period, an issuer may file a new offering statement covering the securities. The new offering statement must include all the information that would be required at that time in an offering statement relating to all offerings that it covers. Before the qualification date of the new offering statement, the issuer may include as part of such new offering statement any unsold securities covered by the earlier offering statement by identifying on the cover page of the new offering circular, or the latest amendment, the amount of such unsold securities being included. The offering of securities on the earlier offering statement will be deemed terminated as of the date of qualification of the new offering statement. Securities may be sold pursuant to this paragraph (d)(3)(i)(F) only if the issuer is current in its annual and semiannual filings pursuant to Rule 257(b) (§ 230.257(b)), at the time of such sale.
(ii) At the market offerings, by or on behalf of the issuer or otherwise, are not permitted under this Regulation A. As used in this paragraph (d)(3)(ii), the term
at the market offering
means an offering of equity securities into an existing trading market for outstanding shares of the same class at other than a fixed price.
(e)
Confidential treatment.
A request for confidential treatment may be made under Rule 406 (§ 230.406) for information required to be filed, and Rule 83 (§ 200.83) for information not required to be filed.
(f)
Electronic filing.
Documents filed or otherwise provided to the Commission pursuant to this Regulation A must be submitted in electronic format by means of EDGAR in accordance with the EDGAR rules set forth in Regulation S-T (17 CFR part 232).

(1) The initial non-public submission;
(2) All non-public amendments; and
(3) All non-public correspondence submitted by or on behalf of the issuer to the Commission staff regarding such submissions (subject to any separately approved confidential treatment request under Rule 251(e) (§ 230.251(e)).

§ 230.253
Offering circular.
(a)
Contents.
An offering circular must include the information required by Form 1-A for offering circulars.

Information that may be omitted.
Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, a qualified offering circular may omit information with respect to the public offering price, underwriting syndicate (including any material relationships between the issuer or selling securityholders and the unnamed underwriters, brokers or dealers), underwriting discounts or commissions, discounts or commissions to dealers, amount of proceeds, conversion rates, call prices and other items dependent upon the offering price, delivery dates, and terms of the securities dependent
upon the offering date; provided, that the following conditions are met:
(1) The securities to be qualified are offered for cash.
(2) The outside front cover page of the offering circular includes a bona fide estimate of the range of the maximum offering price and the maximum number of shares or other units of securities to be offered or a bona fide estimate of the principal amount of debt securities offered, subject to the following conditions:
(i) The range must not exceed $2 for offerings where the upper end of the range is $10 or less or 20% if the upper end of the price range is over $10; and
(ii) The upper end of the range must be used in determining the aggregate offering price under Rule 251(a) (§ 230.251(a)).
(3) The offering statement does not relate to securities to be offered by competitive bidding.
(4) The volume of securities (the number of equity securities or aggregate principal amount of debt securities) to be offered may not be omitted in reliance on this paragraph (b).

# Note to paragraph (
b

# ).
A decrease in the volume of securities offered or a change in the bona fide estimate of the offering price range from that indicated in the offering circular filed as part of a qualified offering statement may be disclosed in the offering circular filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 253(g) (§ 230.253(g)), so long as the decrease in the volume of securities offered or change in the price range would not materially change the disclosure contained in the offering statement at qualification. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any decrease in the volume of securities offered and any deviation from the low or high end of the price range may be reflected in the offering circular supplement filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 253(g)(1) or (3) (§ 230.253(g)(1) or (3)) if, in the aggregate, the decrease in volume and/or change in price represent no more than a 20% change from the maximum aggregate offering price calculable using the information in the qualified offering statement. In no circumstances may this paragraph be used to offer securities where the maximum aggregate offering price would result in the offering exceeding the limit set forth in Rule 251(a) (§ 230.251(a)) or if the change would result in a Tier 1 offering becoming a Tier 2 offering. An offering circular supplement may not be used to increase the volume of securities being offered. Additional securities may only be offered pursuant to a new offering statement or post-qualification amendment qualified by the Commission.
(c)
Filing of omitted information.
The information omitted from the offering circular in reliance upon paragraph (b) of this section must be contained in an offering circular filed with the Commission pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section; except that if such offering circular is not so filed by the later of 15 business days after the qualification date of the offering statement or 15 business days after the qualification of a post-qualification amendment thereto that contains an offering circular, the information omitted in reliance upon paragraph (b) of this section must be contained in a qualified post-qualification amendment to the offering statement.
(d)
Presentation of information.
(1) Information in the offering circular must be presented in a clear, concise and understandable manner and in a type size that is easily readable. Repetition of information should be avoided; cross-referencing of information within the document is permitted.
(2) Where an offering circular is distributed through an electronic medium, issuers may satisfy legibility requirements applicable to printed documents by presenting all required information in a format readily communicated to investors.
(e)
Date.
An offering circular must be dated approximately as of the date it was filed with the Commission.
(f)
Cover page legend.
The cover page of every offering circular must display the following statement highlighted by prominent type or in another manner:
The United States Securities and Exchange Commission does not pass upon the merits of or give its approval to any securities offered or the terms of the offering, nor does it pass upon the accuracy or completeness of any offering circular or other solicitation materials. These securities are offered pursuant to an exemption from registration with the Commission; however, the Commission has not made an independent determination that the securities offered are exempt from registration.
(g)
Offering circular supplements.
(1) An offering circular that discloses information previously omitted from the offering circular in reliance upon Rule 253(b) (§ 230.253(b)) must be filed with the Commission no later than two business days following the earlier of the date of determination of the offering price or the date such offering circular is first used after qualification in connection with a public offering or sale.
(2) An offering circular that reflects information other than that covered in paragraph (g)(1) of this section that constitutes a substantive change from or addition to the information set forth in the last offering circular filed with the Commission must be filed with the Commission no later than five business days after the date it is first used after qualification in connection with a public offering or sale. If an offering circular filed pursuant to this paragraph (g)(2) consists of an offering circular supplement attached to an offering circular that previously had been filed or was not required to be filed pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section because it did not contain substantive changes from an offering circular that previously was filed, only the offering circular supplement need be filed under paragraph (g) of this section, provided that the cover page of the offering circular supplement identifies the date(s) of the related offering circular and any offering circular supplements thereto that together constitute the offering circular with respect to the securities currently being offered or sold.
(3) An offering circular that discloses information, facts or events covered in both paragraphs (g)(1) and (2) of this section must be filed with the Commission no later than two business days following the earlier of the date of the determination of the offering price or the date it is first used after qualification in connection with a public offering or sale.
(4) An offering circular required to be filed pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section that is not filed within the time frames specified in paragraphs (g)(1) through (3) of this section, as applicable, must be filed pursuant to this paragraph (g)(4) as soon as practicable after the discovery of such failure to file.
(5) Each offering circular filed under this section must contain in the upper right corner of the cover page the paragraphs of paragraphs (g)(1) through (4) of this section under which the filing is made, and the file number of the offering statement to which the offering circular relates.

Information contained in this Preliminary Offering Circular is subject to completion or amendment. These securities may not be sold nor may offers to buy be accepted before the offering statement filed with the Commission is qualified. This Preliminary Offering Circular shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy nor may there be any sales of these securities in any state in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful before registration or qualification under the laws of any such state. We may elect to satisfy our obligation to deliver a Final Offering Circular by sending you a notice within two business days after the completion of our sale to you that contains the URL where the Final Offering Circular or the offering statement in which such Final Offering Circular was filed may be obtained.
(b)
Other contents.
The Preliminary Offering Circular contains substantially the information required to be in an offering circular by Form 1-A (§ 239.90 of this chapter), except that certain information may be omitted under Rule 253(b) (§ 230.253(b)) subject to the conditions set forth in such rule.

(b)
Conditions.

(d)
Revised solicitations of interest.
If solicitation of interest materials are used after the public filing of the offering statement and such solicitation of interest materials contain information that is inaccurate or inadequate in any material respect, revised solicitation of interest materials must be redistributed in a substantially similar manner as such materials were originally distributed. Notwithstanding the foregoing in this paragraph (d), if the only information that is inaccurate or inadequate is contained in a Preliminary Offering Circular provided with the solicitation of interest materials pursuant to paragraphs (b)(4)(i) or (ii) of this section, no such redistribution is required in the following circumstances:
(1) in the case of paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section, the revised Preliminary Offering Circular will be provided to any persons making new inquiries and will be recirculated to any persons making any previous inquiries; or
(2) in the case of paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section, the URL continues to link directly to the most recent Preliminary Offering Circular or to the offering statement in which such revised Preliminary Offering Circular was filed.

Where in connection with a succession by merger, consolidation, exchange of securities, acquisition of assets or otherwise, securities of any issuer that is not required to file reports pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section are issued to the holders of any class of securities of another issuer that is required to file such reports, the duty to file reports pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section shall be deemed to have been assumed by the issuer of the class of securities so issued. The successor issuer must, after the consummation of the succession, file reports in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, unless that issuer is exempt from filing such reports or the duty to file such reports is terminated or suspended under paragraph (d) of this section.
(6)
Exchange Act reporting requirements.
The duty to file reports under this rule shall be deemed to have been met if the issuer is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78m or 15 U.S.C. 78o) and, as of each Form 1-K and Form 1-SA due date, has filed all reports required to be filed by Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78m or 15 U.S.C. 78o) during the 12 months (or such shorter period that the registrant was required to file such reports) preceding such due date.

Amendments must be numbered sequentially and be filed separately for each report amended. Amendments must be signed on behalf of the issuer by a duly authorized representative of the issuer. An amendment to any report required to include certifications as specified in the applicable form must include new certifications by the appropriate persons.

Suspension of duty to file reports.
(1) [Reserved]
(2) The duty to file reports under paragraph (b) of this section with respect to a class of securities held of record (as defined in Rule 12g5-1 (§ 240.12g5-1 of this chapter)) by less than 300 persons, or less than 1,200 persons for a bank (as defined in Section 3(a)(6) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(6)), or a bank holding company (as defined in section 2 of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (12 U.S.C. 1841)), shall be suspended for such class of securities immediately upon filing with the Commission an exit report on Form 1-Z (§ 239.94 of this chapter) if the issuer of such class has filed all reports due pursuant to this rule before the date of such Form 1-Z filing for the shorter of:
(i) The period since the issuer became subject to such reporting obligation; or
(ii) Its most recent three fiscal years and the portion of the current year preceding the date of filing Form 1-Z.
(3) For the purposes of paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the term
class
shall be construed to include all securities of an issuer that are of substantially similar character and the holders of which enjoy substantially similar rights and privileges. If the Form 1-Z is subsequently withdrawn or if it is denied because the issuer was ineligible to use the form, the issuer must, within 60 calendar days, file with the Commission all reports which would have been required if such exit report had not been filed. If the suspension resulted from the issuer's merger into, or consolidation with, another issuer or issuers, the notice must be filed by the successor issuer.
(4) The ability to suspend reporting, as described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, is not available for any class of securities if:
(i) During that fiscal year a Tier 2 offering statement was qualified;
(ii) The issuer has not filed an annual report under this rule or the Exchange Act for the fiscal year in which a Tier 2 offering statement was qualified; or
(iii) Offers or sales of securities of that class are being made pursuant to a Tier 2 Regulation A offering.
(e)
Termination of duty to file reports.
If the duty to file reports is deemed to have been met pursuant to paragraph (b)(6) of this section and such status ends because the issuer terminates or suspends its duty to file reports under the Exchange Act, the issuer's obligation to file reports under paragraph (b) of this section shall:
(1) Automatically terminate if the issuer is eligible to suspend its duty to file reports under paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) of this section; or
(2) Recommence with the report covering the most recent financial period after that included in any effective registration statement or filed Exchange Act report.

(a)
Suspension.
The Commission may at any time enter an order temporarily
suspending a Regulation A exemption if it has reason to believe that:
(1) No exemption is available or any of the terms, conditions or requirements of Regulation A have not been complied with;
(2) The offering statement, any sales or solicitation of interest material, or any report filed pursuant to Rule 257 (§ 230.257) contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading;
(3) The offering is being made or would be made in violation of section 17 of the Securities Act;
(4) An event has occurred after the filing of the offering statement that would have rendered the exemption hereunder unavailable if it had occurred before such filing;
(5) Any person specified in Rule 262(a) (§ 230.262(a)) has been indicted for any crime or offense of the character specified in Rule 262(a)(1) (§ 230.262(a)(1)), or any proceeding has been initiated for the purpose of enjoining any such person from engaging in or continuing any conduct or practice of the character specified in Rule 262(a)(2) (§ 230.262(a)(2)), or any proceeding has been initiated for the purposes of Rule 262(a)(3)-(8) (§ 230.262(a)(3) through (8)); or
(6) The issuer or any promoter, officer, director, or underwriter has failed to cooperate, or has obstructed or refused to permit the making of an investigation by the Commission in connection with any offering made or proposed to be made in reliance on Regulation A.
(b)
Notice and hearing
. Upon the entry of an order under paragraph (a) of this section, the Commission will promptly give notice to the issuer, any underwriter, and any selling securityholder:
(1) That such order has been entered, together with a brief statement of the reasons for the entry of the order; and
(2) That the Commission, upon receipt of a written request within 30 calendar days after the entry of the order, will, within 20 calendar days after receiving the request, order a hearing at a place to be designated by the Commission.
(c)
Suspension order
. If no hearing is requested and none is ordered by the Commission, an order entered under paragraph (a) of this section shall become permanent on the 30th calendar day after its entry and shall remain in effect unless or until it is modified or vacated by the Commission. Where a hearing is requested or is ordered by the Commission, the Commission will, after notice of and opportunity for such hearing, either vacate the order or enter an order permanently suspending the exemption.
(d)
Permanent suspension
. The Commission may, at any time after notice of and opportunity for hearing, enter an order permanently suspending the exemption for any reason upon which it could have entered a temporary suspension order under paragraph (a) of this section. Any such order shall remain in effect until vacated by the Commission.
(e)
Notice procedures
. All notices required by this rule must be given by personal service, registered or certified mail to the addresses given by the issuer, any underwriter and any selling securityholder in the offering statement.

§ 230.259
Withdrawal or abandonment of offering statements.
(a)
Withdrawal
. If none of the securities that are the subject of an offering statement has been sold and such offering statement is not the subject of a proceeding under Rule 258 (§ 230.258), the offering statement may be withdrawn with the Commission's consent. The application for withdrawal must state the reason the offering statement is to be withdrawn and must be signed by an authorized representative of the issuer. Any withdrawn document will remain in the Commission's files, as well as the related request for withdrawal.
(b)
Abandonment.
When an offering statement, or a post-qualification amendment to such statement, has been on file with the Commission for nine months without amendment and has not become qualified, the Commission may, in its discretion, declare the
offering statement or post-qualification amendment abandoned. If the offering statement has been amended, or if the post-qualification amendment has been amended, the nine-month period shall be computed from the date of the latest amendment.

§ 230.260
Insignificant deviations from a term, condition or requirement of Regulation A.
(a)
Failure to comply
. A failure to comply with a term, condition or requirement of Regulation A will not result in the loss of the exemption from the requirements of section 5 of the Securities Act for any offer or sale to a particular individual or entity, if the person relying on the exemption establishes that:
(1) The failure to comply did not pertain to a term, condition or requirement directly intended to protect that particular individual or entity;
(2) The failure to comply was insignificant with respect to the offering as a whole, provided that any failure to comply with Rule 251(a), (b), and (d)(1) and (3) (§ 230.251(a), (b), and (d)(1) and (3)) shall be deemed to be significant to the offering as a whole; and
(3) A good faith and reasonable attempt was made to comply with all applicable terms, conditions and requirements of Regulation A.
(b)
Action by Commission
. A transaction made in reliance upon Regulation A must comply with all applicable terms, conditions and requirements of the regulation.

(c)
Suspension
. This provision provides no relief or protection from a proceeding under Rule 258 (§ 230.258).

With respect to any beneficial owner of 20 percent or more of the issuer's outstanding voting equity securities, calculated on the basis of voting power, the issuer is required to determine whether a disqualifying event has occurred only as of the time of filing of the offering statement and not from the time of such sale.

(2) Upon a showing of good cause and without prejudice to any other action by the Commission, if the Commission determines that it is not necessary under the circumstances that an exemption be denied;
(3) If, before the filing of the offering statement or the relevant sale, the court or regulatory authority that entered the relevant order, judgment or decree advises in writing (whether contained in the relevant judgment, order or decree or separately to the Commission or its staff) that disqualification under paragraph (a) of this section should not arise as a consequence of such order, judgment or decree; or

. The issuer must include in the offering circular a description of any matters that would have triggered disqualification under paragraphs (a)(3) and (5) of this section but occurred before June 19, 2015.

§ 230.401
Requirements as to proper form.
(a) The form and contents of a registration statement and prospectus shall conform to the applicable rules and forms as in effect on the initial filing date of such registration statement and prospectus.
(b) If an amendment to a registration statement and prospectus is filed for the purpose of meeting the requirements of section 10(a)(3) of the Act or pursuant to the provisions of section 24(e) or 24(f) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, the form and contents of such an amendment shall conform to the applicable rules and forms as in effect on the filing date of such amendment.
(c) An amendment to a registration statement and prospectus, other than an amendment described in paragraph (b) of this section, may be filed on any shorter Securities Act registration form for which it is eligible on the filing date of the amendment. At the issuer's option, the amendment also may be filed on the same Securities Act registration form used for the most recent amendment described in paragraph (b) of this section or, if no such amendment has been filed, the initial registration statement and prospectus.
(d) The form and contents of a prospectus forming part of a registration statement which is the subject of a stop order entered under section 8(d) of the Act, if used after the date such stop order ceases to be effective, shall conform to the applicable rules and forms as in effect on the date such stop order ceases to be effective.
(e) A prospectus filed as part of an amendment to an effective registration statement, or other amendment to such registration statement, on any form may be prepared in accordance with the requirements of any other form which would then be appropriate for the registration of securities to which the prospectus or other amendment relates, provided that all of the other requirements of such other form and applicable rules (including any required undertakings) are met.
(f) Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, a registrant (1) shall comply with the rules and forms as in effect at a date different from those specified in paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) of this section if the rules or forms or amendments thereto specifically so provide; and (2) may comply voluntarily with the rules and forms as in effect at dates subsequent to those specified in paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) of
this section, provided that all of the requirements of the particular rules and forms in effect at such dates (including any required undertakings) are met.
(g)(1) Subject to paragraphs (g)(2), (g)(3), and (g)(4) of this section, except for registration statements and post-effective amendments that become effective immediately pursuant to Rule 462 and Rule 464 (§ 230.462 and § 230.464), a registration statement or any amendment thereto is deemed filed on the proper registration form unless the Commission objects to the registration form before the effective date.
(2) An automatic shelf registration statement as defined in Rule 405 (§ 230.405) and any post-effective amendment thereto are deemed filed on the proper registration form unless and until the Commission notifies the issuer of its objection to the use of such form. Following any such notification, the issuer must amend its automatic shelf registration statement onto the registration form it is then eligible to use,
provided, however,
that any continuous offering of securities pursuant to Rule 415 (§ 230.415) that the issuer has commenced pursuant to the registration statement before the Commission has notified the issuer of its objection to the use of such form may continue until the effective date of a new registration statement or post-effective amendment to the registration statement that the issuer has filed on the proper registration form, if the issuer files promptly after notification the new registration statement or post-effective amendment and if the offering is permitted to be made under the new registration statement or post-effective amendment.
(3) Violations of General Instruction I.B.6. of Form S-3 or General Instruction I.B.5. of Form F-3 will also violate the requirements as to proper form under this section notwithstanding that the registration statement may have been declared effective previously.
(4) Notwithstanding that the registration statement may have become effective previously, requirements as to proper form under this section will have been violated for any offering of securities where the requirements of General Instruction I.A. of Form SF-3 (§ 239.45 of this chapter) have not been met as of ninety days after the end of the depositor's fiscal year end prior to such offering.

(1)
Investment test.
(i) For acquisitions, other than those described in paragraph (1)(ii) of this definition, and dispositions this test is met when the registrant's and its other subsidiaries' investments in and advances to the tested subsidiary exceed 10 percent of the aggregate worldwide market value of the registrant's voting and non-voting common equity, or if the registrant has no such aggregate worldwide market value, the total assets of the registrant and its subsidiaries consolidated as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal year.
(A) For acquisitions, the “investments in” the tested subsidiary is the consideration transferred, adjusted to exclude the registrant's and its subsidiaries' proportionate interest in the carrying value of assets transferred by the registrant and its subsidiaries consolidated to the tested subsidiary that will remain with the combined entity after the acquisition. It must include the fair value of contingent consideration if required to be recognized at fair value by the registrant at the acquisition date under U.S. GAAP or IFRS-IASB, as applicable; however if recognition at fair value is not required, it must include all contingent consideration, except contingent consideration for which the likelihood of payment is remote.
(B) For dispositions, the “investments in” the tested subsidiary is the fair value of the consideration, including contingent consideration, for the disposed subsidiary when comparing to the aggregate worldwide market value of the registrant's voting and non-voting common equity, or, when the registrant has no such aggregate worldwide market value, the carrying value of the disposed subsidiary when comparing to total assets of the registrant.
(C) When determining the aggregate worldwide market value of the registrant's voting and non-voting common equity, use the average of such aggregate worldwide market value calculated daily for the last five trading days of the registrant's most recently completed month ending prior to the earlier of the registrant's announcement date or agreement date of the acquisition or disposition.
(ii) For a combination between entities or businesses under common control, this test is met when either the net book value of the tested subsidiary exceeds 10 percent of the registrant's and its subsidiaries' consolidated total assets or the number of common shares exchanged or to be exchanged by the registrant exceeds 10 percent of its total common shares outstanding at the date the combination is initiated.
(iii) In all other cases, this test is met when the registrant's and its other subsidiaries' investments in and advances to the tested subsidiary exceed 10 percent of the total assets of the registrant and its subsidiaries consolidated as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal year.
(2)
Asset test.
This test is met when the registrant's and its other subsidiaries' proportionate share of the tested subsidiary's consolidated total assets (after intercompany eliminations) exceeds 10 percent of such total assets of the registrant and its subsidiaries consolidated as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal year.
(3)
Income test.
(i) This test is met when:
(A) The absolute value of the registrant's and its other subsidiaries' equity in the tested subsidiary's consolidated income or loss from continuing operations before income taxes (after intercompany eliminations) attributable to the controlling interests exceeds 10 percent of the absolute value of such income or loss of the registrant and its subsidiaries consolidated for the most recently completed fiscal year; and
(B) The registrant's and its other subsidiaries' proportionate share of the tested subsidiary's consolidated total revenue from continuing operations (after intercompany eliminations) exceeds 10 percent of such total revenue of the registrant and its subsidiaries consolidated for the most recently completed fiscal year. This paragraph (3)(i)(B) does not apply if either the registrant and its subsidiaries consolidated or the tested subsidiary did not have material revenue in each of the two most recently completed fiscal years.
(ii) When determining the income component in paragraph (3)(i)(A) of this definition:
(A) If a net loss from continuing operations before income taxes (after intercompany eliminations) attributable to the controlling interest has been incurred by either the registrant and its subsidiaries consolidated or the tested subsidiary, but not both, exclude the equity in the income or loss from continuing operations before income taxes (after intercompany eliminations) of the tested subsidiary attributable to the controlling interest from such income or loss of the registrant and its subsidiaries consolidated for purposes of the computation;
(B) Compute the test using the average described in this paragraph (3)(ii)(B) if the revenue component in paragraph (3)(i)(B) in this definition does not apply and the absolute value of the registrant's and its subsidiaries' consolidated income or loss from continuing operations before income taxes (after intercompany eliminations) attributable to the controlling interests for the most recent fiscal year is at least 10 percent lower than the average of the absolute value of such amounts for each of its last five fiscal years; and
(C) Entities reporting losses must not be aggregated with entities reporting income where the test involves combined entities, as in the case of determining whether summarized financial data must be presented or whether the aggregate impact specified in §§ 210.3-05(b)(2)(iv) and 210.3-14(b)(2)(i)(C) of this chapter is met, except when determining whether related businesses meet this test for purposes of §§ 210.3-05 and 210.8-04 of this chapter.
(4)
Registered investment company or business development company.
For a registrant that is a registered investment company or a business development company, the term
significant subsidiary
means a subsidiary, including its subsidiaries, which meets any of the following conditions using amounts determined under U.S. GAAP and, if applicable, section 2(a)(41) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-2(a)(41)):
(i)
Investment test.
The value of the registrant's and its other subsidiaries' investments in and advances to the tested subsidiary exceed 10 percent of the value of the total investments of the registrant and its subsidiaries consolidated as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal year; or
(ii)
Income test.
The absolute value of the sum of combined investment income from dividends, interest, and other income, the net realized gains and losses on investments, and the net change in unrealized gains and losses on investments from the tested subsidiary (except, for purposes of § 210.6-11 of this chapter, the absolute value of the change in net assets resulting from operations of the tested subsidiary), for the most recently completed fiscal year exceeds:
(A) 80 percent of the absolute value of the change in net assets resulting from operations of the registrant and its subsidiaries consolidated for the most recently completed fiscal year; or
(B) 10 percent of the absolute value of the change in net assets resulting from operations of the registrant and its subsidiaries consolidated for the most recently completed fiscal year and the investment test (paragraph (4)(i) of this definition) condition exceeds 5 percent. However, if the absolute value of the change in net assets resulting from operations of the registrant and its subsidiaries consolidated is at least 10 percent lower than the average of the absolute value of such amounts for each of its last five fiscal years, then the registrant may compute both conditions of the income test using the average of the absolute value of such amounts for the registrant and its subsidiaries consolidated for each of its last five fiscal years.
Smaller reporting company.
As used in this part, the term
smaller reporting company
means an issuer that is not an investment company, an asset-backed issuer (as defined in § 229.1101 of this chapter), or a majority-owned subsidiary of a parent that is not a smaller reporting company and that:
(1) Had a public float of less than $250 million; or
(2) Had annual revenues of less than $100 million and either:
(i) No public float; or
(ii) A public float of less than $700 million.
(3) Whether an issuer is a smaller reporting company is determined on an annual basis.
(i) For issuers that are required to file reports under section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act:
(A) Public float is measured as of the last business day of the issuer's most recently completed second fiscal quarter and computed by multiplying the aggregate worldwide number of shares of its voting and non-voting common equity held by non-affiliates by the price at which the common equity was last sold, or the average of the bid and asked prices of common equity, in the principal market for the common equity;
(B) Annual revenues are as of the most recently completed fiscal year for which audited financial statements are available; and
(C) An issuer must reflect the determination of whether it came within the definition of smaller reporting company in its quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the first fiscal quarter of the next year, indicating on the cover page of that filing, and in subsequent filings for that fiscal year, whether it is a smaller reporting company, except that, if a determination based on public float indicates that the issuer is newly eligible to be a smaller reporting company, the issuer may choose to reflect this determination beginning with its first quarterly report on Form 10-Q following the determination, rather than waiting until the first fiscal quarter of the next year.
(ii) For determinations based on an initial registration statement under the Securities Act or Exchange Act for shares of its common equity:
(A) Public float is measured as of a date within 30 days of the date of the filing of the registration statement and computed by multiplying the aggregate worldwide number of shares of its voting and non-voting common equity held by non-affiliates before the registration plus, in the case of a Securities Act registration statement, the number of shares of its voting and non-voting common equity included in the registration statement by the estimated public offering price of the shares;
(B) Annual revenues are as of the most recently completed fiscal year for which audited financial statements are available; and
(C) The issuer must reflect the determination of whether it came within the definition of smaller reporting company in the registration statement and must appropriately indicate on the cover page of the filing, and subsequent filings for the fiscal year in which the filing is made, whether it is a smaller reporting company. The issuer must re-determine its status at the end of its second fiscal quarter and then reflect any change in status as provided in paragraph (3)(i)(C) of this definition. In the case of a determination based on an initial Securities Act registration statement, an issuer that was not determined to be a smaller reporting company has the option to re-determine its status at the conclusion of the offering covered by the registration statement based on the actual offering price and number of shares sold.
(iii) Once an issuer determines that it does not qualify for smaller reporting company status because it exceeded one or more of the current thresholds, it will remain unqualified unless when making its annual determination either:
(A) It determines that its public float was less than $200 million; or
(B) It determines that its public float and its annual revenues meet the requirements for subsequent qualification included in the following chart:
Prior annual revenues
Prior public float
None or less than $700 million
$700 million or more
Less than $100 million
Neither threshold exceeded
Public float—Less than $560 million; and
Revenues—Less than $100 million.
$100 million or more
Public float—None or less than $700 million; and
Public float—Less than $560 million; and
Revenues—Less than $80 million
Revenues—Less than $80 million.
Instruction 1 to definition of “smaller reporting company”:
A registrant that qualifies as a smaller reporting company under the public float thresholds identified in paragraphs (1) and (3)(iii)(A) of this definition will qualify as a smaller reporting company regardless of its revenues.
Instruction 2 to definition of “smaller reporting company”:
A foreign private issuer is not eligible to use the requirements for smaller reporting companies unless it uses the forms and rules designated for domestic issuers and provides financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.
(iv) Upon the consummation of a de-SPAC transaction, as defined in § 229.1601(a) of this chapter (Item 1601(a) of Regulation S-K), an issuer must re-determine its status as a smaller reporting company pursuant to the thresholds set forth in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this definition prior to its first filing, other than pursuant to Items 2.01(f), 5.01(a)(8), and/or 9.01(c) of Form 8-K, following the de-SPAC transaction and reflect this re-determination in its filings beginning 45 days after consummation of the de-SPAC transaction.
(A) Public float is measured as of a date within four business days after the consummation of the de-SPAC transaction and is computed by multiplying the aggregate worldwide number of shares of its voting and non-voting common equity held by non-affiliates as of that date by the price at which the common equity was last sold, or the average of the bid and asked prices of common equity, in the principal market for the common equity; and
(B) Annual revenues are the annual revenues of the target company, as defined in § 229.1601(d) of this chapter (Item 1601(d) of Regulation S-K), as of the most recently completed fiscal year reported in the Form 8-K filed pursuant to Items 2.01(f), 5.01(a)(8), and/or 9.01(c) of Form 8-K.
