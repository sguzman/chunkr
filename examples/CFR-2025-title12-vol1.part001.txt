In general.
The OCC provides a copy of the public file to any person who requests it.

A requestor should submit a written request for the public file concerning a decided or closed filing to the OCC's Freedom of Information Act Officer, Communications Division, at the address listed on
www.occ.gov
. The OCC may impose a fee in accordance with 12 CFR 4.17 and at the rate the OCC publishes in the “Notice of Comptroller of the Currency Fees,” described in 12 CFR 8.8.
(b)
Public file.
A public file consists of the portions of the filing, supporting data, supplementary information, and information submitted by interested persons, to the extent that those documents have not been afforded confidential treatment.

see
12 CFR 4.12(b)). A submitter should draft its request for confidential treatment narrowly to extend only to those portions of a document it considers confidential. If a submitter requests confidential treatment for information that the OCC does not consider to be confidential, the OCC may include that information in the public file after providing notice to the submitter. Moreover, at its own initiative, the OCC may determine that certain information should be treated as confidential and withhold that information from the public file. A person requesting information withheld from the public file should submit the request to the OCC's Freedom of Information Act Officer, Communications Division, under the procedures described in 12 CFR part 4, subpart B.

(2)
Extension.
The OCC may extend a comment period if:
(i) The filer fails to file all required publicly available information on a timely basis to permit review by interested persons or makes a request for confidential treatment not granted by the OCC that delays the public availability of that information;
(ii) Any person requesting an extension of time satisfactorily demonstrates to the OCC that additional time is necessary to develop factual information that the OCC determines is necessary to consider the filing; or

A person requesting a hearing must simultaneously submit a copy of the request to the filer.
(b)
Action on a hearing request.
The OCC may grant or deny a request for a hearing and may limit the issues to those it deems relevant or material.

(c)
Denial of a hearing request.
If the OCC denies a hearing request, it will notify the person requesting the hearing of the reason for the denial.
(d)
OCC procedures prior to the hearing

The OCC sends a copy of the Notice of Hearing to the filer, to the person requesting the hearing, and anyone else requesting a copy. The Notice of Hearing states the subject and date of the filing, the time and place of the hearing, and the issues to be addressed. The OCC may limit the issues considered at a hearing to those it determines are relevant or material.
(2)

(i)
Other meetings
—(1)
Public meetings.
The OCC may arrange for a public meeting in connection with a filing, either upon receipt during the comment period of a written request for such a meeting or upon the OCC's own initiative, if the OCC finds that written submissions are insufficient to address facts or issues raised in the filing or otherwise determines that a meeting will benefit the decision-making process. Public meetings will be arranged and presided over by a presiding officer.
(2)
Private meetings.
The OCC may arrange a meeting with a filer or other interested parties to clarify and narrow the issues and to facilitate the resolution of the issues.
(3)
Issues at meetings.

§ 5.12
Computation of time.
In computing the period of days, the OCC does not include the day of the act or event (
e.g.,

[80 FR 28414, May 18, 2015, as amended at 85 FR 80436, Dec. 11, 2020]
§ 5.13
Decisions.
(a)
In general.
The OCC may approve, conditionally approve, or deny a filing after appropriate review and consideration of the record. In reviewing a filing, the OCC may consider the activities, resources, or condition of an affiliate of the filer that may reasonably reflect on or affect the filer. It also may consider information available from any source, including any comments submitted by interested parties or views expressed by interested parties at meetings with the OCC.
(1)
Conditional approval.
The OCC may impose conditions on any approval, including to address a significant supervisory, CRA (if applicable), or compliance concern, if the OCC determines that the conditions are necessary or appropriate to ensure that approval is consistent with relevant statutory and regulatory standards and OCC policies thereunder and safe and sound banking practices.
(2)
Expedited review.
The OCC grants qualifying national banks and Federal savings associations expedited review within a specified time after filing or commencement of the public comment period for certain filings.
(i) The OCC may extend the expedited review period or remove a filing from expedited review procedures if it concludes that the filing, or an adverse comment regarding the filing, presents a significant supervisory, CRA (if applicable), or compliance concern or raises a significant legal or policy issue requiring additional OCC review. The OCC will provide the filer with a written explanation if it decides not to process an application from a qualifying national bank or Federal savings association under expedited review pursuant to this paragraph.
(ii) Adverse comments that the OCC determines do not raise a significant supervisory, CRA (if applicable), or compliance concern or a significant legal or policy issue; are frivolous, non-substantive, or filed primarily as a means of delaying action on the filing; or raise a CRA concern that has been satisfactorily resolved do not affect the OCC's decision under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section. The OCC considers a comment to be non-substantive if it is a generalized opinion that a filing should or should not be approved or a conclusory statement, lacking factual or analytical support. The OCC considers a CRA concern to have been satisfactorily resolved if the OCC previously reviewed (
e.g.,
in an examination, other supervisory activity, or a prior filing made by the current filer) a concern presenting substantially the same issue in substantially the same assessment area during substantially the same time, and the OCC determines that the concern would not warrant denial or imposition of a condition on approval of the application.
(iii) If a bank or savings association makes a filing for any activity or transaction that is dependent upon the approval of another filing under this part, or if requests for approval for more than one activity or transaction are combined in a single filing under applicable sections of this part, none of the subject filings may be deemed approved upon expiration of the applicable time periods, unless all of the filings are subject to expedited review procedures and the longest of the time periods expires without the OCC issuing a decision or notifying the bank or savings association that the filings are not eligible for expedited review under the standards in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section.
(b)
Denial.
The OCC may deny a filing if:
(1) A significant supervisory, CRA (if applicable), or compliance concern exists with respect to the filer;
(2) Approval of the filing is inconsistent with applicable law, regulation, or OCC policy thereunder; or
(3) The filer fails to provide information requested by the OCC that is necessary for the OCC to make an informed decision.
(c)
Required information and abandonment of filing.
A filing must contain information required by the applicable section set forth in this part. To the extent necessary to evaluate an application, the OCC may require a filer to provide additional information. The OCC may deem a filing abandoned if information required or requested by the OCC in connection with the filing is not furnished within the time period specified by the OCC. The OCC may return an application without a decision if it finds the filing to be materially deficient. A filing is materially deficient if it lacks sufficient information for the OCC to make a determination under the applicable statutory or regulatory criteria.
(d)
Notification of final disposition.
The OCC notifies the filer, and any person who makes a written request, of the final disposition of a filing, including confirmation of an expedited review under this part. If the OCC denies a filing, the OCC notifies the filer in writing of the reasons for the denial.
(e)
Publication of decision.
The OCC will issue a public decision when a decision represents a new or changed policy or presents issues of general interest to the public or the banking industry. In rendering its decisions, the OCC may elect not to disclose information that the OCC deems to be private or confidential.
(f)
Appeal.
A filer may file an appeal of an OCC decision in writing with the Deputy Comptroller for Licensing or with the Ombudsman at the address listed on
www.occ.gov
. In the event that the Deputy Comptroller for Licensing was the deciding official of the matter appealed, or was involved personally and substantially in the matter, the appeal may be referred instead to the Chief Counsel or the Ombudsman.
(g)
Extension of time.
When the OCC approves or conditionally approves a filing, the OCC generally gives the filer a specified period of time to commence that new or expanded activity. The OCC does not generally grant an extension of the time specified to commence a new or expanded corporate activity approved under this part, unless the OCC determines that the delay is beyond the filer's control.
(h)
Nullifying a decision.
The OCC may nullify any decision on a filing either prior to or after consummation of the transaction if:
(1) The OCC discovers a material misrepresentation or omission in any information provided to the OCC in the filing or supporting materials;
(2) The decision is contrary to law, regulation, or OCC policy thereunder; or
(3) The decision was granted due to clerical or administrative error, or a material mistake of law or fact.
(i)
Modifying, Suspending, or Rescinding a Decision.
The OCC may modify, suspend, or rescind a decision on a filing if a material change in the information or circumstance on which the OCC relied occurs prior to the date of the consummation of the transaction to which the decision pertains.

Requirements
—(1)
In general.
(i) The OCC charters a national bank under the authority of the National Bank Act of 1864, as amended, 12 U.S.C. 1
et seq.
The bank may be a special purpose bank that limits its activities to fiduciary activities or to any other activities within the business of banking. A special purpose bank that conducts activities other than fiduciary activities must conduct at least one of the following three core banking functions: Receiving deposits; paying checks; or lending money. The name of a proposed national bank must include the word “national.”
(ii) The OCC charters a Federal savings association under the authority of section 5 of the Home Owners' Loan Act, 12 U.S.C. 1464, which in an application to establish a Federal savings association requires the OCC to consider:
(A) Whether the filers are persons of good character and responsibility;
(B) Whether a necessity exists for the association in the community to be served;
(C) Whether there is a reasonable probability of the association's usefulness and success; and
(D) Whether the association can be established without undue injury to properly conducted existing local savings associations and home financing institutions.
(iii) In determining whether to approve an application to establish a national bank or Federal savings association, the OCC verifies that the proposed national bank or Federal savings association has complied with the following requirements. A national bank or a Federal savings association must:
(A) File either articles of association (for a national bank), or a charter and by-laws (for a Federal savings association) with the OCC;
(B) In the case of an application to establish a national bank, file an organization certificate containing specified information with the OCC;
(C) Ensure that all capital stock is paid in, or in the case of a Federal mutual savings association, ensure that at least a minimum amount of capital is paid in; and
(D) Have at least five elected directors.
(2)
Community Reinvestment Act.
Twelve CFR part 25 requires the OCC to take into account a proposed insured national bank's or Federal savings association's description of how it will meet its CRA objectives.
(3)
Federal Deposit Insurance.
Preliminary approval for an application to establish a Federal savings association will be conditioned on the savings association applying for and receiving approval for deposit insurance from the FDIC. Final approval for an application to establish a Federal savings association will not be issued until receipt by the OCC of written confirmation by the FDIC that the accounts of the Federal savings association will be insured by the FDIC.
(f)
Policy
—(1)
In general.
In determining whether to approve an application to establish a national bank or Federal savings association, the OCC is guided by the following principles:
(i) Maintaining a safe and sound banking system;
(ii) Encouraging a national bank or Federal savings association to provide fair access to financial services by helping to meet the credit needs of its entire community;
(iii) Ensuring compliance with laws and regulations; and
(iv) Promoting fair treatment of customers including efficiency and better service.
(2)
Policy considerations.
(i) In evaluating an application to establish a national bank or Federal savings association, the OCC considers whether the proposed institution:
(A) Has organizers who are familiar with national banking laws and regulations or Federal savings association laws and regulations, respectively;
(B) Has competent management, including a board of directors, with ability and experience relevant to the types of services to be provided;
(C) Has capital that is sufficient to support the projected volume and type of business;
(D) Can reasonably be expected to achieve and maintain profitability;
(E) Will be operated in a safe and sound manner; and
(F) Does not have a title that misrepresents the nature of the institution or the services it offers.
(ii) In evaluating an application to establish a Federal savings association, the OCC considers whether the proposed Federal savings association will be operated as a qualified thrift lender under section 10(m) of the Home Owners' Loan Act, 12 U.S.C. 1467a(m).
(iii) The OCC may also consider additional factors listed in section 6 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, 12 U.S.C. 1816, including the risk to the Federal deposit insurance fund, and whether the proposed institution's corporate powers are consistent with the purposes of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, the National Bank Act, and the Home Owners' Loan Act, as applicable.
(3)
OCC evaluation.
The OCC evaluates a proposed institution's organizing group and its business plan or operating plan together. The OCC's judgment concerning one may affect the evaluation of the other. An organizing
group and its business plan or operating plan must be stronger in markets where economic conditions are marginal or competition is intense.
(g)
Organizing group
—(1)
In general.
Strong organizing groups generally include diverse business and financial interests and community involvement. An organizing group must have the experience, competence, willingness, and ability to be active in directing the proposed institution's affairs in a safe and sound manner. The institution's initial board of directors generally is comprised of many, if not all, of the organizers. The business plan or operating plan and other information supplied in the application must demonstrate an organizing group's collective ability to establish and operate a successful national bank or Federal savings association in the economic and competitive conditions of the market to be served. Each organizer should be knowledgeable about the business plan or operating plan. A poor business plan or operating plan reflects adversely on the organizing group's ability, and the OCC generally denies applications with poor business plans or operating plans.
(2)
Management selection.
The initial board of directors must select competent senior executive officers before the OCC grants final approval. Early selection of executive officers, especially the chief executive officer, contributes favorably to the preparation and review of a business plan or operating plan that is accurate, complete, and appropriate for the type of national bank or Federal savings association proposed and its market, and reflects favorably upon an application. As a condition of the charter approval, the OCC retains the right to object to and preclude the hiring of any officer, or the appointment or election of any director, for a two-year period from the date the institution commences business, or longer as appropriate.
(3)
Financial resources.
(i) Each organizer must have a history of responsibility, personal honesty, and integrity. Personal wealth is not a prerequisite to become an organizer or director of a national bank or Federal savings association. However, directors' stock purchases, or, in the case of a Federal mutual savings association, capital contributions, individually and in the aggregate, should reflect a financial commitment to the success of the institution that is reasonable in relation to their individual and collective financial strength. A director should not have to depend on institution dividends, fees, or other compensation to satisfy financial obligations.
(ii) Because directors are often the primary source of additional capital for an institution not affiliated with a holding company, it is desirable that the proposed directors of the national bank or Federal savings association, as a group, be able to supply or have a realistic plan to enable the institution to obtain capital when needed.
(iii) Any financial or other business arrangement, direct or indirect, between the organizing group or other insiders and the proposed national bank or Federal savings association must be on nonpreferential terms.
(4)
Organizational expenses.
(i) Organizers are expected to contribute time and expertise to the organization of the national bank or Federal savings association. Organizers should not bill excessive charges to the institution for professional and consulting services or unduly rely upon these fees as a source of income.
(ii) A proposed national bank or Federal savings association may not pay any fee that is contingent upon an OCC decision. Such action generally is grounds for denial of the application or nullification or rescission of a preliminary approval. Organizational expenses for denied applications are the sole responsibility of the organizing group.
(5)
Sponsor's experience and support.
A sponsor must be financially able to support the new institution's operations and to provide or locate capital when needed. The OCC primarily considers the financial and managerial resources of the sponsor and the sponsor's record of performance, rather than the financial and managerial resources of the organizing group, if an organizing group is sponsored by:
(i) An existing holding company;
(ii) Individuals currently affiliated with other depository institutions; or
(iii) Individuals who, in the OCC's view, are otherwise collectively experienced in banking and have demonstrated the ability to work together effectively.
(h)
Business plan or Operating plan
—(1)
In general.
(i) Organizers of a proposed national bank or Federal savings association must submit a business plan or operating plan that adequately addresses the statutory and policy considerations set forth in paragraphs (e) and (f)(2) of this section. In the case of a proposed Federal savings association the plan must also specifically address meeting qualified thrift lender requirements. The plan must reflect sound banking principles and demonstrate realistic assessments of risk in light of economic and competitive conditions in the market to be served.
(ii) The OCC may offset deficiencies in one factor by strengths in one or more other factors. However, deficiencies in some factors, such as unrealistic earnings prospects, may have a negative influence on the evaluation of other factors, such as capital adequacy, or may be serious enough by themselves to result in denial. The OCC considers inadequacies in a business plan or operating plan to reflect negatively on the organizing group's ability to operate a successful institution.
(2)
Earnings prospects.
The organizing group must submit
pro forma
balance sheets and income statements as part of the business plan or operating plan. The OCC reviews all projections for reasonableness of assumptions and consistency with the business plan or operating plan.
(3)
Management.
(i) The organizing group must include in the business plan or operating plan information sufficient to permit the OCC to evaluate the overall management ability of the organizing group. If the organizing group has limited banking experience or community involvement, the senior executive officers must be able to compensate for such deficiencies.
(ii) The organizing group may not hire an officer or elect or appoint a director if the OCC objects to that person at any time prior to the date the institution commences business.
(4)
Capital.
A proposed bank or Federal savings association must have sufficient initial capital, net of any organizational expenses that will be charged to the institution's capital after it begins operations, to support the institution's projected volume and type of business.
(5)
Community service.
(i) The business plan or operating plan must indicate the organizing group's knowledge of and plans for serving the community. The organizing group must evaluate the banking needs of the community, including its consumer, business, nonprofit, and government sectors. The business plan or operating plan must demonstrate how the proposed national bank or Federal savings association responds to those needs consistent with the safe and sound operation of the institution. The provisions of this paragraph may not apply to an application to organize an institution for a special purpose.
(ii) As part of its business plan or operating plan, the organizing group must submit a statement that demonstrates its plans to achieve CRA objectives.
(iii) Because community support is important to the long-term success of a national bank or Federal savings association, the organizing group must include plans for attracting and maintaining community support.
(6)
Safety and soundness.
The business plan or operating plan must demonstrate that the organizing group (and the sponsoring company, if any), is aware of, and understands, applicable depository institution laws and regulations, and safe and sound banking operations and practices. The OCC will deny an application that does not meet these safety and soundness requirements.
(7)
Fiduciary powers.
The business plan or operating plan must indicate if the proposed institution intends to exercise fiduciary powers. The information required by § 5.26 must be filed with the charter application. A separate application is not required.
(i)
Procedures
—(1)
Prefiling meeting.
The OCC normally requires a prefiling meeting with the organizers of a proposed national bank or Federal savings association before the organizers file an application. Organizers should be familiar with the OCC's chartering policy
and procedural requirements in the Comptroller's Licensing Manual before the prefiling meeting. The prefiling meeting normally is held in the district office where the application will be filed but may be held at another location at the request of the filer.
(2)
Business plan or operating plan.
An organizing group must file a business plan or operating plan that addresses the subjects discussed in paragraph (h) of this section.
(3)
Biographical and financial reports
. (i) Each proposed organizer, director, executive officer, or principal shareholder must submit to the appropriate OCC licensing office:
(A) The information prescribed in the Interagency Biographical and Financial Report, available at
www.occ.gov;
and
(B) Legible fingerprints.
(ii) The OCC may require additional information about any proposed organizer, director, executive officer, or principal shareholder, if appropriate. The OCC may waive any of the information requirements of this paragraph if the OCC determines that it is in the public interest.
(4)
Contact person.
The organizing group must designate a contact person to represent the organizing group in all contacts with the OCC. The contact person must be an organizer and proposed director of the new national bank or Federal savings association, except a representative of the sponsor or sponsors may serve as contact person if an application is sponsored by an existing holding company, individuals currently affiliated with other depository institutions, or individuals who, in the OCC's view, are otherwise collectively experienced in banking and have demonstrated the ability to work together effectively.
(5)
Decision notification.
The OCC notifies the contact person and other relevant parties in writing of its decision on an application.
(6)
Activities.
(i) Before the OCC grants final approval, a proposed national bank or Federal savings association must be established as a legal entity. A national bank becomes a legal entity after it has filed its organization certificate and articles of association with the OCC as required by law. A Federal savings association becomes a legal entity after it has filed its proposed charter and bylaws with the OCC. A proposed national bank may offer and sell securities prior to OCC preliminary approval of the proposed national bank's charter application, provided that the proposed national bank has filed articles of association, an organization certificate, and a completed charter application and the bank complies with paragraph (i)(6)(iii) of this section. A proposed Federal stock savings association may offer and sell securities prior to OCC preliminary approval of the proposed Federal stock savings association's charter application, provided that the proposed Federal stock savings association has filed a proposed charter, bylaws, and a completed charter application and the Federal stock savings association complies with paragraph (i)(6)(iii) of this section.
(ii)(A) After the OCC grants preliminary approval, the organizing group must elect a board of directors, take steps necessary to organize the proposed national bank or Federal savings association and prepare it for commencing business.
(B) A proposed national bank may not conduct the business of banking until the OCC grants final approval and issues a charter. A proposed Federal savings association may not commence business until the OCC grants final approval and issues a charter, which must be in the form provided in this part.
(iii) For all capital obtained through a public offering a proposed national bank or Federal savings association must use an offering circular that complies with the OCC's securities offering regulations, 12 CFR part 16, as applicable. All securities of a particular class in the initial offering must be sold at the same price.
(iv) A national bank or Federal savings association in organization must raise its capital before it commences business. Preliminary approval expires if the proposed national bank or Federal savings association does not raise the required capital within 12 months from the date the OCC grants preliminary approval. Preliminary approval expires if the proposed national bank
or Federal savings association does not commence business within 18 months from the date of preliminary approval, unless the OCC grants an extension. If preliminary approval expires, all cash collected on subscriptions must be returned.
(j)
Expedited review.
An application to establish a full-service national bank or Federal savings association that is sponsored by a bank holding company or savings and loan holding company whose lead depository institution is an eligible bank or eligible savings association is deemed preliminarily approved by the OCC as of the 15th day after the close of the public comment period or the 45th day after the filing is received by the OCC, whichever is later, unless the OCC:
(1) Notifies the filer prior to that date that the filing has been removed from expedited review, or the expedited review process is extended, under § 5.13(a)(2); or
(2) Notifies the filer prior to that date that the OCC has determined that the proposed bank will offer banking services that are materially different than those offered by the lead depository institution.
(k)
National bankers' banks
—(1)
Activities and customers.
In addition to the other requirements of this section, when an organizing group seeks to organize a national bankers' bank, the organizing group must list in the application the anticipated activities and customers or clients of the proposed national bankers' bank.
(2)
Waiver of requirements.
At the organizing group's request, the OCC may waive requirements that are applicable to national banks in general if those requirements are inappropriate for a national bankers' bank and would impede its ability to provide desired services to its market. A filer must submit a request for a waiver with the application and must support the request with adequate justification and legal analysis. A national bankers' bank that is already in operation may also request a waiver. The OCC cannot waive statutory provisions that specifically apply to national bankers' banks pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 27(b)(1).
(3)
Investments.
A national bank or Federal savings association may invest up to 10 percent of its capital and surplus in a bankers' bank and may own five percent or less of any class of a bankers' bank's voting securities.
(l)
Special purpose institutions
—(1)
In general.
A filer for a national bank or Federal savings association charter that will limit its activities to fiduciary activities, credit card operations, or another special purpose must adhere to established charter procedures with modifications appropriate for the circumstances as determined by the OCC. A filer for a national bank or Federal savings association charter that will have a community development focus must also adhere to established charter procedures with modifications appropriate for the circumstances as determined by the OCC. A national bank that seeks to invest in a bank or savings association with a community development focus must comply with applicable requirements of 12 CFR part 24. A Federal savings association that seeks to invest in a bank or savings association with a community development focus must comply with § 160.36 or any other applicable requirements.
(2)
Changes in charter purpose.
An existing national bank or Federal savings association whose activities are limited to a special purpose that desires to change to another special purpose, to add another special purpose, or to no longer be limited to a special purpose charter must submit an application and obtain prior OCC approval under § 5.53. An existing national bank or Federal savings association whose activities are not limited that desires to limit its activities and become a special purpose institution must submit an application and obtain prior OCC approval under § 5.53.

Section 3. Duration.
The duration of the association is perpetual.
Section 4. Purpose and powers.
The purpose of the association is to pursue any or all of the lawful objectives of a Federal mutual savings association chartered under section 5 of the Home Owners' Loan Act and to exercise all the express, implied, and incidental powers conferred thereby and by all acts amendatory thereof and supplemental thereto, subject to the Constitution and laws of the United States as they are now in effect, or as they may hereafter be amended, and subject to all lawful and applicable rules, regulations, and orders of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”).

No member, however, may cast more than 1,000 votes. All accounts are nonassessable.
Section 7. Directors.
The association is under the direction of a board of directors. The authorized number of directors may not be fewer than five nor more than fifteen persons, as fixed in the association's bylaws, except that the number of directors may be decreased to a number less than five or increased to a number greater than fifteen with the prior approval of the OCC.
Section 8. Capital, surplus, and distribution of earnings.
The association will maintain for the purpose of meeting losses the amount of capital required by section 5 of the Home Owners' Loan Act and by regulations of the OCC.

pro rata
to the value of their accounts, in the event of voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the association. Moreover, in any such event, or in any other situation in which the priority of such accounts is in controversy, all such accounts will, to the extent of their withdrawal value, be debts of the association having the same priority as the claims of general creditors of the association not having priority (other than any priority arising or resulting from consensual subordination) over other general creditors of the association.
Section 9. Amendment of charter.
Adoption of any preapproved charter amendment will be effective after such preapproved amendment has been approved by the members at a legal meeting.

(2)
Requirements.
The following requirements are applicable to Federal mutual savings associations:

Such meeting must be held at any convenient place the board of directors may designate, and at a date and time within 150 days after the end of the association's fiscal year. The association's bylaws may provide for telephonic or electronic participation of members at an annual meeting. Members participating in an annual meeting telephonically or electronically will be deemed present in person for purposes of the quorum requirement in paragraph (j)(2)(v) of this section.
(B) At each annual meeting, the officers must make a full report of the financial condition of the association and of its progress for the preceding year and must outline a program for the succeeding year.
(C) If the association's bylaws provide for telephonic or electronic participation in member meetings, the association must follow the procedures for telephonic or electronic participation of the State corporate governance provisions it is permitted to elect pursuant to paragraph (j)(3)(ii) of this section, if those State corporate governance provisions include telephonic or electronic participation procedures; the Delaware General Corporation Law, Del. Code Ann. Tit. 8 (1991, as amended 1994, and as amended thereafter) (with “member” substituting for “stockholder”); or the Model Business Corporation Act (with “member” substituting for “shareholder”), provided, however, that such procedures are not inconsistent with applicable Federal statutes and regulations and safety and soundness. The association must indicate the use of these procedures in its bylaws.
(ii)
Special meetings of members.
Procedures for calling any special meeting of the members and for conducting such a meeting must be set forth in the bylaws. The board of directors of the association or the holders of 10 percent or more of the voting capital must be entitled to call a special meeting. The association's bylaws may provide for telephonic or electronic participation of members at a special meeting pursuant to the procedures specified in paragraph (j)(2)(i)(C) of this section. Members participating in a special meeting telephonically or electronically will be deemed present in person for purposes of the quorum requirement in paragraph (j)(2)(v) of this section. For purposes of this paragraph, “voting capital” means FDIC-insured deposits as of the voting record date.

Notice specifying the date, time, and place of the annual or any special meeting and adequately describing any business to be conducted must be published for two successive weeks immediately prior to the week in which such meeting will convene in a newspaper of general circulation in the city or county in which the principal place of business of the association is located, or mailed postage prepaid at least 15 days and not more than 45 days prior to the date on which such meeting will convene to each of its members of record. A similar notice must be posted in a conspicuous place in each of the offices of the association during the 14 days immediately preceding the date on which such meeting will convene. The bylaws may permit a member to waive in writing any right to receive personal delivery of the notice. When any meeting is adjourned for 30 days or more, notice of the adjournment and reconvening of the meeting must be given as in the case of the original meeting.
(iv)
Fixing of record date.
The bylaws must provide for the fixing of a record date and a method for determining from the books of the association the members entitled to vote. Such date may not be more than 60 days nor fewer than 10 days prior to the date on which the action, requiring such determination of members, is to be taken. The same determination must apply to any adjourned meeting.
(v)
Member quorum.
Any number of members present and voting, represented in person or by proxy, at a regular or special meeting of the members constitutes a quorum. A majority of all votes cast at any meeting of the members determines any question, unless otherwise required by regulation. At any adjourned meeting, any business may be transacted that might have been transacted at the meeting as originally called. Members present at a duly constituted meeting may continue to transact business until adjournment.
(vi)
Voting by proxy.
Procedures must be established for voting at any annual or special meeting of the members by proxy pursuant to the rules and regulations of the OCC. Proxies may be given telephonically or electronically as long as the holder uses a procedure for verifying the identity of the member. All proxies with a term greater than eleven months or solicited at the expense of the association must run to the board of directors as a whole, or to a committee appointed by a majority of such board.
(vii)
Communications between members.
Provisions relating to communications between members must be consistent with § 144.8 of this chapter. No member, however, may have the right to inspect or copy any portion of any books or records of a Federal mutual savings association containing:
(A) A list of depositors in or borrowers from such association;
(B) Their addresses;
(C) Individual deposit or loan balances or records; or
(D) Any data from which such information could be reasonably constructed.
(viii)
Number of directors, membership.
The bylaws must set forth a specific number of directors, not a range. The number of directors may not be fewer than five nor more than fifteen, unless a higher or lower number has been authorized by the OTS prior to July 21, 2011 or by the OCC. Each director of the association must be a member of the association. Directors may be elected for periods of one to three years and until their successors are elected and qualified, but if a staggered board is chosen, provision must be made for the election of approximately one-third or one-half of the board each year, as appropriate. State-chartered savings banks converting to Federal savings banks may include alternative provisions for the election and term of office of directors so long as such provisions are authorized by the OCC, and provide for compliance with the standard provisions of this paragraph no later than six years after the conversion to a Federal savings association.
(ix)
Meetings of the board.
The board of directors determines the place, frequency, time, procedure for notice, which must be at least 24 hours unless waived by the directors, and waiver of notice for all regular and special meetings. The board also may permit telephonic or electronic participation at meetings. The bylaws may provide for
action to be taken without a meeting if unanimous written consent is obtained for such action. A majority of the authorized directors constitutes a quorum for the transaction of business. The act of a majority of the directors present at any meeting at which there is a quorum will be the act of the board.
(x)
Officers, employees and agents.
(A) The bylaws must contain provisions regarding the officers of the association, their functions, duties, and powers. The officers of the association must consist of a president, one or more vice presidents, a secretary, and a treasurer or comptroller, each of whom must be elected annually by the board of directors. Such other officers and assistant officers and agents as may be deemed necessary may be elected or appointed by the board of directors or chosen in such other manner as may be prescribed in the bylaws. Any two or more offices may be held by the same person, except the offices of president and secretary.
(B) Any officer may be removed by the board of directors with or without cause, but such removal, other than for cause, must be without prejudice to the contractual rights, if any, of the person so removed. Termination for cause, for purposes of this section and § 5.22, includes termination because of the person's personal dishonesty; incompetence; willful misconduct; breach of fiduciary duty involving personal profit; intentional failure to perform stated duties; willful violation of any law, rule, or regulation (other than traffic violations or similar offenses) or final cease and desist order; or material breach of any provision of an employment contract.
(xi)
Vacancies, resignation or removal of directors.
In the event of a vacancy on the board, the board of directors may, by its affirmative vote, fill such vacancy, even if the remaining directors constitute less than a quorum. A director elected to fill a vacancy may serve only until the next election of directors by the members. The bylaws must set out the procedure for the resignation of a director. Directors may be removed only for cause, as defined in paragraph (j)(2)(x)(B) of this section, by a vote of the holders of a majority of the shares then entitled to vote at an election of directors.
(xii)
Powers of the board.
The board of directors has the power to exercise any and all of the powers of the association not expressly reserved by the charter to the members.
(xiii)
Nominations for directors.
The bylaws must provide that nominations for directors may be made at the annual meeting by any member and must be voted upon, except, however, the bylaws may require that nominations by a member must be submitted to the secretary and then prominently posted in the principal place of business at least 10 days prior to the date of the annual meeting. However, if such provision is made for prior submission of nominations by a member, then the bylaws must provide for a nominating committee, which, except in the case of a nominee substituted as a result of death or other incapacity, must submit nominations to the secretary and have such nominations similarly posted at least 15 days prior to the date of the annual meeting.
(xiv)
New business.
The bylaws must provide procedures for the introduction of new business at the annual meeting.
(xv)
Amendment.
Bylaws may include any provision for their amendment that would be consistent with applicable law, rules, and regulations and adequately addresses its subject and purpose.
(A) Amendments will be effective:
(
1
) After approval by a majority vote of the authorized board, or by a majority of the vote cast by the members of the association at a legal meeting; and
(
2
) After receipt of any applicable regulatory approval.
(B) When an association fails to meet its quorum requirement, solely due to vacancies on the board, the bylaws may be amended by an affirmative vote of a majority of the sitting board.
(xvi)
Miscellaneous.
The bylaws also may address any other subjects necessary or appropriate for effective operation of the association.
(3)

A Federal mutual association may elect to follow the corporate governance provisions of the laws of any State in which the home office or any branch of the association is located, provided that such provisions are not inconsistent with applicable Federal statutes, regulations, and safety and soundness, and such provisions are not of the type described in paragraph (j)(3)(i)(B) of this section. If this election is selected, a Federal mutual association must designate in its bylaws the provision or provisions from the body of law selected for its corporate governance provisions, and must submit a notice containing a copy of such bylaws, within 30 days after adoption. The notice must indicate, where not obvious, why the bylaw provisions meet the requirements stated in paragraph (j)(3)(i)(B) of this section.

# Federal Stock Charter
Section 1. Corporate title.
The full corporate title of the association is __.
Section 2. Office.
The home office is located in __ [city, state].
Section 3. Duration.
The duration of the association is perpetual.
Section 4. Purpose and powers.
The purpose of the association is to pursue any or all of the lawful objectives of a Federal savings association chartered under section 5 of the Home Owners' Loan Act and to exercise all of the express, implied, and incidental powers conferred thereby and by all acts amendatory thereof and supplemental thereto, subject to the Constitution and laws of the United States as they are now in effect, or as they may hereafter be amended, and subject to all lawful and applicable rules, regulations, and orders of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”).
Section 5. Capital stock.
The total number of shares of all classes of the capital stock that the association has the authority to issue is ____, all of which is common stock of par [or if no par is specified then shares have a stated] value of ____per share. The shares may be issued from time to time as authorized by the board of directors without the approval of its shareholders, except as otherwise provided in this Section 5 or to the extent that such approval is required by governing law, rule, or regulation. The consideration for the issuance of the shares must be paid in full before their issuance and may not be less than the par [or stated] value. Neither promissory notes nor future services may constitute payment or part payment for the issuance of shares of the association. The consideration for the shares must be cash, tangible or intangible property (to the extent direct investment in such property would be permitted to the association), labor, or services actually performed for the association, or any combination of the foregoing. In the absence of actual fraud in the transaction, the value of such property, labor, or services, as determined by the board of directors of the association, is conclusive. Upon payment of such consideration, such shares are deemed to be fully paid and nonassessable. In the case of a stock dividend, that part of the retained earnings of the association that is transferred to common stock or paid-in capital accounts upon the issuance of shares as a stock dividend is deemed to be the consideration for their issuance.
Except for shares issued in the initial organization of the association or in connection with the conversion of the association from the mutual to stock form of capitalization, no shares of capital stock (including shares issuable upon conversion, exchange, or exercise of other securities) may be issued, directly or indirectly, to officers, directors, or controlling persons of the association other than as part of a general public offering or as qualifying shares to a director, unless the issuance or the plan under which they would be issued has been approved by a majority of the total votes eligible to be cast at a legal meeting. The holders of the common stock exclusively possess all voting power. Each holder of shares of common stock is entitled to one vote for each share held by such holder, except as to the cumulation of votes for the election of directors, unless the charter provides that there will be no such cumulative voting. Subject to any provision for a liquidation account, in the event of any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the association, the holders of the common stock will be entitled, after payment or provision for payment of all debts and liabilities of the association, to receive the remaining assets of the association available for distribution, in cash or in kind. Each share of common stock must have the same relative rights as and be identical in all respects with all the other shares of common stock.
Section 6. Preemptive rights.
Holders of the capital stock of the association are not entitled to preemptive rights with respect to any shares of the association which may be issued.
Section 7. Directors.
The association will be under the direction of a board of directors. The authorized number of directors, as stated in the association's bylaws, may not be fewer than five nor more than fifteen except when a greater or lesser number is approved by the OCC.
Section 8. Amendment of charter.
Except as provided in Section 5, no amendment, addition, alteration, change or repeal of this charter may be made, unless such is proposed by the board of directors of the association, approved by the shareholders by a majority of the votes eligible to be cast at a legal meeting, unless a higher vote is otherwise required, and approved or preapproved by the OCC.

(B)
Amendments exempted from expedited review.

(ii)
Notice requirement.
No application under paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section is required if the amendment is contained within paragraphs (e) or (g) of this section. In such case, the Federal stock savings association must submit a notice with the charter amendment to the OCC within 30 days after adoption.

A Federal stock association may amend Section 5 of its charter to change the number of authorized shares of stock, the number of shares within each class of stock, and the par or stated value of such shares.
(4)
Capital stock.
A Federal stock association may amend its charter by revising Section 5 to read as follows:
Section 5. Capital stock.
The total number of shares of all classes of capital stock that the association has the authority to issue is ____, of which ____is common stock of par [or if no par value is specified the stated] value of ____per share and of which [list the number of each class of preferred and the par or if no par value is specified the stated value per share of each such class]. The shares may be issued from time to time as authorized by the board of directors without further approval of shareholders, except as otherwise provided in this Section 5 or to the extent that such approval is required by governing law, rule, or regulation. The consideration for the issuance of the shares must be paid in full before their issuance and may not be less than the par [or stated] value. Neither promissory notes nor future services may constitute payment or part payment for the issuance of shares of the association. The consideration for the shares must be cash, tangible or intangible property (to the extent direct investment in such property would be permitted), labor, or services actually performed for the association, or any combination of the foregoing. In the absence of actual fraud in the transaction, the value of such property, labor, or services, as determined by the board of directors of the association, will be conclusive. Upon payment of such consideration, such shares will be deemed to be fully paid and nonassessable. In the case of a stock dividend, that part of the retained earnings of the association that is transferred to common stock or paid-in capital accounts upon the issuance of shares as a stock dividend will be deemed to be the consideration for their issuance.
Except for shares issued in the initial organization of the association or in connection with the conversion of the association from the mutual to the stock form of capitalization, no shares of capital stock (including shares issuable upon conversion, exchange, or exercise of other securities) may be issued, directly or indirectly, to officers, directors, or controlling persons of the association other than as part of a general public offering or as qualifying shares to a director, unless their issuance or the plan under which they would be issued has been approved by a majority of the total votes eligible to be cast at a legal meeting.
Nothing contained in this Section 5 (or in any supplementary sections hereto) entitles the holders of any class of a series of capital stock to vote as a separate class or series or to more than one vote per share, except as to
the cumulation of votes for the election of directors, unless the charter otherwise provides that there will be no such cumulative voting:
Provided,
That this restriction on voting separately by class or series does not apply:
i. To any provision which would authorize the holders of preferred stock, voting as a class or series, to elect some members of the board of directors, less than a majority thereof, in the event of default in the payment of dividends on any class or series of preferred stock;
ii. To any provision that would require the holders of preferred stock, voting as a class or series, to approve the merger or consolidation of the association with another corporation or the sale, lease, or conveyance (other than by mortgage or pledge) of properties or business in exchange for securities of a corporation other than the association if the preferred stock is exchanged for securities of such other corporation:
Provided,
That no provision may require such approval for transactions undertaken with the assistance or pursuant to the direction of the OCC or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation;
iii. To any amendment which would adversely change the specific terms of any class or series of capital stock as set forth in this Section 5 (or in any supplementary sections hereto), including any amendment which would create or enlarge any class or series ranking prior thereto in rights and preferences. An amendment which increases the number of authorized shares of any class or series of capital stock, or substitutes the surviving association in a merger or consolidation for the association, is not considered to be such an adverse change.
A description of the different classes and series (if any) of the association's capital stock and a statement of the designations, and the relative rights, preferences, and limitations of the shares of each class of and series (if any) of capital stock are as follows:
A.
Common stock.
Except as provided in this Section 5 (or in any supplementary sections thereto) the holders of the common stock exclusively possess all voting power. Each holder of shares of the common stock is entitled to one vote for each share held by each holder, except as to the cumulation of votes for the election of directors, unless the charter otherwise provides that there will be no such cumulative voting.
Whenever there has been paid, or declared and set aside for payment, to the holders of the outstanding shares of any class of stock having preference over the common stock as to the payment of dividends, the full amount of dividends and of sinking fund, retirement fund, or other retirement payments, if any, to which such holders are respectively entitled in preference to the common stock, then dividends may be paid on the common stock and on any class or series of stock entitled to participate therewith as to dividends out of any assets legally available for the payment of dividends.
In the event of any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the association, the holders of the common stock (and the holders of any class or series of stock entitled to participate with the common stock in the distribution of assets) will be entitled to receive, in cash or in kind, the assets of the association available for distribution remaining after: (i) Payment or provision for payment of the association's debts and liabilities; (ii) distributions or provision for distributions in settlement of its liquidation account; and (iii) distributions or provision for distributions to holders of any class or series of stock having preference over the common stock in the liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the association. Each share of common stock will have the same relative rights as and be identical in all respects with all the other shares of common stock.
B.
Preferred stock.
The association may provide in supplementary sections to its charter for one or more classes of preferred stock, which must be separately identified. The shares of any class may be divided into and issued in series, with each series separately designated so as to distinguish the shares thereof from the shares of all other series and classes. The terms of each series must be set forth in a supplementary section to the charter. All shares of the same class must be identical except as to the following relative rights and preferences, as to which there may be variations between different series:
a. The distinctive serial designation and the number of shares constituting such series;
b. The dividend rate or the amount of dividends to be paid on the shares of such series, whether dividends are cumulative and, if so, from which date(s), the payment date(s) for dividends, and the participating or other special rights, if any, with respect to dividends;
c. The voting powers, full or limited, if any, of shares of such series;
d. Whether the shares of such series are redeemable and, if so, the price(s) at which, and the terms and conditions on which, such shares may be redeemed;
e. The amount(s) payable upon the shares of such series in the event of voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the association;
f. Whether the shares of such series are entitled to the benefit of a sinking or retirement fund to be applied to the purchase or redemption of such shares, and if so entitled, the amount of such fund and the manner of its application, including the price(s) at which such shares may be redeemed or purchased through the application of such fund;
g. Whether the shares of such series are convertible into, or exchangeable for, shares
of any other class or classes of stock of the association and, if so, the conversion price(s) or the rate(s) of exchange, and the adjustments thereof, if any, at which such conversion or exchange may be made, and any other terms and conditions of such conversion or exchange.
h. The price or other consideration for which the shares of such series are issued; and
i. Whether the shares of such series which are redeemed or converted have the status of authorized but unissued shares of serial preferred stock and whether such shares may be reissued as shares of the same or any other series of serial preferred stock.
Each share of each series of serial preferred stock must have the same relative rights as and be identical in all respects with all the other shares of the same series.
The board of directors has authority to divide, by the adoption of supplementary charter sections, any authorized class of preferred stock into series, and, within the limitations set forth in this section and the remainder of this charter, fix and determine the relative rights and preferences of the shares of any series so established.
Prior to the issuance of any preferred shares of a series established by a supplementary charter section adopted by the board of directors, the association must file with the OCC a dated copy of that supplementary section of this charter established and designating the series and fixing and determining the relative rights and preferences thereof.
(5)
Limitations on subsequent issuances.
A Federal stock association may amend its charter to require shareholder approval of the issuance or reservation of common stock or securities convertible into common stock under circumstances which would require shareholder approval under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange if the shares were then listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
(6)
Cumulative voting.
A Federal stock association may amend its charter by substituting the following sentence for the second sentence in the third paragraph of Section 5: “Each holder of shares of common stock will be entitled to one vote for each share held by such holder and there will be no right to cumulate votes in an election of directors.”
(7)
Anti-takeover provisions following mutual to stock conversion.
Notwithstanding the law of the State in which the association is located, a Federal stock association may amend its charter by renumbering existing sections as appropriate and adding a new section 8 as follows:
Section 8. Certain Provisions Applicable for Five Years.
Notwithstanding anything contained in the Association's charter or bylaws to the contrary, for a period of [specify number of years up to five] years from the date of completion of the conversion of the Association from mutual to stock form, the following provisions will apply:
A.
Beneficial Ownership Limitation.
No person may directly or indirectly offer to acquire or acquire the beneficial ownership of more than 10 percent of any class of an equity security of the association. This limitation does not apply to a transaction in which the association forms a holding company without change in the respective beneficial ownership interests of its stockholders other than pursuant to the exercise of any dissenter and appraisal rights, the purchase of shares by underwriters in connection with a public offering, or the purchase of less than 25 percent of a class of stock by a tax-qualified employee stock benefit plan as defined in 12 CFR 192.25.
In the event shares are acquired in violation of this section 8, all shares beneficially owned by any person in excess of 10 percent will be considered “excess shares” and will not be counted as shares entitled to vote and may not be voted by any person or counted as voting shares in connection with any matters submitted to the stockholders for a vote.
For purposes of this section 8, the following definitions apply:
1. The term “person” includes an individual, a group acting in concert, a corporation, a partnership, an association, a joint stock company, a trust, an unincorporated organization or similar company, a syndicate or any other group formed for the purpose of acquiring, holding or disposing of the equity securities of the association.
2. The term “offer” includes every offer to buy or otherwise acquire, solicitation of an offer to sell, tender offer for, or request or invitation for tenders of, a security or interest in a security for value.
3. The term “acquire” includes every type of acquisition, whether effected by purchase, exchange, operation of law or otherwise.
4. The term “acting in concert” means (a) knowing participation in a joint activity or parallel action towards a common goal of acquiring control whether or not pursuant to an express agreement, or (b) a combination or pooling of voting or other interests in the securities of an issuer for a common purpose pursuant to any contract, understanding, relationship, agreement or other arrangement, whether written or otherwise.
B.
Cumulative Voting Limitation.
Stockholders may not cumulate their votes for election of directors.
C.
Call for Special Meetings.
Special meetings of stockholders relating to changes in control of the association or amendments to its charter may be called only upon direction of the board of directors.
(h)
Anti-takeover provisions.
The OCC may grant approval to a charter amendment not listed in paragraph (g) of this section regarding the acquisition by any person or persons of its equity securities provided that the association files as part of its application pursuant to paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section an opinion, acceptable to the OCC, of counsel independent from the association that the proposed charter provision would be permitted to be adopted by a corporation chartered by the State in which the principal office of the association is located. Any such provision must be consistent with applicable statutes, regulations, and OCC policies. Further, any such provision that would have the effect of rendering more difficult a change in control of the association and would require for any corporate action (other than the removal of directors) the affirmative vote of a larger percentage of shareholders than is required by this part, may not be effective unless adopted by a percentage of shareholder vote at least equal to the highest percentage that would be required to take any action under such provision.
(i)
Reissuance of charter.
A Federal stock association that has amended its charter may apply to have its charter, including the amendments, reissued by the OCC. Such requests for reissuance should be filed with the appropriate OCC licensing office, and contain signatures required in the form “Federal Stock Charter” in paragraph (e) of this section, together with such supporting documents as needed to demonstrate that the amendments were properly adopted.
(j)
Bylaws for Federal stock savings associations
—(1)
In general.
Bylaws may be adopted, amended or repealed by either a majority of the votes cast by the shareholders at a legal meeting or a majority of the board of directors. A bylaw provision inconsistent with paragraph (k), (l), (m) or (n) of this section may be adopted only with the approval of the OCC.
(2)
Form of filing

Except as provided in paragraph (j)(2)(i)(B) of this section, the bylaw amendment will be deemed approved as of the 30th day after filing, unless the OCC notifies the filer that the application is denied or that the amendment contains procedures of the type described in paragraph (j)(2)(i)(B) of this section and is not eligible for expedited review, provided the association follows the requirements of its charter and bylaws in adopting the amendment.
(B)
Amendments exempted from expedited review.
Expedited review is not available for a bylaw amendment that would:
(
1
) Render more difficult or discourage a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest, the assumption of control by a holder of a large block of the association's stock, or the removal of incumbent management; or
(
2
) Be inconsistent with paragraphs (k) through (n) of this section, with applicable laws, rules, regulations or the association's charter or involve a significant issue of law or policy, including indemnification, conflicts of interest, and limitations on director or officer liability.
(ii)
Corporate governance election and notice requirement.
A Federal stock association may elect to follow the corporate governance provisions of: The laws of any State in which the home office or any branch of the association is located; the laws of any State in which a holding company of the association is incorporated or chartered; Delaware General Corporation law; or the Model Business Corporation Act, provided that such provisions may be elected to the extent not inconsistent with applicable Federal statutes and regulations and safety and soundness, and such provisions are not of the type described in paragraph (j)(2)(i)(B) of this section. If this election is selected,
a Federal stock association must designate in its bylaws the provision or provisions from the body or bodies of law selected for its corporate governance provisions, and must file a notice containing a copy of such bylaws, within 30 days after adoption. The notice must indicate, where not obvious, why the bylaw provisions meet the requirements stated in paragraph (j)(2)(i)(B) of this section. A Federal stock savings association that has elected to follow the corporate governance provisions of the law of the State in which its holding company is incorporated may continue to use those provisions even if the association is no longer controlled by that holding company.
(iii)
No filing required.
No filing is required for purposes of paragraph (j)(2) of this section if a bylaw amendment adopts the language of the OCC's model or optional bylaws without change.
(3)
Effectiveness.
A bylaw amendment is effective after approval by the OCC, if required, and adoption by the association, provided that the association follows the requirements of its charter and bylaws in adopting the amendment.

Effect of subsequent charter or bylaw change.
Notwithstanding any subsequent change to its charter or bylaws, the authority of a Federal savings association to engage in any transaction is determined only by the association's charter or bylaws then in effect.
(k)
Shareholders of Federal stock savings associations
—(1)
Shareholder meetings
—(i)
In general.
A meeting of the shareholders of the association for the election of directors and for the transaction of any other business of the association must be held annually within 150 days after the end of the association's fiscal year. Unless otherwise provided in the association's charter, special meetings of the shareholders may be called by the board of directors or on the request of the holders of 10 percent or more of the shares entitled to vote at the meeting, or by such other persons as may be specified in the bylaws of the association.
(ii)
Location of shareholder meetings
—(A)
In general.
All annual and special meetings of shareholders of the association may be held at any convenient place the board of directors may designate. The association's bylaws may provide for the telephonic or electronic participation of shareholders in these meetings. Shareholders participating in an annual or special meeting telephonically or electronically will be deemed present in person for purposes of the quorum requirement in paragraph (k)(5) of this section.
(B)
Procedures for telephonic or electronic participation.
If the association's bylaws provide for telephonic or electronic participation in shareholder meetings, the association must elect to follow corporate governance provisions for these meetings pursuant to paragraph (j)(2)(ii) of this section that include procedures for telephonic or electronic participation in shareholder meetings. The association must indicate the use of these elected procedures in its bylaws.
(2)
Notice of shareholder meetings.
Written notice stating the place, day, and hour of the meeting and the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called must be delivered not fewer than 20 nor more than 50 days before the date of the meeting, either personally or by mail, by or at the direction of the chair of the board, the president, the secretary, or the directors, or other persons calling the meeting, to each shareholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting. If mailed, such notice will be deemed to be delivered when deposited in the mail, addressed to the shareholder at the address appearing on the stock transfer books or records of the association as of the record date prescribed in paragraph (k)(3) of this section, with postage thereon prepaid. When any shareholders' meeting, either annual or special, is adjourned for 30 days or more, notice of the adjourned meeting must be given as in the case of an original meeting. Notwithstanding anything in this section, however, a Federal stock association that is wholly owned is not subject to the shareholder notice requirement.
(3)
Fixing of record date.
For the purpose of determining shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any
meeting of shareholders or any adjournment thereof, or shareholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend, or in order to make a determination of shareholders for any other proper purpose, the board of directors must fix in advance a date as the record date for any such determination of shareholders. Such date in any case may not be more than 60 days and, in case of a meeting of shareholders, not less than 10 days prior to the date on which the particular action, requiring such determination of shareholders, is to be taken. When a determination of shareholders entitled to vote at any meeting of shareholders has been made as provided in this section, such determination will apply to any adjournment thereof.
(4)
Voting lists.
(i) At least 20 days before each meeting of the shareholders, the officer or agent having charge of the stock transfer books for the shares of the association must make a complete list of the stockholders of record entitled to vote at such meeting, or any adjournments thereof, arranged in alphabetical order, with the address and the number of shares held by each. This list of shareholders must be kept on file at the home office of the association and is subject to inspection by any shareholder of record or the stockholder's agent during the entire time of the meeting. The original stock transfer book will constitute
prima facie
evidence of the stockholders entitled to examine such list or transfer books or to vote at any meeting of stockholders. Notwithstanding anything in this section, however, a Federal stock association that is wholly owned is not subject to the voting list requirements.
(ii) In lieu of making the shareholders list available for inspection by any shareholders as provided in paragraph (k)(4)(i) of this section, the board of directors may perform such acts as required by paragraphs (a) and (b) of Rule 14a-7 of the General Rules and Regulations under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (17 CFR 240.14a-7) as may be duly requested in writing, with respect to any matter which may be properly considered at a meeting of shareholders, by any shareholder who is entitled to vote on such matter and who must defray the reasonable expenses to be incurred by the association in performance of the act or acts required.
(5)
Shareholder quorum.
A majority of the outstanding shares of the association entitled to vote, represented in person or by proxy, constitutes a quorum at a meeting of shareholders. The shareholders present at a duly organized meeting may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough shareholders to leave less than a quorum. If a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of the majority of the shares represented at the meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter will be the act of the stockholders, unless the vote of a greater number of stockholders voting together or voting by classes is required by law or the charter. Directors, however, are elected by a plurality of the votes cast at an election of directors.
(6)
Shareholder voting
—(i)
Proxies.
Unless otherwise provided in the association's charter, at all meetings of shareholders, a shareholder may vote in person or by proxy executed in writing by the shareholder or by a duly authorized attorney in fact. Proxies may be given telephonically or electronically as long as the holder uses a procedure for verifying the identity of the shareholder. Proxies solicited on behalf of the management must be voted as directed by the shareholder or, in the absence of such direction, as determined by a majority of the board of directors. No proxy maybe valid more than eleven months from the date of its execution except for a proxy coupled with an interest.
(ii)
Shares controlled by association.
Neither treasury shares of its own stock held by the association nor shares held by another corporation, if a majority of the shares entitled to vote for the election of directors of such other corporation are held by the association, may be voted at any meeting or counted in determining the total number of outstanding shares at any given time for purposes of any meeting.
(7)
Nominations and new business submitted by shareholders.
Nominations for directors and new business submitted by shareholders must be voted upon at
the annual meeting if such nominations or new business are submitted in writing and delivered to the secretary of the association at least five days prior to the date of the annual meeting. Ballots bearing the names of all the persons nominated must be provided for use at the annual meeting.
(8)
Informal action by stockholders.
If the bylaws of the association so provide, any action required to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders, or any other action that may be taken at a meeting of the stockholders, may be taken without a meeting if consent in writing has been given by all the stockholders entitled to vote with respect to the subject matter.
(l)
Board of directors
—(1)
General powers and duties.
The business and affairs of the association must be under the direction of its board of directors. Directors need not be stockholders unless the bylaws so require.
(2)
Number and term.
The bylaws must set forth a specific number of directors, not a range. The number of directors may not be fewer than five nor more than fifteen, unless a higher or lower number has been authorized by the OTS prior to July 21, 2011 or the OCC. Directors must be elected for a term of one to three years and until their successors are elected and qualified. If a staggered board is chosen, the directors must be divided into two or three classes as nearly equal in number as possible and one class must be elected by ballot annually.
(3)
Regular meetings.
The board of directors determines the place, frequency, time and procedure for notice of regular meetings. The bylaws may provide for telephonic or electronic participation at these meetings.
(4)
Quorum.
A majority of the number of directors constitutes a quorum for the transaction of business at any meeting of the board of directors. The act of the majority of the directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is present will be the act of the board of directors, unless a greater number is prescribed by regulation of the OCC.
(5)
Vacancies.
Any vacancy occurring in the board of directors may be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors even with less than a quorum of the board of directors. A director elected to fill a vacancy may serve only until the next election of directors by the shareholders. Any directorship to be filled by reason of an increase in the number of directors may be filled by election by the board of directors for a term of office continuing only until the next election of directors by the shareholders.
(6)
Removal or resignation of directors.
(i) At a meeting of shareholders called expressly for that purpose, any director may be removed only for cause, as termination for cause is defined in § 5.21(j)(2)(x)(B), by a vote of the holders of a majority of the shares then entitled to vote at an election of directors. Associations may provide for procedures regarding resignations in the bylaws.
(ii) If less than the entire board is to be removed, no one of the directors may be removed if the votes cast against the removal would be sufficient to elect a director if then cumulatively voted at an election of the class of directors of which such director is a part.
(iii) Whenever the holders of the shares of any class are entitled to elect one or more directors by the provisions of the charter or supplemental sections thereto, the provisions of this section apply, in respect to the removal of a director or directors so elected, to the vote of the holders of the outstanding shares of that class and not to the vote of the outstanding shares as a whole.
(7)
Executive and other committees.
The board of directors, by resolution adopted by a majority of the full board, may designate from among its members an executive committee and one or more other committees. No committee may have the authority of the board of directors with reference to: The declaration of dividends; the amendment of the charter or bylaws of the association; recommending to the stockholders a plan of merger, consolidation, or conversion; the sale, lease, or other disposition of all, or substantially all, of the property and assets of the association otherwise than in the usual and regular course of its business; a voluntary dissolution of the association; a revocation of any of the foregoing; or the approval of a transaction in which
any member of the executive committee, directly or indirectly, has any material beneficial interest. The designation of any committee and the delegation of authority thereto does not operate to relieve the board of directors, or any director, of any responsibility imposed by law or regulation.
(8)
Notice of special meetings.
Written notice of at least 24 hours regarding any special meeting of the board of directors or of any committee designated thereby must be given to each director in accordance with the bylaws, although such notice may be waived by the director. The attendance of a director at a meeting constitutes a waiver of notice of such meeting, except where a director attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any meeting need be specified in the notice or waiver of notice of such meeting. The bylaws may provide for telephonic or electronic participation at a special meeting.
(9)
Action without a meeting.
Any action required or permitted to be taken by the board of directors at a meeting may be taken without a meeting if a consent in writing, setting forth the actions so taken, is signed by all of the directors.
(10)
Presumption of assent.
A director of the association who is present at a meeting of the board of directors at which action on any association matter is taken is presumed to have assented to the action taken unless their dissent or abstention is entered in the minutes of the meeting or unless a written dissent to such action is filed with the person acting as the secretary of the meeting before the adjournment thereof or is forwarded by registered mail to the secretary of the association within five days after the date on which a copy of the minutes of the meeting is received. Such right to dissent does not apply to a director who voted in favor of such action.
(11)
Age limitation on directors.
A Federal association may provide a bylaw on age limitation for directors. Bylaws on age limitations must comply with all Federal laws, rules and regulations.
(m)
Officers
—(1)
Positions.
The officers of the association must consist of a president, one or more vice presidents, a secretary, and a treasurer or comptroller, each of whom must be elected by the board of directors. The board of directors may also designate the chair of the board as an officer. The offices of the secretary and treasurer or comptroller may be held by the same person and the vice president may also be either the secretary or the treasurer or comptroller. The board of directors may designate one or more vice presidents as executive vice president or senior vice president.
(2)
Removal.
Any officer may be removed by the board of directors whenever in its judgment the best interests of the association will be served thereby; but such removal, other than for cause, as termination for cause is defined in § 5.21(j)(2)(x)(B), will be without prejudice to the contractual rights, if any, of the person so removed.
(3)
Age limitation on officers.
A Federal association may provide a bylaw on age limitation for officers. Bylaws on age limitations must comply with all Federal laws, rules, and regulations.
(n)
Certificates for shares and their transfer
—(1)
Certificates for shares.
Certificates representing shares of capital stock of the association must be in such form as determined by the board of directors and approved by the OCC. The name and address of the person to whom the shares are issued, with the number of shares and date of issue, must be entered on the stock transfer books of the association. All certificates surrendered to the association for transfer must be cancelled and no new certificate may be issued until the former certificate for a like number of shares has been surrendered and cancelled, except that in the case of a lost or destroyed certificate a new certificate may be issued upon such terms and indemnity to the association as the board of directors may prescribe.
(2)
Transfer of shares.
Transfer of shares of capital stock of the association may be made only on its stock transfer books. Authority for such transfer may be given only by the holder of record or by a legal representative, who must furnish proper evidence of such authority, or by an attorney
authorized by a duly executed power of attorney and filed with the association. The transfer may be made only on surrender for cancellation of the certificate for the shares. The person in whose name shares of capital stock stand on the books of the association is deemed by the association to be the owner for all purposes.

(b)
Scope.
(1) This section describes procedures and standards governing OCC review and approval of an application by a mutual depository institution to convert to a Federal mutual savings association or an application by a stock depository institution to convert to a Federal stock savings association.

(c)
Licensing requirements.
A depository institution that is mutual in form (“mutual depository institution”) must submit an application and obtain prior OCC approval to convert to a Federal mutual savings association. A stock depository institution must submit an application and obtain prior OCC approval to convert to a Federal stock savings association.

Conversion of a mutual depository institution or a stock depository institution to a Federal savings association
—(1)
Policy.
Consistent with the OCC's chartering policy, it is OCC policy to allow conversion to a Federal savings association charter by another financial institution that can operate safely and soundly as a Federal savings association in compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and policies. This includes consideration of the factors set out in section 5(e) of the Home Owners' Loan Act, 12 U.S.C. 1464(e). The converting financial institution must obtain all necessary regulatory and shareholder or member approvals. The OCC may deny an application by any mutual depository institution or stock depository institution to convert to a Federal mutual savings association charter or Federal stock association charter, respectively, on the basis of the standards for denial set forth in § 5.13(b) or when conversion would permit the filer to escape supervisory action by its current regulators.
(2)
Procedures
—(i)
Prefiling communications.
The filer should consult with the appropriate OCC licensing office prior to filing if it anticipates that its application will raise unusual or complex issues. If a prefiling meeting is appropriate, it will normally be held in the OCC licensing office where the application will be filed, but may be held at another location at the request of the filer.
(ii)

(iii) The OCC may permit a Federal savings association to retain nonconforming assets of a converting institution for the time period prescribed by the OCC following a conversion, subject to conditions and an OCC determination of the carrying value of the retained assets consistent with the requirements of section 5(c) of the Home Owners' Loan Act (12 U.S.C. 1464(c)) relating to loans and investments. The OCC may permit a Federal savings association to continue nonconforming activities of a converting institution for the time period prescribed by the OCC following a conversion, subject to conditions.
(iv) The OCC may require directors and senior executive officers of the converting institution to submit the Interagency Biographical and Financial Report, available at

Exceptions to rules of general applicability.
Sections 5.8, 5.10, and 5.11 do not apply to this section. However, if the OCC concludes that an application presents significant or novel policy, supervisory, or legal issues, the OCC may
determine that any or all parts of §§ 5.8, 5.10, and 5.11 apply.

Expedited review.
An application by an eligible bank to convert to a Federal savings association charter is deemed approved by the OCC as of the 45th day after the filing is received by the OCC, unless the OCC notifies the filer prior to that date that the filing has been removed from expedited review, or the expedited review process is extended, under § 5.13(a)(2).

In addition to the rules and procedures set forth in paragraph (d) of this section, a filer converting from a mutual depository institution to a Federal mutual savings association must comply with the following: After a Federal charter is issued to a converting institution, the association's members must after due notice, or upon a valid adjournment of a previous legal meeting, hold a meeting to elect directors and take care of all other actions necessary to fully effectuate the conversion and operate the association in accordance with law and these rules and regulations. Immediately thereafter, the board of directors must meet, elect officers, and transact any other appropriate business.
(f)
Conversion of a national bank to a Federal stock savings association—supplemental rules
—(1)
Additional procedures.

The appropriate OCC licensing office provides instructions to the converting national bank for terminating its status as a national bank and beginning its status as a Federal savings association.
(g)
Continuation of business and entity.
The existence of the converting institution continues in the resulting Federal savings association. The resulting Federal savings association is considered the same business and entity as the converting institution, although as to rights, powers, and duties, the resulting Federal savings association is a Federal savings association. Any and all of the assets and other property (whether real, personal, mixed, tangible or intangible, including choses in action, rights, and credits) of the converting institution become assets and property of the resulting Federal savings association when the conversion occurs. Similarly, any and all of the obligations and debts of and claims against the converting institution become obligations and debts of and claims against the Federal savings association when the conversion occurs.

§ 5.26
Fiduciary powers of national banks and Federal savings associations.
(a)
Authority.
12 U.S.C. 92a, 1462a, 1463, 1464(n), and 5412(b)(2)(B).
(b)
Licensing requirements.
A national bank or Federal savings association must submit an application and obtain prior approval from, or in certain circumstances file a notice with, the OCC in order to exercise fiduciary powers. No approval or notice is required in the following circumstances:
(1) Where two or more national banks consolidate or merge, and any of the national banks has, prior to the consolidation or merger, received OCC approval to exercise fiduciary powers and that approval is in force at the time of the consolidation or merger, the resulting national bank may exercise fiduciary powers in the same manner and to the same extent as the national bank to which approval was originally granted;
(2) Where two or more Federal savings associations consolidate or merge, and any of the Federal savings associations has, prior to the consolidation or merger, received approval from the OCC or the OTS to exercise fiduciary powers and that approval is in force at the time of the consolidation or merger, the resulting Federal savings association may exercise fiduciary powers in the same manner and to the same extent as the Federal savings association to which approval was originally granted;
(3) Where a national bank with prior OCC approval to exercise fiduciary
powers is the resulting bank in a merger or consolidation with a State bank, State savings association, or Federal savings association and the national bank will exercise fiduciary powers in the same manner and to the same extent to which approval was originally granted; and
(4) Where a Federal savings association with prior approval from the OCC or the OTS to exercise fiduciary powers is the resulting savings association in a merger or consolidation with a State bank, State savings association, or national bank and the Federal savings association will exercise fiduciary powers in the same manner and to the same extent to which approval was originally granted.
(c)
Scope.
This section sets forth the procedures governing OCC review and approval of an application, and in certain cases the filing of a notice, by a national bank or Federal savings association to exercise fiduciary powers. Fiduciary activities of national banks are subject to the provisions of 12 CFR part 9. Fiduciary activities of Federal savings associations are subject to the provisions of 12 CFR part 150.
(d)
Policy.
The exercise of fiduciary powers is primarily a management decision of the national bank or Federal savings association. The OCC generally permits a national bank or Federal savings association to exercise fiduciary powers if the bank or savings association is operating in a satisfactory manner, the proposed activities comply with applicable statutes and regulations, and the bank or savings association retains qualified fiduciary management.

Expedited review.
An application by an eligible bank or eligible savings association to exercise fiduciary powers is deemed approved by the OCC as of the 30th day after the application is received by the OCC, unless the OCC notifies the bank or savings association prior to that date that the filing has been removed from expedited review, or the expedited review process is extended, under § 5.13(a)(2).
(4)
Permit.
Approval of an application under this section constitutes a permit under 12 U.S.C. 92a for national banks and 12 U.S.C. 1464(n) for Federal savings associations to conduct the fiduciary powers requested in the application.

(7)
Exceptions to rules of general applicability.
Sections 5.8, 5.10, and 5.11 do not apply to this section. However, if the OCC concludes that an application presents significant or novel policy, supervisory, or legal issues, the OCC may determine that any or all parts of §§ 5.8, 5.10, and 5.11 apply.
(8)
Expiration of approval.
Approval expires if a national bank or Federal
savings association does not commence fiduciary activities within 18 months from the date of approval, unless the OCC grants an extension of time.

This section describes the procedures and standards governing OCC review and approval of an application by a national bank to establish a new branch or to relocate a branch.
(2)
Branch established through a conversion or business combination.
The standards of this section governing review and approval of applications by the OCC and, as applicable, 12 U.S.C. 36(b), but not the application procedures set forth in this section, apply to branches acquired or retained in a conversion approved under § 5.24 or a business combination approved under § 5.33. A branch acquired or retained in a conversion or business combination is subject to the application procedures set forth in § 5.24 or § 5.33.
(d)
Definitions
—(1)
Branch
includes any branch bank, branch office, branch agency, additional office, or any branch place of business established by a national bank in the United States or its territories at which deposits are received, checks paid, or money lent.
(i) A branch established by a national bank includes a seasonal agency described in 12 U.S.C. 36(c), a mobile facility, a temporary facility, or an intermittent facility.
(ii) A facility otherwise described in this paragraph (d)(1) is not a branch if:
(A) The bank establishing the facility does not permit members of the public to have physical access to the facility for purposes of making deposits, paying checks, or borrowing money (
e.g.,
an office established by the bank that receives deposits only through the mail); or
(B) It is located at the site of, or is an extension of, an approved main office or branch office of the national bank. The OCC determines whether a facility is an extension of an existing main office or branch office on a case-by-case basis. For this purpose, the OCC will consider a drive-in or pedestrian facility located within 500 feet of a public entrance to an existing main office or branch office to be an extension of the existing main office or branch office, provided the functions performed at the drive-in or pedestrian facility are limited to functions that are ordinarily performed at a teller window.
(iii) A branch does not include a remote service unit (RSU) as described in 12 CFR 7.1027. This encompasses RSUs that are automated teller machines (ATMs), including interactive ATMs. A branch also does not include a loan production office, a deposit production office, a trust office, an administrative office, a data processing office, or any other office that does not engage in at least one of the activities in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
(2)
Home State
means the State in which the national bank's main office is located.

Intermittent branch
means a branch that is operated by a national bank for one or more limited periods of time to provide branch banking services at a specified recurring event, on the grounds or premises where the event is held or at a fixed site adjacent to the grounds or premises where the event is held, and exclusively during the occurrence of the event. Examples of an intermittent branch include the operation of a branch on the campus of, or at a fixed site adjacent to the campus of, a specific college during school registration periods; or the operation of a branch during a State fair on State fairgrounds or at a fixed site adjacent to the fairgrounds.
(4)
Messenger service
has the meaning set forth in 12 CFR 7.1012.
(5)
Mobile branch
is a branch of a national bank, other than a messenger service branch, that does not have a single, permanent site, and includes a vehicle that travels to various public
locations to enable customers to conduct their banking business. A mobile branch may provide services at various regularly scheduled locations or it may be open at irregular times and locations such as at county fairs, sporting events, or school registration periods. A mobile branch may be stationed continuously at a single location within the geographic area it is approved to serve for a period of up to four months. A branch license is needed for each mobile unit.
(6)
Temporary branch
means a branch of a national bank that is located at a fixed site and which, from the time of its opening, is scheduled to, and will, permanently close no later than a certain date (not longer than one year after the branch is first opened) specified in the branch application and the public notice.
(e)
Policy.
In determining whether to approve an application to establish or relocate a branch, the OCC is guided by the following principles:
(1) Maintaining a safe and sound banking system;
(2) Encouraging a national bank to provide fair access to financial services by helping to meet the credit needs of its entire community;
(3) Ensuring compliance with laws and regulations; and
(4) Promoting fair treatment of customers including efficiency and better service.

See
12 CFR 7.1012). Unless otherwise required by law, the bank need not list the specific locations to be served.
(3)
Jointly established branches.
If a national bank proposes to establish a branch jointly with one or more national banks or other depository institutions, only one of the national banks must submit a branch application. The national bank submitting the application may act as agent for all national banks in the group of depository institutions proposing to share the branch. The application must include the name and main office address of each national bank in the group.
(4)
Intermittent branches.
Prior to operating an intermittent branch, a national bank must file a branch application and publish notice in accordance with § 5.8, both of which must identify the event at which the branch will be operated; designate a location for operation of the branch which must be on the grounds or premises at which the event is held or on a fixed site adjacent to those grounds or premises; and specify the approximate time period during which the event will be held and during which the branch will operate, including whether operation of the branch will be on an annual or otherwise recurring basis. If the branch is approved, then the bank need not obtain approval each time it seeks to operate the branch in accordance with the original application and approval.
(5)
Authorization.
The OCC authorizes operation of the branch when all requirements and conditions for opening are satisfied.
(6)
Expedited review.
An application submitted by an eligible bank to establish or relocate a branch is deemed approved by the OCC as of the 15th day after the close of the applicable public comment period or the 45th day after the filing is received by the OCC (or in the case of a short-distance relocation the 30th day after the filing is received by the OCC), whichever is later, unless the OCC notifies the bank prior to that date that the filing has been removed from expedited review, or the expedited review process is extended, under § 5.13(a)(2).

A national bank that seeks to establish and operate a
de novo
branch in any State other than the bank's home State or a State in which the bank already has a branch must satisfy the standards and requirements of 12 U.S.C. 36(g).
(h)
Exceptions to rules of general applicability.
(1) A national bank filing an
application for a mobile branch or messenger service branch must publish a public notice, as described in § 5.8, in the communities in which the bank proposes to engage in business.
(2) The comment period on an application to engage in a short-distance relocation is 15 days.
(3) The OCC may waive or reduce the public notice and comment period, as appropriate, with respect to an application to establish a branch to restore banking services to a community affected by a disaster or to temporarily replace banking facilities where, because of an emergency, the bank cannot provide services or must curtail banking services.
(4) The OCC may waive or reduce the public notice and comment period, as appropriate, for an application by a national bank with a CRA rating of Satisfactory or better to establish a temporary branch which, if it were established by a State bank to operate in the manner proposed, would be permissible under State law without State approval.

Policy and related filing requirements
—(1)
Factors
—(i)
In general.
When the OCC evaluates any application for a business combination, the OCC considers the following factors:
(A) The capital level of any resulting national bank or Federal savings association;
(B) The conformity of the transaction to applicable law, regulation, and supervisory policies;
(C) The purpose of the transaction;
(D) The impact of the transaction on safety and soundness of the national bank or Federal savings association; and
(E) The effect of the transaction on the national bank's or Federal savings association's shareholders (or members in the case of a mutual savings association), depositors, other creditors, and customers.
(ii)
Bank Merger Act.
When the OCC evaluates an application for a business combination under the Bank Merger Act, the OCC also considers the following factors:
(A)
Competition.
(
1
) The OCC considers the effect of a proposed business combination on competition. The filer must provide a competitive analysis of the transaction, including a definition of the relevant geographic market or markets. A filer may refer to the Comptroller's Licensing Manual for procedures to expedite its competitive analysis.
(
2
) The OCC will deny an application for a business combination if the combination would result in a monopoly or would be in furtherance of any combination or conspiracy to monopolize or attempt to monopolize the business of banking in any part of the United States. The OCC also will deny any proposed business combination whose effect in any section of the United States may be substantially to lessen competition, or tend to create a monopoly, or which in any other manner would be in restraint of trade, unless the probable effects of the transaction in meeting the convenience and needs of the community clearly outweigh the anticompetitive effects of the transaction. For purposes of weighing against anticompetitive effects, a business combination may have favorable effects in meeting the convenience and needs of the community if the depository institution being acquired has limited long-term prospects, or if the resulting national bank or Federal savings association will provide significantly improved, additional, or less costly services to the community.
(B)
Financial and managerial resources and future prospects.
The OCC considers the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the existing or proposed institutions.
(C)
Convenience and needs of community.
The OCC considers the probable effects of the business combination on the convenience and needs of the community served. The filer must describe these effects in its application, including any planned office closings or reductions in services following the business combination and the likely impact on the community. The OCC also considers additional relevant factors, including the resulting national bank's or Federal savings association's ability and plans to provide expanded or less costly services to the community.
(D)
Money laundering.
The OCC considers the effectiveness of any insured depository institution involved in the business combination in combating money laundering activities, including in overseas branches.
(E)
Financial stability.
The OCC considers the risk to the stability of the United States banking and financial system.
(F)
Deposit concentration limit.
The OCC will not approve a transaction that would violate the deposit concentration limit in 12 U.S.C. 1828(c)(13) for interstate merger transactions, as defined in 12 U.S.C. 1828(c)(13)(C)(i).
(iii)
Community Reinvestment Act
—(A)
In General.
The OCC takes into account the filer's Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) record of performance in considering an application for a business combination. The OCC's conclusion of whether the CRA performance is or is not consistent with approval of
an application is considered in conjunction with the other factors of this section.
(B)
Interstate mergers under 12 U.S.C. 1831u.
The OCC considers the CRA record of performance of the filer and its resulting bank affiliates and the filer's record of compliance with applicable State community reinvestment laws when required by 12 U.S.C. 1831u(b)(3).
(C)
CRA Sunshine.
A filer must:
(
1
) Disclose whether it has entered into and disclosed a covered agreement, as defined in 12 CFR 35.2, in accordance with 12 CFR 35.6 and 35.7; and
(
2
) Provide summaries of, or documents relating to, all substantive discussions with respect to the development of the content of a covered agreement disclosed in (e)(1)(iii)(C)(
1
) that include the names of participants, dates, and synopsis of the discussions.
(iv)
Interstate mergers under 12 U.S.C. 1831u.
The OCC considers the standards and requirements contained in 12 U.S.C. 1831u for interstate merger transactions between insured banks, when applicable.
(2)
Acquisition and retention of branches.
A filer must disclose the location of any branch it will acquire and retain in a business combination, including approved but unopened branches. The OCC considers the acquisition and retention of a branch under the standards set out in § 5.30 or § 5.31, as applicable, but it does not require a separate application.
(3)
Subsidiaries.
(i) A filer must identify any subsidiary, financial subsidiary investment, bank service company investment, service corporation investment, or other equity investment to be acquired in a business combination and state the activities of each subsidiary or other company in which the filer would be acquiring an investment. The OCC does not require a separate application or notice under §§ 5.34, 5.35, 5.36, 5.38, 5.39, 5.58, and 5.59.
(ii) A national bank filer proposing to acquire, through a business combination, a subsidiary, financial subsidiary investment, bank service company investment, service corporation investment, or other equity investment of any entity other than a national bank must provide the same information and analysis of the subsidiary's activities, or of the investment, that would be required if the filer were establishing the subsidiary, or making such investment, pursuant to §§ 5.34, 5.35, 5.36, or 5.39.
(iii) A Federal savings association filer proposing to acquire, through a business combination, a subsidiary, bank service company investment, service corporation investment, or other equity investment of any entity other than a Federal savings association must provide the same information and analysis of the subsidiary's activities, or of the investment, that would be required if the filer were establishing the subsidiary, or making such investment, pursuant to §§ 5.35, 5.38, 5.58, or 5.59.
(4)
Interim national bank or interim Federal savings association
—(i)
Application.
A filer for a business combination that plans to use an interim national bank or interim Federal savings association to accomplish the transaction must file an application to organize an interim national bank or interim Federal savings association as part of the application for the related business combination.
(ii)
Conditional approval.
The OCC grants conditional preliminary approval to form an interim national bank or interim Federal savings association when it acknowledges receipt of the application for the related business combination.
(iii)
Corporate status.
An interim national bank or interim Federal savings association becomes a legal entity and may enter into legally valid agreements when it has filed, and the OCC has accepted, the interim national bank's duly executed articles of association and organization certificate or the Federal savings association's charter and bylaws. OCC acceptance occurs:
(A) On the date the OCC advises the interim national bank that its articles of association and organization certificate are acceptable or advises the interim Federal savings association that its charter and bylaws are acceptable; or
(B) On the date the interim national bank files articles of association and an organization certificate that conform to the form for those documents
provided by the OCC in the Comptroller's Licensing Manual or the date the interim Federal savings association files a charter and bylaws that conform to the requirements set out in this part 5.
(iv)
Other corporate procedures.
A filer should consult the Comptroller's Licensing Manual to determine what other information is necessary to complete the chartering of the interim national bank as a national bank or the interim Federal savings association as a Federal savings association.
(5)
Nonconforming assets.
(i) A filer must identify any nonconforming activities and assets, including nonconforming subsidiaries, of other institutions involved in the business combination that will not be disposed of or discontinued prior to consummation of the transaction. The OCC generally requires a national bank or Federal savings association to divest or conform nonconforming assets, or discontinue nonconforming activities, within a reasonable time following the business combination.
(ii) Any resulting Federal savings association must conform to the requirements of sections 5(c) and 10(m) of the Home Owners' Loan Act (12 U.S.C. 1464(c) and 1467a(m)) within the time period prescribed by the OCC.
(6)
Fiduciary powers.
(i) A filer must state whether the resulting national bank or Federal savings association intends to exercise fiduciary powers pursuant to § 5.26(b).
(ii) If a filer intends to exercise fiduciary powers after the combination and requires OCC approval for such powers, the filer must include the information required under § 5.26(e)(2).
(7)
Expiration of approval.
Approval of a business combination, and conditional approval to form an interim national bank or interim Federal savings association, if applicable, expires if the business combination is not consummated within six months after the date of OCC approval, unless the OCC grants an extension of time.
(8)
Adequacy of disclosure.
(i) A filer must inform shareholders of all material aspects of a business combination and must comply with any applicable requirements of the Federal securities laws and securities regulations of the OCC. Accordingly, a filer must ensure that all proxy and information statements prepared in connection with a business combination do not contain any untrue or misleading statement of a material fact, or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
(ii) A national bank or Federal savings association filer with one or more classes of securities subject to the registration provisions of section 12(b) or (g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. 78
l

—(1)
National bank or Federal savings association filer
—(i)
In general.
Sections 5.8, 5.10, and 5.11 do not apply to this section. However, if the OCC concludes that an application presents significant or novel policy, supervisory, or legal issues, the OCC may determine that some or all provisions in §§ 5.8, 5.10 and 5.11 apply.

Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (o)(2)(ii), an affirmative vote of two-thirds of the outstanding voting stock of any constituent Federal stock savings association is required for approval of a consolidation or merger. If any class of shares is entitled to vote as a class pursuant to § 5.22(g)(4), an affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of each voting class and two-thirds of the total voting shares is required. The required vote must be taken at a meeting of the savings association.

§ 5.34
Operating subsidiaries of a national bank.
(a)
Authority.
12 U.S.C. 24 (Seventh), 24a, 25b, 93a, 3102(b).
(b)
Licensing requirements.
A national bank must file an application or notice as prescribed in this section to acquire or establish an operating subsidiary, or to commence a new activity in an existing operating subsidiary.
(c)
Scope.
This section sets forth authorized activities and application or notice procedures for national banks engaging in activities through an operating subsidiary. The procedures in this section do not apply to financial subsidiaries authorized under § 5.39. Unless provided otherwise, this section applies to a Federal branch or agency that acquires, establishes, or maintains any subsidiary that a national bank is authorized to acquire or establish under this section in the same manner and to the same extent as if the Federal branch or agency were a national bank, except that the ownership interest required in paragraphs (e)(2) and (f)(2)(i)(C)(
2
) of this section applies to the parent foreign bank of the Federal branch or agency and not to the Federal branch or agency. The OCC may, at any time, limit a national bank's investment in an operating subsidiary or may limit or refuse to permit any activities in an operating subsidiary for supervisory, legal, or safety and soundness reasons.
(d)
Definition.
For purposes of this section,
authorized product
means a product that would be defined as insurance under section 302(c) of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (15 U.S.C. 6712) that, as of January 1, 1999, the OCC had determined in writing that national banks may provide as principal or national banks were in fact lawfully providing the product as principal, and as of that date no court of relevant jurisdiction had, by final judgment, overturned a determination by the OCC that national banks may provide the product as principal. An authorized product does not include title insurance, or an annuity contract the income of which is subject to treatment under section 72 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 72).
(e)
Standards and requirements
—(1)
Authorized activities.
(i) A national bank may conduct in an operating subsidiary activities that are permissible for a national bank to engage in directly either as part of, or incidental to, the business of banking, as determined by the OCC, or otherwise under other statutory authority, including:
(A) Providing authorized products as principal; and
(B) Providing title insurance as principal if the national bank or subsidiary thereof was actively and lawfully underwriting title insurance before November 12, 1999, and no affiliate of the national bank (other than a subsidiary) provides insurance as principal. A subsidiary may not provide title insurance as principal if the State had in effect before November 12, 1999, a law which prohibits any person from underwriting title insurance with respect to real property in that State.
(ii) In addition to OCC authorization, before it begins business an operating subsidiary also must comply with other laws applicable to it and its proposed business, including applicable licensing or registration requirements, if any, such as registration requirements under securities laws.
(2)
Qualifying subsidiaries.
(i) An operating subsidiary in which a national bank may invest includes a corporation, limited liability company, limited partnership, or similar entity if:
(A) The bank has the ability to control the management and operations of the subsidiary, and no other person or entity has the ability to exercise effective control or influence over the management or operations of the subsidiary to an extent equal to or greater than that of the bank or an operating subsidiary thereof;
(B) The parent bank owns and controls more than 50 percent of the voting (or similar type of controlling) interest of the operating subsidiary, or the parent bank otherwise controls the operating subsidiary and no other party controls a percentage of the voting (or similar type of controlling) interest of the operating subsidiary greater than the bank's interest; and
(C) The operating subsidiary is consolidated with the bank under GAAP.
(ii) However, the following entities are not operating subsidiaries subject to this section:
(A) A subsidiary in which the bank's investment is made pursuant to specific authorization in a statute or OCC regulation (
e.g.,
a bank service company under 12 U.S.C. 1861
et seq.,
a financial subsidiary under section 5136A of the Revised Statutes (12 U.S.C. 24a), or a community development corporation subsidiary under 12 U.S.C. 24 (Eleventh) and 12 CFR part 24;
(B) A subsidiary in which the bank has acquired, in good faith, shares through foreclosure on collateral, by way of compromise of a doubtful claim, or to avoid a loss in connection with a debt previously contracted; and
(C) A trust formed for purposes of securitizing assets held by the bank as part of its banking business.
(iii) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section,
(A) A national bank must have reasonable policies and procedures to preserve the limited liability of the bank and its operating subsidiaries; and
(B) OCC regulations may not be construed as requiring a national bank and its operating subsidiaries to operate as a single entity.
(3)
Examination and supervision.
An operating subsidiary conducts activities authorized under this section pursuant to the same authorization, terms and conditions that apply to the conduct of such activities by its parent national bank, unless otherwise specifically provided by statute, regulation, or published OCC policy, including sections 1044 and 1045 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (12 U.S.C. 25b) with respect to the application of State law. If the OCC determines that the operating subsidiary is operating in violation of law, regulation, or written condition, or in an unsafe or unsound manner or otherwise threatens the safety or soundness of the bank, the OCC will direct the bank or operating subsidiary to take appropriate remedial action, which may include requiring the bank to divest or liquidate the operating subsidiary, or discontinue specified activities. OCC authority under this paragraph is subject to the limitations and requirements of section 45 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1831v) and section 115 of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (12 U.S.C. 1820a).
(4)
Consolidation of figures
—(i)
National banks.
Pertinent book figures of the parent national bank and its operating subsidiary will be combined for the purpose of applying statutory or regulatory limitations when combination is needed to effect the intent of the statute or regulation,
e.g.,
for purposes of 12 U.S.C. 56, 59, 60, 84, and 371d.
(ii)
Federal branches or agencies.
Transactions conducted by all of a foreign bank's Federal branches and agencies and State branches and agencies, and their operating subsidiaries, will be combined for the purpose of applying any limitation or restriction as provided in 12 CFR 28.14.
(f)
Procedures
—(1)
Application required.
(i) Except for an operating subsidiary that qualifies for the notice procedures in paragraph (f)(2) of this section or is exempt from application or notice requirements under paragraph (f)(6) of this section, a national bank must first submit an application to, and receive prior approval from, the OCC to establish or acquire an operating subsidiary or to perform a new activity in an existing operating subsidiary.
(ii) The application must explain, as appropriate, how the bank “controls” the enterprise, describing in full detail structural arrangements where control is based on factors other than bank ownership of more than 50 percent of the voting interest of the subsidiary and the ability to control the management and operations of the subsidiary by holding voting interests sufficient to select the number of directors needed to control the subsidiary's board
and to select and terminate senior management. In the case of a limited partnership or limited liability company that does not qualify for the notice procedures set forth in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, the bank must provide a statement explaining why it is not eligible. The application also must include a complete description of the bank's investment in the subsidiary, the proposed activities of the subsidiary, the organizational structure and management of the subsidiary, the relations between the bank and the subsidiary, and other information necessary to adequately describe the proposal. To the extent that the application relates to the initial affiliation of the bank with a company engaged in insurance activities, the bank must describe the type of insurance activity in which the company is engaged and has present plans to conduct. The bank must also list for each State the lines of business for which the company holds, or will hold, an insurance license, indicating the State where the company holds a resident license or charter, as applicable. The application must state whether the operating subsidiary will conduct any activity at a location other than the main office or a previously approved branch of the bank. The OCC may require a filer to submit a legal analysis if the proposal is novel, unusually complex, or raises substantial unresolved legal issues. In these cases, the OCC encourages filers to have a prefiling meeting with the OCC. Any bank receiving approval under this paragraph is deemed to have agreed that the subsidiary will conduct the activity in a manner consistent with published OCC guidance.
(2)
Notice process only for certain qualifying filings.
(i) Except for an operating subsidiary that is exempt from application or notice procedures under paragraph (f)(6) of this section, a national bank that is well capitalized and well managed may establish or acquire an operating subsidiary, or perform a new activity in an existing operating subsidiary, by providing the appropriate OCC licensing office written notice prior to, or within 10 days after, acquiring or establishing the subsidiary, or commencing the new activity, if:
(A) The activity is listed in paragraph (f)(5) of this section or, except as provided in paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section, the activity is substantively the same as a previously approved activity and the activity will be conducted in accordance with the same terms and conditions applicable to the previously approved activity;
(B) The entity is a corporation, limited liability company, limited partnership, or trust; and
(C) The bank or an operating subsidiary thereof:
(
1
) Has the ability to control the management and operations of the subsidiary and no other person or entity has the ability to exercise effective control or influence over the management or operations of the subsidiary to an extent equal to or greater than that of the bank or an operating subsidiary thereof. The ability to control the management and operations means:
(
i
) In the case of a subsidiary that is a corporation, the bank or an operating subsidiary thereof holds voting interests sufficient to select the number of directors needed to control the subsidiary's board and to select and terminate senior management;
(
ii
) In the case of a subsidiary that is a limited partnership, the bank or an operating subsidiary thereof has the ability to control the management and operations of the subsidiary by controlling the selection and termination of senior management;
(
iii
) In the case of a subsidiary that is a limited liability company, the bank or an operating subsidiary thereof has the ability to control the management and operations of the subsidiary by controlling the selection and termination of senior management; or
(
iv
) In the case of a subsidiary that is a trust, the bank or an operating subsidiary thereof has the ability to replace the trustee at will;
(
2
) Holds more than 50 percent of the voting, or equivalent, interests in the subsidiary and:
(
i
) In the case of a subsidiary that is a limited partnership, the bank or an operating subsidiary thereof is the sole general partner of the limited partnership, provided that under the partnership agreement, limited partners have no authority to bind the partnership by
virtue solely of their status as limited partners;
(
ii
) In the case of a subsidiary that is a limited liability company, the bank or an operating subsidiary thereof is the sole managing member of the limited liability company, provided that under the limited liability company agreement, other limited liability company members have no authority to bind the limited liability company by virtue solely of their status as members; or
(
iii
) In the case of a subsidiary that is a trust, the bank or an operating subsidiary thereof is the sole beneficial owner of the trust; and
(
3
) Is required to consolidate its financial statements with those of the subsidiary under GAAP.
(ii) A national bank must file an application under paragraph (f)(1) of this section if a State has or will charter or license the proposed operating subsidiary as a bank, trust company, or savings association.
(iii) The written notice must include a complete description of the bank's investment in the subsidiary and of the activity conducted and a representation and undertaking that the activity will be conducted in accordance with OCC policies contained in guidance issued by the OCC regarding the activity. To the extent that the notice relates to the initial affiliation of the bank with a company engaged in insurance activities, the bank must describe the type of insurance activity in which the company is engaged and has present plans to conduct. The bank also must list for each State the lines of business for which the company holds, or will hold, an insurance license, indicating the State where the company holds a resident license or charter, as applicable. Any bank receiving approval under this paragraph is deemed to have agreed that the subsidiary will conduct the activity in a manner consistent with published OCC guidance.
(3)
Exceptions to rules of general applicability.
Sections 5.8, 5.10, and 5.11 do not apply to this section. However, if the OCC concludes that an application presents significant or novel policy, supervisory, or legal issues, the OCC may determine that some or all provisions in §§ 5.8, 5.10, and 5.11 apply.
(4)
OCC review and approval.
The OCC reviews a national bank's application to determine whether the proposed activities are legally permissible under Federal banking laws and to ensure that the proposal is consistent with safe and sound banking practices and OCC policy and does not endanger the safety or soundness of the parent national bank. As part of this process, the OCC may request additional information and analysis from the filer.
(5)
Activities eligible for notice.
The following activities qualify for the notice procedures in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, provided the activity is conducted pursuant to the same terms and conditions as would be applicable if the activity were conducted directly by a national bank:

In general.
A national bank must file an application and obtain prior approval before making or acquiring, either directly or through an operating subsidiary, a non-controlling investment in an enterprise if the non-controlling investment does not qualify for the notice procedure set forth in paragraph (e) of this section because the bank is unable to make the representation required by paragraph (e)(2) or the certifications required by paragraphs (e)(3) or (e)(7) of this section. The application must include the information required in paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(4) through (e)(6) of this section and, if possible, the information required by paragraphs (e)(2), (e)(3), and (e)(7) of this section. If the bank is unable to make the representation set forth in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, the bank's application must explain why the activity in which the enterprise engages is a permissible activity for a national bank and why the filer should be permitted to hold a non-controlling investment in an enterprise engaged in that activity.

Non-controlling investment; no application or notice required.
A national bank may make or acquire, either directly or through an operating subsidiary, a non-controlling investment in an enterprise without an application or notice to the OCC, if the:
(1) Activities of the enterprise are limited to those activities previously reported by the bank in connection with the making or acquiring of a non-controlling investment;

(3) The bank's non-controlling investment will be made in accordance with any conditions imposed by the OCC in approving any prior non-controlling investment in an enterprise conducting these same activities; and

The activities of the enterprise
must be conducted pursuant to the same terms and conditions as would be applicable if the activity were conducted directly by a national bank.

This notice must include a complete description of the bank's investment in the enterprise and the activities conducted, a description of how the bank plans to divest the non-controlling investment or the underlying assets within applicable statutory time frames, and a representation and undertaking that the bank will conduct the activities in accordance with OCC policies contained in guidance issued by the OCC regarding the activities. Any national bank receiving approval under this paragraph (h)(1) is deemed to have agreed that the enterprise will conduct the activity in a manner consistent with published OCC guidance.
(2)
No notice or application required.
A national bank is not required to file a notice or application under this § 5.36 if it acquires a non-controlling investment in shares of a company through foreclosure or otherwise in good faith to compromise a doubtful claim, or in the ordinary course of collecting a debt previously contracted.
(i)
Non-controlling investments by Federal branches.
A Federal branch that is well capitalized and well managed may make a non-controlling investment in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section in the same manner and subject to the same conditions and requirements as a national bank, and subject to any additional requirements that may apply under 12 CFR 28.10(c).

An operating subsidiary conducts activities authorized under this section pursuant to the same authorization, terms and conditions that apply to the conduct of such activities by its parent Federal savings association, unless otherwise specifically provided by statute, regulation, or published OCC policy, including sections 1045 and 1046 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (12
U.S.C. 25b and 1465) with respect to the application of State law. If the OCC determines that the operating subsidiary is operating in violation of law, regulation, or written condition, or in an unsafe or unsound manner or otherwise threatens the safety or soundness of the savings association, the OCC will direct the savings association or operating subsidiary to take appropriate remedial action, which may include requiring the savings association to divest or liquidate the operating subsidiary, or discontinue specified activities. OCC authority under this paragraph is subject to the limitations and requirements of section 45 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1831v) and section 115 of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (12 U.S.C. 1820a).
(4)
Consolidation of figures.
(i) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of this section, pertinent book figures of the parent Federal savings association and its operating subsidiary must be combined for the purpose of applying statutory or regulatory limitations when combination is needed to effect the intent of the statute or regulation,
e.g.,
for purposes of 12 U.S.C. 1464(c) and 1464(u).
(ii) Consolidation for purposes of calculating portfolio assets and qualified thrift investments is subject to 12 U.S.C. 1467a(m)(5).
(f)
Procedures
—(1)
Application required.
(i) A Federal savings association must first submit an application to, and receive prior approval from, the OCC to establish or acquire an operating subsidiary, or to perform a new activity in an existing operating subsidiary.
(ii) The application must explain, as appropriate, how the savings association “controls” the enterprise, describing in full detail structural arrangements where control is based on factors other than savings association ownership of more than 50 percent of the voting interest of the subsidiary and the ability to control the management and operations of the subsidiary by holding voting interests sufficient to select the number of directors needed to control the subsidiary's board and to select and terminate senior management. In the case of a limited partnership or limited liability company that does not qualify for the expedited review procedure set forth in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, the savings association must provide a statement explaining why it is not eligible. The application also must include a complete description of the savings association's investment in the subsidiary, the proposed activities of the subsidiary, the organizational structure and management of the subsidiary, the relations between the savings association and the subsidiary, and other information necessary to adequately describe the proposal. To the extent that the application relates to the initial affiliation of the savings association with a company engaged in insurance activities, the savings association must describe the type of insurance activity in which the company is engaged and has present plans to conduct. The savings association must also list for each State the lines of business for which the company holds, or will hold, an insurance license, indicating the State where the company holds a resident license or charter, as applicable. The application must state whether the operating subsidiary will conduct any activity at a location other than the home office or a previously approved branch of the savings association. The OCC may require a filer to submit a legal analysis if the proposal is novel, unusually complex, or raises substantial unresolved legal issues. In these cases, the OCC encourages filers to have a prefiling meeting with the OCC. Any savings association receiving approval under this paragraph is deemed to have agreed that the subsidiary will conduct the activity in a manner consistent with published OCC guidance.
(2)
Expedited review.
(i) An application to establish or acquire an operating subsidiary, or to perform a new activity in an existing operating subsidiary, that meets the requirements of this paragraph is deemed approved by the OCC as of the 30th day after the filing is received by the OCC, unless the OCC notifies the filer prior to that date that the filing has been removed from expedited review, or the expedited review process is extended under § 5.13(a)(2). Any savings association receiving approval under this paragraph is deemed to have agreed that the subsidiary will
conduct the activity in a manner consistent with published OCC guidance.
(ii) An application is eligible for expedited review if all of the following requirements are met:
(A) The savings association is well capitalized and well managed;
(B) The activity is listed in paragraph (f)(5) this section or is substantively the same as a previously approved activity and the activity will be conducted in accordance with the same terms and conditions applicable to the previously approved activity;
(C) The entity is a corporation, limited liability company, limited partnership or trust; and
(D) The savings association or an operating subsidiary thereof:
(
1
) Has the ability to control the management and operations of the subsidiary and no other person or entity has the ability to exercise effective control or influence over the management or operations of the subsidiary to an extent equal to or greater than that of the savings association or an operating subsidiary thereof. The ability to control the management and operations means:
(
i
) In the case of a subsidiary that is a corporation, the savings association or an operating subsidiary thereof holds voting interests sufficient to select the number of directors needed to control the subsidiary's board and to select and terminate senior management;
(
ii
) In the case of a subsidiary that is a limited partnership, the savings association or an operating subsidiary thereof has the ability to control the management and operations of the subsidiary by controlling the selection and termination of senior management;
(
iii
) In the case of a subsidiary that is a limited liability company, the savings association or an operating subsidiary thereof has the ability to control the management and operations of the subsidiary by controlling the selection and termination of senior management; or
(
iv
) In the case of a subsidiary that is a trust, the savings association or an operating subsidiary thereof has the ability to replace the trustee at will;
(
2
) Holds more than 50 percent of the voting, or equivalent, interests in the subsidiary, and:
(
i
) In the case of a subsidiary that is a limited partnership, the savings association or an operating subsidiary thereof is the sole general partner of the limited partnership, provided that under the partnership agreement, limited partners have no authority to bind the partnership by virtue solely of their status as limited partners;
(
ii
) In the case of a subsidiary that is a limited liability company, the savings association or an operating subsidiary thereof is the sole managing member of the limited liability company, provided that under the limited liability company agreement, other limited liability company members have no authority to bind the limited liability company by virtue solely of their status as members; or
(
iii
) In the case of a subsidiary that is a trust, the savings association or an operating subsidiary thereof is the sole beneficial owner of the trust; and
(
3
) Is required to consolidate its financial statements with those of the subsidiary under GAAP. A filer proposing to qualify for expedited review must include in the application all necessary information showing the application meets the requirements.
(3)
Exceptions to rules of general applicability.
Sections 5.8, 5.10, and 5.11 do not apply to this section. However, if the OCC concludes that an application presents significant or novel policy, supervisory, or legal issues, the OCC may determine that some or all provisions in §§ 5.8, 5.10, and 5.11 apply.
(4)
OCC review and approval.
The OCC reviews a Federal savings association's application to determine whether the proposed activities are legally permissible under Federal savings association law and to ensure that the proposal is consistent with safe and sound banking practices and OCC policy and does not endanger the safety or soundness of the parent Federal savings association. As part of this process, the OCC may request additional information and analysis from the filer.
(5)
Activities eligible for expedited review.
The following activities qualify for the expedited review procedures in
paragraph (f)(2) of this section, provided the activity is conducted pursuant to the same terms and conditions as would be applicable if the activity were conducted directly by a Federal savings association:
(i) Holding and managing assets acquired by the parent savings association or its operating subsidiaries, including investment assets and property acquired by the savings association through foreclosure or otherwise in good faith to compromise a doubtful claim, or in the ordinary course of collecting a debt previously contracted;

Redesignation.
A Federal savings association that proposes to redesignate a service corporation as an operating subsidiary must submit a notification to the OCC at least 30 days prior to the redesignation date. The notification must include a description of how the redesignated service corporation meets all of the requirements of this section to be an operating subsidiary, a resolution of the savings association's board of directors approving the redesignation, and the proposed effective date of the redesignation. The savings association may effect the redesignation on the proposed date unless the OCC notifies the savings association otherwise prior to that date. The OCC may require an application if the redesignation presents policy, supervisory, or legal issues.
(7)
Fiduciary powers.
(i) If an operating subsidiary proposes to accept fiduciary appointments for which fiduciary powers are required, such as acting as trustee or executor, then the Federal savings association must have fiduciary powers under section 5(n) of the Home Owners' Loan Act, 12 U.S.C. 1464(n), and the subsidiary also must have its own fiduciary powers under the law applicable to the subsidiary.
(ii) Unless the subsidiary is a registered investment adviser, if an operating subsidiary proposes to exercise investment discretion on behalf of customers or provide investment advice for a fee, the Federal savings association must have prior OCC approval to exercise fiduciary powers pursuant to § 5.26 (or a predecessor provision) and 12 CFR part 150.
(8)
Expiration of approval.
Approval expires if the Federal savings association has not established or acquired the operating subsidiary, or commenced the new activity in an existing operating subsidiary within 12 months after the date of the approval, unless the OCC shortens or extends the time period.
(g)
Grandfathered operating subsidiaries.
Notwithstanding the requirements for a qualifying operating subsidiary in paragraph (e)(2) of this section and unless otherwise notified by the OCC with respect to a particular operating subsidiary, an entity that a Federal savings association lawfully acquired or established as an operating subsidiary before May 18, 2015, may continue to operate as a Federal savings association operating subsidiary under this section, provided that the savings association and the operating subsidiary were, and continue to be, conducting authorized activities in compliance with the standards and requirements applicable when the savings association established or acquired the operating subsidiary.
(h)
Issuances of securities by operating subsidiaries.
An operating subsidiary may not state or imply that the securities it issues are covered by Federal deposit insurance. An operating subsidiary may not issue any security the payment, maturity, or redemption of which may be accelerated upon the condition that the controlling Federal savings association is insolvent or has been placed into receivership. For as long as any securities are outstanding, the controlling Federal savings association must maintain all records generated through each securities issuance in the ordinary course of business, including but not limited to a copy of the prospectus, offering circular, or similar document concerning such issuance, and make such records available for examination by the OCC.

A national bank, or, as applicable, its affiliated depository institutions, must continue to satisfy the qualification requirements set forth in paragraphs (g)(1) and (2) of this section and the safeguards in paragraphs (h)(1), (2), (3) and (4) of this section following its acquisition of control of, or an interest in, a financial subsidiary. A national bank that fails to continue to satisfy these requirements will be subject to the following procedures and requirements:
(i) The OCC will give notice to the national bank and, in the case of an affiliated depository institution to that depository institution's appropriate Federal banking agency, promptly upon determining that the national bank, or, as applicable, its affiliated depository institution, does not continue to meet the requirements in paragraph (g)(1) or (2) of this section or the safeguards in paragraph (h)(1), (2), (3), or (4) of this section.

The OCC aims to act promptly on all applications. The agency's range of potential actions on applications includes approval, denial, and requesting that an applicant withdraw the application because any shortcomings are unlikely to be resolved in a timely manner. Applications that tend to withstand scrutiny more easily and are more likely to be approved expeditiously generally feature all of the following indicators:
1. The acquirer is well capitalized under § 5.3, and the resulting institution will be well capitalized;
2. The resulting institution will have total assets less than $50 billion;
3. The acquirer has a Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) rating of Outstanding or Satisfactory;
4. The acquirer has composite and management ratings of 1 or 2 under the Uniform Financial Institution Ratings System (UFIRS) or ROCA rating system;
5. The acquirer has a consumer compliance rating of 1 or 2 under the Uniform Interagency Consumer Compliance Rating System (CC Rating System), if applicable;
6. The acquirer has no open formal or informal enforcement actions;
7. The acquirer has no open or pending fair lending actions, including referrals or notifications to other agencies;
8. The acquirer is effective in combatting money laundering activities;
9. The target's total assets are less than or equal to 50% of acquirer's total assets;
10. The target is an eligible depository institution as defined in § 5.3;
11. The proposed transaction clearly would not have a significant adverse effect on competition;
12. The OCC has not identified a significant legal or policy issue; and
13. No adverse comment has raised a significant CRA or consumer compliance concern.
If certain indicators that raise supervisory or regulatory concerns are present, the OCC is unlikely to find that the statutory factors under the BMA are consistent with approval unless and until the applicant has adequately addressed or remediated the concern. The following are examples of indicators that raise supervisory or regulatory concerns:
1. The acquirer has a CRA rating of Needs to Improve or Substantial Noncompliance.
2. The acquirer has a consumer compliance rating of 3 or worse.
3. The acquirer has UFIRS or ROCA composite or management ratings of 3 or worse or the most recent report of examination otherwise indicates that the acquirer is not financially sound or well managed.
4. The acquirer is a global systemically important banking organization or subsidiary thereof.
5. The acquirer has open or pending Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-money Laundering, fair lending, or consumer compliance actions, including enforcement actions, referrals, or notifications to other agencies.
6. The acquirer has failed to adopt, implement, and adhere to all the corrective actions required by a formal enforcement action in a timely manner, or there have been multiple enforcement actions against the acquirer executed or outstanding during a three-year period.

# III. Financial Stability

# A. Factors Considered
The BMA requires the OCC to consider “the risk to the stability of the United States banking or financial system” when reviewing transactions subject to the Act. In reviewing a BMA application under this factor, the OCC considers the following factors:
1. Whether the proposed transaction would result in a material increase in risks to financial system stability due to an increase in size of the combining institutions.
2. Whether the proposed transaction would result in a reduction in the availability of substitute providers for the services offered by the combining institutions.
3. Whether the resulting institution would engage in any business activities or participate in markets in a manner that, in the event of financial distress of the resulting institution, would cause significant risks to other institutions.
4. Whether the proposed transaction would materially increase the extent to which the combining institutions contribute to the complexity of the financial system.
5. Whether the proposed transaction would materially increase the extent of cross-border activities of the combining institutions.
6. Whether the proposed transaction would increase the relative degree of difficulty of resolving or winding up the resulting institution's business in the event of failure or insolvency.
7. Any other factors that could indicate that the transaction poses a risk to the U.S. banking or financial system.

# B. Balancing Test
1.
In general:
The OCC applies a balancing test when considering the factors in section III.A. of this appendix in light of all the facts and circumstances available regarding the proposed transaction, including weighing the financial stability risk posed by the proposed transaction against the financial stability risk posed by denial of the proposed transaction, particularly if the proposed transaction involves a troubled target. The OCC considers each factor both individually and in combination with others. Even if only a single factor indicates that the proposed transaction would pose a risk to the stability of the U.S. banking or financial system, the OCC may determine that there would be an adverse effect of the proposal on the stability of the U.S. banking or financial system. Finally, the OCC also considers whether the proposed transaction would provide any stability benefits and whether enhanced prudential standards applicable as a result of the proposed transaction would offset any potential risks.
2.
Conditions:
The OCC's review of the financial stability factors will include, as appropriate, whether to impose conditions on approval of the transaction. The OCC may impose conditions, enforceable under 12 U.S.C. 1818, to address and mitigate financial stability risk concerns, such as requiring asset divestitures by the resulting institution, imposing higher minimum capital requirements, or imposing other financial stability-related conditions.
3.
Recovery planning and heightened standards:
The OCC's review of the financial stability factors will consider the impact of the proposed transaction in light of:
b. Standards applicable to the resulting institution pursuant to 12 CFR part 30, appendix D, “OCC Guidelines Establishing Heightened Standards for Certain Large Insured National Banks, Insured Federal Savings Associations, and Insured Federal Branches”; and
c. Standards applicable to the resulting institution's recovery planning pursuant to 12 CFR part 30, appendix E, “OCC Guidelines Establishing Standards for Recovery Planning by Certain Large Insured National Banks, Insured Federal Savings Associations, and Insured Federal Branches”.
4.
Concurrent filings:
the OCC's review of the financial stability factors may consider the facts, circumstances, and representations of concurrent filings for related transactions, including the impact of the related transactions to the proposed transaction under review by the OCC.

# IV. Financial and Managerial Resources and Future Prospects
The OCC is required by the BMA to consider the managerial resources, financial resources, and future prospects of the combining and the resulting institutions. The OCC considers each of these factors independently for both the combining and resulting institutions. However, because these factors are directly related to one another, the OCC also considers these factors holistically.

# A. Overarching Considerations
1. The OCC tailors its consideration of the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the combining and resulting institutions to their size, complexity, and risk profile.
2. The OCC considers these factors within the context of the prevailing economic and operating environment.
3. The OCC is more likely to approve combinations where the acquirer has sufficient financial and managerial resources to ensure safe and sound operations of the resulting institution than when:
a. The acquirer has a less than satisfactory supervisory record, including its financial and managerial resources;
b. The acquirer has experienced rapid growth;
c. The acquirer has engaged in multiple acquisitions with overlapping integration periods;
d. The acquirer has failed to comply with conditions imposed in prior OCC licensing decisions; or
e. The acquirer is functionally the target in the transaction.
4. The OCC normally does not approve a combination that would result in a depository institution with less than adequate capital or liquidity, less than satisfactory management, or poor earnings prospects.
5. The OCC considers all comments received on proposed business combinations. However, the OCC's consideration of an institution's financial and managerial resources and future prospects are necessarily based on confidential supervisory information. While the OCC will provide an appropriate discussion of comments pertaining to the financial resources, managerial resources, and future prospects factors, it will generally not discuss or otherwise disclose confidential supervisory information in public decision letters.

# B. Individual Factors
1.
Financial Resources:
a. The OCC reviews the existing and proposed institutions' current and pro forma capital levels.
i. The OCC reviews for compliance with the applicable capital ratios required by 12 CFR part 3 and the Prompt Corrective Action capital categories established by 12 CFR 6.4.
ii. The OCC may not approve a combination application filed by an insured depository institution that is undercapitalized as defined in 12 CFR 6.4 unless it has approved the institution's capital restoration plan or the Board of Directors of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has determined that the transaction would fulfill the purposes of 12 U.S.C. 1831o.
b. The OCC closely scrutinizes transactions that increase the risk to the bank's financial condition and resilience, including bank capital, liquidity, and earnings, that can arise from any of the eight categories of risk included in the OCC's Risk Assessment System: credit, interest rate, liquidity, price, operational, compliance, strategic, and reputation.
c. In relation to the financial resources factor, the OCC considers management's ability to address increased risks that would result from the transaction.
d. A transaction involving an acquirer with a strong supervisory record relative to capital, liquidity, and earnings is more likely to satisfy the review factors. By contrast, a transaction involving an acquirer with a recent less than satisfactory financial or supervisory record is less likely to satisfy this factor.
2.
Managerial Resources:
The OCC considers several factors when considering the managerial resources of the institutions.
a. The OCC considers the supervisory record and current condition of both the acquirer and target to determine if the resulting institutions will have sufficient managerial resources to manage the resulting institution.
i. A significant number of MRAs suggests there may be insufficient managerial resources. Additionally, the OCC considers both institutions' management ratings under the UFIRS or ROCA system and component ratings under the CC Rating System, Uniform Rating System for Information Technology, and Uniform Interagency Trust Rating System, as applicable.
ii. When applicable, the OCC also considers the relevant Risk Assessment System (RAS) conclusions for the combining institutions.
iii. The OCC considers the context in which a rating or RAS element was assigned and any additional information resulting from ongoing supervision.
iv. Less than satisfactory ratings at the target do not preclude the approval of a transaction provided that the acquirer can employ sufficiently robust risk management and financial resources to correct the weaknesses at the target.
b. The OCC considers whether the acquirer has conducted sufficient due diligence of the target depository institution to understand the business model, systems compatibility, and weaknesses of the target. To facilitate the OCC's review, the acquirer's management team should demonstrate its plans and ability to address the acquirer's previously identified weaknesses, remediate the target's weaknesses, and exercise appropriate risk management for the size, complexity, and risk profile of the resulting institution.
c. The OCC also considers the acquirer's analysis and plans to integrate the combining institutions' operations, including systems and information security processes, products, services, employees, and cultures. The OCC's consideration and degree of scrutiny reflects the applicant's track record with information technology governance, business continuity resilience, and, as applicable, integrating acquisitions.
d. The OCC considers the acquirer's plans to identify and manage systems compatibility and integration issues, such as information technology compatibility and the implications for business continuity resilience. Any combination in which the OCC identifies systems integration concerns may lead to additional review.
i. A critical component of these plans includes the acquirer's identification and assessment of overreliance on manual controls, strategies for automating critical processes, and the strategies and capacity for modernization of aging and legacy information technology systems.
ii. The OCC may impose conditions, enforceable pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 1818, if it determines that information technology systems compatibility and integration represent a supervisory significant concern. These conditions may include requirements and time frames for specific remedial actions and specific measures for assessing and evaluating the depository institution's systems integration progress.
iii. The OCC may deny the application if the integration issues or other issues present significant supervisory concerns, and the
issues cannot be resolved through appropriate conditions or otherwise.
e. The OCC also considers the proposed governance structure of the resulting institution. This includes governance in decision-making processes, the board management oversight structure, and the risk management system, including change management. This also includes expansion of existing activities, introduction of new or more complex products or lines of business, and implications for managing existing and acquired subsidiaries and equity investments. When applicable, the resulting institution's governance is also considered in the context of the institution's relationship with its holding company and the scope of the holding company's activities.
3.
Future Prospects:
a. The OCC considers the resulting institution's future prospects in light of its assessment of the institutions' financial and managerial resources.
b. The OCC also considers the proposed operations of the resulting institution. The OCC's consideration and degree of scrutiny reflects the acquirer's record of integrating acquisitions.
i. The OCC considers whether the integration of the combining institutions would allow it to function effectively as a single unit.
ii. The OCC considers the resulting institution's business plan or strategy and management's ability to implement it in a safe and sound manner.
iii. The OCC also considers the combination's potential impact on the resulting institution's continuity planning and operational resilience.

# V. Convenience and Needs
A. The OCC considers the probable effects of the proposed business combination on the community to be served. Review of the convenience and needs factor is prospective and considers the likely impact on the community of the resulting institution after the transaction is consummated, including but not limited to:
1. Any plans to close, consolidate, limit, or expand branches or branching services, including in low- or moderate-income (LMI) areas;
2. Any plans to reduce the availability or increase the cost of banking services or products, or plans to provide expanded or less costly banking services or products to the community;
3. Any plans to maintain, reduce, or improve credit availability throughout the community, including, for example, access to home mortgage, consumer, small business, and small farm loans;
4. Job losses or reduced job opportunities from branch staffing changes, including branch closures or consolidations;
5. Community investment or development initiatives, including, for example, community reinvestment, community development investment, and community outreach and engagement strategies; and
6. Efforts to support affordable housing initiatives and small businesses.
B. The OCC considers comments received during the comment period and information provided during any public hearing or meeting related to the proposed business combination. To the extent public comments or discussions address issues involving confidential supervisory information, however, the OCC generally will not discuss or otherwise disclose that confidential supervisory information in public decision letters and forums.
C. The OCC considers the CRA record of performance of an applicant in evaluating a business combination application. The OCC's forward-looking evaluation of the convenience and needs factor under the BMA is separate and distinct from its consideration of the CRA record of performance of an applicant in helping to meet the credit needs of the relevant community, including LMI neighborhoods.

# VI. Public Comment Period and Public Meetings

# A. Public Comment Period
1. Unless an exception applies, a combination under the BMA is subject to a 30-day comment period following publication of the notice of the proposed combination. The OCC may extend the comment period in certain instances:
a. When a filer fails to file all required publicly available information on a timely basis or makes a request for confidential treatment not granted by the OCC;
b. When requested and the OCC determines that additional time is necessary to develop factual information necessary to consider the filing; and
c. When the OCC determines that other extenuating circumstances exist.
2. The OCC may find that additional time is necessary to develop factual information if a filer's response to a comment does not fully address the matters raised in the comment, and the commenter requests an opportunity to respond.
3. Examples of extenuating circumstances necessitating an extension include:
a. Transactions in which public meetings are held to allow for public comment after the meeting;
b. Unusual transactions (
e.g.,
novel or complex transactions); and
c. Natural or other disasters occurring in geographic regions affecting the public's ability to timely submit comments.

# B. Public Meetings
1. While the BMA does not require the OCC to hold meetings or hearings, the OCC has three methods for seeking oral input: (1) public hearing, (2) public meeting, and (3) private meeting. Public meetings are the most-employed public option.
2. The OCC will balance the public's interest in the transaction with the value or harm of a public meeting to the decision-making process (
e.g.,
although there may be increased public interest in a transaction, a public meeting will not be held if it would not inform the OCC's decision on an application or would otherwise harm the decision-making process).
3. Criteria informing the OCC's decision on whether to hold public meetings include:
a. The extent of public interest in the proposed transaction.
b. Whether a public meeting is appropriate in order to document or clarify issues presented by a particular transaction based on issues the public raises during the public comment process.
c. Whether a public meeting would provide useful information that the OCC would not otherwise be able to obtain in writing.
d. The significance of the transaction to the banking industry. Relevant considerations may include the asset sizes of the institutions involved (
e.g.,
resulting institution will have $50 billion or more in total assets) and concentration of the resulting institution in one or more markets.
e. The significance of the transaction to the communities affected. Relevant considerations may include the effects of the transaction on the convenience and needs of the community to be served, including a consideration of a bank's CRA strategy and the extent to which the acquirer and target are currently serving the convenience and needs of their communities.
f. The acquirer's and target's CRA, consumer compliance, fair lending, and other pertinent supervisory records, as applicable.

This section describes the procedures for the OCC to waive the residency and citizenship requirements for national bank directors set forth at 12 U.S.C. 72.
(c)
Application Procedures
—(1)
Residency.
A national bank may request a waiver of the residency requirement for any number of directors by filing a written application with the OCC. The OCC may grant a waiver on an individual basis or for any number of director positions. The waiver is valid until the OCC revokes it in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section, or, if granted on an individual basis, until the individual no longer serves on the board.
(2)
Citizenship.
A national bank may request a waiver of the citizenship requirements for individuals who comprise up to a minority of the total number of directors by filing a written application with the OCC. The OCC may grant a waiver on an individual basis.

(4)
Exceptions to rules of general applicability.
Sections 5.8, 5.9, 5.10, and 5.11 do not apply to this section.
(d)
Revocation of waiver
—(1)
Procedure.
The OCC may revoke a residency or citizenship waiver. Before revocation, the OCC will provide written notice to the national bank and affected director(s) of its intention to revoke a residency or citizenship waiver and the basis for its intention. The bank and affected director(s) may respond in writing to the OCC within 10 calendar days, unless the OCC determines that a shorter period is appropriate in light of relevant circumstances. The OCC will consider the written responses of the bank and affected director(s), if any, prior to deciding whether or not to revoke a residency or citizenship waiver. The OCC will notify the national bank and the director of the OCC's decision to revoke a residency or citizenship waiver in writing.
(2)
Effective date.
The OCC's decision to revoke a residency or citizenship waiver is effective:
(i) If the director or national bank, or both, appeals pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section, upon the director's receipt of the decision of the Comptroller, an authorized delegate, or the appellate official, to uphold the initial decision to revoke the residency or citizenship waiver; or
(ii) If neither the director nor national bank appeals pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section, upon the expiration of the period to appeal.
(e)
Appeal.
(1) A director or national bank, or both, may seek review by appealing the OCC's decision to revoke a residency or citizenship waiver to the Comptroller, or an authorized delegate, within 15 days of the receipt of the OCC's written decision to revoke. The director or national bank, or both, may appeal on the grounds that the reasons for revocation are contrary to fact or arbitrary and capricious. The appellant must submit all documents and written arguments that the appellant wishes to be considered in support of the appeal.
(2) The Comptroller, or an authorized delegate, may designate an appellate official who was not previously involved in the decision leading to the appeal at issue. The Comptroller, an authorized delegate, or the appellate official considers all information submitted with the original application for the residency or citizenship waiver,
the material before the OCC official who made the initial decision, and any information submitted by the appellant at the time of appeal.
(3) The Comptroller, an authorized delegate, or the appellate official will independently determine whether the reasons given for the initial decision to revoke are contrary to fact or arbitrary and capricious. If they determine either to be the case, the Comptroller, an authorized delegate, or the appellate official may reverse the initial decision to revoke the waiver.
(4) Upon completion of the review, the Comptroller, an authorized delegate, or the appellate official will notify the appellant in writing of the decision. If the initial decision is upheld, the decision to revoke the waiver is effective pursuant to paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section.
(f)
Prior waivers.
Any waiver granted by the OCC before January 11, 2021 remains in effect unless revoked pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section or, for a waiver granted to an individual, until the individual no longer serves on the board.

However, in certain circumstances, a Federal stock savings association is required to submit an application and obtain OCC approval.
(c)
Scope.
This section describes procedures and standards relating to a transaction resulting in an increase in a Federal stock savings association's permanent capital.
(d)
Exceptions to rules of general applicability.

Definitions.
For the purposes of this section the following definitions apply:
(1)
Capital plan
means a plan describing the manner and schedule by which a Federal stock savings association will attain specified capital levels or ratios and a capital restoration plan filed with the OCC under 12 U.S.C. 1831o and 12 CFR 6.5.
(2)

(5)
Retained net income
means the net income of a specified period less the amount of all dividends and other capital distributions declared in that period.
(f)
Policy.
In determining whether to approve a proposed increase in a Federal stock savings association's permanent capital, the OCC considers whether the change is:
(1) Consistent with law, regulation, and OCC policy thereunder;
(2) Provides an adequate capital structure; and
(3) If appropriate, complies with the Federal stock savings association's capital plan.
(g)
Procedures
—(1)
When prior approval is required.
A Federal stock savings association must submit an application to the appropriate OCC licensing office and obtain prior OCC approval to increase its permanent capital if the Federal stock savings association is:
(i) Required to receive OCC approval pursuant to letter, order, directive, written agreement or otherwise;
(ii) Selling common or preferred stock for consideration other than cash; or
(iii) Receiving a material noncash contribution to capital surplus.

(4)
Notice of increase.
(i) If prior approval is required pursuant to this paragraph (g), after a Federal stock savings association completes an increase in capital it must submit a notice to the appropriate OCC licensing office. The notice must contain:

—(1)
Approval
—(i)
Prior approval not required.
If a national bank is not required to file an application and obtain prior approval under paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section, the bank need not submit an application. It must submit the notice of capital increase under paragraph (i)(3) of this section. The increase in capital is deemed approved by the OCC as of the date the increase was made, once the bank has filed the notice of capital increase and the OCC certifies the increase, as provided in paragraph (i)(3).
(ii)
Prior approval required.
In addition to a notice of capital increase under paragraph (i)(3) of this section, a national bank must submit an application under paragraph (i)(1) or (i)(2) of this section and obtain prior OCC approval to increase its permanent capital if the bank is:

An eligible bank's application is deemed approved by the OCC 15 days after the date the OCC receives the application described in paragraph (i)(1) of this section, unless the OCC notifies the bank prior to that date that the application has been removed from expedited review, or the expedited review process is extended, under § 5.13(a)(2). An eligible bank seeking to decrease its capital may request OCC approval for up to four consecutive quarters. The request need only specify a total dollar amount for the four-quarter period and need not specify amounts for each quarter. An eligible bank may decrease its capital pursuant to such a plan only if the bank maintains its eligible bank status before and after each decrease in its capital.
(3)
Notice of increase.
(i) After a bank completes an increase in capital it must submit a notice to the appropriate OCC licensing office. The notice must be acknowledged before a notary public by the bank's president, vice president, or cashier and contain:

(ii) After it receives the notice of capital increase, the OCC issues a certification specifying the amount of the increase and the effective date (
i.e.,
the date on which the increase occurred). In the case of a capital increase for which prior approval was not required pursuant to paragraph (g)(1)(i), the increase is deemed certified by the OCC seven days after receipt of the notice if the OCC has not issued a certification prior to that date.
(4)
Notice of decrease.
A national bank that decreases its capital in accordance with paragraphs (i)(1) or (i)(2) of this section must notify the appropriate OCC licensing office following the completion of the transaction.

(ii) Within 30 days after the end of the quarter in which the adjustment occurred, a bank must notify the OCC if the accounting adjustment resulted in an increase or decrease to permanent capital in an amount greater than 5% of the bank's total permanent capital prior to the adjustments; or, if the bank is subject to a letter, order, directive, written agreement, or otherwise related to changes in permanent capital. The notification must include the amount and description of the adjustment, including the applicable provision of GAAP.

Policy
—(1)
In general.

through the acquisition of shares of a bank holding company, they are subject to the notice requirements of this section.

(3)
Assessing financial condition.
In assessing the financial condition of the acquiring person, the OCC weighs any debt servicing requirements in light of the acquiring person's overall financial strength; the institution's earnings performance, asset condition, capital adequacy, and future prospects; and the likelihood of the acquiring party making unreasonable demands on the resources of the institution.
(f)

(iii) The OCC presumes, unless rebutted, that an acquisition or other disposition of voting securities through which any person proposes to acquire ownership of, or the power to vote, 10 percent or more of a class of voting securities of a national bank or Federal savings association is an acquisition by a person of the power to direct the bank's or savings association's management or policies if:

(viii) An acquiring person may seek to rebut a presumption established in paragraph (f)(2)(ii) or (iii) of this section by presenting relevant information in writing to the appropriate OCC licensing office. The OCC will respond in writing to any person that seeks to rebut the presumption of control or the presumption of concerted action. No rebuttal filing is effective unless the OCC indicates in writing that the information submitted has been found to be sufficient to rebut the presumption of control.

The OCC may act on a proposed change in control prior to the expiration of the public comment period if the OCC makes a written determination that an emergency exists.

(4)
Conditional actions.
The OCC may impose conditions on its action not to disapprove a notice to assure satisfaction of the relevant statutory criteria for non-objection to a notice.
(5)
Disapproval.
The OCC may disapprove a notice if it finds that any of the following factors exist:
(i) The proposed acquisition of control would result in a monopoly or would be in furtherance of any combination or conspiracy to monopolize or to attempt to monopolize the business of banking in any part of the United States;
(ii) The effect of the proposed acquisition of control in any section of the country may be substantially to lessen competition or to tend to create a monopoly or the proposed acquisition of control would in any other manner be in restraint of trade, and the anticompetitive effects of the proposed acquisition of control are not clearly outweighed in the public interest by the probable effect of the transaction in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served;
(iii) Either the financial condition of any acquiring person or the future prospects of the institution is such as might jeopardize the financial stability of the bank or Federal savings association or prejudice the interests of the depositors of the bank or Federal savings association;

Disclosure
—(1)
Announcement.
The filer must publish an announcement in a newspaper of general circulation in the community where the affected national bank or Federal savings association is located within 10 days of filing.

i.e.,
20 days from the date of the announcement). The announcement also must state that the public portion of the notice is available upon request.

Federal savings association to be acquired, including situations where the OCC must act immediately in order to prevent the probable failure of a national bank or Federal savings association, the OCC may waive or shorten the publication requirement.

) Delay would not be in the public interest; or
(
3
) Other extraordinary circumstances justify waiver of prior notice.
(C) The OCC will determine the length of the waiver on a case-by-case basis. All waivers that the OCC grants under this paragraph (e)(6) are subject to the condition that the national bank or Federal savings association must file a technically complete notice under this section within the time period specified by the OCC.
(D) Subject to paragraph (e)(6)(i)(C) of this section, the proposed individual may assume the position on an interim basis until the earliest of the following events:
(
1
) The individual and the national bank or the Federal savings association receive a notice of intent not to disapprove, at which time the individual may assume the position on a permanent basis, provided all other applicable legal requirements are satisfied;
(
2
) The individual and the national bank or the Federal savings association receive a notice of disapproval within 90 calendar days after the submission of a technically complete notice. In this event the individual must immediately resign from the position upon receipt of the notice of disapproval and may assume the position on a permanent basis only if the notice of disapproval is reversed on appeal and all other applicable legal requirements are satisfied; or
(
3
) The OCC does not act within 90 calendar days after the submission of a technically complete notice. In this event, the individual may assume the position on a permanent basis 91 calendar days after the submission of a technically complete notice.
(E) If the technically complete notice is not filed within the time period specified in the waiver, the proposed individual must immediately resign their position. Thereafter, the individual may assume the position only after a technically complete notice has been filed, all other applicable requirements are satisfied, and:
(
1
) The national bank or the Federal savings association receives a notice of intent not to disapprove;
(
2
) The review period expires; or
(
3
) A notice of disapproval has been overturned on appeal as set forth in paragraph (f) of this section.
(F) Notwithstanding the grant of a waiver, the OCC has authority to issue a notice of disapproval within 30 days of the expiration of such waiver.
(ii)
Automatic waiver.
An individual who has been elected to the board of directors of a national bank or Federal savings association may serve as a director on an interim basis before a notice has been filed under this section, provided the individual was not nominated by management, and the national bank or Federal savings association submits a notice under this section not later than seven days after the individual has been notified of the election. The individual may serve on an interim basis until the occurrence of the earliest of the events described in paragraphs (e)(6)(i)(D)(
1
), (
2
), or (
3
) of this section.
(7)
Commencement of service.
An individual proposed as a member of the
board of directors or as a senior executive officer who satisfies all other applicable legal requirements may assume the office on a permanent basis:
(i) Prior to the expiration of the review period, only if the OCC notifies the national bank or Federal savings association in writing that the OCC does not disapprove the proposed director or senior executive officer pursuant to paragraph (e)(5) of this section; or
(ii) Following the expiration of the review period, unless:
(A) The OCC issues a written notice of disapproval during the review period; or
(B) The national bank or Federal savings association does not provide additional information within the time period required by the OCC pursuant to paragraph (e)(3) of this section and the OCC deems the notice to be abandoned pursuant to § 5.13(c).
(8)
Exceptions to rules of general applicability.
Sections 5.8, 5.9, 5.10, 5.11, and 5.13(a) through (f) do not apply to a notice for a change in directors and senior executive officers, except that § 5.13(c) will apply to the extent provided for in paragraphs (e)(3)(iii) and (e)(7) of this section.
(f)
Appeal.
(1) If the national bank or Federal savings association, the proposed individual, or both, disagree with a disapproval, they may seek review by appealing the disapproval to the Comptroller, or an authorized delegate, within 15 days of the receipt of the notice of disapproval. The national bank or Federal savings association or the individual may appeal on the grounds that the reasons for disapproval are contrary to fact or insufficient to justify disapproval. The appellant must submit all documents and written arguments that the appellant wishes to be considered in support of the appeal.
(2) The Comptroller, or an authorized delegate, may designate an appellate official who was not previously involved in the decision leading to the appeal at issue. The Comptroller, an authorized delegate, or the appellate official considers all information submitted with the original notice, the material before the OCC official who made the initial decision, and any information submitted by the appellant at the time of the appeal.
(3) The Comptroller, an authorized delegate, or the appellate official will independently determine whether the reasons given for the disapproval are contrary to fact or insufficient to justify the disapproval. If either is determined to be the case, the Comptroller, an authorized delegate, or the appellate official may reverse the disapproval.
(4) Upon completion of the review, the Comptroller, an authorized delegate, or the appellate official will notify the appellant in writing of the decision. If the original decision is reversed, the individual may assume the position in the national bank or Federal savings association for which he or she was proposed.

Definitions.
The following definitions apply to this section:
(1)
Affiliate
means an affiliate, as defined under regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System regarding transactions with affiliates, 12 CFR part 223 (Regulation W).
(2)
Capital distribution
means:
(i) A distribution of cash or other property to owners of a Federal savings association made on account of their ownership, but excludes:
(A) Any dividend consisting only of the shares of the savings association or rights to purchase the shares; or
(B) If the savings association is a Federal mutual savings association, any payment that the savings association is required to make under the terms of a deposit instrument and any other amount paid on deposits that the OCC determines is not a distribution for the purposes of this section;
(ii) A Federal savings association's payment to repurchase, redeem, retire or otherwise acquire any of its shares or other ownership interests; any payment to repurchase, redeem, retire, or otherwise acquire debt instruments included in its total capital under 12 CFR part 3; and any extension of credit to finance an affiliate's acquisition of the savings association's shares or interests;

This includes the Federal savings association's payment of cash or property to shareholders of another association or to shareholders of its holding company to acquire ownership in that association, other than by a distribution of shares;
(iv) Any other distribution charged against a Federal savings association's capital accounts if the savings association would not be well capitalized, as set forth in 12 CFR 6.4, following the distribution; and

or would not otherwise remain an eligible savings association following the distribution;
(ii) The total amount of all of the Federal savings association's capital distributions (including the proposed capital distribution) for the applicable calendar year exceeds its net income for that year to date plus retained net income for the preceding two years.

After review of an application submitted pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this section:
(1) The OCC may deny the application in whole or in part, if it makes any of the following determinations:
(i) The Federal savings association will be undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, or critically undercapitalized as set forth in 12 CFR 6.4, as applicable, following the capital distribution. If so, the OCC will determine if the capital distribution is permitted under 12 U.S.C. 1831o(d)(1)(B).
(ii) The proposed capital distribution raises safety or soundness concerns.

(a)
Scope and definitions.
(1) A Federal savings association must comply with this section in order to include subordinated debt securities or mandatorily redeemable preferred stock (“covered securities”) in tier 2 capital under 12 CFR 3.20(d) and to prepay covered securities included in tier 2 capital.

Application procedures
—(1)
Application to include covered securities in tier 2 capital
—(i)
Application required.
A Federal savings association must file an application seeking the OCC's approval of the inclusion of covered securities in
tier 2 capital. The savings association may file its application before or after it issues covered securities, but may not include covered securities in tier 2 capital until the OCC approves the application and the securities are issued.
(ii)
Expedited review.
The OCC is deemed to have approved an application from an eligible savings association to include covered securities in tier 2 capital upon the expiration of 30 days after the filing date of the application unless, before the expiration of that time period, the OCC notifies the Federal savings association that:
(A) Additional information is required to supplement the application;

(2)
Application required to prepay covered securities included in tier 2 capital
—(i)
In general.
A Federal savings association must file an application to, and receive prior approval from, the OCC before prepaying covered securities included in tier 2 capital. The application must include:
(A) A statement explaining why the Federal savings association believes that following the proposed prepayment the savings association would continue to hold an amount of capital commensurate with its risk; or
(B) A description of the replacement capital instrument that meets the criteria for tier 1 or tier 2 capital under 12 CFR 3.20, including the amount of such instrument and the time frame for issuance.
(ii)
Replacement covered security.
If the OCC conditions approval of prepayment on a requirement that a Federal savings association must replace the covered security with a covered security of an equivalent amount that satisfies the requirements for tier 1 or tier 2 capital, the savings association must file an application to issue the replacement covered security and must receive prior OCC approval.
(c)
General requirements.
A covered security issued under this section must satisfy the requirements for tier 2 capital in 12 CFR 3.20(d).
(d)
Securities requirements for inclusion in tier 2 capital.
To be included in tier 2 capital, covered securities must satisfy the requirements in 12 CFR 3.20(d). In addition, such covered securities must meet the following requirements:
(1)
Form.
(i) Each certificate evidencing a covered security must:
(A) Bear the following legend on its face, in bold type: “This security is
not
a savings account or deposit and it is
not
insured by the United States or any agency or fund of the United States;”
(B) State that the security is subordinated on liquidation, as to principal, interest, and premium, to all claims against the savings association that have the same priority as savings accounts or a higher priority;
(C) State that the security is not secured by the savings association's assets or the assets of any affiliate of the savings association. An affiliate means any person or company that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the savings association;
(D) State that the security is not eligible collateral for a loan by the savings association;
(E) State the prohibition on the payment of dividends or interest at 12 U.S.C. 1828(b) and, in the case of subordinated debt securities, state the prohibition on the payment of principal and interest at 12 U.S.C. 1831o(h), 12 CFR 3.11, and any other relevant restrictions;
(F) For subordinated debt securities, state or refer to a document stating the terms under which the savings association may prepay the obligation;
(G) Where applicable, state or refer to a document stating that the savings association must obtain OCC's prior approval before the acceleration of payment of principal or interest on subordinated debt securities, redemption of subordinated debt securities prior to maturity, repurchase of subordinated debt securities, or exercising a call option in connection with a subordinated debt security; and
(H) State that the security may be fully subordinated to interests held by the U.S. government in the event that the savings association enters into a receivership, insolvency, liquidation, or similar proceeding;
(ii) A Federal savings association must include such additional statements as the OCC may prescribe for certificates, purchase agreements, indentures, and other related documents.
(2)
Indenture.
(i) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, a Federal savings association must use an indenture for subordinated debt securities. If the aggregate amount of subordinated debt securities publicly offered (excluding sales in a non-public offering as defined in 12 CFR 16.7) and sold in any consecutive 12-month or 36-month period exceeds $5,000,000 or $10,000,000 respectively (or such lesser amount that the Securities and Exchange Commission may establish by rule or regulation under 15 U.S.C. 77ddd), the indenture must provide for the appointment of a trustee other than the savings association or an affiliate of the savings association (as defined in paragraph (d)(1)(i)(C) of this section) and for collective enforcement of the security holders' rights and remedies.
(ii) A Federal savings association is not required to use an indenture if the subordinated debt securities are sold only to accredited investors, as that term is defined in 15 U.S.C. 77b(a)(15). A savings association must have an indenture that meets the requirements of paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section in place before any debt securities for which an exemption from the indenture requirement is claimed, are transferred to any non-accredited investor. If a savings association relies on this exemption from the indenture requirement, it must place a legend on the debt securities indicating that an indenture must be in place before the debt securities are transferred to any non-accredited investor.
(e)
Review by the OCC.
(1) In reviewing applications under this section, the OCC will consider whether:
(i) The issuance of the covered securities is authorized under applicable laws and regulations and is consistent with the savings association's charter and bylaws;
(ii) The savings association is at least adequately capitalized under 12 CFR 6.4 and meets the regulatory capital requirements at 12 CFR 3.10;
(iii) The savings association is or will be able to service the covered securities;
(iv) The covered securities are consistent with the requirements of this section;
(v) The covered securities and related transactions sufficiently transfer risk from the Deposit Insurance Fund; and
(vi) The OCC has no objection to the issuance based on the savings association's overall policies, condition, and operations.
(2) The OCC's approval is conditioned upon no material changes to the information disclosed in the application submitted to the OCC. The OCC may impose such additional requirements or conditions as it may deem necessary to protect purchasers, the savings association, the OCC, or the Deposit Insurance Fund.
(f)
Amendments.
If a Federal savings association amends the covered securities or related documents following the completion of the OCC's review, it must obtain the OCC's approval under this section before it may include the amended securities in tier 2 capital.
(g)
Sale of covered securities.
The Federal savings association must complete the sale of covered securities within one year after the OCC's approval under this section. A savings association may request an extension of the offering period by filing a written request with the OCC. The savings association must demonstrate good cause for the extension and file the request at least 30 days before the expiration of the offering period or any extension of the offering period.
(h)
Issuance of a replacement regulatory capital instrument in connection with prepaying a covered security.
The OCC may require a Federal savings association seeking prior approval to prepay a covered security included in tier 2 capital to issue a replacement covered security of an equivalent amount that qualifies as tier 1 or tier 2 capital under 12 CFR 3.20. If the OCC imposes
such a requirement, the savings association must complete the sale of such covered security prior to, or immediately after, the prepayment.
5
5
A Federal savings association may replace tier 2 capital instruments concurrent with the redemption of existing tier 2 capital instruments.
(i)
Reports.
A Federal savings association must file the following information with the OCC within 30 days after the savings association completes the sale of covered securities includable as tier 2 capital. If the savings association filed its application following the completion of the sale, it must submit this information with its application:
(1) A written report indicating the number of purchasers, the total dollar amount of securities sold, the net proceeds received by the savings association from the issuance, and the amount of covered securities, net of all expenses, to be included as tier 2 capital;
(2) Three copies of an executed form of the securities and a copy of any related documents governing the issuance or administration of the securities; and
(3) A certification by the appropriate executive officer indicating that the savings association complied with all applicable laws and regulations in connection with the offering, issuance, and sale of the securities.

Pass-through investments; notice procedure.
Except as provided in paragraphs (f) through (i) of this section, a Federal savings association may make a pass-through investment, directly or through its operating subsidiary, in an enterprise that engages in an activity described in § 5.38(f)(5) or in an activity that is substantively the same as a previously approved activity by filing a written notice. The Federal savings association must file this written notice with the appropriate OCC licensing office no later than 10 days after making the investment. The written notice must:
(1) Describe the structure of the investment and the activity or activities conducted by the enterprise in which the Federal savings association is investing. To the extent the notice relates to the initial affiliation of the Federal savings association with a company engaged in insurance activities, the savings association should describe the type of insurance activity that the company is engaged in and has present plans to conduct. The Federal savings association must also list for each State the lines of business for which the company holds, or will hold, an insurance license, indicating the State where the company holds a resident license or charter, as applicable;
(2) State:

(4) Describe how the Federal savings association has the ability to prevent the enterprise from engaging in an activity that is not set forth in § 5.38(f)(5) or not contained in published OCC (including published former OTS) precedent for previously approved activities, or how the savings association otherwise has the ability to withdraw its investment;
(5) Describe how the investment is convenient and useful to the Federal savings association in carrying out its business and not a mere passive investment unrelated to the savings association's banking business;
(6) Certify that the Federal savings association's loss exposure is limited as a legal matter and that the savings association does not have unlimited liability for the obligations of the enterprise; and
(7) Certify that the enterprise in which the Federal savings association is investing agrees to be subject to OCC supervision and examination, subject to the limitations and requirements of section 45 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1831v) and section 115 of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (12 U.S.C. 1820a).
(f)
Pass-through investments; application procedure
—(1)
In general.
A Federal savings association must file an application and obtain prior approval before making or acquiring, either directly or through an operating subsidiary, a pass-through investment in an enterprise if the pass-through investment does not qualify for the notice procedure set forth in paragraph (e) of this section because the savings association is unable to make the representation required by paragraph (e)(2) or the certification required by paragraphs (e)(3) or (e)(7) of this section. The application must include the information required in paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(4) through (e)(6) of this section and, if possible, paragraphs (e)(2), (e)(3), and (e)(7) of this section. If the Federal savings association is unable to make the representation set forth in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, the savings association's application must explain why the activity in which the enterprise engages is a permissible activity for a Federal savings association and why the filer should be permitted to hold a pass-through investment in an enterprise engaged in that activity. A Federal savings association may not make a pass-through investment if it is unable to make the representations and certifications specified in paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(4) through (e)(6) of this section.
(2)
Expedited review.
An application submitted by a Federal savings association is deemed approved by the OCC as of the 10th day after the application is received by the OCC if:
(A) The Federal savings association makes the representation required by paragraph (e)(2) and the certification required by paragraph (e)(3) of this section;
(B) The book value of the Federal savings association's pass-through investment for which the application is being submitted is no more than 1% of the savings association's capital and surplus;
(C) No more than 50% of the enterprise is owned or controlled by banks or savings associations subject to examination by an appropriate Federal banking agency or credit unions insured by the National Credit Union Association; and
(D) The OCC has not notified the Federal savings association that the application has been removed from expedited review, or the expedited review process is extended, under § 5.13(a)(2).
(3)
Investments requiring a filing under 12 U.S.C. 1828(m).
Notwithstanding any other provision in this section, if an enterprise in which a Federal savings association proposes to invest would be a subsidiary of the Federal savings association for purposes of 12 U.S.C.
1828(m) and the enterprise would not be an operating subsidiary or a service corporation, the Federal savings association must file an application with the OCC under paragraph (f)(3) of this section at least 30 days prior to making the investment and obtain prior approval from the OCC before making the investment. The application must include the information required in paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(4) through (e)(6) of this section and, if possible, paragraphs (e)(2), (e)(3), and (e)(7) of this section. If the Federal savings association is unable to make the representation set forth in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, the savings association's application must explain why the activity in which the enterprise engages is a permissible activity for a Federal savings association and why the filer should be permitted to hold a pass-through investment in an enterprise engaged in that activity. A Federal savings association may not make a pass-through investment if it is unable to make the representations and certifications specified in paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(4) through (e)(6) of this section.
(g)
Pass-through investments; no application or notice required.
A Federal savings association may make or acquire, either directly or through an operating subsidiary, a pass-through investment in an enterprise, without an application or notice to the OCC, if:

(2) The activities in the enterprise continue to be legally permissible for a Federal savings association;
(3) The savings association's pass-through investment will be made in accordance with any conditions imposed by the OCC or OTS in approving any prior pass-through investment conducting these activities;
(4) The savings association is able to make the representations and certifications specified in paragraphs (e)(3) through (e)(7) of this section; and
(5) The enterprise will not be a subsidiary for purposes of 12 U.S.C. 1828(m).
(h)
Pass-through investments in enterprises holding assets in satisfaction of debts previously contracted.
Certain pass-through investments may be eligible for expedited treatment where the Federal savings association's investment is in an enterprise holding assets in satisfaction of debts previously contracted or the savings association acquires shares of a company in satisfaction of debts previously contracted.
(1)
Notice required.
A Federal savings association that is well capitalized and well managed may acquire a pass-through investment, directly or through its operating subsidiary, in an enterprise that engages in the activities of holding and managing assets acquired by the parent savings association through foreclosure or otherwise in good faith to compromise a doubtful claim, or in the ordinary course of collecting a debt previously contracted, by filing a written notice in accordance with this paragraph (h)(1). The activities of the enterprise must be conducted pursuant to the same terms and conditions as would be applicable if the activity were conducted directly by a Federal savings association. The Federal savings association must file the written notice with the appropriate OCC licensing office no later than 10 days after making the pass-through investment. This notice must include a complete description of the Federal savings association's investment in the enterprise and the activities conducted, a description of how the savings association plans to divest the pass-through investment or the underlying assets within applicable statutory time frames, and a representation and undertaking that the savings association will conduct the activities in accordance with OCC policies contained in guidance issued by the OCC regarding the activities. Any Federal savings association receiving approval under this paragraph (h)(1) is deemed to have agreed that the enterprise will conduct the activity in a manner consistent with published OCC guidance.
(2)
No notice or application required.
A Federal savings association is not required to file a notice or application under this § 5.58 if it acquires a non-controlling investment in shares of a
company through foreclosure or otherwise in good faith to compromise a doubtful claim, or in the ordinary course of collecting a debt previously contracted.
(i)
Additional exception to filing requirement.
A Federal savings association may make a pass-through investment without filing a notice or application to the OCC if all of the following conditions are met:
(1) The investment is in an investment company the portfolio of which consists exclusively of assets that the Federal savings association may hold directly;
(2) The Federal savings association is not investing more than 10 percent of its total capital (or, in the case of a Federal savings association that is a qualifying community banking organization that has elected to use the community bank leverage ratio framework, 10 percent of its tier 1 capital, as used under § 3.12 of this chapter) in one company;
(3) The book value of the Federal savings association's aggregate pass-through investments does not exceed 25 percent of its total capital (or, in the case of a Federal savings association that is a qualifying community banking organization that has elected to use the community bank leverage ratio framework, 25 percent of its tier 1 capital, as used under § 3.12 of this chapter) after making the investment;
(4) The investment would not give Federal savings association direct or indirect control of the company; and
(5) The Federal savings association's liability is limited to the amount of its investment.
(j)
Exceptions to rules of general applicability.
Sections 5.8, 5.9, 5.10, and 5.11 do not apply to this section. However, if the OCC concludes that an application presents significant or novel policy, supervisory, or legal issues, the OCC may determine that some or all provisions in §§ 5.8, 5.9, 5.10, and 5.11 apply.

Any investment that would cause a Federal savings association's investment in service corporations, in the aggregate, to exceed 2 percent of assets, or made while the savings association's investments in service corporations exceeds 2 percent of assets, must serve primarily community, inner city, or community and economic development or public welfare purposes consistent with 12 CFR part 24. A Federal savings association must designate the investments serving those purposes.

(h)

The savings association must also list for each State the lines of business for which the company holds, or will hold, an insurance license, indicating the State where the service corporation holds a resident license or charter, as applicable. The OCC may require a filer to submit a legal analysis if the proposal is novel, unusually complex, or raises substantial unresolved legal issues. In these cases, the OCC encourages filers to have a prefiling meeting with the OCC. Any savings association receiving approval under this paragraph is deemed to have agreed that the service corporation will conduct the activity in a manner consistent with published OCC guidance.
(2)
Expedited review.
(i) An application to establish or acquire a service corporation, or to perform a new activity in an existing service corporation subsidiary, that meets the requirements of this paragraph is deemed approved by the OCC as of the 30th day after the filing is received by the OCC, unless the OCC notifies the filer prior to that date that the filing has been removed from expedited review, or the expedited review period is extended, under § 5.13(a)(2). Any savings association receiving approval under this paragraph is deemed to have agreed that the service corporation will conduct the activity in a manner consistent with published OCC guidance.
(ii) An application is eligible for expedited review if the following requirements are met:
(A) The savings association is well capitalized and well managed; and
(B) The service corporation engages only in one or more of the preapproved activities listed in paragraph (f) of this section.
(3)
OCC review and approval.
The OCC reviews a Federal savings association's application to determine whether the proposal is legally permissible and to ensure that the proposal is consistent with the requirements of this section, safe and sound banking practices and OCC policy and does not endanger the safety or soundness of the parent Federal savings association. As part of this process, the OCC may request additional information and analysis from the filer.

The OCC may require an application if the redesignation presents policy, supervisory, or legal issues.
(5)
Exception to rules of general applicability.
Sections 5.8, 5.10 and 5.11 do not apply to this section. However, if the OCC concludes that an application presents significant or novel policy, supervisory, or legal issues, the OCC may determine that some or all provisions in §§ 5.8, 5.10, and 5.11 apply.

(3) If a service corporation is a GAAP-consolidated subsidiary, the salvage investment will be considered an investment in a subsidiary for purposes of 12 CFR part 3.
(j)
Failure to comply with the requirements applicable to service corporations.
If a service corporation fails to meet any of the requirements of this section, the Federal savings association must notify the appropriate OCC licensing office. Unless the Federal savings association is otherwise advised by the OCC, if the service corporation cannot comply with the requirements of this section within 90 days of failing to meet such requirements, or otherwise resolve such failure to comply with this section, the Federal savings association must promptly dispose of its investment in the service corporation.

(i) If in current year minus one or current year minus two the bank declared dividends in excess of that year's net income, the excess does not reduce retained net income for the three-year period specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, provided that the amount of excess dividends can be offset by retained net income in current year minus three or current year minus four. If the bank declared dividends in excess of net income in current year minus one, the excess is offset by retained net income in current year minus three and then by retained net income in current year minus two. If the bank declared dividends in excess of net income in current year minus two, the excess is first offset by retained net income in current year minus four and then by retained net income in current year minus three.
(ii) If the bank's retained net income in current year minus three and current year minus four was insufficient to offset the full amount of the excess dividends declared, as calculated in accordance with paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, then the amount that is not offset will reduce the retained net income available to pay dividends in the current year.
(iii) The calculation in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) and (c)(2)(ii) of this section applies only to retained net loss that results from dividends declared in excess of a single year's net income and does not apply to other types of current earnings deficits.
(3)
Prior approval required.
A national bank may declare a dividend in excess of the amount described in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section, provided that the dividend is approved by the OCC. A national bank must submit a request for prior approval of a dividend under 12 U.S.C. 60 to the appropriate OCC supervisory office.

§ 5.65
Restrictions on undercapitalized institutions.
Notwithstanding any other provision in this subpart, a national bank may not declare or pay any dividend if, after making the dividend, the national bank would be “undercapitalized” as defined in 12 CFR part 6.
§ 5.66
Dividends payable in property other than cash.
In addition to cash dividends, directors of a national bank may declare dividends payable in property, with the approval of the OCC. A national bank must submit a request for prior approval of a noncash dividend to the appropriate OCC licensing office. The dividend is equivalent to a cash dividend in an amount equal to the actual current value of the property, regardless of whether the book value is higher or lower under GAAP. Before the dividend is declared, the bank should show the difference between actual value and book value on the books of the national bank as a gain or loss, as applicable, and the dividend should then be declared in the amount of the actual current value of the property being distributed.
[85 FR 80469, Dec. 11, 2020]
§ 5.67
Fractional shares.
A national bank issuing additional stock may adopt arrangements to preclude the issuance of fractional shares. The bank may remit the cash equivalent of the fraction not being issued to those to whom fractional shares would otherwise be issued. The cash equivalent is based on the market value of the stock, if there is an established and
active market in the national bank's stock. In the absence of such a market, the cash equivalent is based on a reliable and disinterested determination as to the fair market value of the stock if such stock is available. The bank may propose an alternate method in the application for the stock issuance filed with the OCC.

(b)
Purpose.
Section 38 of the FDI Act establishes a framework of supervisory actions for insured depository institutions that are not adequately capitalized. The principal purpose of this subpart is to define, for insured national banks and insured Federal savings associations, the capital measures and capital levels, and for insured Federal branches, comparable asset-based measures and levels, that are used for determining the supervisory actions authorized under section 38 of the FDI Act. This part 6 also establishes procedures for submission and review of capital restoration plans and for issuance and review of directives and orders pursuant to section 38.
(c)
Scope.
This subpart implements the provisions of section 38 of the FDI Act as they apply to insured national banks, insured Federal branches, and insured Federal savings associations. Certain of these provisions also apply to officers, directors, and employees of these insured institutions. Other provisions apply to any company that controls an insured national bank, insured Federal branch, or insured Federal savings association and to the affiliates of an insured national bank, insured Federal branch, or insured Federal savings association.
(d)
Other supervisory authority.
Neither section 38 nor this part in any way limits the authority of the OCC under any other provision of law to take supervisory actions to address unsafe or unsound practices, deficient capital levels, violations of law, unsafe or unsound conditions, or other practices. Action under section 38 of the FDI Act and this part may be taken independently of, in conjunction with, or in addition to any other enforcement action available to the OCC, including issuance of cease and desist orders, capital directives, approval or denial of applications or notices, assessment of civil money penalties, or any other actions authorized by law.
(e)
Disclosure of capital categories.
The assignment of an insured national bank, insured Federal branch, or insured Federal savings association under this subpart within a particular capital category is for purposes of implementing and applying the provisions of section 38. Unless permitted by the OCC or otherwise required by law, no national bank or Federal savings association may state in any advertisement or promotional material its capital category under this subpart or that the OCC or any other Federal banking agency has assigned the national bank or Federal savings association to a particular capital category.
(f)
Transition procedures.

(d)
Disapproval of capital restoration plan.
If a capital restoration plan is not approved by the OCC, the national bank or Federal savings association shall submit a revised capital restoration plan within the time specified by the OCC.

(g)
Amendment of capital restoration plan.
A national bank or Federal savings association that has submitted an approved capital restoration plan may, after prior written notice to and approval by the OCC, amend the plan to reflect a change in circumstance. Until such time as a proposed amendment has been approved, the national bank or Federal savings association shall implement the capital restoration plan as approved prior to the proposed amendment.
(h)
Notice to FDIC.
Within 45 days of the effective date of OCC approval of a capital restoration plan, or any amendment to a capital restoration plan, the OCC shall provide a copy of the plan or amendment to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

(ii)
Limit on duration.
The guarantee and limit of liability under section 38 and this subpart shall expire after the OCC notifies the national bank or Federal savings association that it has remained adequately capitalized for each of four consecutive calendar quarters.

Collection on guarantee.
Each company that controls a given national bank or Federal savings association shall be jointly and severally liable for the guarantee for such national bank or Federal savings association as required under section 38 and this subpart, and the OCC may require payment of the full amount of that guarantee from any or all of the companies issuing the guarantee.
(2)
Failure to provide guarantee.
In the event that a national bank or Federal savings association that is controlled by any company submits a capital restoration plan that does not contain the guarantee required under section 38(e)(2) of the FDI Act, the national bank or Federal savings association shall, upon submission of the plan, be subject to the provisions of section 38 and this part that are applicable to national banks or Federal savings associations that have not submitted an acceptable capital restoration plan.
(3)
Failure to perform guarantee.
Failure by any company that controls a national bank or Federal savings association to perform fully its guarantee of any capital plan shall constitute a material failure to implement the plan for purposes of section 38(f) of the FDI Act. Upon such failure, the national bank or Federal savings association shall be subject to the provisions of section 38 and this part that are applicable to national banks or Federal savings associations that have failed in a material respect to implement a capital restoration plan.
(j)
Enforcement of capital restoration plan.
The failure of a national bank or Federal savings association to implement, in any material respect, a capital restoration plan required under section 38 and this section shall subject the national bank or Federal savings association to the assessment of civil money penalties pursuant to section 8(i)(2)(A) of the FDI Act.

§ 7.1000
Activities that are part of, or incidental to, the business of banking.
(a)
Purpose.
This section identifies the criteria that the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) uses to determine whether an activity is authorized as part of, or incidental to, the business of banking under 12 U.S.C. 24(Seventh) or other statutory authority.
(b)
Restrictions and conditions on activities.
The OCC may determine that activities are permissible under 12 U.S.C. 24(Seventh) or other statutory authority only if they are subject to standards or conditions designed to provide that the activities function as intended and are conducted safely and soundly, in accordance with other applicable statutes, regulations, or supervisory policies.
(c)
Activities that are part of the business of banking.
(1) An activity is permissible for national banks as part of the business of banking if the activity is authorized under 12 U.S.C. 24(Seventh) or other statutory authority. In determining whether an activity that is not specifically included in 12 U.S.C. 24(Seventh) or other statutory authority is part of the business of banking, the OCC considers the following factors:
(i) Whether the activity is the functional equivalent to, or a logical outgrowth of, a recognized banking activity;
(ii) Whether the activity strengthens the bank by benefiting its customers or its business;
(iii) Whether the activity involves risks similar in nature to those already assumed by banks; and
(iv) Whether the activity is authorized for State-chartered banks.
(2) The weight accorded each factor set out in paragraph (c)(1) of this section depends on the facts and circumstances of each case.
(d)
Activities that are incidental to the business of banking.
(1) An activity is authorized for a national bank as incidental to the business of banking if it is convenient or useful to an activity that is specifically authorized for national banks or to an activity that is otherwise part of the business of banking. In determining whether an activity is convenient or useful to such activities, the OCC considers the following factors:
(i) Whether the activity facilitates the production or delivery of a bank's products or services, enhances the bank's ability to sell or market its products or services, or improves the effectiveness or efficiency of the bank's operations, in light of risks presented, innovations, strategies, techniques and new technologies for producing and delivering financial products and services; and
(ii) Whether the activity enables the bank to use capacity acquired for its banking operations or otherwise avoid economic loss or waste.
(2) The weight accorded each factor set out in paragraph (d)(1) of this section depends on the facts and circumstances of each case.
[85 FR 83726, Dec. 22, 2020]
§ 7.1001
National bank acting as general insurance agent.
Pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 92, a national bank may act as an agent for any fire, life, or other insurance company in any place the population of which does not exceed 5,000 inhabitants. This section is applicable to any office of a national bank when the office is located in a community having a population of less than 5,000, even though the principal office of such bank is located in a community whose population exceeds 5,000.
[85 FR 35374, June 10, 2020]
§ 7.1002
National bank and Federal savings association acting as finder.
(a)
In general.
A finder may identify potential parties, make inquiries as to interest, introduce or arrange contacts or meetings of interested parties, act as an intermediary between interested parties, and otherwise bring parties together for a transaction that the parties themselves negotiate and consummate. It is part of the business of banking under 12 U.S.C. 24(Seventh) for a national bank to act as a finder. A Federal savings association may act as a finder to the extent those activities are incidental to the powers expressly authorized by the Home Owners' Loan Act (HOLA) (12 U.S.C. 1461
et seq
).
(b)
Permissible finder activities
—(1)
National banks.
The following list provides examples of permissible finder activities for national banks. This list is illustrative and not exclusive; the OCC may determine that other activities are permissible pursuant to a national bank's authority to act as a finder:
(i) Communicating information about providers of products and services, and proposed offering prices and
terms to potential markets for these products and services;
(ii) Communicating to the seller an offer to purchase or a request for information, including forwarding completed applications, application fees, and requests for information to third-party providers;
(iii) Arranging for third-party providers to offer reduced rates to those customers referred by the national bank;
(iv) Providing administrative, clerical, and record keeping functions related to the national bank's finder activity, including retaining copies of documents, instructing and assisting individuals in the completion of documents, scheduling sales calls on behalf of sellers, and conducting market research to identify potential new customers for retailers;
(v) Conveying between interested parties expressions of interest, bids, offers, orders, and confirmations relating to a transaction;
(vi) Conveying other types of information between potential buyers, sellers, and other interested parties;
(vii) Establishing rules of general applicability governing the use and operation of the finder service, including rules that:
(A) Govern the submission of bids and offers by buyers, sellers, and other interested parties that use the finder service and the circumstances under which the finder service will pair bids and offers submitted by buyers, sellers, and other interested parties; and
(B) Govern the manner in which buyers, sellers, and other interested parties may bind themselves to the terms of a specific transaction; and
(viii) Acting as an electronic finder pursuant to § 7.5002(a)(1).
(2)
Federal savings associations.
The following list provides examples of finder activities that are permissible for Federal savings associations. This list is illustrative and not exclusive; the OCC may determine that other activities are permissible pursuant to a Federal savings association's incidental powers:
(i) Referring customers to a third party; and
(ii) Providing services and products to customers indirectly through a third-party discount program.
(c)
Limitation.
The authority to act as a finder does not enable a national bank or a Federal savings association to engage in brokerage activities that have not been found to be permissible for national banks or Federal savings associations, respectively.
(d)
Advertisement and fee.
Unless otherwise prohibited by Federal law, a national bank or Federal savings association may advertise the availability of, and accept a fee for, the services provided pursuant to this section.
[85 FR 83727, Dec. 22, 2020]
§ 7.1003
Money lent by a national bank at banking offices or at facilities other than banking offices.
(a)
In general.
For purposes of what constitutes a branch within the meaning of 12 U.S.C. 36(j) and 12 CFR 5.30, “money” is deemed to be “lent” only at the place, if any, where the borrower in-person receives loan proceeds directly from national bank funds:
(1) From the lending national bank or its operating subsidiary; or
(2) At a facility that is established by the lending national bank or its operating subsidiary.
(b)
Receipt of national bank funds representing loan proceeds.
Loan proceeds directly from national bank funds may be received by a borrower in person at a place that is not the national bank's main office and is not licensed as a branch without violating 12 U.S.C. 36, 12 U.S.C. 81 and 12 CFR 5.30, provided that a third party is used to deliver the funds and the place is not established by the lending national bank or its operating subsidiary. A third party includes a person who satisfies the requirements of § 7.1012(c)(2), or one who customarily delivers loan proceeds directly from national bank funds under accepted industry practice, such as an attorney or escrow agent at a real estate closing.
(c)
Services on equivalent terms to those offered customers of unrelated banks.
An operating subsidiary owned by a national bank may distribute loan proceeds from its own funds or bank funds directly to the borrower in person at
offices the operating subsidiary has established without violating 12 U.S.C. 36, 12 U.S.C. 81 and 12 CFR 5.30 provided that the operating subsidiary provides similar services on substantially similar terms and conditions to customers of unaffiliated entities including unaffiliated banks.

§ 7.1004
Establishment of a loan production office by a national bank.
(a)
In general.
A national bank or its operating subsidiary may engage in loan production activities at a site other than the main office or a branch of the bank. A national bank or its operating subsidiary may solicit loan customers, market loan products, assist persons in completing application forms and related documents to obtain a loan, originate and approve loans, make credit decisions regarding a loan application, and offer other lending-related services such as loan information and applications at a loan production office without violating 12 U.S.C. 36 and 12 U.S.C. 81, provided that “money” is not deemed to be “lent” at that site within the meaning of § 7.1003 and the site does not accept deposits or pay withdrawals.
(b)
Services of other persons.
A national bank may use the services of, and compensate, persons not employed by the bank in its loan production activities.

§ 7.1006
Loan agreement providing for a national bank or Federal savings association share in profits, income, or earnings or for stock warrants.
A national bank or Federal savings association may take as consideration for a loan a share in the profit, income, or earnings from a business enterprise of a borrower. A national bank or Federal savings association also may take as consideration for a loan a stock warrant issued by a business enterprise of a borrower, provided that the bank or savings association does not exercise the warrant. The share or stock warrant may be taken in addition to, or in lieu of, interest. The borrower's obligation to repay principal, however, may not be conditioned upon the value of the profit, income, or earnings of the business enterprise or upon the value of the warrant received.
[61 FR 4862, Feb. 9, 1996, as amended at 85 FR 83728, Dec. 22, 2020]
§ 7.1007
National Bank Acceptances.
A national bank is not limited in the character of acceptances it may make in financing credit transactions. Bankers' acceptances may be used for such purpose, since the making of acceptances is an essential part of banking authorized by 12 U.S.C. 24.
§ 7.1008
Preparation by a national bank of income tax returns for customers or public.
A national bank may assist its customers in preparing their tax returns, either gratuitously or for a fee.

§ 7.1009
[Reserved]
§ 7.1010
Postal services by national banks and Federal savings associations.
(a)
In general.
A national bank or Federal savings association may provide postal services and receive income from those services. The services performed are those permitted under applicable rules of the United States Postal Service and may include meter stamping of letters and packages and the sale of related insurance. The national bank or Federal savings association may advertise, develop, and extend the services to attract customers to the institution.
(b)
Postal regulations.
A national bank or Federal savings association providing postal services must do so in accordance with the rules and regulations of the United States Postal Service. The national bank or Federal savings association must keep the books and records of the postal services separate from those of other banking operations. Under 39 U.S.C. 404 and regulations issued under that statute (
see
39 CFR chapter I), the United States Postal Service may inspect the books
and records pertaining to the postal services.
[85 FR 83728, Dec. 22, 2020]
§ 7.1011
National bank acting as payroll issuer.
A national bank may disburse to an employee of a customer payroll funds deposited with the bank by that customer. The bank may disburse those funds by direct payment to the employee, by crediting an account in the employee's name at the disbursing bank, or by forwarding funds to another institution in which an employee maintains an account.
§ 7.1012
Establishment, operation, or use of a messenger service by a national bank.
(a)
Definition.
For purposes of this section, a “messenger service” means any service, such as a courier service or armored car service, used by a national bank and its customers to pick up from, and deliver to, specific customers at locations such as their homes or offices, items relating to transactions between the bank and those customers.
(b)
Pick-up and delivery of items constituting nonbranching activities.
Pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 24 (Seventh), a national bank may establish and operate a messenger service, or use, with its customers, a third party messenger service. The bank may use the messenger service to transport items relevant to the bank's transactions with its customers without regard to the branching limitations set forth in 12 U.S.C. 36, provided the service does not engage in branching functions within the meaning of 12 U.S.C. 36(j). In establishing or using such a facility, the national bank may establish terms, conditions, and limitations consistent with this section and appropriate to assure compliance with safe and sound banking practices.
(c)
Pick-up and delivery of items constituting branching functions by a messenger service established by a third party.
(1) Pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 24 (Seventh), a national bank and its customers may use a messenger service to pick up from and deliver to customers items that relate to branching functions within the meaning of 12 U.S.C. 36, provided the messenger service is established and operated by a third party. In using such a facility, a national bank may establish terms, conditions, and limitations, consistent with this section and appropriate to assure compliance with safe and sound banking practices.
(2) The OCC reviews whether a messenger service is established by a third party on a case-by-case basis, considering all of the circumstances. However, a messenger service is clearly established by a third party if:
(i) A party other than the national bank owns or rents the messenger service and its facilities and employs the persons who provide the service;
(ii)(A) The messenger service retains the discretion to determine in its own business judgment which customers and geographic areas it will serve; or
(B) If the messenger service and the bank are under common ownership or control, the messenger service actually provides its services to the general public, including other depository institutions, and retains the discretion to determine in its own business judgment which customers and geographic areas it will serve;
(iii) The messenger service maintains ultimate responsibility for scheduling, movement, and routing;
(iv) The messenger service does not operate under the name of the bank, and the bank and the messenger service do not advertise, or otherwise represent, that the bank itself is providing the service, although the bank may advertise that its customers may use one or more third party messenger services to transact business with the bank;
(v) The messenger service assumes responsibility for the items during transit and for maintaining adequate insurance covering thefts, employee fidelity, and other in-transit losses; and
(vi) The messenger service acts as the agent for the customer when the items are in transit. The bank deems items intended for deposit to be deposited when credited to the customer's account at the bank's main office, one of its branches, or another permissible facility, such as a back-office facility that is not a branch. The bank deems items representing withdrawals to be
paid when the items are given to the messenger service.
(3) A national bank may defray all or part of the costs incurred by a customer in transporting items through a messenger service. Payment of those costs may only cover expenses associated with each transaction involving the customer and the messenger service. The national bank may impose terms, conditions, and limitations that it deems appropriate with respect to the payment of such costs.
(d)
Pickup and delivery of items pertaining to branching activities where the messenger service is established by the national bank.
A national bank may establish and operate a messenger service to transport items relevant to the bank's transactions with its customers if such transactions constitute one or more branching functions within the meaning of 12 U.S.C. 36(j), provided the bank receives approval to establish a branch pursuant to 12 CFR 5.30.

§ 7.1014
Sale of money orders at nonbanking outlets by a national bank.
A national bank may designate bonded agents to sell the bank's money orders at nonbanking outlets. The responsibility of both the bank and its agent should be defined in a written agreement setting forth the duties of both parties and providing for remuneration of the agent. The bank's agents need not report on sales and transmit funds from the nonbanking outlets more frequently than at the end of the third business day following receipt of the funds.
§ 7.1015
National bank and Federal savings association investments in small business investment companies.
(a)
National banks.
A national bank may invest in a small business investment company (SBIC) or in any entity established solely to invest in SBICs, including purchasing the stock of a SBIC, subject to appropriate capital limitations (
see e.g.,
15 U.S.C. 682(b)), and may receive the benefits of such stock ownership (
e.g.,
stock dividends). The receipt and retention of a dividend by a national bank from a SBIC in the form of stock of a corporate borrower of the SBIC is not a purchase of stock within the meaning of 12 U.S.C. 24(Seventh).
(b)
Federal savings associations.
Federal savings associations may invest in a SBIC or in any entity established solely to invest in SBICs as provided in 12 CFR 160.30.
(c)
Qualifying SBIC.
A national bank or Federal savings association may invest in a SBIC that is either:
(1) Already organized and has obtained a license from the Small Business Administration; or
(2) In the process of being organized.
(d)
SBIC wind-down.
A national bank or Federal savings association may retain an interest in a SBIC that has voluntarily surrendered its license to operate as a SBIC in accordance with 13 CFR 107.1900 and does not make any new investments (other than investments in cash equivalents, which, for the purposes of this paragraph (d), means high quality, highly liquid investments whose maturity corresponds to the issuer's expected or potential need for funds and whose currency corresponds to the issuer's assets) after such voluntary surrender.
[85 FR 83728, Dec. 22, 2020]
§ 7.1016
Independent undertakings issued by a national bank or Federal savings association to pay against documents.
(a)
In general.
A national bank or Federal savings association may issue and commit to issue letters of credit and other independent undertakings within the scope of applicable laws or rules of practice recognized by law.
1
Under such independent undertakings, the national bank's or Federal savings association's obligation to honor depends upon the presentation of specified documents and not upon nondocumentary conditions or resolution of questions of fact or law at issue between the applicant and the beneficiary. A national bank or Federal savings association also may confirm or otherwise undertake to honor or purchase specified documents upon their presentation under another person's independent undertaking within the scope of such laws or rules.
1
Examples of such laws or rules of practice include: The applicable version of Article 5 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) (1962, as amended 1990) or revised Article 5 of the UCC (as amended 1995); the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits (International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) Publication No. 600 or any applicable prior version); the Supplements to UCP 500
600 for Electronic Presentation (eUCP v. 1.0, 1.1,
2.0) (Supplements to the Uniform Customs and Practices for Documentary Credits for Electronic Presentation); International Standby Practices (ISP98) (ICC Publication No. 590); the United Nations Convention on
Independent Guarantees and Stand-by Letters of Credit (adopted by the U.N. General Assembly in 1995 and signed by the U.S. in 1997); and the Uniform Rules for Bank-to-Bank Reimbursements Under Documentary Credits (ICC Publication No. 725).
(b)
Safety and soundness considerations
—(1)
Terms.
As a matter of safe and sound banking practice, national banks and Federal savings associations that issue independent undertakings should not be exposed to undue risk. At a minimum, national banks and Federal savings associations should consider the following:
(i) The independent character of the undertaking should be apparent from its terms (such as terms that subject it to laws or rules providing for its independent character);
(ii) The undertaking should be limited in amount;
(iii) The undertaking should:
(A) Be limited in duration; or
(B) Permit the national bank or Federal savings association to terminate the undertaking either on a periodic basis (consistent with the bank's or savings association's ability to make any necessary credit assessments) or at will upon either notice or payment to the beneficiary; or
(C) Entitle the national bank or Federal savings association to cash collateral from the applicant on demand (with a right to accelerate the applicant's obligations, as appropriate); and
(iv) The national bank or Federal savings association either should be fully collateralized or have a post-honor right of reimbursement from the applicant or from another issuer of an independent undertaking. Alternatively, if the national bank's or Federal savings association's undertaking is to purchase documents of title, securities, or other valuable documents, the bank or savings association should obtain a first priority right to realize on the documents if the bank or savings association is not otherwise to be reimbursed.
(2)
Additional considerations in special circumstances.
Certain undertakings require particular protections against credit, operational, and market risk:
(i) In the event that the undertaking is to honor by delivery of an item of value other than money, the national bank or Federal savings association should ensure that market fluctuations that affect the value of the item will not cause the bank or savings association to assume undue market risk;
(ii) In the event that the undertaking provides for automatic renewal, the terms for renewal should be consistent with the national bank's or Federal savings association's ability to make any necessary credit assessments prior to renewal;
(iii) In the event that a national bank or Federal savings association issues an undertaking for its own account, the underlying transaction for which it is issued must be within the bank's or savings association's authority and comply with any safety and soundness requirements applicable to that transaction.
(3)
Operational expertise.
The national bank or Federal savings association should possess operational expertise that is commensurate with the sophistication of its independent undertaking activities.
(4)
Documentation.
The national bank or Federal savings association must accurately reflect the bank's or savings association's undertakings in its records, including any acceptance or deferred payment or other absolute obligation arising out of its contingent undertaking.
(c)
Coverage.
An independent undertaking within the meaning of this section is not subject to the provisions of § 7.1017.
[61 FR 4862, Feb. 9, 1996, as amended at 64 FR 60099, Nov. 4, 1999; 68 FR 70131, Dec. 17, 2003; 73 FR 22241, Apr. 24, 2008; 85 FR 83728, Dec. 22, 2020]
§ 7.1017
National bank as guarantor or surety on indemnity bond.
(a) A national bank may lend its credit, bind itself as a surety to indemnify another, or otherwise become a guarantor (including, pursuant to 12 CFR 28.4, guaranteeing the deposits and other liabilities of its Edge corporations and Agreement corporations and of its corporate instrumentalities in foreign countries), if:
(1) The bank has a substantial interest in the performance of the transaction involved (for example, a bank, as fiduciary, has a sufficient interest in the faithful performance by a cofiduciary of its duties to act as surety on the bond of such cofiduciary); or
(2) The transaction is for the benefit of a customer and the bank obtains from the customer a segregated deposit that is sufficient in amount to cover the bank's total potential liability. A segregated deposit under this section includes collateral:
(i) In which the bank has perfected its security interest (for example, if the collateral is a printed security, the bank must have obtained physical control of the security, and, if the collateral is a book entry security, the bank must have properly recorded its security interest); and
(ii) That has a market value, at the close of each business day, equal to the bank's total potential liability and is composed of:
(A) Cash;
(B) Obligations of the United States or its agencies;
(C) Obligations fully guaranteed by the United States or its agencies as to principal and interest; or
(D) Notes, drafts, or bills of exchange or bankers' acceptances that are eligible for rediscount or purchase by a Federal Reserve Bank; or
(iii) That has a market value, at the close of each business day, equal to 110 percent of the bank's total potential liability and is composed of obligations of a State or political subdivision of a State.
(b) In addition to paragraph (a) of this section, a national bank may guarantee obligations of a customer, subsidiary or affiliate that are financial in character, provided the amount of the bank's financial obligation is reasonably ascertainable and otherwise consistent with applicable law.
[61 FR 4862, Feb. 9, 1996, as amended at 64 FR 60099, Nov. 4, 1999; 73 FR 22241, Apr. 24, 2008]
§ 7.1018
National bank automatic payment plan accounts.
A national bank may, for the benefit and convenience of its savings depositors, adopt an automatic payment plan under which a savings account will earn dividends at the current rate paid on regular savings accounts. The depositor, upon reaching a previously designated age, receives his or her accumulated savings and earned interest in installments of equal amounts over a specified period.
§ 7.1020
Purchase of open accounts by a national bank.
(a)
General.
The purchase of open accounts is a part of the business of banking and within the power of a national bank.
(b)
Export transactions.
A national bank may purchase open accounts in connection with export transactions; the accounts should be protected by insurance such as that provided by the Foreign Credit Insurance Association and the Export-Import Bank.
§ 7.1021
Financial literacy programs not branches of national banks.
A financial literacy program is a program the principal purpose of which is to be educational for members of the community. The premises of, or a facility used by, a school or other organization at which a national bank participates in a financial literacy program is not a branch for purposes of 12 U.S.C. 36 provided the bank does not establish and operate the premises or facility. The OCC considers establishment and operation in this context on a case by case basis, considering the facts and circumstances. However, the premises or facility is not a branch of the national bank if the safe harbor test in § 7.1012(c)(2) applicable to messenger services established by third parties is satisfied. The factor discussed in § 7.1012(c)(2)(i) can be met if bank employee participation in the financial literacy program consists of managing the program or conducting or engaging
in financial education activities provided the school or other organization retains control over the program and over the premises or facilities at which the program is held.
[85 FR 83729, Dec. 22, 2020]
§ 7.1022
National banks' authority to buy and sell exchange, coin, and bullion.
(a) In this section,
industrial or commercial metal
means metal (including an alloy) in a physical form primarily suited to industrial or commercial use, for example, copper cathodes.
(b)
Scope of authorization.
Section 24(Seventh) of the National Bank Act authorizes national banks to buy and sell exchange, coin, and bullion. Industrial or commercial metal is not exchange, coin, and bullion within the meaning of this authorization.
(c)
Buying and selling metal as part of or incidental to the business of banking.
Section 24(Seventh) authorizes national banks to engage in activities that are part of, or incidental to, the business of banking. Buying and selling industrial or commercial metal for the purpose of dealing or investing in that metal is not part of or incidental to the business of banking pursuant to section 24(Seventh). Accordingly, national banks may not acquire industrial or commercial metal for purposes of dealing or investing.
(d)
Other authorities not affected.
This section may not be construed to preclude a national bank from acquiring or selling metal in connection with its incidental authority to foreclose on loan collateral, compromise doubtful claims, or avoid loss in connection with a debt previously contracted. This section also may not be construed to preclude a national bank from buying and selling physical metal to hedge a derivative for which that metal is the reference asset so long as the amount of the physical metal used for hedging purposes is nominal.
(e)
Nonconforming holdings.
National banks that hold industrial or commercial metal as a result of dealing or investing in that metal must dispose of such metal as soon as practicable, but not later than one year from April 1, 2018. The OCC may grant up to four separate one-year extensions to dispose of industrial or commercial metal if a national bank makes a good faith effort to dispose of the metal and retention of the metal for an additional year is not inconsistent with the safe and sound operation of the bank.
[81 FR 96360, Dec. 30, 2016, as amended at 85 FR 83729, Dec. 22, 2020]
§ 7.1023
Federal savings associations, prohibition on industrial or commercial metal dealing or investing.
(a) In this section,
industrial or commercial metal
means metal (including an alloy) in a physical form primarily suited to industrial or commercial use, for example, copper cathodes.
(b) Federal savings associations may not deal or invest in industrial or commercial metal.
(c)
Other authorities not affected.
This section may not be construed to preclude a Federal savings association from acquiring or selling metal in connection with its authority to foreclose on loan collateral, compromise doubtful claims, or avoid loss in connection with a debt previously contracted.
(d)
Nonconforming holdings.
Federal savings associations that hold industrial or commercial metal as a result of dealing or investing in that metal must dispose of such metal as soon as practicable, but not later than one year from April 1, 2018. The OCC may grant up to four separate one-year extensions to dispose of industrial or commercial metal if a Federal savings association makes a good faith effort to dispose of the metal and retention of the metal for an additional year is not inconsistent with safe and sound operation of the association.
[81 FR 96360, Dec. 30, 2016, as amended at 85 FR 83729, Dec. 22, 2020]
§ 7.1024

(a)
Investment in real estate necessary for the transaction of business
—(1)
In general.
A national bank or Federal savings association may invest in real estate that is necessary for the transaction of its business.
(2)
Type of real estate.
Real estate investments permissible under this section include:
(i) Premises that are owned and occupied (or to be occupied, if under construction) by the national bank or Federal savings association, or its respective branches or consolidated subsidiaries;
(ii) Real estate acquired and intended, in good faith, for use in future expansion;
(iii) Parking facilities that are used by customers or employees of the national bank or Federal savings association, or its respective branches or consolidated subsidiaries;
(iv) Residential property for the use of officers or employees of the national bank or Federal savings association who are:
(A) Located in remote areas where suitable housing at a reasonable price is not readily available; or
(B) Temporarily assigned to a foreign country, including foreign nationals temporarily assigned to the United States; and
(v) Property for the use of national bank or Federal savings association officers, employees, or customers, or for the temporary lodging of such persons in areas where suitable commercial lodging is not readily available, provided that the purchase and operation of the property qualifies as a deductible business expense for Federal tax purposes.
(3)
Permissible means of holding.
(i) A national bank or Federal savings association may acquire and hold real estate under this paragraph (a) by any reasonable and prudent means, including ownership in fee, a leasehold estate, or in an interest in a cooperative. The national bank or Federal savings association may hold this real estate directly or through one or more subsidiaries. The national bank or Federal savings association may organize a banking premises subsidiary as a corporation, partnership, or similar entity (
e.g.,
a limited liability company).
(ii) A Federal savings association also may acquire and hold banking premises through a service corporation in accordance with 12 CFR 5.59.
(b)
Fixed assets.
A national bank or Federal savings association may own fixed assets necessary for the transaction of its business, such as fixtures, furniture, and data processing equipment.
(c)
Investment in banking premises
—(1)
Investment limitation.
Twelve CFR 5.37(d)(1)(i) and (d)(3)(i) provide quantitative investment limitations that govern when OCC approval is required for a national bank or Federal savings association to invest in banking premises.
(2)
Premises approval.
(i) A national bank or Federal savings association must seek approval from the OCC in accordance with 12 CFR 5.37(d).
(ii) A Federal savings association that invests in banking premises through a service corporation must comply with the quantitative limitations in 12 CFR 5.37(d) and, to the extent applicable, 12 CFR 5.59.
(3)
Option to purchase.
An unexercised option to purchase banking premises or stock in a corporation holding banking premises is not an investment in banking premises. However, a national bank or Federal savings association seeking to exercise such an option must comply with the requirements in 12 CFR 5.37(d).
(d)
Future national bank or Federal savings association expansion.
A national bank or Federal savings association normally should use real estate acquired for future national bank or Federal savings association expansion within five years. After holding such real estate for one year, the national bank or Federal savings association must state, by resolution of its board of directors or an appropriately authorized bank or savings association official or subcommittee of the board, definite plans for its use. The resolution or other official action must be available for inspection by OCC examiners.
(e)
Transition.
If, on May 18, 2015, a Federal savings association holds an investment in real estate, fixed assets, banking premises, or other real property that complies with the legal requirements in effect prior to May 18, 2015, but would violate any provision of this section or § 5.37, the savings association may continue to hold such investment in accordance with the prior legal requirements. However, a Federal savings association that holds such an investment may not modify, expand or improve this investment, except for
routine maintenance, without the prior approval of the appropriate OCC supervisory office.

Functional equivalent of a loan.
A tax equity finance transaction is the functional equivalent of a loan if:
(1) The structure of the transaction is necessary for making the tax credits or other tax benefits available to the national bank or Federal savings association;
(2) The transaction is of limited tenure and is not indefinite, including retaining a limited investment interest that is required by law to obtain continuing tax benefits or needed to obtain the expected rate of return;
(3) The tax benefits and other payments received by the national bank or Federal savings association from the transaction repay the investment and provide the expected rate of return at the time of underwriting;
(4) Consistent with paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the national bank or Federal savings association does not rely on appreciation of value in the project or property rights underlying the project for repayment;
(5) The national bank or Federal savings association uses underwriting and credit approval criteria and standards that are substantially equivalent to the underwriting and credit approval criteria and standards used for a traditional commercial loan;

(2) The national bank or Federal savings association limits the total dollar amount of tax equity finance transactions undertaken pursuant to this section to no more than five percent of its capital and surplus, unless the OCC determines, by written approval of a written request by the national bank or Federal savings association to exceed the five percent limit, that a higher aggregate limit will not pose an unreasonable risk to the national bank or Federal savings association and that the tax equity finance transactions in the national bank's or Federal savings association's portfolio will not be conducted in an unsafe or unsound manner; provided, however, that in no case may a national bank or Federal savings association's total dollar amount
of tax equity finance transactions undertaken pursuant to this section exceed 15 percent of its capital and surplus;
(3) The national bank or Federal savings association has provided written notification to the appropriate OCC supervisory office, prior to engaging in each tax equity finance transaction that includes its evaluation of the risks posed by the transaction;
(4) The national bank or Federal savings association can identify, measure, monitor, and control the associated risks of its tax equity finance transaction activities individually and as a whole on an ongoing basis to ensure that such activities are conducted in a safe and sound manner; and
(5) The national bank or Federal savings association obtains a legal opinion or has other good faith, reasoned bases for making a determination that tax credits or other tax benefits are available before engaging in a tax equity finance transaction.
(e)
Applicable legal requirements.
The transaction is subject to the substantive legal requirements of a loan, including the lending limits prescribed by 12 U.S.C. 84 and 12 U.S.C. 1464(u), as appropriate, as implemented by 12 CFR part 32, and if the active investor or project sponsor of the transaction is an affiliate of the bank, to the restrictions on transactions with affiliates prescribed by 12 U.S.C. 371c and 371c-1, as implemented by 12 CFR part 223.

(2)
Payment system with limits on liability or no liability.
A notice filed under paragraph (c)(2) of this section also must include a representation that either:
(i) The rules of the payment system do not impose liability for operational losses on members; or
(ii) The national bank's or Federal savings association's liability for operational losses is limited by the rules of the payment system to specific and appropriate limits that do not exceed the lower of:
(A) The legal lending limit under 12 CFR part 32; or
(B) The limit set for the bank or savings association by the OCC.
(e)
Safety and soundness procedures.
(1) Prior to joining a payment system, a national bank or Federal savings association must:
(i) Identify and evaluate the risks posed by membership in the payment system, taking into account whether the liability of the bank or savings association is limited; and
(ii) Ensure that it can measure, monitor, and control the risks identified pursuant to paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section.
(2) After joining a payment system, a national bank or Federal savings association must manage the risks of the payment system on an ongoing basis. This ongoing risk management must:
(i) Identify and evaluate the risks posed by membership in the payment system, taking into account whether the liability of the bank or savings association is limited; and
(ii) Measure, monitor, and control the risks identified pursuant to paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section.
(3) If the national bank or Federal savings association identifies risks during the ongoing risk management required by paragraph (e)(2) of this section that raise safety and soundness concerns, such as a material change to the bank's or savings association's liability or indemnification responsibilities, the national bank or Federal savings association must:
(i) Notify the appropriate OCC supervisory office as soon as the safety and soundness concern is identified; and
(ii) Take appropriate actions to remediate the risk.
(4) A national bank or Federal savings association that believes its open-ended liability is otherwise limited (
e.g.,
by negotiated agreements or laws of an appropriate jurisdiction) may consider its liability to be limited for purposes of the reviews required by paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section so long as:
(i) Prior to joining the payment system, the bank or savings association obtains a written legal opinion that:
(A) Describes how the payment system allocates liability for operational losses; and
(B) Concludes the potential liability for operational losses for the national bank or Federal savings association is in fact limited to specific and appropriate limits that do not exceed the lower of:
(
1
) The legal lending limit under 12 CFR part 32; or
(
2
) The limit set for the bank or savings association by the OCC; and
(ii) There are no material changes to the liability or indemnification requirements applicable to the bank or savings association since the issuance of the written legal opinion.
(f)
Safety and soundness considerations.
(1) A national bank or Federal savings association should evaluate, at a minimum, the following payment system characteristics when conducting an analysis required by paragraph (e) of this section:
(i) Does the processing occur on a real-time gross settlement basis or provide reasonable assurance (
e.g.,
prefunding, etc.) that members will meet settlement obligations?
(ii) How does the payment system's rules limit its liability to members?
(iii) Does the payment system have insurance coverage and/or self-insurance arrangements to cover operational losses?
(iv) Do the payment system's rules provide an unambiguous pro-rata loss allocation methodology under its indemnity provisions and does the methodology provide members the opportunity to reduce or eliminate liability exposure by decreasing or ceasing use of the payment system?
(v) Do the payment system's rules provide for unambiguous membership withdrawal procedures that do not require the prior approval of the system?
(vi) Does the payment system have appropriate admission and continuing participation requirements for system participants? Such requirements should address, among other things:
(A) The participants' access to sufficient financial resources to meet obligations arising from participation;
(B) The adequacy of participants' operational capacities to meet obligations arising from participation; and
(C) The adequacy of the participants' own risk management processes.
(vii) Does the payment system have processes and controls in place to verify and monitor on an ongoing basis the compliance of each participant with admission and participation requirements?
(viii) Does the payment system have written policies and procedures for addressing participant failures to meet ongoing participation requirements?
(ix) Are the payment system's rules relating to the system's emergency authorities unambiguous and may they be amended or otherwise altered without prior notification to all members and an opportunity to withdraw?

§ 7.1027
Establishment and operation of a remote service unit by a national bank.
A remote service unit (RSU) is an automated or unstaffed facility, operated by a customer of a bank with at most delimited assistance from bank personnel, that conducts banking functions such as receiving deposits, paying withdrawals, or lending money. A national bank may establish and operate an RSU pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 24(Seventh). An RSU includes an automated teller machine, automated loan machine, automated device for receiving deposits, personal computer, telephone, other similar electronic devices, and drop boxes. An RSU may be equipped with a telephone or tele-video device that allows contact with bank personnel. An RSU is not a “branch” within the meaning of 12 U.S.C. 36(j), and is not subject to State geographic or operational restrictions or licensing laws.

§ 7.1028
Establishment and operation of a deposit production office by a national bank.
(a)
In general.
A national bank or its operating subsidiary may engage in deposit production activities at a site other than the main office or a branch of the bank. A national bank or its operating subsidiary may solicit deposits, provide information about deposit products, and assist persons in completing application forms and related documents to open a deposit account at a deposit production office (DPO). A DPO is not a branch within the meaning of 12 U.S.C. 36(j) and 12 CFR 5.30(d)(1) so long as it does not receive deposits, pay withdrawals, or make loans. All deposit and withdrawal transactions of a bank customer using a DPO must be performed by the customer, either in person at the main office or a branch office of the bank, or by mail, electronic transfer, or a similar method of transfer.
(b)
Services of other persons.
A national bank may use the services of, and compensate, persons not employed by the bank in its deposit production activities.
[85 FR 83732, Dec. 22, 2020]
§ 7.1029
Combination of national bank loan production office, deposit production office, and remote service unit.
A location at which a national bank operates a loan production office (LPO), a deposit production office (DPO), and a remote service unit (RSU) is not a “branch” within the meaning of 12 U.S.C. 36(j) by virtue of that combination. Since an LPO, DPO, or RSU is not, individually, a branch under 12 U.S.C. 36(j), any combination of these facilities at one location does not create a branch. The RSU at such a combined location must be primarily operated by the customer with at most delimited assistance from bank personnel.

(ii) If shareholders have the right to call special meetings, a high percentage of shareholders is needed to call the meeting.
(5)
Shareholder removal of a director only for cause.
State provisions that provide, or that permit the corporation to provide in its certificate of incorporation or other governing document, that shareholders may remove a director only for cause, and not both for cause and without cause.

The following State anti-takeover provisions are inconsistent with Federal banking statutes or regulations:
(1)
Supermajority voting requirements.
State provisions that require, or that
permit the corporation to require in its certificate of incorporation or other governing document, a supermajority of the shareholders to approve specified matters are inconsistent when applied to matters for which Federal banking statutes or regulations specify the required level of shareholder approval.
(2)
Restrictions on a shareholder's right to vote all the shares it owns.
State provisions that prohibit, or that permit the corporation in its certificate of incorporation or other governing document to prohibit, a person from voting shares acquired that increase their percentage of ownership of the company's stock above a certain level are inconsistent when applied to shareholder votes governed by 12 U.S.C. 61.
(d)
Bank safety and soundness
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, any State corporate governance provision, including anti-takeover provisions, that would render more difficult or discourage an injection of capital by purchase of bank stock, a merger, the acquisition of the bank, a tender offer, a proxy contest, the assumption of control by a holder of a large block of the bank's stock, or the removal of the incumbent board of directors or management is inconsistent with bank safety and soundness if:

(e)
Case-by-case review
—(1)

A national bank must follow the provisions for approval by the board of directors and approval of shareholders for the adoption of an anti-takeover provision in the State corporate governance law it has elected to follow. However, if the provision is included in the bank's articles of association, the bank's shareholders must approve the amendment of the articles pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 21a, even if the State law does not require approval by the shareholders.
(2)
Documentation.
If the State corporate governance law requires the anti-takeover provision to be in the company's articles of incorporation, certificate of incorporation, or similar document, the national bank must include the provision in its articles of association. If the State corporate governance law does not require the provision to be in the company's articles of incorporation, certificate of incorporation, or similar document, but allows it to be in the bylaws, then the national bank must include the provision in either its articles of association or in its bylaws, provided, however, that if the State corporate governance law requires shareholder approval for changes to the corporation's bylaws, then the national bank must include the provision in its articles of association.

The failure of directors to require bonds with adequate sureties and in sufficient amount may make the directors liable for any losses that the bank or savings association sustains because of the absence of such bonds. Directors should not serve as sureties on such bonds. Directors should consider whether agents who have access to assets of the bank or savings association should also have fidelity bond coverage.
(b)
Factors.
The board of directors of the national bank or Federal savings association, or a committee thereof, must determine the amount of such coverage, premised upon a consideration of factors, including:
(1) Internal auditing safeguards employed;
(2) Number of employees;
(3) Amount of deposit liabilities; and
(4) Amount of cash and securities normally held by the bank or savings association.

§ 7.2014
Indemnification of national bank and Federal savings association institution-affiliated parties.
(a)
Indemnification under State law.
Subject to the limitations of paragraph (b) of this section, a national bank or Federal savings association may indemnify an institution-affiliated party for damages and expenses, including the advancement of expenses and legal fees, in accordance with the law of the State the bank or savings association has designated for its corporate governance pursuant to § 7.2000(b) (for national banks), 12 CFR 5.21(j)(3)(ii) (for Federal mutual savings associations), or 12 CFR 5.22(j)(2)(ii) (for Federal stock savings associations), provided such payments are consistent with safe and sound banking practices. The term “institution-affiliated party” has the same meaning as set forth at 12 U.S.C. 1813(u).
(b)
Administrative proceedings or civil actions initiated by Federal banking agencies.
With respect to an administrative proceeding or civil action initiated by any Federal banking agency, a national bank or Federal savings association may only make or agree to make indemnification payments to an institution-affiliated party that are reasonable and consistent with the requirements of 12 U.S.C. 1828(k) and 12 CFR chapter III.
(c)
Written agreement required for advancement.
Before advancing funds to an institutional-affiliated party under this section, a national bank or Federal savings association must obtain a written agreement that the institution-affiliated party will reimburse the bank or savings association, as appropriate, for any portion of that indemnification that the institution-affiliated party is ultimately found not to be entitled to under 12 U.S.C. 1828(k) and 12 CFR chapter III, except to the extent that the bank's or savings association's expenses have been reimbursed by an insurance policy or fidelity bond.
(d)
Insurance premiums.
A national bank or Federal savings association may provide for the payment of reasonable premiums for insurance covering the expenses, legal fees, and liability of institution-affiliated parties to the extent that the expenses, fees, or liability could be indemnified under this section.
[85 FR 83735, Dec. 22, 2020]
§ 7.2015
National bank cashier.
A national bank's bylaws, board of directors, or a duly designated officer may assign some or all of the duties previously performed by the bank's cashier to its president, chief executive officer, or any other officer.
§ 7.2016
Restricting transfer of national bank stock and record dates; stock certificates.
(a)
Restricting transfer of stock and record dates
—(1)
Conditions for stock transfer.
Under 12 U.S.C. 52, a national bank may impose conditions upon the transfer of its stock reasonably calculated to simplify the work of the bank with respect to stock transfers, voting at shareholders' meetings, and related matters and to protect it against fraudulent transfers.
(2)
Record dates.
A national bank may close its stock records for a reasonable period to ascertain shareholders for voting purposes. The board of directors may fix a record date for determining the shareholders entitled to notice of, and to vote at, any meeting of shareholders. The record date should be in reasonable proximity to the date that notice is given to the shareholders of the meeting.
(b)
Bank stock certificates.
(1) A national bank may prescribe the manner in which its stock must be transferred in its bylaws or articles of association. A bank issuing stock in certificated form must comply with the requirements of 12 U.S.C. 52, including as to:
(i) The name and location of the bank;
(ii) The name of the holder of record of the stock represented thereby;
(iii) The number and class of shares which the certificate represents;
(iv) If the bank issues more than one class of stock, the respective rights, preferences, privileges, voting rights, powers, restrictions, limitations, and qualifications of each class of stock issued (unless incorporated by reference to the articles of association);
(v) Signatures of the president and cashier of the bank, or such other officers as the bylaws of the bank provide; and
(vi) The seal of the bank.
(2) The requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(v) of this section may be met through the use of electronic means or by facsimile.
[61 FR 4862, Feb. 9, 1996, as amended at 85 FR 83735, Dec. 22, 2020]
§ 7.2019
Loans secured by a national bank's own shares.
(a)
Permitted agreements, relating to bank shares.
A national bank may require a borrower holding shares of the bank to execute agreements:
(1) Not to pledge, give away, transfer, or otherwise assign such shares;
(2) To pledge such shares at the request of the bank when necessary to prevent loss; and
(3) To leave such shares in the bank's custody.
(b)
Use of capital notes and debentures.
A national bank may not make loans secured by a pledge of the bank's own capital notes and debentures. Such notes and debentures must be subordinated to the claims of depositors and other creditors of the issuing bank, and are, therefore, capital instruments within the purview of 12 U.S.C. 83.
§ 7.2021
National bank preemptive rights.
A national bank in its articles of association must grant or deny preemptive rights to the bank's shareholders. Any amendment to a national bank's articles of association which modifies such preemptive rights must be approved by a vote of the holders of two-thirds of the bank's outstanding voting shares.
§ 7.2022
National bank voting trusts.
The shareholders of a national bank may establish a voting trust under the applicable law of a State selected by the participants and designated in the trust agreement, provided the implementation of the trust is consistent with safe and sound banking practices.

(a)
Authority to engage in reverse stock splits.
A national bank may engage in a reverse stock split if the transaction serves a legitimate corporate purpose and provides adequate dissenting shareholders' rights.
(b)
Legitimate corporate purpose.
Examples of legitimate corporate purposes include a reverse stock split to:
(1) Reduce the number of shareholders in order to qualify as a Subchapter S corporation; and
(2) Reduce costs associated with shareholder communications and meetings.
[64 FR 60099, Nov. 4, 1999]
§ 7.2024
Staggered terms for national bank directors and size of bank board.
(a)
Staggered terms.
Any national bank may adopt bylaws that provide for staggering the terms of its directors. National banks must provide the OCC with copies of any bylaws so amended.
(b)
Maximum term.
Any national bank director may hold office for a term that does not exceed three years.
(c)
Number of directors.
A national bank's board of directors must consist of no fewer than 5 and no more than 25 members. A national bank may, after notice to the OCC, increase the size of its board of directors above the 25 member limit. A national bank seeking to increase the number of its directors must notify the OCC any time the proposed size would exceed 25 directors. The bank's notice must specify the reason(s) for the increase in the size of the board of directors beyond the statutory limit.
[68 FR 70131, Dec. 17, 2003, as amended at 85 FR 83736, Dec. 22, 2020]
§ 7.2025
Capital stock-related activities of a national bank.
(a)
In general.
A national bank must obtain the necessary shareholder approval required by 12 U.S.C. 51a, 57, or 59 for any change in its permanent capital. An increase or decrease in the amount of a national bank's common or preferred stock is a change in permanent capital subject to the notice and approval requirements of 12 CFR 5.46 and applicable law. A national bank may obtain the required shareholder approval of changes in permanent capital, as provided in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section.
(b)
Issuance of previously approved and authorized common stock.
In compliance with 12 U.S.C. 57, a national bank may issue common stock up to an amount previously approved and authorized in the national bank's articles of association by holders of two-thirds of the national bank's shares without obtaining additional shareholder approval for each subsequent issuance within the authorized amount.
(c)
Issuance, repurchase, and redemption of preferred stock pursuant to certain procedures.
Subject to the requirements of 12 U.S.C. 51a and 59, a national bank may adopt procedures to authorize the board of directors to issue, determine the terms of, repurchase, and redeem one or more series of preferred stock, if permitted by the corporate governance provisions adopted by the bank under § 7.2000. To satisfy the shareholder approval requirements of 12 U.S.C. 51a and 59, the adoption of such procedures must be approved by shareholders in advance through an amendment to the national bank's articles of association. Any amendment to a national bank's articles of association that authorizes both the issuance and the repurchase and redemption of shares must be approved by holders of two-thirds of the national bank's shares.
(d)
Share repurchase programs.
Subject to the requirements of 12 U.S.C. 59, a national bank may establish a program for the repurchase, from time to time, of the national bank's common or preferred stock, if permitted by the corporate governance provisions adopted by the bank under § 7.2000. To satisfy the shareholder approval requirement of 12 U.S.C. 59, the repurchase program must be approved in advance by the holders of two-thirds of the national bank's shares, including through an amendment to the national bank's articles of association that authorizes the board of directors to repurchase the national bank's common or preferred stock from time to time under board-determined parameters that can limit the frequency, type, aggregate limit, or purchase price of repurchases.
(e)
Preferred Stock Features.
A national bank's preferred stock may be cumulative or non-cumulative and may or may not have voting rights on one or more series.
[85 FR 83736, Dec. 22, 2020]

# Subpart C—National Bank and Federal Savings Association Operations
§ 7.3000
National bank and Federal savings association operating hours and closings.
(a)
Operating hours.
The board of directors of a national bank or Federal savings association, or an equivalent person or committee of a Federal branch or agency, should review its hours of operations for customers and, independently of any other bank, savings association, or Federal branch or agency, take appropriate action to establish a schedule of operating hours for customers.
(b)
Emergency closings declared by the Comptroller.
Pursuant to 12 U.S.C.
95(b)(1) and 1463(a)(1)(A), the Comptroller of the Currency (Comptroller), may declare any day a legal holiday if emergency conditions exist. That day is a legal holiday for national banks, Federal savings associations, and Federal branches or agencies in the affected geographic area (
i.e.,
throughout the United States, in a State, or in part of a State), and national banks, Federal savings associations, and Federal branches and agencies may temporarily limit or suspend operations at their affected offices, unless the Comptroller by written order directs otherwise. Emergency conditions may be caused by acts of nature or of man and may include natural and other disasters, public health or safety emergencies, civil and municipal emergencies, and cyber threats or other unauthorized intrusions (
e.g.,
severe flooding, a pandemic, terrorism, a cyber-attack on bank systems, or a power emergency declared by a local power company or government requesting that businesses in the affected area close). The Comptroller may issue a proclamation authorizing the emergency closing in anticipation of the emergency condition, at the time of the emergency condition, or soon thereafter. In the absence of a Comptroller declaration of a bank holiday, a national bank, Federal savings associations, or Federal branch or agency may choose to temporarily close offices in response to an emergency condition. The national bank, Federal savings associations, or Federal branch or agency should notify the OCC of such temporary closure as soon as feasible.
(c)
Emergency and ceremonial closings declared by a State or State official.
In the event a State or a legally authorized State official declares any day to be a legal holiday for emergency or ceremonial reasons in that State or part of the State, that same day is a legal holiday for national banks, Federal savings associations, and Federal branches or agencies or their offices in the affected geographic area. National banks, Federal savings associations, and Federal branches or agencies or their affected offices may close their affected offices or remain open on such a State-designated holiday, unless the Comptroller by written order directs otherwise.
(d)
Liability.
A national bank, Federal savings association, or Federal branch or agency should assure that all liabilities or other obligations under the applicable law due to its closing are satisfied.
(e)
Definition.
For the purpose of this subpart, the term “State” means any of the several States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, or any other territory or possession of the United States.
[85 FR 83736, Dec. 22, 2020]
§ 7.3001
Sharing national bank or Federal association space and employees.

(1) Consistent with § 7.1024, lease excess space on national bank or Federal savings association premises to one or more other businesses (including other financial institutions);
(2) Share space jointly held with one or more other businesses; or
(3) Offer its services in space owned by or leased to other businesses.
(b)
Sharing employees.
When sharing space with other businesses as described in paragraph (a) of this section, a national bank or Federal savings association may provide, under one or more written agreements between the national bank or Federal savings association, the other businesses, and their employees, that:
(1) A national bank or Federal savings association employee may act as agent for the other business; or
(2) An employee of the other business may act as agent for the national bank or Federal savings association.
(c)
Supervisory conditions.
When a national bank or Federal savings association engages in arrangements of the types listed in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the national bank or Federal savings association must ensure that:
(1) The other business is conspicuously, accurately, and separately identified;
(2) Shared employees clearly and fully disclose the nature of their agency relationship to customers of the national bank or Federal savings association and of the other businesses so that customers will know the identity of the national bank, Federal savings association, or other business that is providing the product or service;
(3) The arrangement does not constitute a joint venture or partnership with the other business under applicable State law;
(4) All aspects of the relationship between the national bank or Federal savings association and the other business are conducted at arm's length, unless a special arrangement is warranted because the other business is a subsidiary of the national bank or Federal savings association;
(5) Security issues arising from the activities of the other business on the premises are addressed;
(6) The activities of the other business do not adversely affect the safety and soundness of the national bank or Federal savings association;
(7) The shared employees or the entity for which they perform services are duly licensed or meet qualification requirements of applicable statutes and regulations pertaining to agents or employees of such other business; and
(8) The assets and records of the parties are segregated.
(d)
Other legal requirements.
When entering into arrangements of the types described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, and in conducting operations pursuant to those arrangements, a national bank or Federal savings association must ensure that each arrangement complies with all applicable laws and regulations. If the arrangement involves an affiliate or a shareholder, director, officer or employee of the national bank or Federal savings association:
(1) The national bank or Federal savings association must ensure compliance with all applicable statutory and regulatory provisions governing national bank or Federal savings association transactions with these persons or entities;
(2) The parties must comply with all applicable fiduciary duties; and
(3) The parties, if they are in competition with each other, must consider limitations, if any, imposed by applicable antitrust laws.
(e)
Transition.
If, on May 18, 2015, a Federal savings association shares space or employees with another business under an agreement that complies with the legal requirements that were in effect prior to May 18, 2015, but which would violate any provision of this section, the Federal savings association may continue sharing under the existing agreement but it may not amend, renew, or extend the agreement without prior approval of the appropriate OCC supervisory office.

# Subpart D—Preemption
§ 7.4000
Visitorial powers with respect to national banks.
(a)
General rule.
(1) Under 12 U.S.C. 484, only the OCC or an authorized representative of the OCC may exercise visitorial powers with respect to national banks. State officials may not exercise visitorial powers with respect to national banks, such as conducting examinations, inspecting or requiring the production of books or records of national banks, or prosecuting enforcement actions, except in limited circumstances authorized by federal law. However, production of a bank's records (other than non-public OCC information under 12 CFR part 4, subpart C) may be required under normal judicial procedures.
(2) For purposes of this section, visitorial powers include:
(i) Examination of a bank;
(ii) Inspection of a bank's books and records;
(iii) Regulation and supervision of activities authorized or permitted pursuant to federal banking law; and
(iv) Enforcing compliance with any applicable Federal or state laws concerning those activities, including through investigations that seek to ascertain compliance through production of non-public information by the bank, except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section.
(3) Unless otherwise provided by Federal law, the OCC has exclusive
visitorial authority with respect to the content and conduct of activities authorized for national banks under Federal law.
(b)
Exclusion.
In accordance with the decision of the Supreme Court in
Cuomo
v.
Clearing House Assn., L. L. C.,
129 S. Ct. 2710 (2009), an action against a national bank in a court of appropriate jurisdiction brought by a state attorney general (or other chief law enforcement officer) to enforce an applicable law against a national bank and to seek relief as authorized by such law is not an exercise of visitorial powers under 12 U.S.C. 484.
(c)
Exceptions to the general rule.
Under 12 U.S.C. 484, the OCC's exclusive visitorial powers are subject to the following exceptions:
(1)
Exceptions authorized by Federal law.
National banks are subject to such visitorial powers as are provided by Federal law. Examples of laws vesting visitorial power in other governmental entities include laws authorizing state or other Federal officials to:
(i) Inspect the list of shareholders, provided that the official is authorized to assess taxes under state authority (12 U.S.C. 62; this section also authorizes inspection of the shareholder list by shareholders and creditors of a national bank);
(ii) Review, at reasonable times and upon reasonable notice to a bank, the bank's records solely to ensure compliance with applicable state unclaimed property or escheat laws upon reasonable cause to believe that the bank has failed to comply with those laws (12 U.S.C. 484(b));
(iii) Verify payroll records for unemployment compensation purposes (26 U.S.C. 3305(c));
(iv) Ascertain the correctness of Federal tax returns (26 U.S.C. 7602);
(v) Enforce the Fair Labor Standards Act (29 U.S.C. 211); and
(vi) Functionally regulate certain activities, as provided under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, Pub. L. 106-102, 113 Stat. 1338 (Nov. 12, 1999).
(2)
Exception for courts of justice.
National banks are subject to such visitorial powers as are vested in the courts of justice. This exception pertains to the powers inherent in the judiciary.
(3)
Exception for Congress.
National banks are subject to such visitorial powers as shall be, or have been, exercised or directed by Congress or by either House thereof or by any committee of Congress or of either House duly authorized.
(d)
Report of examination.
The report of examination made by an OCC examiner is designated solely for use in the supervision of the bank. The bank's copy of the report is the property of the OCC and is loaned to the bank and any holding company thereof solely for its confidential use. The bank's directors, in keeping with their responsibilities both to depositors and to shareholders, should thoroughly review the report. The report may be made available to other persons only in accordance with the rules on disclosure in 12 CFR part 4.
[61 FR 4862, Feb. 9, 1996, as amended at 64 FR 60100, Nov. 4, 1999; 69 FR 1904, Jan. 13, 2004; 76 FR 43565, July 21, 2011]
§ 7.4001
Charging interest by national banks at rates permitted competing institutions; charging interest to corporate borrowers.
(a)
Definition.
The term “interest” as used in 12 U.S.C. 85 includes any payment compensating a creditor or prospective creditor for an extension of credit, making available of a line of credit, or any default or breach by a borrower of a condition upon which credit was extended. It includes, among other things, the following fees connected with credit extension or availability: numerical periodic rates, late fees, creditor-imposed not sufficient funds (NSF) fees charged when a borrower tenders payment on a debt with a check drawn on insufficient funds, overlimit fees, annual fees, cash advance fees, and membership fees. It does not ordinarily include appraisal fees, premiums and commissions attributable to insurance guaranteeing repayment of any extension of credit, finders' fees, fees for document preparation or notarization, or fees incurred to obtain credit reports.
(b)
Authority.
A national bank located in a state may charge interest at the maximum rate permitted to any state-chartered or licensed lending institution by the law of that state. If
state law permits different interest charges on specified classes of loans, a national bank making such loans is subject only to the provisions of state law relating to that class of loans that are material to the determination of the permitted interest. For example, a national bank may lawfully charge the highest rate permitted to be charged by a state-licensed small loan company, without being so licensed, but subject to state law limitations on the size of loans made by small loan companies.
(c)
Effect on state definitions of interest.
The Federal definition of the term “interest” in paragraph (a) of this section does not change how interest is defined by the individual states (nor how the state definition of interest is used) solely for purposes of state law. For example, if late fees are not “interest” under state law where a national bank is located but state law permits its most favored lender to charge late fees, then a national bank located in that state may charge late fees to its intrastate customers. The national bank may also charge late fees to its interstate customers because the fees are interest under the Federal definition of interest and an allowable charge under state law where the national bank is located. However, the late fees would not be treated as interest for purposes of evaluating compliance with state usury limitations because state law excludes late fees when calculating the maximum interest that lending institutions may charge under those limitations.
(d)
Usury.
A national bank located in a state the law of which denies the defense of usury to a corporate borrower may charge a corporate borrower any rate of interest agreed upon by a corporate borrower.
(e)
Transferred loans.
Interest on a loan that is permissible under 12 U.S.C. 85 shall not be affected by the sale, assignment, or other transfer of the loan.
[61 FR 4862, Feb. 9, 1996, as amended at 66 FR 34791, July 2, 2001; 85 FR 33536, June 2, 2020]
§ 7.4002
National bank charges.
(a)
Authority to impose charges and fees.
A national bank may charge its customers non-interest charges and fees, including deposit account service charges.
(b)
Considerations.
(1) All charges and fees should be arrived at by each bank on a competitive basis and not on the basis of any agreement, arrangement, undertaking, understanding, or discussion with other banks or their officers.
(2) The establishment of non-interest charges and fees, their amounts, and the method of calculating them are business decisions to be made by each bank, in its discretion, according to sound banking judgment and safe and sound banking principles. A national bank establishes non-interest charges and fees in accordance with safe and sound banking principles if the bank employs a decision-making process through which it considers the following factors, among others:
(i) The cost incurred by the bank in providing the service;
(ii) The deterrence of misuse by customers of banking services;
(iii) The enhancement of the competitive position of the bank in accordance with the bank's business plan and marketing strategy; and
(iv) The maintenance of the safety and soundness of the institution.
(c)
Interest.
Charges and fees that are “interest” within the meaning of 12 U.S.C. 85 are governed by § 7.4001 and not by this section.
(d)
State law.
The OCC applies preemption principles derived from the United States Constitution, as interpreted through judicial precedent, when determining whether State laws apply that purport to limit or prohibit charges and fees described in this section.
(e)
National bank as fiduciary.
This section does not apply to charges imposed by a national bank in its capacity as a fiduciary, which are governed by 12 CFR part 9.
[66 FR 34791, July 2, 2001]

Authority of national banks.
A national bank may make, sell, purchase, participate in, or otherwise deal in loans and interests in loans that are not secured by liens on, or interests in, real estate, subject to such terms, conditions, and limitations prescribed by the Comptroller of the Currency and any other applicable Federal law.
(b)
Standards for loans.
A national bank shall not make a consumer loan subject to this § 7.4008 based predominantly on the bank's realization of the foreclosure or liquidation value of the borrower's collateral, without regard to the borrower's ability to repay the loan according to its terms. A bank may use any reasonable method to determine a borrower's ability to repay, including, for example, the borrower's current and expected income, current and expected cash flows, net worth, other relevant financial resources, current financial obligations, employment status, credit history, or other relevant factors.
(c)
Unfair and deceptive practices.
A national bank shall not engage in unfair or deceptive practices within the meaning of section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. 45(a)(1), and regulations promulgated thereunder in connection with loans made under this § 7.4008.
(d)
Applicability of state law.
A national bank may make non-real estate loans without regard to state law limitations concerning:
(1) Licensing, registration (except for purposes of service of process), filings, or reports by creditors;
(2) The ability of a creditor to require or obtain insurance for collateral or other credit enhancements or risk mitigants, in furtherance of safe and sound banking practices;
(3) Loan-to-value ratios;
(4) The terms of credit, including the schedule for repayment of principal and interest, amortization of loans, balance, payments due, minimum payments, or term to maturity of the loan, including the circumstances under which a loan may be called due and payable upon the passage of time or a specified event external to the loan;
(5) Escrow accounts, impound accounts, and similar accounts;
(6) Security property, including leaseholds;
(7) Access to, and use of, credit reports;
(8) Disclosure and advertising, including laws requiring specific statements, information, or other content to be included in credit application forms, credit solicitations, billing statements, credit contracts, or other credit-related documents;

# Subpart E—National Bank Electronic Activities

# Source:
67 FR 35004, May 17, 2002, unless otherwise noted.
§ 7.5000
Scope.
This subpart applies to a national bank's use of technology to deliver services and products consistent with safety and soundness.
§ 7.5001
Electronic activities that are incidental to the business of banking.
In addition to the electronic activities specifically permitted in § 7.5004 (sale of excess electronic capacity and by-products) and § 7.5006 (incidental non-financial data processing), the OCC has determined that the following electronic activities are incidental to the business of banking, pursuant to § 7.1000. This list of activities is illustrative and not exclusive; the OCC may
determine that other activities are permissible pursuant to this authority.
(a) Website development where incidental to other banking services;
(b) Internet access and email provided on a non-profit basis as a promotional activity;
(c) Advisory and consulting services on electronic activities where the services are incidental to customer use of electronic banking services; and
(d) Sale of equipment that is convenient or useful to customer's use of related electronic banking services, such as specialized terminals for scanning checks that will be deposited electronically by wholesale customers of banks under the Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act, Public Law 108-100 (12 U.S.C. 5001-5018) (the Check 21 Act).
[85 FR 83737, Dec. 22, 2020]
§ 7.5002
Furnishing of products and services by electronic means and facilities.
(a)
Use of electronic means and facilities.
A national bank may perform, provide, or deliver through electronic means and facilities any activity, function, product, or service that it is otherwise authorized to perform, provide, or deliver, subject to § 7.5001(b) and applicable OCC guidance. The following list provides examples of permissible activities under this authority. This list is illustrative and not exclusive; the OCC may determine that other activities are permissible pursuant to this authority.
(1) Acting as an electronic finder by:
(i) Establishing, registering, and hosting commercially enabled web sites in the name of sellers;
(ii) Establishing hyperlinks between the bank's site and a third-party site, including acting as a “virtual mall” by providing a collection of links to web sites of third-party vendors, organized by-product type and made available to bank customers;
(iii) Hosting an electronic marketplace on the bank's Internet web site by providing links to the web sites of third-party buyers or sellers through the use of hypertext or other similar means;
(iv) Hosting on the bank's servers the Internet web site of:
(A) A buyer or seller that provides information concerning the hosted party and the products or services offered or sought and allows the submission of interest, bids, offers, orders and confirmations relating to such products or services; or
(B) A governmental entity that provides information concerning the services or benefits made available by the governmental entity, assists persons in completing applications to receive such services or benefits and permits persons to transmit their applications for such services or benefits;
(v) Operating an Internet web site that permits numerous buyers and sellers to exchange information concerning the products and services that they are willing to purchase or sell, locate potential counter-parties for transactions, aggregate orders for goods or services with those made by other parties, and enter into transactions between themselves;
(vi) Operating a telephone call center that provides permissible finder services; and
(vii) Providing electronic communications services relating to all aspects of transactions between buyers and sellers;
(2) Providing electronic bill presentment services;
(3) Offering electronic stored value systems;
(4) Safekeeping for personal information or valuable confidential trade or business information, such as encryption keys; and
(5) Issuing electronic letters of credit within the scope of 12 CFR 7.1016.
(b)
Applicability of guidance and requirements not affected.
When a national bank performs, provides, or delivers through electronic means and facilities an activity, function, product, or service that it is otherwise authorized to perform, provide, or deliver, the electronic activity is not exempt from the regulatory requirements and supervisory guidance that the OCC would apply if the activity were conducted by non-electronic means or facilities.
(c)
State laws.
As a general rule, and except as provided by Federal law, State law is not applicable to a national bank's conduct of an authorized activity through electronic means or
facilities if the State law, as applied to the activity, would be preempted pursuant to traditional principles of Federal preemption derived from the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution and applicable judicial precedent. Accordingly, State laws that stand as an obstacle to the ability of national banks to exercise uniformly their Federally authorized powers through electronic means or facilities, are not applicable to national banks.
[61 FR 4862, Feb. 9, 1996, as amended at 73 FR 22242, Apr. 24, 2008]
§ 7.5003
Composite authority to engage in electronic activities.
Unless otherwise prohibited by Federal law, a national bank may engage in an electronic activity that is comprised of several component activities if each of the component activities is itself part of or incidental to the business of banking or is otherwise permissible under Federal law.
§ 7.5004
Sale of excess electronic capacity and by-products.
(a) A national bank may, in order to optimize the use of the bank's resources or avoid economic loss or waste, market and sell to third parties electronic capacities legitimately acquired or developed by the bank for its banking business.
(b) With respect to acquired equipment or facilities, legitimate excess electronic capacity that may be sold to others can arise in a variety of situations, including the following:
(1) Due to the characteristics of the desired equipment or facilities available in the market, the capacity of the most practical optimal equipment or facilities available to meet the bank's requirements exceeds its present needs;
(2) The acquisition and retention of additional capacity, beyond present needs, reasonably may be necessary for planned future expansion or to meet the expected future banking needs during the useful life of the equipment;
(3) Requirements for capacity fluctuate because a bank engages in batch processing of banking transactions or because a bank must have capacity to meet peak period demand with the result that the bank has periods when its capacity is underutilized; and
(4) After the initial acquisition of capacity thought to be fully needed for banking operations, the bank experiences either a decline in level of the banking operations or an increase in the efficiency of the banking operations using that capacity.
(c) Types of electronic capacity in equipment or facilities that banks may have legitimately acquired and that may be sold to third parties if excess to the bank's needs for banking purposes include:
(1) Data processing services;
(2) Production and distribution of non-financial software;

(7) Electronic imaging and storage.
(d) A national bank may sell to third parties electronic by-products legitimately acquired or developed by the bank for its banking business. Examples of electronic by-products that banks may have legitimately acquired that may be sold to third parties if excess to the bank's needs include:
(1) Software acquired (not merely licensed) or developed by the bank for banking purposes or to support its banking business; and
(2) Electronic databases, records, or media (such as electronic images) developed by the bank for or during the performance of its permissible data processing activities.
§ 7.5005
National bank acting as digital certification authority.
(a) It is part of the business of banking under 12 U.S.C. 24(Seventh) for a national bank to act as a certificate authority and to issue digital certificates verifying the identity of persons associated with a particular public/private key pair. As part of this service, the bank may also maintain a listing or repository of public keys.
(b) A national bank may issue digital certificates verifying attributes in addition to identity of persons associated with a particular public/private key pair where the attribute is one for
which verification is part of or incidental to the business of banking. For example, national banks may issue digital certificates verifying certain financial attributes of a customer as of the current or a previous date, such as account balance as of a particular date, lines of credit as of a particular date, past financial performance of the customer, and verification of customer relationship with the bank as of a particular date.
(c) When a national bank issues a digital certificate relating to financial capacity under this section, the bank shall include in that certificate an express disclaimer stating that the bank does not thereby promise or represent that funds will be available or will be advanced for any particular transaction.
§ 7.5006
Data processing.
(a)
Eligible activities.
It is part of the business of banking under 12 U.S.C. 24(Seventh) for a national bank to provide data processing, and data transmission services, facilities (including equipment, technology, and personnel), data bases, advice and access to such services, facilities, data bases and advice, for itself and for others, where the data is banking, financial, or economic data, and other types of data if the derivative or resultant product is banking, financial, or economic data. For this purpose, economic data includes anything of value in banking and financial decisions.
(b)
Other data.
A national bank also may perform the activities described in paragraph (a) of this section for itself and others with respect to additional types of data to the extent convenient or useful to provide the data processing services described in paragraph (a), including where reasonably necessary to conduct those activities on a competitive basis. The total revenue attributable to the bank's data processing activities under this section must be derived predominantly from processing the activities described in paragraph (a) of this section.
(c)
Software for performance of authorized banking functions.
A national bank may produce, market, or sell software that performs services or functions that the bank could perform directly, as part of the business of banking.
[61 FR 4862, Feb. 9, 1996, as amended at 73 FR 22242, Apr. 24, 2008]
§ 7.5007
Correspondent services.
It is part of the business of banking for a national bank to offer as a correspondent service to any of its affiliates or to other financial institutions any service it may perform for itself. The following list provides examples of electronic activities that banks may offer correspondents under this authority. This list is illustrative and not exclusive; the OCC may determine that other activities are permissible pursuant to this authority.
(a) The provision of computer networking packages and related hardware;
(b) Data processing services;
(c) The sale of software that performs data processing functions;
(d) The development, operation, management, and marketing of products and processing services for transactions conducted at electronic terminal devices;

§ 7.5009
Location under 12 U.S.C. 85 of national banks operating exclusively through the Internet.
For purposes of 12 U.S.C. 85, the main office of a national bank that operates
exclusively through the Internet is the office identified by the bank under 12 U.S.C. 22(Second) or as relocated under 12 U.S.C. 30 or other appropriate authority.
§ 7.5010
Shared electronic space.
National banks that share electronic space, including a co-branded web site, with a bank subsidiary, affiliate, or another third-party must take reasonable steps to clearly, conspicuously, and understandably distinguish between products and services offered by the bank and those offered by the bank's subsidiary, affiliate, or the third-party.

§ 8.2
Semiannual assessment.
(a) Each national bank and each Federal savings association shall pay to the OCC a semiannual assessment fee, due by March 31 and September 30 of each year, for the six-month period beginning on January 1 and July 1 before each payment date. The OCC will calculate the amount due under this section and provide a notice of assessments to each national bank and each Federal savings association no later than 7 business days prior to collection on March 31 and September 30 of each year. In setting assessments, the OCC may take into account the nature and scope of the activities of a national bank or Federal savings association, the amount and type of assets that the entity holds, the financial and managerial condition of the entity, and any other factor the OCC determines is appropriate, as provided by 12 U.S.C. 16. The semiannual assessment will be calculated as follows:

(1) Every national bank and every Federal savings association falls into one of the asset-size brackets denoted by Columns A and B. A national bank's or Federal savings association's semiannual assessment is composed of two
parts. The first part is the calculation of a base amount of the assessment, which is computed on the assets of the national bank or Federal savings association up to the lower endpoint (Column A) of the bracket in which it falls. This base amount of the assessment is calculated by the OCC in Column C.
(2) The second part is the calculation of assessments due on the remaining assets of the national bank or Federal savings association in excess of Column E. The excess is assessed at the marginal rate shown in Column D.
(3) The total semiannual assessment is the amount in Column C, plus the amount of the national bank's or Federal savings association's assets in excess of Column E times the marginal rate in Column D:
Assessments = C + [(Assets − E) × D].
(4) Each year, the OCC may index the marginal rates in Column D to adjust for the percent change in the level of prices, as measured by changes in the Gross Domestic Product Implicit Price Deflator (GDPIPD) for each June-to-June period. The OCC may at its discretion adjust marginal rates by amounts other than the percentage change in the GDPIPD. The OCC will also adjust the amounts in Column C to reflect any change made to the marginal rate.
(5)(i) The specific marginal rates and complete assessment schedule will be published in the “Notice of Office of the Comptroller of the Currency Fees and Assessments,” provided for at § 8.8. Each semiannual assessment is based upon the total assets shown in the national bank's or Federal savings association's most recent “Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income” (Call Report) preceding the payment date. Each national bank or Federal savings association subject to the jurisdiction of the OCC on the date of the second or fourth quarterly Call Report as appropriate, required by the OCC under 12 U.S.C. 161 and 12 U.S.C. 1464(v), is subject to the full assessment for the next six-month period. National banks and Federal savings associations that are no longer subject to the jurisdiction of the OCC as of the date of the first or third quarterly Call Report, as appropriate, will receive a refund of assessments for the second three months of the semiannual assessment period.
(ii) [Reserved]
(6)(i) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, the OCC may reduce the semiannual assessment for each non-lead national bank or non-lead Federal savings association by a percentage that it will specify in the “Notice of Office of the Comptroller of the Currency Fees and Assessments” described in § 8.8.
(ii) For purposes of this paragraph (a)(6):
(A)
Lead national bank
or
lead Federal savings association
means the largest national bank or Federal savings association controlled by a company, based on a comparison of the total assets held by each national bank or Federal savings association controlled by that company as reported in each national bank's or Federal savings association's Call Report filed for the quarter immediately preceding the payment of a semiannual assessment.
(B)
Non-lead national bank
or
non-lead Federal savings association
means a national bank or Federal savings association that is not the lead national bank or lead Federal savings association controlled by a company that controls two or more national banks or Federal savings associations.
(C)

(D)
Control
and
company
with respect to Federal savings associations have the same meanings as these terms have in section 10(a) of the Home Owners' Loan Act (12 U.S.C. 1467a(a).
(b)(1) Each Federal branch and each Federal agency shall pay to the OCC a semiannual assessment fee, due by March 31 and September 30 of each year, for the six-month period beginning on January 1 and July 1 before each payment date. The OCC will calculate the amount due under this section and provide a notice of assessments to each Federal branch and agency no later than 7 business days prior to March 31 and September 30 of each year.
(2) The amount of the semiannual assessment paid by each Federal branch and Federal agency shall be computed at the same rate as provided in the Table in 12 CFR 8.2(a); however, only the total domestic assets of the Federal branch or agency shall be subject to assessment.
(3)(i) Each semiannual assessment of each Federal branch and each agency is based upon the total assets shown in the Federal branch's or agency's Call Report most recently preceding the payment date. Each Federal branch or agency subject to the jurisdiction of the OCC on the date of the second and fourth Call Reports is subject to the full assessment for the next six-month period. Federal branches and agencies that are no longer subject to the jurisdiction of the OCC as of the date of the first or third quarterly Call Report, as appropriate, will receive a refund of assessments for the second three months of the semiannual assessment period.
(ii) [Reserved]
(4)(i) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, the OCC may reduce the semiannual assessment for each non-lead Federal branch and agency by an amount that it will specify in the “Notice of Office of the Comptroller of the Currency Fees and Assessments” described in § 8.8.
(ii) For purposes of this paragraph (b)(4):
(A)
Lead Federal branch or agency
means the largest Federal branch or agency of a foreign bank, based on a comparison of the total assets held by each Federal branch or agency of that foreign bank as reported in each Federal branch's or agency's Call Report filed for the quarter immediately preceding the payment of a semiannual assessment.
(B)
Non-lead Federal branch or agency
means a Federal branch or agency that is not the lead Federal branch or agency of a foreign bank that controls two or more Federal branches or agencies.
(c)
Additional assessment for independent credit card national banks and independent credit card Federal savings associations
—(1)
General rule.
In addition to the assessment calculated according to paragraph (a) of this section, each independent credit card national bank and independent credit card Federal savings association will pay an assessment based on receivables attributable to credit card accounts owned by the national bank or Federal savings association. This assessment will be computed by adding to its asset-based assessment an additional amount determined by its level of receivables attributable. The dollar amount of the additional assessment will be published in the “Notice of Office of the Comptroller of the Currency Fees and Assessments,” described at § 8.8.
(2)
Independent credit card national banks and independent credit card Federal savings associations affiliated with full-service national banks or Federal savings associations.
The OCC will assess an independent credit card national bank and an independent credit card Federal savings association in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section, notwithstanding that the national bank or Federal savings association is affiliated with a full-service national bank or full-service Federal savings association, if the OCC concludes that the affiliation is intended to evade this part.
(3)

(i)
Affiliate,
with respect to national banks, has the same meaning as this term has in 12 U.S.C. 221a(b).

is a national bank that engages primarily in credit card operations and is not affiliated with a full-service national bank.
(vii)
Independent credit card Federal savings association
is a Federal savings association that engages primarily in credit card operations and is not affiliated with a full-service Federal savings association.
(viii)
Receivables attributable

(4)
Reports of receivables attributable.
Independent credit card national banks and independent credit card Federal savings associations will report receivables attributable data to the OCC semiannually at a time specified by the OCC.
(d)
Surcharge based on the condition of the national bank, Federal savings association, or Federal branch or agency.
Subject to any limit that the OCC prescribes in the “Notice of Office of the Comptroller of the Currency Fees and Assessments,” the OCC shall apply a surcharge to the semiannual assessment computed in accordance with paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section.

§ 8.7
Payment of interest on delinquent assessments and examination and investigation fees.
(a) Each national bank, Federal savings association, Federal branch, and Federal agency shall pay to the OCC interest on its delinquent payments of semiannual assessments. In addition, each institution subject to a special examination or investigation fee shall pay to the OCC interest on its delinquent payments of special examination and investigation fees. Semiannual assessment payments will be considered delinquent if they are received after the time for payment specified in § 8.2. Special examination and investigation fees will be considered delinquent if not received by the OCC within 30 calendar days of the invoice date.
(b) In the event that an institution believes that the notice of assessments or special examination and investigation fees contains an error or miscalculation, the institution may provide the OCC with a written request for a revised notice and a refund of any overpayments. Any such request for a revised notice and refund must be made after timely payment of the semiannual assessment under the dates specified in § 8.2 or timely payment of the special examination and investigation fee within 30 calendar days of the invoice date.
(1) Within 30 calendar days of receipt of such request, the OCC shall either—
(i) Refund the amount of the overpayment; or
(ii) Provide notice of its unwillingness to accept the request for a revised notice of assessments. In the latter instance, the OCC and the entity claiming the overpayment shall thereafter attempt to reach agreement on the amount, if any, to be refunded; the OCC shall refund this amount within 30 calendar days of such agreement.

(c) Interest on delinquent payments, as described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, will be assessed beginning the first calendar day on which payment is considered delinquent, and on each calendar day thereafter up to and including the day payment is received. Interest will be simple interest, calculated for each day payment is delinquent by multiplying the daily equivalent of the applicable interest rate by the amount delinquent. The rate of interest will be the United States Treasury Department's current value of funds rate (the “TFRM rate”); that rate is issued under the Treasury Fiscal Requirements Manual and is published quarterly in the
Federal Register.
The interest rates applicable to a delinquent payment will be determined as follows:
(1) For delinquent days occurring from January 1 to March 31, the rate will be the TFRM rate that is published the preceding December for the first quarter of the ensuing year.
(2) For delinquent days occurring from April 1 to June 30, the rate will be the TFRM rate that is published the preceding March for the second quarter of that year.
(3) For delinquent days occurring from July 1 to September 30, the rate will be the TFRM rate that is published the preceding June for the third quarter of that year.
(4) For delinquent days occurring from October 1 to December 31, the
rate will be the TFRM rate that is published the preceding September for the fourth quarter of that year.

# Regulations
§ 9.1
Authority, purpose, and scope.
(a)
Authority.
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) issues this part pursuant to its authority under 12 U.S.C. 24 (Seventh), 92a, and 93a, and 15 U.S.C. 78q, 78q-1, and 78w.
(b)
Purpose.
The purpose of this part is to set forth the standards that apply to the fiduciary activities of national banks.
(c)
Scope.
This part applies to all national banks that act in a fiduciary capacity, as defined in § 9.2(e). This part also applies to all Federal branches of foreign banks to the same extent as it applies to national banks.
§ 9.2
Definitions.
For the purposes of this part, the following definitions apply:
(a)
Affiliate
has the same meaning as in 12 U.S.C. 221a(b).
(b)
Applicable law
means the law of a state or other jurisdiction governing a national bank's fiduciary relationships, any applicable Federal law governing those relationships, the terms of the instrument governing a fiduciary relationship, or any court order pertaining to the relationship.
(c)
Custodian under a uniform gifts to minors act
means a fiduciary relationship established pursuant to a state law substantially similar to the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act or the Uniform Transfers to Minors Act as published by the American Law Institute.
(d)
Fiduciary account
means an account administered by a national bank acting in a fiduciary capacity.
(e)
Fiduciary capacity
means: trustee, executor, administrator, registrar of stocks and bonds, transfer agent, guardian, assignee, receiver, or custodian under a uniform gifts to minors act; investment adviser, if the bank receives a fee for its investment advice;
any capacity in which the bank possesses investment discretion on behalf of another; or any other similar capacity that the OCC authorizes pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 92a.
(f)
Fiduciary officers and employees
means all officers and employees of a national bank to whom the board of directors or its designee has assigned functions involving the exercise of the bank's fiduciary powers.
(g)
Fiduciary powers
means the authority the OCC permits a national bank to exercise pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 92a.
(h)
Guardian
means the guardian or conservator, by whatever name used by state law, of the estate of a minor, an incompetent person, an absent person, or a person over whose estate a court has taken jurisdiction, other than under bankruptcy or insolvency laws.
(i)
Investment discretion
means, with respect to an account, the sole or shared authority (whether or not that authority is exercised) to determine what securities or other assets to purchase or sell on behalf of the account. A bank that delegates its authority over investments and a bank that receives delegated authority over investments are both deemed to have investment discretion.
(j)
Trust office
means an office of a national bank, other than a main office or a branch, at which the bank engages in one or more of the activities specified in § 9.7(d). Pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 36(j), a trust office is not a “branch” for purposes of 12 U.S.C. 36, unless it is also an office at which deposits are received, or checks paid, or money lent.
(k)
Trust representative office
means an office of a national bank, other than a main office, branch, or trust office, at which the bank performs activities ancillary to its fiduciary business, but does not engage in any of the activities specified in § 9.7(d). Examples of ancillary activities include advertising, marketing, and soliciting for fiduciary business; contacting existing or potential customers, answering questions, and providing information about matters related to their accounts; acting as a liaison between the trust office and the customer (
e.g.,
forwarding requests for distribution or changes in investment objectives, or forwarding forms and funds received from the customer); inspecting or maintaining custody of fiduciary assets or holding title to real property. This list is illustrative and not comprehensive. Other activities may also be “ancillary activities” for the purposes of this definition. Pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 36(j), a trust representative office is not a “branch” for purposes of 12 U.S.C. 36, unless it is also an office at which deposits are received, or checks paid, or money lent.
[61 FR 68554, Dec. 30, 1996, as amended at 66 FR 34797, July 2, 2001]

(c) A person seeking approval to organize a special-purpose national bank limited to fiduciary powers shall file an application with the OCC pursuant to 12 CFR 5.20.
[61 FR 68554, Dec. 30, 1996, as amended at 66 FR 34798, July 2, 2001]
§ 9.4
Administration of fiduciary powers.
(a)
Responsibilities of the board of directors.
A national bank's fiduciary activities shall be managed by or under the direction of its board of directors. In discharging its responsibilities, the board may assign any function related to the exercise of fiduciary powers to any director, officer, employee, or committee thereof.
(b)
Use of other personnel.
The national bank may use any qualified personnel and facilities of the bank or its affiliates to perform services related to the exercise of its fiduciary powers, and any department of the bank or its affiliates may use fiduciary officers, employees, and facilities to perform
services unrelated to the exercise of fiduciary powers, to the extent not prohibited by applicable law.
(c)
Agency agreements.
Pursuant to a written agreement, a national bank exercising fiduciary powers may perform services related to the exercise of fiduciary powers for another bank or other entity, and may purchase services related to the exercise of fiduciary powers from another bank or other entity.
(d)
Bond requirement.
A national bank shall ensure that all fiduciary officers and employees are adequately bonded.
§ 9.5
Policies and procedures.
A national bank exercising fiduciary powers shall adopt and follow written policies and procedures adequate to maintain its fiduciary activities in compliance with applicable law. Among other relevant matters, the policies and procedures should address, where appropriate, the bank's:
(a) Brokerage placement practices;
(b) Methods for ensuring that fiduciary officers and employees do not use material inside information in connection with any decision or recommendation to purchase or sell any security;
(c) Methods for preventing self-dealing and conflicts of interest;

(e) Investment of funds held as fiduciary, including short-term investments and the treatment of fiduciary funds awaiting investment or distribution.
§ 9.6
Review of fiduciary accounts.
(a)
Pre-acceptance review.
Before accepting a fiduciary account, a national bank shall review the prospective account to determine whether it can properly administer the account.

(c)
Annual review.
At least once during every calendar year, a bank shall conduct a review of all assets of each fiduciary account for which the bank has investment discretion to evaluate whether they are appropriate, individually and collectively, for the account.
§ 9.7
Multi-state fiduciary operations.
(a)
Acting in a fiduciary capacity in more than one state.
Pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 92a and this section, a national bank may act in a fiduciary capacity in any state. If a national bank acts, or proposes to act, in a fiduciary capacity in a particular state, the bank may act in the following specific capacities:
(1) Any of the eight fiduciary capacities expressly listed in 12 U.S.C. 92a(a), unless the state prohibits its own state banks, trust companies, and other corporations that compete with national banks in that state from acting in that capacity; and
(2) Any other fiduciary capacity the state permits for its own state banks, trust companies, or other corporations that compete with national banks in that state.
(b)
Serving customers in other states.
While acting in a fiduciary capacity in one state, a national bank may market its fiduciary services to, and act as fiduciary for, customers located in any state, and it may act as fiduciary for relationships that include property located in other states. The bank may use a trust representative office for this purpose.
(c)
Offices in more than one state.
A national bank with fiduciary powers may establish trust offices or trust representative offices in any state.
(d)
Determination of the state referred to in 12 U.S.C. 92a.
For each fiduciary relationship, the state referred to in section 92a is the state in which the bank acts in a fiduciary capacity for that relationship. A national bank acts in a fiduciary capacity in the state in which it accepts the fiduciary appointment, executes the documents that create the fiduciary relationship, and makes discretionary decisions regarding the investment or distribution of fiduciary assets. If these activities take place in more than one state, then the state in which the bank acts in a fiduciary capacity for section 92a purposes is the state that the bank designates from among those states.
(e)
Application of state law
—(1)
State laws used in section 92a.
The state laws that apply to a national bank's fiduciary activities by virtue of 12 U.S.C. 92a are the laws of the state in which the bank acts in a fiduciary capacity.
(2)
Other state laws.
Except for the state laws made applicable to national banks by virtue of 12 U.S.C. 92a, state laws limiting or establishing preconditions on the exercise of fiduciary powers are not applicable to national banks.
[66 FR 34798, July 2, 2001]
§ 9.8
Recordkeeping.
(a)
Documentation of accounts.
A national bank shall adequately document the establishment and termination of each fiduciary account and shall maintain adequate records for all fiduciary accounts.
(b)
Retention of records.
A national bank shall retain records described in paragraph (a) of this section for a period of three years from the later of the termination of the account or the termination of any litigation relating to the account.
(c)
Separation of records.
A national bank shall ensure that records described in paragraph (a) of this section are separate and distinct from other records of the bank.
§ 9.9
Audit of fiduciary activities.
(a)
Annual audit.
At least once during each calendar year, a national bank shall arrange for a suitable audit (by internal or external auditors) of all significant fiduciary activities, under the direction of its fiduciary audit committee, unless the bank adopts a continuous audit system in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. The bank shall note the results of the audit (including significant actions taken as a result of the audit) in the minutes of the board of directors.
(b)
Continuous audit.
In lieu of performing annual audits under paragraph (a) of this section, a national bank may adopt a continuous audit system under which the bank arranges for a discrete audit (by internal or external auditors) of each significant fiduciary activity (
i.e.,
on an activity-by-activity basis), under the direction of its fiduciary audit committee, at an interval commensurate with the nature and risk of that activity. Thus, certain fiduciary activities may receive audits at intervals greater or less than one year, as appropriate. A bank that adopts a continuous audit system shall note the results of all discrete audits performed since the last audit report (including significant actions taken as a result of the audits) in the minutes of the board of directors at least once during each calendar year .
(c)
Fiduciary audit committee.
A national bank's fiduciary audit committee must consist of a committee of the bank's directors or an audit committee of an affiliate of the bank. However, in either case, the committee:
(1) Must not include any officers of the bank or an affiliate who participate significantly in the administration of the bank's fiduciary activities; and
(2) Must consist of a majority of members who are not also members of any committee to which the board of directors has delegated power to manage and control the fiduciary activities of the bank.
§ 9.10
Fiduciary funds awaiting investment or distribution.
(a)
In general.
With respect to a fiduciary account for which a national bank has investment discretion or discretion over distributions, the bank may not allow funds awaiting investment or distribution to remain uninvested and undistributed any longer than is reasonable for the proper management of the account and consistent with applicable law. With respect to a fiduciary account for which a national bank has investment discretion, the bank shall obtain for funds awaiting investment or distribution a rate of return that is consistent with applicable law.
(b)
Self-deposits
—(1)
In general.
A national bank may deposit funds of a fiduciary account that are awaiting investment or distribution in the commercial, savings, or another department of the bank, unless prohibited by applicable law. To the extent that the funds are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the bank shall set aside collateral as security, under the control of appropriate
fiduciary officers and employees, in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section. The market value of the collateral set aside must at all times equal or exceed the amount of the uninsured fiduciary funds.
(2)
Acceptable collateral.
A national bank may satisfy the collateral requirement of paragraph (b)(1) of this section with any of the following:
(i) Direct obligations of the United States, or other obligations fully guaranteed by the United States as to principal and interest;

(iii) Readily marketable securities of the classes in which state banks, trust companies, or other corporations exercising fiduciary powers are permitted to invest fiduciary funds under applicable state law;
(iv) Surety bonds, to the extent they provide adequate security, unless prohibited by applicable law; and
(v) Any other assets that qualify under applicable state law as appropriate security for deposits of fiduciary funds.

Affiliate deposits.
A national bank, acting in its fiduciary capacity, may deposit funds of a fiduciary account that are awaiting investment or distribution with an affiliated insured depository institution, unless prohibited by applicable law. A national bank may set aside collateral as security for a deposit by or with an affiliate of fiduciary funds awaiting investment or distribution, unless prohibited by applicable law.

Self-dealing and conflicts of interest.
(a)
Investments for fiduciary accounts
—(1)
In general.
Unless authorized by applicable law, a national bank may not invest funds of a fiduciary account for which a national bank has investment discretion in the stock or obligations of, or in assets acquired from: the bank or any of its directors, officers, or employees; affiliates of the bank or any of their directors, officers, or employees; or individuals or organizations with whom there exists an interest that might affect the exercise of the best judgment of the bank.
(2)
Additional securities investments.
If retention of stock or obligations of the bank or its affiliates in a fiduciary account is consistent with applicable law, the bank may:
(i) Exercise rights to purchase additional stock (or securities convertible into additional stock) when offered pro rata to stockholders; and
(ii) Purchase fractional shares to complement fractional shares acquired through the exercise of rights or the receipt of a stock dividend resulting in fractional share holdings.
(b)
Loans, sales, or other transfers from fiduciary accounts
—(1)
In general.
A national bank may not lend, sell, or otherwise transfer assets of a fiduciary account for which a national bank has investment discretion to the bank or any of its directors, officers, or employees, or to affiliates of the bank or any of their directors, officers, or employees, or to individuals or organizations with whom there exists an interest that might affect the exercise of the best judgment of the bank, unless:
(i) The transaction is authorized by applicable law;
(ii) Legal counsel advises the bank in writing that the bank has incurred, in its fiduciary capacity, a contingent or potential liability, in which case the bank, upon the sale or transfer of assets, shall reimburse the fiduciary account in cash at the greater of book or market value of the assets;
(iii) As provided in § 9.18(b)(8)(iii) for defaulted investments; or
(iv) Required in writing by the OCC.
(2)
Loans of funds held as trustee.
Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, a national bank may not lend to any of its directors, officers, or employees any funds held in trust, except with respect to employee benefit plans in accordance with the exemptions found in section 408 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1108).
(c)
Loans to fiduciary accounts.
A national bank may make a loan to a fiduciary account and may hold a security interest in assets of the account if the
transaction is fair to the account and is not prohibited by applicable law.
(d)
Sales between fiduciary accounts.
A national bank may sell assets between any of its fiduciary accounts if the transaction is fair to both accounts and is not prohibited by applicable law.
(e)
Loans between fiduciary accounts.
A national bank may make a loan between any of its fiduciary accounts if the transaction is fair to both accounts and is not prohibited by applicable law.
§ 9.13
Custody of fiduciary assets.
(a)
Control of fiduciary assets.
A national bank shall place assets of fiduciary accounts in the joint custody or control of not fewer than two of the fiduciary officers or employees designated for that purpose by the board of directors. A national bank may maintain the investments of a fiduciary account off-premises, if consistent with applicable law and if the bank maintains adequate safeguards and controls. A bank that is deemed a fiduciary based solely on its capacity as investment advisor, as that capacity is defined in § 9.101(a), and has no other fiduciary capacity as enumerated in § 9.2(e) is not required to serve as custodian when offering those fiduciary services.
(b)
Separation of fiduciary assets.
A national bank shall keep the assets of fiduciary accounts separate from the assets of the bank. A national bank shall keep the assets of each fiduciary account separate from all other accounts or shall identify the investments as the property of a particular account, except as provided in § 9.18.

§ 9.14
Deposit of securities with state authorities.
(a)
In general.
If state law requires corporations acting in a fiduciary capacity to deposit securities with state authorities for the protection of private or court trusts, then before a national bank acts as a private or court-appointed trustee in that state, it shall make a similar deposit with state authorities. If the state authorities refuse to accept the deposit, the bank shall deposit the securities with the Federal Reserve Bank or Federal Home Loan Bank of the district in which the national bank is located, to be held for the protection of private or court trusts to the same extent as if the securities had been deposited with state authorities.
(b)
Acting in a fiduciary capacity in more than one state.
If a national bank acts in a fiduciary capacity in more than one state, the bank may compute the amount of securities that are required to be deposited for each state on the basis of the amount of assets for which the bank is acting in a fiduciary capacity at offices located in that state. If state law requires a deposit of securities on a basis other than assets (
e.g.,
a requirement to deposit a fixed amount or an amount equal to a percentage of capital), the bank may compute the amount of deposit required in that state on a pro-rated basis, according to the proportion of fiduciary assets for which the bank is acting in a fiduciary capacity at offices located in that state.
[61 FR 68554, Dec. 30, 1996, as amended at 66 FR 34798, July 2, 2001; 82 FR 8105, Jan. 23, 2017]
§ 9.15
Fiduciary compensation.
(a)
Compensation of bank.
If the amount of a national bank's compensation for acting in a fiduciary capacity is not set or governed by applicable law, the bank may charge a reasonable fee for its services.
(b)
Compensation of co-fiduciary officers and employees.
A national bank may not permit any officer or employee to retain any compensation for acting as a co-fiduciary with the bank in the administration of a fiduciary account, except with the specific approval of the bank's board of directors.
§ 9.16
Receivership or voluntary liquidation of bank.
If the OCC appoints a receiver for an uninsured national bank, or if a national bank places itself in voluntary liquidation, the receiver or liquidating agent shall promptly close or transfer to a substitute fiduciary all fiduciary accounts, in accordance with OCC instructions and the orders of the court having jurisdiction.
§ 9.17
Surrender or revocation of fiduciary powers.
(a)
Surrender.
In accordance with 12 U.S.C. 92a(j), a national bank seeking to surrender its fiduciary powers shall file with the OCC a certified copy of the resolution of its board of directors evidencing that intent. If, after appropriate investigation, the OCC is satisfied that the bank has been discharged from all fiduciary duties, the OCC will provide written notice that the bank is no longer authorized to exercise fiduciary powers.
(b)
Revocation.
If the OCC determines that a national bank has unlawfully or unsoundly exercised, or has failed for a period of five consecutive years to exercise its fiduciary powers, the Comptroller may, in accordance with the provisions of 12 U.S.C. 92a(k), revoke the bank's fiduciary powers.
§ 9.18
Collective investment funds.
(a)
In general.
Where consistent with applicable law, a national bank may invest assets that it holds as fiduciary in the following collective investment funds:
1

2

(ii) A national bank may invest assets of retirement, pension, profit sharing, stock bonus, or other employee benefit trusts exempt from Federal income tax and that the bank holds in any capacity (including agent), in a collective investment fund established under this paragraph (a)(2) if the fund itself qualifies for exemption from Federal income tax.
(b)

If a fund, the assets of which consist solely of Individual Retirement Accounts, Keogh Accounts, or other employee benefit accounts that are exempt from taxation, is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-1
et seq.
), the fund will not be deemed in violation of this paragraph (b)(2) as a result of its compliance with section 10(c) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-10(c)).
(3)
Proportionate interests.
Each participating account in a collective investment fund must have a proportionate interest in all the fund's assets.
(4)
Valuation
—(i)
Frequency of valuation.
A bank administering a collective investment fund shall determine the value of the fund's readily marketable assets at least once every three months. A bank shall determine the value of the fund's assets that are not readily marketable at least once a year.
(ii)
General method of valuation.
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section, a bank shall value each fund asset at mark-to-market value as of the date set for valuation, unless the bank cannot readily ascertain mark-to-market value, in which case the bank shall use a fair value determined in good faith.
(iii)
Short-term investment funds (STIFs) method of valuation.
A bank may value a STIF's assets on a cost basis, rather than mark-to-market value as provided in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section, for purposes of admissions and withdrawals, if the Plan includes appropriate provisions, consistent with this part, requiring the STIF to:
(A) Operate with a stable net asset value of $1.00 per participating interest as a primary fund objective;
(B) Maintain a dollar-weighted average portfolio maturity of 60 days or less and a dollar-weighted average portfolio life maturity of 120 days or less as determined in the same manner as is required by the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 2a-7 for money market mutual funds (17 CFR 270.2a-7);
(C) Accrue on a straight-line or amortized basis the difference between the cost and anticipated principal receipt on maturity;
(D) Hold the STIF's assets until maturity under usual circumstances;
(E) Adopt portfolio and issuer qualitative standards and concentration restrictions;
(F) Adopt liquidity standards that include provisions to address contingency funding needs;
(G) Adopt shadow pricing procedures that:
(
1
) Require the bank to calculate the extent of difference, if any, of the mark-to-market net asset value per participating interest using available market quotations (or an appropriate substitute that reflects current market conditions) from the STIF's amortized cost price per participating interest, at least on a calendar week basis and more frequently as determined by the bank when market conditions warrant; and
(
2
) Require the bank, in the event the difference calculated pursuant to this subparagraph exceeds $0.005 per participating interest, to take action to reduce dilution of participating interests or other unfair results to participating accounts in the STIF;
(H) Adopt procedures for stress testing the STIF's ability to maintain a stable net asset value per participating interest that shall provide for:
(
1
) The periodic stress testing, at least on a calendar month basis and at such intervals as an independent risk manager or a committee responsible for the STIF's oversight that consists of members independent from the STIF's investment management determines appropriate and reasonable in light of current market conditions;
(
2
) Stress testing based upon hypothetical events that include, but are not limited to, a change in short-term interest rates, an increase in participant account withdrawals, a downgrade of or default on portfolio securities, and the widening or narrowing of
spreads between yields on an appropriate benchmark the STIF has selected for overnight interest rates and commercial paper and other types of securities held by the STIF;
(
3
) A stress testing report on the results of such testing to be provided to the independent risk manager or the committee responsible for the STIF's oversight that consists of members independent from the STIF's investment management that shall include: the date(s) on which the testing was performed; the magnitude of each hypothetical event that would cause the difference between the STIF's mark-to-market net asset value calculated using available market quotations (or appropriate substitutes which reflect current market conditions) and its net asset value per participating interest calculated using amortized cost to exceed $0.005; and an assessment by the bank of the STIF's ability to withstand the events (and concurrent occurrences of those events) that are reasonably likely to occur within the following year; and
(
4
) Reporting adverse stress testing results to the bank's senior risk management that is independent from the STIF's investment management.
(I) Adopt procedures that require a bank to disclose to STIF participants and to the OCC's Asset Management Group, Credit
Market Risk Division, within five business days after each calendar month-end, the fund's total assets under management (securities and other assets including cash, minus liabilities); the fund's mark-to-market and amortized cost net asset values both with and without capital support agreements; the dollar-weighted average portfolio maturity; the dollar-weighted average portfolio life maturity of the STIF as of the last business day of the prior calendar month; and for each security held by the STIF as of the last business day of the prior calendar month:
(
1
) The name of the issuer;
(
2
) The category of investment;
(
3
) The Committee on Uniform Securities Identification Procedures (CUSIP) number or other standard identifier;
(
4
) The principal amount;
(
5
) The maturity date for purposes of calculating dollar-weighted average portfolio maturity;
(
6
) The final legal maturity date (taking into account any maturity date extensions that may be effected at the option of the issuer) if different from the maturity date for purposes of calculating dollar-weighted average portfolio maturity;
(
7
) The coupon or yield; and
(
8
) The amortized cost value;
(J) Adopt procedures that require a bank that administers a STIF to notify the OCC's Asset Management Group, Credit
Market Risk Division, prior to or within one business day thereafter of the following:
(
1
) Any difference exceeding $0.0025 between the net asset value and the mark-to-market value of a STIF participating interest as calculated using the method set forth in paragraph (b)(4)(iii)(G)(1) of this section;
(
2
) When a STIF has re-priced its net asset value below $0.995 per participating interest;
(
3
) Any withdrawal distribution-in-kind of the STIF's participating interests or segregation of portfolio participants;
(
4
) Any delays or suspensions in honoring STIF participating interest withdrawal requests;
(
5
) Any decision to formally approve the liquidation, segregation of assets or portfolios, or some other liquidation of the STIF; or
(
6
) In those situations when a bank, its affiliate, or any other entity provides a STIF financial support, including a cash infusion, a credit extension, a purchase of a defaulted or illiquid asset, or any other form of financial support in order to maintain a stable net asset value per participating interest;
(K) Adopt procedures that in the event a STIF has re-priced its net asset value below $0.995 per participating interest, the bank administering the STIF shall calculate, admit, and withdraw the STIF's participating interests at a price based on the mark-to-market net asset value; and
(L) Adopt procedures that, in the event a bank suspends or limits withdrawals and initiates liquidation of the
STIF as a result of redemptions, require the bank to:
(
1
) Determine that the extent of the difference between the STIF's amortized cost per participating interest and its mark-to-market net asset value per participating interest may result in material dilution of participating interests or other unfair results to participating accounts;
(
2
) Formally approve the liquidation of the STIF; and
(
3
) Facilitate the fair and orderly liquidation of the STIF to the benefit of all STIF participants.

(A) The OCC may issue an administrative order specifying, for purposes of paragraph (b)(4)(iii)(B) of this section, temporary revisions to the length of the dollar-weighted average portfolio maturity requirement, the length of dollar-weighted average portfolio life maturity, and the manner of determining such limits;
(B) A bank seeking to comply with paragraph (b)(4)(iii)(B) will be deemed to be in compliance with that paragraph's requirements by complying with the limits or other revisions, and any applicable conditions, described in the administrative order; and
(C) The OCC will publish the administrative order on
www.occ.gov
and through other methods, as appropriate.
(5)
Admission and withdrawal of accounts
—(i)
In general.
A bank administering a collective investment fund shall admit an account to or withdraw an account from the fund only on the basis of the valuation described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.
(ii)
Prior request or notice.
A bank administering a collective investment fund may admit an account to or withdraw an account from a collective investment fund only if the bank has approved a request for or a notice of intention of taking that action on or before the valuation date on which the admission or withdrawal is based. No requests or notices may be canceled or countermanded after the valuation date.
(iii)
Prior notice period for withdrawals from funds with assets not readily marketable.
(A) A bank administering a collective investment fund described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section that is invested primarily in real estate or other assets that are not readily marketable may require a prior notice period, not to exceed one year, for withdrawals.
(B) A bank that requires a prior notice period for withdrawals must withdraw an account from the fund within the prior notice period or, if permissible under the fund's written plan, within one year after the date on which notice was required, except as described in paragraph (b)(5)(iii)(C) of this section.
(C) A bank may withdraw an account from the fund up to one year after the withdrawal period described in paragraph (b)(5)(iii)(B) of this section, with the OCC's approval, provided that the following conditions are met:
(
1
) The fund's written plan, including its notice and withdrawal policy, authorizes an extended withdrawal period and is fully disclosed to fund participants;
(
2
) The bank's board of directors, or a committee authorized by the board of directors, determines that, due to unanticipated and severe market conditions for specific assets held by the fund, an extended withdrawal period is necessary in order to preserve the value of the fund's assets for the benefit of fund participants;
(
3
) The bank's board of directors, or a committee authorized by the board of directors, determines that the extended withdrawal period is consistent with 12 CFR part 9 and applicable law;
(
4
) The bank's board of directors, or a committee authorized by the board of directors, represents that the bank will act upon any withdrawal request as soon as practicable and consistent with its fiduciary duties; and
(
5
) Any other condition imposed by the OCC, if the OCC determines that the condition is necessary or appropriate to protect the interests of fund participants.
(D) Upon request by a bank, the OCC may approve an extension beyond the one-year extension period described in
paragraph (b)(5)(iii)(C) of this section if the OCC determines that the bank has made a good faith effort to satisfy withdrawal requests and the bank has been unable to satisfy such requests without causing harm to participants due to ongoing severe market conditions. The bank must also continue to satisfy the conditions described in paragraph (b)(5)(iii)(C) of this section. Extensions under this paragraph must be requested and approved annually, for a maximum of two years after the initial one-year extension period.
(iv)
Method of distributions.
A bank administering a collective investment fund shall make distributions to accounts withdrawing from the fund in cash, ratably in kind, a combination of cash and ratably in kind, or in any other manner consistent with applicable law in the state in which the bank maintains the fund.
(v)
Segregation of investments.
If an investment is withdrawn in kind from a collective investment fund for the benefit of all participants in the fund at the time of the withdrawal but the investment is not distributed ratably in kind, the bank shall segregate and administer it for the benefit ratably of all participants in the collective investment fund at the time of withdrawal.
(6)
Audits and financial reports
—(i)
Annual audit.
At least once during each 12-month period, a bank administering a collective investment fund shall arrange for an audit of the collective investment fund by auditors responsible only to the board of directors of the bank.
4
4
If a fund, the assets of which consist solely of Individual Retirement Accounts, Keogh Accounts, or other employee benefit accounts that are exempt from taxation, is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-1
et seq.
), the fund will not be deemed in violation of this paragraph (b)(6)(i) as a result of its compliance with section 10(c) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-10(c)), if the bank has access to the audit reports of the fund.
(ii)
Financial report.
At least once during each 12-month period, a bank administering a collective investment fund shall prepare a financial report of the fund based on the audit required by paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section. The report must disclose the fund's fees and expenses in a manner consistent with applicable law in the state in which the bank maintains the fund. This report must contain a list of investments in the fund showing the cost and current market value of each investment, and a statement covering the period after the previous report showing the following (organized by type of investment):
(A) A summary of purchases (with costs);
(B) A summary of sales (with profit or loss and any other investment changes);
(C) Income and disbursements; and
(D) An appropriate notation of any investments in default.
(iii)
Limitation on representations.
A bank may include in the financial report a description of the fund's value on previous dates, as well as its income and disbursements during previous accounting periods. A bank may not publish in the financial report any predictions or representations as to future performance. In addition, with respect to funds described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, a bank may not publish the performance of individual funds other than those administered by the bank or its affiliates.
(iv)
Availability of the report.
A bank administering a collective investment fund shall provide a copy of the financial report, or shall provide notice that a copy of the report is available upon request without charge, to each person who ordinarily would receive a regular periodic accounting with respect to each participating account. The bank may provide a copy of the financial report to prospective customers. In addition, the bank shall provide a copy of the report upon request to any person for a reasonable charge.
(7)
Advertising restriction.
A bank may not advertise or publicize any fund authorized under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, except in connection with the advertisement of the general fiduciary services of the bank.
(8)
Self-dealing and conflicts of interest.
A national bank administering a collective investment fund must comply with the following (in addition to § 9.12):
(i)
Bank interests.
A bank administering a collective investment fund may not have an interest in that fund
other than in its fiduciary capacity. If, because of a creditor relationship or otherwise, the bank acquires an interest in a participating account, the participating account must be withdrawn on the next withdrawal date. However, a bank may invest assets that it holds as fiduciary for its own employees in a collective investment fund.
(ii)
Loans to participating accounts.
A bank administering a collective investment fund may not make any loan on the security of a participant's interest in the fund. An unsecured advance to a fiduciary account participating in the fund until the time of the next valuation date does not constitute the acquisition of an interest in a participating account by the bank.
(iii)
Purchase of defaulted investments.
A bank administering a collective investment fund may purchase for its own account any defaulted investment held by the fund (in lieu of segregating the investment in accordance with paragraph (b)(5)(v) of this section) if, in the judgment of the bank, the cost of segregating the investment is excessive in light of the market value of the investment. If a bank elects to purchase a defaulted investment, it shall do so at the greater of market value or the sum of cost and accrued unpaid interest.
(9)
Management fees.
A bank administering a collective investment fund may charge a reasonable fund management fee only if:
(i) The fee is permitted under applicable law (and complies with fee disclosure requirements, if any) in the state in which the bank maintains the fund; and
(ii) The amount of the fee does not exceed an amount commensurate with the value of legitimate services of tangible benefit to the participating fiduciary accounts that would not have been provided to the accounts were they not invested in the fund.
(10)
Expenses.
A bank administering a collective investment fund may charge reasonable expenses incurred in operating the collective investment fund, to the extent not prohibited by applicable law in the state in which the bank maintains the fund. However, a bank shall absorb the expenses of establishing or reorganizing a collective investment fund.
(11)
Prohibition against certificates.
A bank administering a collective investment fund may not issue any certificate or other document representing a direct or indirect interest in the fund, except to provide a withdrawing account with an interest in a segregated investment.
(12)
Good faith mistakes.
The OCC will not deem a bank's mistake made in good faith and in the exercise of due care in connection with the administration of a collective investment fund to be a violation of this part if, promptly after the discovery of the mistake, the bank takes whatever action is practicable under the circumstances to remedy the mistake.
(c)
Other collective investments.
In addition to the collective investment funds authorized under paragraph (a) of this section, a national bank may collectively invest assets that it holds as fiduciary, to the extent not prohibited by applicable law, as follows:
(1)
Single loans or obligations.
In the following loans or obligations, if the bank's only interest in the loans or obligations is its capacity as fiduciary:
(i) A single real estate loan, a direct obligation of the United States, or an obligation fully guaranteed by the United States, or a single fixed amount security, obligation, or other property, either real, personal, or mixed, of a single issuer; or
(ii) A variable amount note of a borrower of prime credit, if the bank uses the note solely for investment of funds held in its fiduciary accounts.
(2)
Mini-funds.
In a fund maintained by the bank for the collective investment of cash balances received or held by a bank in its capacity as trustee, executor, administrator, guardian, or custodian under a uniform gifts to minors act, that the bank considers too small to be invested separately to advantage. The total assets in the fund must not exceed $1,500,000 and the number of participating accounts must not exceed 100. The OCC shall adjust this $1,500,000 threshold amount on January 1 of every year by the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) that was in effect on
the preceding June 1, rounded to the nearest $100 increment, and make this adjusted amount available to the public.
(3)
Trust funds of corporations and closely-related settlors.
In any investment specifically authorized by the instrument creating the fiduciary account or a court order, in the case of trusts created by a corporation, including its affiliates and subsidiaries, or by several individual settlors who are closely related.
(4)
Other authorized funds.
In any collective investment authorized by applicable law, such as investments pursuant to a state pre-need funeral statute.
(5)
Special exemption funds.
In any other manner described by the bank in a written plan approved by the OCC.
5
In order to obtain a special exemption, a bank shall submit to the OCC a written plan that sets forth:
5
Any institution that must comply with this section in order to receive favorable tax treatment under 26 U.S.C. 584 (namely, any corporate fiduciary) may seek OCC approval of special exemption funds in accordance with this paragraph (c)(5).
(i) The reason that the proposed fund requires a special exemption;
(ii) The provisions of the proposed fund that are inconsistent with paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section;
(iii) The provisions of paragraph (b) of this section for which the bank seeks an exemption; and
(iv) The manner in which the proposed fund addresses the rights and interests of participating accounts.

§ 9.20
Transfer agents.
(a)(1)
Registration.
An application for registration under Section 17A(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 of a transfer agent for which the OCC is the appropriate regulatory agency, as defined in section 3(a)(34)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, shall be filed with the OCC on FFIEC Form TA-1, in accordance with the instructions contained therein. Registration shall become effective 30 days after the date an application on Form TA-1 is filed unless the OCC accelerates, denies, or postpones such registration in accordance with section 17A(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
(2)
Amendments to registration.
Within 60 days following the date on which any information reported on Form TA-1 becomes inaccurate, misleading, or incomplete, the registrant shall file an amendment on FFIEC Form TA-1 correcting the inaccurate, misleading, or incomplete information. The filing of an amendment to an application for registration as a transfer agent under this section, which registration has not become effective, shall postpone the effective date of the registration for 30 days following the date on which the amendment is filed unless the OCC accelerates, denies, or postpones the registration in accordance with Section 17A(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
(3)
Withdrawal from registration.
Any registered national bank transfer agent that ceases to engage in activities that require registration under Section 17A(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 may file a written notice of withdrawal from registration with the OCC. Deregistration shall be effective 60 days after filing.
(4)
Reports.
Every registration or amendment filed under this section shall constitute a report or application within the meaning of Sections 17, 17A(c), and 32(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
(b)
Operational and reporting requirements.

[73 FR 22242, Apr. 24, 2008]

# Interpretations
§ 9.100
Acting as indenture trustee and creditor.
With respect to a debt securities issuance, a national bank may act both as indenture trustee and as creditor until 90 days after default, if the bank maintains adequate controls to manage the potential conflicts of interest.
§ 9.101
Providing investment advice for a fee.
(a)
In general.
The term “fiduciary capacity” at § 9.2(e) is defined to include “investment adviser, if the bank receives a fee for its investment advice.” In other words, if a bank is providing investment advice for a fee, then it is acting in a fiduciary capacity. For purposes of that definition, “investment adviser” generally means a national bank that provides advice or recommendations concerning the purchase or sale of specific securities, such as a national bank engaged in portfolio advisory and management activities (including acting as investment adviser to a mutual fund). Additionally, the qualifying phrase “if the bank receives a fee for its investment advice” excludes those activities in which the investment advice is merely incidental to other services.
(b)
Specific activities
—(1)
Full-service brokerage.
Engaging in full-service brokerage may entail providing investment advice for a fee, depending upon the commission structure and specific facts. Full-service brokerage involves investment advice for a fee if a non-bank broker engaged in that activity is considered an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80b-1
et seq.
).
(2)
Activities not involving investment advice for a fee.
The following activities generally do not entail providing investment advice for a fee:
(i) Financial advisory and counseling activities, including strategic planning of a financial nature, merger and acquisition advisory services, advisory and structuring services related to project finance transactions, and providing market economic information to customers in general;
(ii) Client-directed investment activities (
i.e.,
the bank has no investment discretion) where investment advice and research may be made available to the client, but the fee does not depend on the provision of investment advice;
(iii) Investment advisory activities incidental to acting as a municipal securities dealer;
(iv) Real estate management services provided to other financial institutions;
(v) Real estate consulting services, including acting as a finder in locating, analyzing, and making recommendations regarding the purchase of property, and making recommendations concerning the sale of property;
(vi) Advisory activities concerning bridge loans;
(vii) Advisory activities for homeowners' associations;
(viii) Advisory activities concerning tax planning and structuring; and
(ix) Investment advisory activities authorized by the OCC under 12 U.S.C. 24(Seventh) as incidental to the business of banking.

A national bank that acts as an investment adviser to an investment company is subject to the requirements of SEC Rule 17j-1 (17 CFR 270.17j-1) issued under the Investment Company Act of 1940. SEC Rule 17j-1 requires an “access person” of the investment adviser to report certain personal securities transactions to the investment adviser for review by the Securities and Exchange Commission. “Access person” includes directors, officers, and certain employees of the investment adviser. The reporting requirement under paragraph (a)(4) of this section is a separate requirement from any applicable requirements under SEC Rule 17j-1. However, an “access person” required to file a report with a national bank pursuant to SEC Rule 17j-1 need not file a separate report under paragraph (a)(4) of this section if the required information is the same.

A national bank may file a written request with the OCC for waiver of one or more of the requirements set forth in §§ 12.2 through 12.7, either in whole or in part. The OCC may grant a waiver from the requirements of this part to any national bank, or any class of national banks, with regard to a specific transaction or a specific class of transactions.
§ 12.9
Settlement of securities transactions.
(a) All contracts effected or entered into by a national bank for the purchase or sale of a security (other than an exempted security as defined in 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(12), government security, municipal security, commercial paper, bankers' acceptances, or commercial bills) shall provide for completion of the transaction within the number of business days in the standard settlement cycle followed by registered broker dealers in the United States, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties at the time of the transaction. The number of business days in the standard settlement cycle shall be determined by reference to paragraph (a) of SEC Rule 15c6-1, 17 CFR 240.15c6-1(a).
(b) Paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section do not apply to contracts:
(1) For the purchase or sale of limited partnership interests that are not listed on an exchange or for which quotations are not disseminated through an automated quotation system of a registered securities association;
(2) For the purchase or sale of securities that the SEC may from time to time, taking into account then existing market practices, exempt by order from the requirements of paragraph (a) of SEC Rule 15c6-1, 17 CFR 240.15c6-1(a), either unconditionally or on specified terms and conditions, if the SEC determines that an exemption is consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors.
(c) Paragraph (a) of this section does not apply to contracts for the sale for cash of securities that are priced after 4:30 p.m. Eastern time on the date the securities are priced and that are sold by an issuer to an underwriter pursuant to a firm commitment underwritten offering registered under the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. 77a
et seq.,
or sold to an initial purchaser by a national bank participating in the offering. A national bank shall not effect or enter into a contract for the purchase or sale of the securities that provides for payment of funds and delivery of securities later than the fourth business day after the date of the contract unless otherwise expressly agreed to by the parties at the time of the transaction.
(d) For purposes of paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section, the parties to a contract are deemed to have expressly agreed to an alternate date for payment of funds and delivery of securities at the time of the transaction for a contract for the sale for cash of securities pursuant to a firm commitment offering if the managing underwriter and the issuer have agreed to the date for all securities sold pursuant to the offering and the parties to the contract have not expressly agreed to another date for payment of funds and delivery of securities at the time of the transaction.

§ 13.1
Scope.
This part applies to national banks that have filed notice as, or are required to file notice as, government securities brokers or dealers pursuant to section 15C of the Securities Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78o-5) and Department of the Treasury rules under section 15C (17 CFR 400.1(d) and part 401).
§ 13.2
Definitions.
(a)
Bank that is a government securities broker or dealer
means a national bank that has filed notice, or is required to file notice, as a government securities broker or dealer pursuant to section 15C of the Securities Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78o-5) and Department of the
Treasury rules under section 15C (17 CFR 400.1(d) and part 401).
(b)
Customer
does not include a broker or dealer or a government securities broker or dealer.
(c)
Government security
has the same meaning as this term has in section 3(a)(42) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(42)).
(d)
Non-institutional customer
means any customer other than:
(1) A bank, savings association, insurance company, or registered investment company;
(2) An investment adviser registered under section 203 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80b-3); or
(3) Any entity (whether a natural person, corporation, partnership, trust, or otherwise) with total assets of at least $50 million.
§ 13.3
Business conduct.
A bank that is a government securities broker or dealer shall observe high standards of commercial honor and just and equitable principles of trade in the conduct of its business as a government securities broker or dealer.
§ 13.4
Recommendations to customers.
In recommending to a customer the purchase, sale or exchange of a government security, a bank that is a government securities broker or dealer shall have reasonable grounds for believing that the recommendation is suitable for the customer upon the basis of the facts, if any, disclosed by the customer as to the customer's other security holdings and as to the customer's financial situation and needs.
§ 13.5
Customer information.
Prior to the execution of a transaction recommended to a non-institutional customer, a bank that is a government securities broker or dealer shall make reasonable efforts to obtain information concerning:
(a) The customer's financial status;
(b) The customer's tax status;
(c) The customer's investment objectives; and
(d) Such other information used or considered to be reasonable by the bank in making recommendations to the customer.

# Interpretations
§ 13.100
Obligations concerning institutional customers.
(a) As a result of broadened authority provided by the Government Securities Act Amendments of 1993 (15 U.S.C. 78o-3 and 78o-5), the OCC is adopting sales practice rules for the government securities market, a market with a particularly broad institutional component. Accordingly, the OCC believes it is appropriate to provide further guidance to banks on their suitability obligations when making recommendations to institutional customers.
(b) The OCC's suitability rule (§ 13.4) is fundamental to fair dealing and is intended to promote ethical sales practices and high standards of professional conduct. Banks' responsibilities include having a reasonable basis for recommending a particular security or strategy, as well as having reasonable grounds for believing the recommendation is suitable for the customer to whom it is made. Banks are expected to meet the same high standards of competence, professionalism, and good faith regardless of the financial circumstances of the customer.
(c) In recommending to a customer the purchase, sale, or exchange of any government security, the bank shall have reasonable grounds for believing that the recommendation is suitable for the customer upon the basis of the facts, if any, disclosed by the customer as to the customer's other security holdings and financial situation and needs.
(d) The interpretation in this section concerns only the manner in which a bank determines that a recommendation is suitable for a particular institutional customer. The manner in which a bank fulfills this suitability obligation will vary, depending on the nature of the customer and the specific transaction. Accordingly, the interpretation in this section deals only with guidance regarding how a bank may fulfill customer-specific suitability obligations under § 13.4.
1
1
The interpretation in this section does not address the obligation related to suitability that requires that a bank have “* * * a ‘reasonable basis’ to believe that the recommendation could be suitable for at least
some customers.”
In the Matter of the Application of F.J. Kaufman and Company of Virginia and Frederick J. Kaufman, Jr.,
50 SEC 164 (1989).
(e) While it is difficult to define in advance the scope of a bank's suitability obligation with respect to a specific institutional customer transaction recommended by a bank, the OCC has identified certain factors that may be relevant when considering compliance with § 13.4. These factors are not intended to be requirements or the only factors to be considered but are offered merely as guidance in determining the scope of a bank's suitability obligations.
(f) The two most important considerations in determining the scope of a bank's suitability obligations in making recommendations to an institutional customer are the customer's capability to evaluate investment risk independently and the extent to which the customer is exercising independent judgement in evaluating a bank's recommendation. A bank must determine, based on the information available to it, the customer's capability to evaluate investment risk. In some cases, the bank may conclude that the customer is not capable of making independent investment decisions in general. In other cases, the institutional customer may have general capability, but may not be able to understand a particular type of instrument or its risk. This is more likely to arise with relatively new types of instruments, or those with significantly different risk or volatility characteristics than other investments generally made by the institution. If a customer is either generally not capable of evaluating investment risk or lacks sufficient capability to evaluate the particular product, the scope of a bank's customer-specific obligations under § 13.4 would not be diminished by the fact that the bank was dealing with an institutional customer. On the other hand, the fact that a customer initially needed help understanding a potential investment need not necessarily imply that the customer did not ultimately develop an understanding and make an independent investment decision.
(g) A bank may conclude that a customer is exercising independent judgement if the customer's investment decision will be based on its own independent assessment of the opportunities and risks presented by a potential investment, market factors and other investment considerations. Where the bank has reasonable grounds for concluding that the institutional customer is making independent investment decisions and is capable of independently evaluating investment risk, then a bank's obligations under § 13.4 for a particular customer are fulfilled.
2
Where a customer has delegated decision-making authority to an agent, such as an investment advisor or a bank trust department, the interpretation in this section shall be applied to the agent.
2
See footnote 1 in paragraph (d) of this section.
(h) A determination of capability to evaluate investment risk independently will depend on an examination of the customer's capability to make its own investment decisions, including the resources available to the customer to make informed decisions. Relevant considerations could include:
(1) The use of one or more consultants, investment advisers, or bank trust departments;
(2) The general level of experience of the institutional customer in financial markets and specific experience with the type of instruments under consideration;
(3) The customer's ability to understand the economic features of the security involved;
(4) The customer's ability to independently evaluate how market developments would affect the security; and
(5) The complexity of the security or securities involved.
(i) A determination that a customer is making independent investment decisions will depend on the nature of the relationship that exists between the bank and the customer.
Relevant considerations could include:
(1) Any written or oral understanding that exists between the bank and the customer regarding the nature of the relationship between the bank and the
customer and the services to be rendered by the bank;
(2) The presence or absence of a pattern of acceptance of the bank's recommendations;
(3) The use by the customer of ideas, suggestions, market views and information obtained from other government securities brokers or dealers or market professionals, particularly those relating to the same type of securities; and
(4) The extent to which the bank has received from the customer current comprehensive portfolio information in connection with discussing recommended transactions or has not been provided important information regarding its portfolio or investment objectives.
(j) Banks are reminded that these factors are merely guidelines that will be utilized to determine whether a bank has fulfilled its suitability obligation with respect to a specific institutional customer transaction and that the inclusion or absence of any of these factors is not dispositive of the determination of suitability. Such a determination can only be made on a case-by-case basis taking into consideration all the facts and circumstances of a particular bank/customer relationship, assessed in the context of a particular transaction.
(k) For purposes of the interpretation in this section, an institutional customer shall be any entity other than a natural person. In determining the applicability of the interpretation in this section to an institutional customer, the OCC will consider the dollar value of the securities that the institutional customer has in its portfolio and/or under management. While the interpretation in this section is potentially applicable to any institutional customer, the guidance contained in this section is more appropriately applied to an institutional customer with at least $10 million invested in securities in the aggregate in its portfolio and/or under management.

Anticoercion and antitying rules.

[65 FR 75839, Dec. 4, 2000, as amended at 79 FR 28398, May 16, 2014]

the completion of the initial sale of an insurance product or annuity to a consumer. The disclosure required by paragraph (b) of this section must be made orally and in writing at the time the consumer applies for an extension of credit in connection with which an insurance product or annuity is solicited, offered, or sold.
(2)
Exception for transactions by mail.
If a sale of an insurance product or annuity is conducted by mail, a covered person is not required to make the oral disclosures required by paragraph (a) of this section. If a covered person takes an application for credit by mail, the covered person is not required to make the oral disclosure required by paragraph (b).
(3)
Exception for transactions by telephone.
If a sale of an insurance product or annuity is conducted by telephone, a covered person may provide the written disclosures required by paragraph (a) of this section by mail within 3 business days beginning on the first business day after the sale, excluding Sundays and the legal public holidays specified in 5 U.S.C. 6103(a). If a covered person takes an application for credit by telephone, the covered person may provide the written disclosure required by paragraph (b) of this section by mail, provided the covered person mails it to the consumer within three days beginning the first business day after the application is taken, excluding Sundays and the legal public holidays specified in 5 U.S.C. 6103(a).
(4)
Electronic form of disclosures.
(i) Subject to the requirements of section 101(c) of the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (15 U.S.C. 7001(c)), a covered person may provide the written disclosures required by paragraph (a) and (b) of this section through electronic media instead of on paper, if the consumer affirmatively consents to receiving the disclosures electronically and if the disclosures are provided in a format that the consumer may retain or obtain later, for example, by printing or storing electronically (such as by downloading).
(ii) Any disclosures required by paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section that are provided by electronic media are not required to be provided orally.
(5)
Disclosures must be readily understandable.
The disclosures provided shall be conspicuous, simple, direct, readily understandable, and designed to call attention to the nature and significance of the information provided.

• NOT FDIC-INSURED
• NOT INSURED BY ANY FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AGENCY
• NOT GUARANTEED BY THE [BANK] [FEDERAL SAVINGS ASSOCIATION]
• MAY GO DOWN IN VALUE
(6)
Disclosures must be meaningful.

(B) A typeface and type size that are easy to read;
(C) Wide margins and ample line spacing;
(D) Boldface or italics for key words; and
(E) Distinctive type style, and graphic devices, such as shading or sidebars, when the disclosures are combined with other information.
(ii) A covered person has not provided the disclosures in a meaningful form if the covered person merely states to the consumer that the required disclosures are available in printed material, but does not provide the printed material when required and does not orally disclose the information to the consumer when required.
(iii) With respect to those disclosures made through electronic media for which paper or oral disclosures are not required, the disclosures are not meaningfully provided if the consumer may bypass the visual text of the disclosures before purchasing an insurance product or annuity.
(7)
Consumer acknowledgment.
A covered person must obtain from the consumer, at the time a consumer receives the disclosures required under paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section, or at the time of the initial purchase by the consumer of an insurance product or annuity, a written acknowledgment by the consumer that the consumer received the disclosures. A covered person may permit a consumer to acknowledge receipt of the disclosures electronically or in paper form. If the disclosures required under paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section are provided in connection with a transaction that is conducted by telephone, a covered person must:

(ii) Make reasonable efforts to obtain a written acknowledgment from the consumer.
(d)
Advertisements and other promotional material for insurance products or annuities.

[65 FR 75839, Dec. 4, 2000, as amended at 79 FR 28398, May 16, 2014]
§ 14.50
Where insurance activities may take place.
(a)
General rule.
A bank or Federal savings association must, to the extent practicable, keep the area where the bank or Federal savings association conducts transactions involving insurance products or annuities physically segregated from areas where retail deposits are routinely accepted from the general public, identify the areas where insurance product or annuity sales activities occur, and clearly delineate and distinguish those areas from the areas where the bank's or Federal savings association's retail deposit-taking activities occur.
(b)
Referrals.
Any person who accepts deposits from the public in an area where such transactions are routinely conducted in the bank or Federal savings association may refer a consumer who seeks to purchase an insurance product or annuity to a qualified person who sells that product only if the person making the referral receives no more than a one-time, nominal fee of a fixed dollar amount for each referral that does not depend on whether the referral results in a transaction.
[65 FR 75839, Dec. 4, 2000, as amended at 79 FR 28399, May 16, 2014]
§ 14.60
Qualification and licensing requirements for insurance sales personnel.

§ 19.13

Except as otherwise provided by law, the ALJ may, for good cause shown, extend the time limits prescribed by the Uniform Rules or by any notice or order issued in the proceedings. After the referral of the case to the Comptroller pursuant to § 19.38, the Comptroller may grant extensions of the time limits for good cause shown.

§ 19.16

Collateral attacks on adjudicatory proceeding.
If an interlocutory appeal or collateral attack is brought in any court concerning all or any part of an adjudicatory proceeding, the challenged adjudicatory proceeding will continue without regard to the pendency of that court proceeding. No default or other failure to act as directed in the adjudicatory proceeding within the times prescribed in this subpart will be excused based on the pendency before any court of any interlocutory appeal or collateral attack.
§ 19.18
Commencement of proceeding and contents of notice.
(a)
Commencement of proceeding.
—(1)(i) Except for change-in-control proceedings under section 7(j)(4) of the FDIA, 12 U.S.C. 1817(j)(4), a proceeding governed by this subpart is commenced by issuance of a notice by the Comptroller.
(ii) The notice must be served by Enforcement Counsel upon the respondent and given to any other appropriate financial institution supervisory authority where required by law. Enforcement Counsel may serve the notice upon counsel for the respondent, provided that Enforcement Counsel has confirmed that counsel represents the respondent in the matter and will accept service of the notice on behalf of the respondent.
(iii) Enforcement Counsel must file the notice with OFIA.
(2) Change-in control proceedings under section 7(j)(4) of the FDIA (12 U.S.C. 1817(j)(4)) commence with the issuance of an order by the Comptroller.
(b)
Contents of notice.
Notice pleading applies. The notice must provide:
(1) The legal authority for the proceeding and for the OCC's jurisdiction over the proceeding;
(2) Matters of fact or law showing that the OCC is entitled to relief;
(3) A proposed order or prayer for an order granting the requested relief;
(4) The time, place, and nature of the hearing as required by law or regulation;
(5) The time within which to file an answer as required by law or regulation;
(6) The time within which to request a hearing as required by law or regulation; and
(7) That the answer and/or request for a hearing must be filed with OFIA.
§ 19.19
Answer.
(a)
When.
Within 20 days of service of the notice, respondent must file an answer as designated in the notice. In a
civil money penalty proceeding, respondent must also file a request for a hearing within 20 days of service of the notice.
(b)
Content of answer.
An answer must specifically respond to each paragraph or allegation of fact contained in the notice and must admit, deny, or state that the respondent lacks sufficient information to admit or deny each allegation of fact. A statement of lack of information has the effect of a denial. Denials must fairly meet the substance of each allegation of fact denied; general denials are not permitted. When a respondent denies part of an allegation, that part must be denied and the remainder specifically admitted. Any allegation of fact in the notice which is not denied in the answer is deemed admitted for purposes of the proceeding. A respondent is not required to respond to the portion of a notice that constitutes the prayer for relief or proposed order. The answer must set forth affirmative defenses, if any, asserted by the respondent.
(c)
Default
—(1)
Effect of failure to answer.
Failure of a respondent to file an answer required by this section within the time provided constitutes a waiver of the respondent's right to appear and contest the allegations in the notice. If no timely answer is filed, Enforcement Counsel may file a motion for entry of an order of default. Upon a finding that no good cause has been shown for the failure to file a timely answer, the ALJ will file with the Comptroller a recommended decision containing the findings and the relief sought in the notice. Any final order issued by the Comptroller based upon a respondent's failure to answer is deemed to be an order issued upon consent.
(2)
Effect of failure to request a hearing in civil money penalty proceedings.
If respondent fails to request a hearing as required by law within the time provided, the notice of assessment constitutes a final and unappealable order of the Comptroller without further action by the ALJ.
§ 19.20
Amended pleadings.
(a)
Amendments.
The notice or answer may be amended or supplemented at any stage of the proceeding. The respondent must answer an amended notice within the time remaining for the respondent's answer to the original notice, or within ten days after service of the amended notice, whichever period is longer, unless the Comptroller or ALJ orders otherwise for good cause.
(b)
Amendments to conform to the evidence.
When issues not raised in the notice or answer are tried at the hearing by express or implied consent of the parties, they will be treated in all respects as if they had been raised in the notice or answer, and no formal amendments are required. If evidence is objected to at the hearing on the ground that it is not within the issues raised by the notice or answer, the ALJ may admit the evidence when admission is likely to assist in adjudicating the merits of the action and the objecting party fails to satisfy the ALJ that the admission of such evidence would unfairly prejudice that party's action or defense upon the merits. The ALJ may grant a continuance to enable the objecting party to meet such evidence.
§ 19.21
Failure to appear.
Failure of a respondent to appear in person at the hearing or by a duly authorized counsel constitutes a waiver of respondent's right to a hearing and is deemed an admission of the facts as alleged and consent to the relief sought in the notice. Without further proceedings or notice to the respondent, the ALJ will file with the Comptroller a recommended decision containing the findings and the relief sought in the notice.
§ 19.22
Consolidation and severance of actions.
(a)
Consolidation
—(1) On the motion of any party, or on the ALJ's own motion, the ALJ may consolidate, for some or all purposes, any two or more proceedings, if each such proceeding involves or arises out of the same transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences, or involves at least one common respondent or a material common question of law or fact, unless such consolidation would cause unreasonable delay or injustice.
(2) In the event of consolidation under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, appropriate adjustment to the prehearing schedule must be made to
avoid unnecessary expense, inconvenience, or delay.
(b)
Severance.
The ALJ may, upon the motion of any party, sever the proceeding for separate resolution of the matter as to any respondent only if the ALJ finds:
(1) Undue prejudice or injustice to the moving party would result from not severing the proceeding; and
(2) Such undue prejudice or injustice would outweigh the interests of judicial economy and expedition in the complete and final resolution of the proceeding.
§ 19.23
Motions.
(a)
In writing.
—(1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, an application or request for an order or ruling must be made by written motion.
(2) All written motions must state with particularity the relief sought and must be accompanied by a proposed order.
(3) No oral argument may be held on written motions except as otherwise directed by the ALJ. Written memoranda, briefs, affidavits, or other relevant material or documents may be filed in support of or in opposition to a motion.
(b)
Oral motions.
A motion may be made orally on the record unless the ALJ directs that such motion be reduced to writing.
(c)
Filing of motions.
Motions must be filed with the ALJ, except that following the filing of the recommended decision, motions must be filed with the Comptroller.
(d)
Responses.
—(1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, within ten days after service of any written motion, or within such other period of time as may be established by the ALJ or the Comptroller, any party may file a written response to a motion. The ALJ will not rule on any oral or written motion before each party has had an opportunity to file a response.
(2) The failure of a party to oppose a written motion or an oral motion made on the record is deemed a consent by that party to the entry of an order substantially in the form of the order accompanying the motion.
(e)
Dilatory motions.
Frivolous, dilatory or repetitive motions are prohibited. The filing of such motions may form the basis for sanctions.
(f)
Dispositive motions.
Dispositive motions are governed by §§ 19.29 and 19.30.
§ 19.24
Scope of document discovery.
(a)
Limits on discovery
—(1) Subject to the limitations set out in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section, a party to a proceeding under this subpart may obtain document discovery by serving a written request to produce documents. For purposes of a request to produce documents, the term
documents
includes writings, drawings, graphs, charts, photographs, recordings, electronically stored information, and other data or data compilations stored in any medium from which information can be obtained either directly or, if necessary, after translation by the responding party, into a reasonably usable form.
(2) Discovery by use of deposition is governed by subpart I of this part.
(3) Discovery by use of either interrogatories or requests for admission is not permitted.
(4) Any request to produce documents that calls for irrelevant material; or that is unreasonable, oppressive, excessive in scope, unduly burdensome, or repetitive of previous requests, or that seeks to obtain privileged documents will be denied or modified. A request is unreasonable, oppressive, excessive in scope, or unduly burdensome if, among other things, it fails to include justifiable limitations on the time period covered and the geographic locations to be searched, or the time provided to respond in the request is inadequate.
(b)
Relevance.
A party may obtain document discovery regarding any non-privileged matter that has material relevance to the merits of the pending action.
(c)
Privileged matter.
Privileged documents are not discoverable. Privileges include the attorney-client privilege, attorney work-product doctrine, bank examination privilege, law enforcement privilege, any government's or government agency's deliberative process privilege, and any other privileges the Constitution, any applicable act of Congress, or the principles of common law provide.
(d)
Time limits.
All document discovery, including all responses to discovery requests, must be completed by the date set by the ALJ and no later than 30 days prior to the date scheduled for the commencement of the hearing, except as provided in the Local Rules. No exceptions to this time limit are permitted, unless the ALJ finds on the record that good cause exists for waiving the requirements of paragraph (d).
§ 19.25
Request for document discovery from parties.
(a)
Document requests.
—(1) Any party may serve on any other party a request to produce and permit the requesting party or its representative to inspect or copy any discoverable documents that are in the possession, custody, or control of the party upon whom the request is served. In the case of a request for inspection, the responding party may produce copies of documents or of electronically stored information instead of permitting inspection.
(2) The request:
(i) Must describe with reasonable particularity each item or category of items to be inspected or produced; and
(ii) Must specify a reasonable time, place, and manner for the inspection or production.
(b)
Production or copying
—(1)
General.
Unless otherwise specified by the ALJ or agreed upon by the parties, the producing party must produce copies of documents as they are kept in the usual course of business or organized to correspond to the categories of the request, and electronically stored information must be produced in a form in which it is ordinarily maintained or in a reasonably usable form.
(2)
Costs.
The producing party must pay its own costs to respond to a discovery request, unless otherwise agreed by the parties.
(c)
Obligation to update responses.
A party who has responded to a discovery request with a response that was complete when made is not required to supplement the response to include documents thereafter acquired, unless the responding party learns:
(1) The response was materially incorrect when made; or
(2) The response, though correct when made, is no longer true and a failure to amend the response is, in substance, a knowing concealment.
(d)
Motions to limit discovery.
—(1) Any party that objects to a discovery request may, within 20 days of being served with such request, file a motion in accordance with the provisions of § 19.23 to strike or otherwise limit the request. If an objection is made to only a portion of an item or category in a request, the portion objected to must be specified. Any objections not made in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) and § 19.23 are waived.
(2) The party who served the request that is the subject of a motion to strike or limit may file a written response within ten days of service of the motion. No other party may file a response.
(e)
Privilege.
At the time other documents are produced, the producing party must reasonably identify all documents withheld on the grounds of privilege and must produce a statement of the basis for the assertion of privilege. When similar documents that are protected by attorney-client privilege, attorney work-product doctrine, bank examination privilege, law enforcement privilege, any government's or government agency's deliberative process privilege, or any other privileges of the Constitution, any applicable act of Congress, or the principles of common law, or are voluminous, these documents may be identified by category instead of by individual document. The ALJ retains discretion to determine when the identification by category is insufficient.
(f)
Motions to compel production.
—(1) If a party withholds any documents as privileged or fails to comply fully with a discovery request, the requesting party may, within ten days of the assertion of privilege or of the time the failure to comply becomes known to the requesting party, file a motion in accordance with the provisions of § 19.23 for the issuance of a subpoena compelling production.
(2) The party who asserted the privilege or failed to comply with the document request may file a written response to a motion to compel within
ten days of service of the motion. No other party may file a response.
(g)
Ruling on motions.
After the time for filing responses pursuant to this section has expired, the ALJ will rule promptly on all motions filed pursuant to this section. If the ALJ determines that a discovery request, or any of its terms, calls for irrelevant material, is unreasonable, oppressive, excessive in scope, unduly burdensome, or repetitive of previous requests, or seeks to obtain privileged documents, the ALJ may deny or modify the request, and may issue appropriate protective orders, upon such conditions as justice may require. The pendency of a motion to strike or limit discovery or to compel production is not a basis for staying or continuing the proceeding, unless otherwise ordered by the ALJ. Notwithstanding any other provision in this part, the ALJ may not release, or order a party to produce, documents withheld on grounds of privilege if the party has stated to the ALJ its intention to file a timely motion for interlocutory review of the ALJ's order to produce the documents, and until the motion for interlocutory review has been decided.
(h)
Enforcing discovery subpoenas.
If the ALJ issues a subpoena compelling production of documents by a party, the subpoenaing party may, in the event of noncompliance and to the extent authorized by applicable law, apply to any appropriate United States district court for an order requiring compliance with the subpoena. A party's right to seek court enforcement of a subpoena will not in any manner limit the sanctions that may be imposed by the ALJ against a party who fails to produce subpoenaed documents.
§ 19.26
Document subpoenas to nonparties.
(a)
General rules.
—(1) Any party may apply to the ALJ for the issuance of a document discovery subpoena addressed to any person who is not a party to the proceeding. The application must contain a proposed document subpoena and a brief statement showing the general relevance and reasonableness of the scope of documents sought. The subpoenaing party must specify a reasonable time, place, and manner for making production in response to the document subpoena.
(2) A party may apply for a document subpoena under this section only within the time period during which such party could serve a discovery request under § 19.24(d). The party obtaining the document subpoena is responsible for serving it on the subpoenaed person and for serving copies on all parties. Document subpoenas may be served in any state, territory, or possession of the United States, the District of Columbia, or as otherwise provided by law.
(3) The ALJ will promptly issue any document subpoena requested pursuant to this section. If the ALJ determines that the application does not set forth a valid basis for the issuance of the subpoena, or that any of its terms are unreasonable, oppressive, excessive in scope, or unduly burdensome, the ALJ may refuse to issue the subpoena or may issue it in a modified form upon such conditions as may be consistent with the Uniform Rules.
(b)
Motion to quash or modify.
—(1) Any person to whom a document subpoena is directed may file a motion to quash or modify such subpoena with the ALJ. The motion must be accompanied by a statement of the basis for quashing or modifying the subpoena. The movant must serve the motion on all parties, and any party may respond to such motion within ten days of service of the motion.
(2) Any motion to quash or modify a document subpoena must be filed on the same basis, including the assertion of privilege, upon which a party could object to a discovery request under § 19.25(d), and during the same time limits during which such an objection could be filed.
(c)
Enforcing document subpoenas.
If a subpoenaed person fails to comply with any subpoena issued pursuant to this section or any order of the ALJ, which directs compliance with all or any portion of a document subpoena, the subpoenaing party or any other aggrieved party may, to the extent authorized by applicable law, apply to an appropriate United States district court for an order requiring compliance with so much of the document subpoena as the ALJ has not quashed or modified. A
party's right to seek court enforcement of a document subpoena will in no way limit the sanctions that may be imposed by the ALJ on a party who induces a failure to comply with subpoenas issued under this section.
§ 19.27
Deposition of witness unavailable for hearing.
(a)
General rules.
—(1) If a witness will not be available for the hearing, a party desiring to preserve that witness' testimony for the record may apply in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, to the ALJ for the issuance of a subpoena, including a subpoena
duces tecum,
requiring the attendance of the witness at a deposition. The ALJ may issue a deposition subpoena under this section upon showing:
(i) The witness will be unable to attend or may be prevented from attending the hearing because of age, sickness or infirmity, or will otherwise be unavailable;
(ii) The witness' unavailability was not procured or caused by the subpoenaing party;
(iii) The testimony is reasonably expected to be material; and
(iv) Taking the deposition will not result in any undue burden to any other party and will not cause undue delay of the proceeding.
(2) The application must contain a proposed deposition subpoena and a brief statement of the reasons for the issuance of the subpoena. The subpoena must name the witness whose deposition is to be taken and specify the time, manner, and place for taking the deposition. A deposition subpoena may require the witness to be deposed at any place within the country in which that witness resides or has a regular place of employment, by remote means, or such other convenient place or manner, as the ALJ fixes.
(3) Any requested subpoena that sets forth a valid basis for its issuance must be promptly issued, unless the ALJ requires a written response or requires attendance at a conference concerning whether the requested subpoena should be issued.
(4) The party obtaining a deposition subpoena is responsible for serving it on the witness and for serving copies on all parties. Unless the ALJ orders otherwise, no deposition under this section may be taken on fewer than ten days' notice to the witness and all parties.
(b)
Objections to deposition subpoenas.
—(1) The witness and any party who has not had an opportunity to oppose a deposition subpoena issued under this section may file a motion with the ALJ to quash or modify the subpoena prior to the time for compliance specified in the subpoena, but not more than ten days after service of the subpoena.
(2) A statement of the basis for the motion to quash or modify a subpoena issued under this section must accompany the motion. The motion must be served on all parties.
(c)
Procedure upon deposition.
—(1) Each witness testifying pursuant to a deposition subpoena must be duly sworn. By stipulation of the parties or by order of the ALJ, a court reporter or other person authorized to administer an oath may administer the oath remotely without being in the physical presence of the deponent. Each party must have the right to examine the witness. Objections to questions or documents must be in short form, stating the grounds for the objection. Failure to object to questions or documents is not deemed a waiver except where the ground for the objection might have been avoided if the objection had been timely presented. All questions, answers, and objections must be recorded.
(2) Any party may move before the ALJ for an order compelling the witness to answer any questions the witness has refused to answer or submit any evidence the witness has refused to submit during the deposition.
(3) The deposition must be subscribed by the witness, unless the parties and the witness, by stipulation, have waived the signing, or the witness is ill, cannot be found, or has refused to sign. If the deposition is not subscribed by the witness, the court reporter taking the deposition must certify that the transcript is a true and complete transcript of the deposition.
(d)
Enforcing subpoenas.
If a subpoenaed person fails to comply with any subpoena issued pursuant to this section, or fails to comply with any order
of the ALJ, which directs compliance with all or any portion of a deposition subpoena under paragraphs (b) or (c)(2) of this section, the subpoenaing party or other aggrieved party may, to the extent authorized by applicable law, apply to an appropriate United States district court for an order requiring compliance with the portions of the subpoena with which the subpoenaed party has not complied. A party's right to seek court enforcement of a deposition subpoena in no way limits the sanctions that may be imposed by the ALJ on a party who fails to comply with, or procures a failure to comply with, a subpoena issued under this section.
§ 19.28
Interlocutory review.
(a)
General rule.
The Comptroller may review a ruling of the ALJ prior to the certification of the record to the Comptroller only in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section and § 19.23.
(b)
Scope of review.
The Comptroller may exercise interlocutory review of a ruling of the ALJ if the Comptroller finds:
(1) The ruling involves a controlling question of law or policy as to which substantial grounds exist for a difference of opinion;
(2) Immediate review of the ruling may materially advance the ultimate termination of the proceeding;
(3) Subsequent modification of the ruling at the conclusion of the proceeding would be an inadequate remedy; or
(4) Subsequent modification of the ruling would cause unusual delay or expense.
(c)
Procedure.
Any request for interlocutory review must be filed by a party with the ALJ within ten days of the ruling and must otherwise comply with § 19.23. Any party may file a response to a request for interlocutory review in accordance with § 19.23(d). Upon the expiration of the time for filing all responses, the ALJ will refer the matter to the Comptroller for final disposition.
(d)
Suspension of proceeding.
Neither a request for interlocutory review nor any disposition of such a request by the Comptroller under this section suspends or stays the proceeding unless otherwise ordered by the ALJ or the Comptroller.
§ 19.29
Summary disposition.
(a)
In general.
The ALJ will recommend that the Comptroller issue a final order granting a motion for summary disposition if the undisputed pleaded facts, admissions, affidavits, stipulations, documentary evidence, matters as to which official notice may be taken, and any other evidentiary materials properly submitted in connection with a motion for summary disposition show:
(1) There is no genuine issue as to any material fact; and
(2) The moving party is entitled to a decision in its favor as a matter of law.
(b)
Filing of motions and responses.
—(1) Any party who believes there is no genuine issue of material fact to be determined and that the party is entitled to a decision as a matter of law may move at any time for summary disposition in its favor of all or any part of the proceeding. Any party, within 20 days after service of such a motion, or within such time period as allowed by the ALJ, may file a response to such motion.
(2) A motion for summary disposition must be accompanied by a statement of the material facts as to which the moving party contends there is no genuine issue. Such motion must be supported by documentary evidence, which may take the form of admissions in pleadings, stipulations, depositions, investigatory depositions, transcripts, affidavits, and any other evidentiary materials that the moving party contends supports the moving party's position. The motion must also be accompanied by a brief containing the points and authorities in support of the contention of the moving party. Any party opposing a motion for summary disposition must file a statement setting forth those material facts as to which the opposing party contends a genuine dispute exists. Such opposition must be supported by evidence of the same type as that submitted with the motion for summary disposition and a brief containing the points and authorities in
support of the contention that summary disposition would be inappropriate.
(c)
Hearing on motion.
At the written request of any party or on the ALJ's own motion, the ALJ may hear oral argument on the motion for summary disposition.
(d)
Decision on motion.
Following receipt of a motion for summary disposition and all responses thereto, the ALJ will determine whether the moving party is entitled to summary disposition. If the ALJ determines that summary disposition is warranted, the ALJ will submit a recommended decision to that effect to the Comptroller. If the ALJ finds that no party is entitled to summary disposition, the ALJ will make a ruling denying the motion.
§ 19.30
Partial summary disposition.
If the ALJ determines that a party is entitled to summary disposition as to certain claims only, the ALJ will defer submitting a recommended decision as to those claims. A hearing on the remaining issues must be ordered. Those claims for which the ALJ has determined that summary disposition is warranted will be addressed in the recommended decision filed at the conclusion of the hearing.
§ 19.31
Scheduling and prehearing conferences.
(a)
Scheduling conference.
Within 30 days of service of the notice or order commencing a proceeding, the ALJ will direct counsel for all parties to meet with the ALJ at a specified time and manner prior to the hearing for the purpose of scheduling the course and conduct of the proceeding. This meeting is called a “scheduling conference.” The schedule for the identification of potential witnesses, the time for and manner of discovery, and the exchange of any prehearing materials including witness lists, statements of issues, stipulations, exhibits, and any other materials may also be determined at the scheduling conference.
(b)
Prehearing conferences.
The ALJ may, in addition to the scheduling conference, on the ALJ's own motion or at the request of any party, direct counsel for the parties to confer with the ALJ at a prehearing conference to address any or all of the following:
(1) Simplification and clarification of the issues;
(2) Stipulations, admissions of fact, and the contents, authenticity and admissibility into evidence of documents;
(3) Matters of which official notice may be taken;
(4) Limitation of the number of witnesses;
(5) Summary disposition of any or all issues;
(6) Resolution of discovery issues or disputes;
(7) Amendments to pleadings; and
(8) Such other matters as may aid in the orderly disposition of the proceeding.
(c)
Transcript.
The ALJ may require that a scheduling or prehearing conference be recorded by a court reporter. A transcript of the conference and any materials filed, including orders, becomes part of the record of the proceeding. A party may obtain a copy of the transcript at the party's expense.
(d)
Scheduling or prehearing orders.
At or within a reasonable time following the conclusion of the scheduling conference or any prehearing conference, the ALJ will serve on each party an order setting forth any agreements reached and any procedural determinations made.
§ 19.32
Prehearing submissions.
(a)
Party prehearing submissions.
Within the time set by the ALJ, but in no case later than 20 days before the start of the hearing, each party must file with the ALJ and serve on every other party:
(1) A prehearing statement that states:
(i) The party's position with respect to the legal issues presented;
(ii) The statutory and case law upon which the party relies; and
(iii) The facts that the party expects to prove at the hearing;
(2) A final list of witnesses to be called to testify at the hearing, including the name, mailing address, and electronic mail address of each witness and a short summary of the expected testimony of each witness, which need not identify the exhibits to be relied upon by each witness at the hearing;
(3) A list of the exhibits expected to be introduced at the hearing along with a copy of each exhibit; and
(4) Stipulations of fact, if any.
(b)
Effect of failure to comply.
No witness may testify and no exhibits may be introduced at the hearing if such witness or exhibit is not listed in the prehearing submissions pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, except for good cause shown.
§ 19.33
Public hearings.
(a)
General rule.
All hearings must be open to the public, unless the Comptroller in their discretion, determines that holding an open hearing would be contrary to the public interest. Within 20 days of service of the notice or, in the case of change-in-control proceedings under section 7(j)(4) of the FDIA (12 U.S.C. 1817(j)(4)), within 20 days from service of the hearing order, any respondent may file with the Comptroller a request for a private hearing, and any party may file a reply to such a request. A party must serve on the ALJ a copy of any request or reply the party files with the Comptroller. The form of, and procedure for, these requests and replies are governed by § 19.23. A party's failure to file a request or a reply constitutes a waiver of any objections regarding whether the hearing will be public or private.
(b)
Filing document under seal.
Enforcement Counsel, in Enforcement Counsel's discretion, may file any document or part of a document under seal if disclosure of the document would be contrary to the public interest. The ALJ will take all appropriate steps to preserve the confidentiality of such documents or parts thereof, including closing portions of the hearing to the public.
§ 19.34
Hearing subpoenas.
(a)
Issuance.
—(1) Upon application of a party showing general relevance and reasonableness of scope of the testimony or other evidence sought, the ALJ may issue a subpoena or a subpoena
duces tecum
requiring the attendance of a witness at the hearing or the production of documentary or physical evidence at the hearing. The application for a hearing subpoena must also contain a proposed subpoena specifying the attendance of a witness or the production of evidence from any state, territory, or possession of the United States, the District of Columbia, or as otherwise provided by law at any designated place where the hearing is being conducted. The party making the application must serve a copy of the application and the proposed subpoena on every other party.
(2) A party may apply for a hearing subpoena at any time before the commencement of a hearing. During a hearing, a party may make an application for a subpoena orally on the record before the ALJ.
(3) The ALJ will promptly issue any hearing subpoena requested pursuant to this section. If the ALJ determines that the application does not set forth a valid basis for the issuance of the subpoena, or that any of its terms are unreasonable, oppressive, excessive in scope, or unduly burdensome, the ALJ may refuse to issue the subpoena or may issue it in a modified form upon any conditions consistent with this subpart. Upon issuance by the ALJ, the party making the application must serve the subpoena on the person named in the subpoena and on each party.
(b)
Motion to quash or modify.
—(1) Any person to whom a hearing subpoena is directed or any party may file a motion to quash or modify the subpoena, accompanied by a statement of the basis for quashing or modifying the subpoena. The movant must serve the motion on each party and on the person named in the subpoena. Any party may respond to the motion within ten days of service of the motion.
(2) Any motion to quash or modify a hearing subpoena must be filed prior to the time specified in the subpoena for compliance but not more than ten days after the date of service of the subpoena upon the movant.
(c)
Enforcing subpoenas.
If a subpoenaed person fails to comply with any subpoena issued pursuant to this section or any order of the ALJ which directs compliance with all or any portion of a document subpoena, the subpoenaing party or any other aggrieved party may seek enforcement of the subpoena pursuant to § 19.26(c).
§ 19.35
Conduct of hearings.
(a)
General rules
—(1)
Conduct of hearings.
Hearings must be conducted so as to provide a fair and expeditious presentation of the relevant disputed issues. Each party has the right to present its case or defense by oral and documentary evidence and to conduct such cross examination as may be required for full disclosure of the facts.
(2)
Order of hearing.
Enforcement Counsel will present its case-in-chief first, unless otherwise ordered by the ALJ, or unless otherwise expressly specified by law or regulation. Enforcement Counsel will be the first party to present an opening statement and a closing statement and may make a rebuttal statement after the respondent's closing statement. If there are multiple respondents, respondents may agree among themselves as to their order of presentation of their cases, but if they do not agree, the ALJ will fix the order.
(3)
Examination of witnesses.
Only one counsel for each party may conduct an examination of a witness, except that in the case of extensive direct examination, the ALJ may permit more than one counsel for the party presenting the witness to conduct the examination. A party may have one counsel conduct the direct examination and another counsel conduct re-direct examination of a witness, or may have one counsel conduct the cross examination of a witness and another counsel conduct the re-cross examination of a witness.

Issuance of notice or order.
The Comptroller may serve a notice of suspension or prohibition or order of removal or prohibition pursuant to section 8(g) of the FDIA (12 U.S.C. 1818(g)) on an institution-affiliated party. The Comptroller will serve a copy of this notice or order on any depository institution that the subject of the notice or order is affiliated with at the time the OCC issues the notice or order. After service of the notice or order, the institution-affiliated party must immediately cease service to, or participation in the affairs of, that depository institution and, if so determined by the OCC, any other depository institution. The notice or order will indicate the basis for suspension, removal, or prohibition and will inform the institution-affiliated party of the right to request in writing, within 30 days from the date that the institution-affiliated party was served, an opportunity to show at an informal hearing that continued service to or participation in the conduct of the affairs of any depository institution has not posed, does not pose, or is not likely to pose a threat to the interests of the depositors of, or has not threatened, does not threaten, or is not likely to threaten to impair public confidence in, any relevant depository institution. The Comptroller will serve the notice or order upon the institution-affiliated party and the related institution in the manner set forth in § 19.11(c).
(b)
Request for hearing

The request filed under this section must state specifically the relief desired and the grounds on which that relief is based and must admit, deny, or state that the institution-affiliated party lacks sufficient information to admit or deny each allegation in the notice or order. A statement of lack of information has the effect of a denial. Denials must fairly meet the substance of each allegation denied; general denials are not permitted. When the institution-affiliated party denies part of an allegation, that part must be denied and the remainder specifically admitted. Any allegation in the notice or order which is not denied is deemed admitted for purposes of the proceeding. The request must state with particularity how the institution-affiliated party intends to show that its continued service to or participation in the affairs of the institution would not pose a threat to the interests of the institution's depositors or impair public confidence in any institution.
(c)
Default.

(b)
Appointment of presiding officer.
The OCC Supervisory Office must appoint one or more OCC employees as the presiding officer to conduct the hearing. The presiding officer(s) may not have been involved in a prosecutorial or investigative role in the proceeding, a factually related proceeding, or the underlying enforcement action.

Petitioner.
When the petitioner requests a hearing, the petitioner may elect to have the matter determined by the presiding officer solely on the basis of written submissions by serving on the OCC Supervisory Office and all parties a signed document waiving the statutory right to appear and make oral argument. The petitioner must present the written submissions to the presiding officer and serve the other parties not later than ten days prior to the date fixed for the hearing or within a shorter time period as the presiding officer may permit.
(2)
OCC.
The OCC may respond to the petitioner's submissions by presenting the presiding officer with a written response and by serving the other parties in the manner prescribed by § 19.11(c) not later than the date fixed for the hearing or within such other time period as the presiding officer may require.

Hearings under this subpart are not subject to the provisions of subpart A of this part or the adjudicative provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 554-557).
(2)
Powers of the presiding officer.
The presiding officer must determine all procedural issues that are governed by this subpart. The presiding officer also may permit witnesses, limit the number of witnesses, and impose time limitations as they deem reasonable. The informal hearing will not be governed by formal rules of evidence, including the Federal Rules of Evidence. The presiding officer must consider all oral presentations, when permitted, and all documents the presiding officer deems to be relevant and material to the proceeding and not unduly repetitious. The presiding officer may ask questions of any person participating in the hearing and may make any rulings reasonably necessary to facilitate the effective and efficient operation of the hearing.
(3)
Presentation.
(i) The OCC and the petitioner may present relevant written materials and oral argument at the hearing. The petitioner may appear at the hearing personally or through counsel. Except as permitted in paragraph (c) of this section, each party, including the OCC, must file a copy of any affidavit, memorandum, or other written material to be presented at the hearing with the presiding officer and must serve the other parties not later than ten days prior to the hearing or within such shorter time period as permitted by the presiding officer.
(ii) If the petitioner or the OCC desires to present oral testimony or witnesses at the hearing, they must file a written request with the presiding officer not later than ten days prior to the hearing, or within a shorter time period as required by the presiding officer. The written request must include the names of proposed witnesses, along with the general nature of the expected testimony, and the reasons why oral testimony is necessary. The presiding officer generally will not admit oral testimony or witnesses unless a specific and compelling need is demonstrated. Witnesses, if admitted, must be sworn. By stipulation of the parties or by order of the presiding officer, a court reporter or other person authorized to administer an oath may administer the oath remotely without being in the physical presence of the witness.
(iii) In deciding on any suspension or prohibition based on an indictment, information, or complaint, the presiding officer may not consider the ultimate question of the guilt or innocence of the individual with respect to the criminal charges that are outstanding. In deciding on any removal or prohibition with respect to a conviction or pre-trial diversion program, the presiding officer may not consider challenges to or efforts to impeach the validity of the conviction or the agreement to enter a pre-trial diversion program or other similar program. The presiding officer may consider facts in either situation, however, that show the nature of the events on which the criminal charges, conviction, or agreement to enter a pre-trial diversion program or other similar program was based.
(4)
Electronic presentation.
Based on the circumstances of each hearing, the presiding officer may direct the use of, or any party may elect to use, an electronic presentation during the hearing. If the presiding officer requires an electronic presentation during the hearing,
each party will be responsible for their own presentation and related costs unless the parties agree to another manner by which to allocate presentation responsibilities and costs.
(5)
Record.
A transcript of the proceedings may be taken if the petitioner requests a transcript and agrees to pay all expenses or if the presiding officer determines that the nature of the case warrants a transcript. The presiding officer may order the record to be kept open for a reasonable period following the hearing, not to exceed five business days, to permit the petitioner or the OCC to submit additional documents for the record. Thereafter, no further submissions may be accepted except for good cause shown.
§ 19.113
Recommended and final decisions.
(a)

(b)
Comments.
Each party may, within ten days of being served with the presiding officer's recommended decision, submit to the Comptroller comments on the recommended decision.

Within 60 days of the conclusion of the hearing or, if the petitioner has waived an oral hearing, within 60 days from the date fixed for the hearing, the Comptroller will notify the petitioner by registered mail, or electronic mail or other electronic means if the petitioner consents, whether the suspension or removal from office or prohibition from participation in any manner in the affairs of any depository institution will be affirmed, terminated, or modified. The Comptroller's decision must include a statement of reasons supporting the decision. The Comptroller's decision is a final and unappealable order.
(d)
Other actions.
A finding of not guilty or other disposition of the charge or charges on which a notice of suspension was based does not preclude the Comptroller from thereafter instituting removal proceedings pursuant to section 8(e) of the FDIA (12 U.S.C. 1818(e)) and subpart A of this part.
(e)
Expiration of order.
A removal or prohibition by order remains in effect until terminated by the Comptroller. A suspension or prohibition by notice remains in effect until the criminal charge is disposed of or until terminated by the Comptroller.

been disapproved by the OCC for a change in control of:
(1) An insured national bank or Federal savings association pursuant to section 7(j) of the FDIA (12 U.S.C. 1817(j)) and 12 CFR 5.50; or
(2) An uninsured national bank pursuant to 12 CFR 5.50.
(b)
Applicability of subpart A of this part.
Unless otherwise provided in this subpart, the rules in subpart A set forth the procedures applicable to requests for OCC hearings under this subpart.
§ 19.161
Hearing process.
(a)
Hearing request.
Pursuant to 12 CFR 5.50(f)(6), following receipt of a notice of disapproval of a proposed acquisition of control of a national bank or Federal savings association, a filer may request a hearing by the OCC on the proposed acquisition. A hearing request must:
(1) Be in writing; and
(2) Be filed with the Hearing Clerk of the OCC within ten days after service on the filer of the notice of disapproval. If a filer fails to request a hearing with a timely written request, the notice of disapproval constitutes a final and unappealable order.
(b)
Hearing order.
Following receipt of a hearing request, the Comptroller will issue, within 20 days, an order that sets forth:
(1) The legal authority for the proceeding and for the OCC's jurisdiction over the proceeding;
(2) The matters of fact or law upon which the disapproval is based; and
(3) The requirement for filing an answer to the hearing order with OFIA within 20 days after service of the hearing order.
(c)
Answer.
An answer to a hearing order must specifically deny those portions of the order that are disputed. Those portions of the order that the filer does not specifically deny are deemed admitted by the filer. Any hearing under this subpart is limited to those portions of the order that are specifically denied.
(d)
Effect of failure to answer.
Failure of a filer to file an answer within 20 days after service of the hearing order constitutes a waiver of the filer's right to appear and contest the allegations in the hearing order. If a filer does not file a timely answer, Enforcement Counsel may file a motion for entry of an order of default. Upon a finding that no good cause has been shown for the failure to file a timely answer, the ALJ will file with the Comptroller a recommended decision containing the findings and the relief sought in the hearing order. Any final order issued by the Comptroller based upon a filer's failure to answer is deemed to be an order issued upon consent and is a final and unappealable order.

# Subpart I—Discovery Depositions and Subpoenas
§ 19.170
Discovery depositions.
(a)
In general.
In any proceeding instituted under or subject to the provisions of subpart A of this part, a party may take the deposition of a fact witness, an expert, or a hybrid fact-expert where there is need for the deposition. A fact witness is a person, including another party, who has direct knowledge of matters that are non-privileged and of material relevance to the proceeding.

The deposition of experts is limited to those experts who are expected to testify at the hearing.
(1)

Remote participation.
The parties may stipulate, or the ALJ may order, that a deposition be taken by telephone or other remote means.

Objections to questions or exhibits must be in short form and must state the grounds for the objection. Failure to object to questions or exhibits is not a waiver except where the grounds for the objection might have been avoided if the objection had been timely presented.
(e)
Recording the testimony
—(1)
Generally.
The party taking the deposition must have a certified court reporter record the witness' testimony:
(i) By stenotype machine or electronic means, such as by sound or video recording device;

(iii) For good cause and with leave of the ALJ, by any other method.
(2)
Cost.
The party taking the deposition must bear the cost of recording and transcribing the witness' testimony.
(3)
Transcript.

(f)
Protective orders.
At any time after notice of a deposition has been given, a party may file a motion for the issuance of a protective order. Such protective order may prohibit, terminate, or limit the scope or manner of the taking of a deposition. The ALJ may grant a protective order upon a showing of sufficient grounds, including that the deposition:
(1) Is unreasonable, oppressive, excessive in scope, or unduly burdensome;
(2) Involves privileged, irrelevant, or immaterial matters;
(3) Involves unwarranted attempts to pry into a party's preparation for trial; or
(4) Is being conducted in bad faith or in such manner as to unreasonably annoy, embarrass, or oppress the witness.

Expenses.
Deposition witnesses, including expert witnesses, must be paid the same expenses in the same manner as are paid witnesses in the district courts of the United States in proceedings in which the United States is a party. Expenses in accordance with this paragraph (g) must be paid by the party seeking to take the deposition.

§ 19.197
Initiation of disciplinary proceeding.
(a)
Receipt of information.
An individual, including any employee of the OCC, who has reason to believe that an individual practicing before the OCC in
a representative capacity has engaged in any conduct that would serve as a basis for censure, suspension, or debarment under this subpart, may make a report thereof and forward it to the OCC or to such person as may be delegated responsibility for such matters by the Comptroller.

When the Comptroller has reason to believe that any individual who practices before the OCC in a representative capacity has engaged in conduct that would serve as a basis for censure, suspension, or debarment under § 19.192, the Comptroller may, after giving the individual notice and opportunity to respond, institute a formal disciplinary proceeding against such individual. The proceeding will be conducted pursuant to § 19.199 and initiated by a complaint that names the individual as a respondent and is signed by the Comptroller. Except in cases of willfulness, or when time, the nature of the proceeding, or the public interest do not permit, a proceeding under this section may not be commenced until the respondent has been informed, in writing, of the facts or conduct that warrant institution of a proceeding and the respondent has been accorded the opportunity to comply with all lawful requirements or take whatever action may be necessary to remedy the conduct that is the basis for the commencement of the proceeding.
§ 19.198
Conferences.
(a)
General.
The Comptroller may confer with a proposed respondent concerning allegations of misconduct or other grounds for censure, debarment, or suspension, regardless of whether a proceeding for censure, debarment, or suspension has been commenced. If a conference results in a stipulation in connection with a proceeding in which the individual is the respondent, the stipulation may be entered in the record at the request of either party to the proceeding.
(b)
Voluntary suspension or debarment.
In order to avoid the institution of, or a decision in, a debarment or suspension proceeding, a person who practices before the OCC may consent to suspension or debarment from practice. At the discretion of the Comptroller, the individual may be suspended or debarred in accordance with the consent offered.
§ 19.199
Proceedings under this subpart.
Any hearing held under this subpart is held before an ALJ pursuant to procedures set forth in subpart A of this part. The Comptroller will appoint a person to represent the OCC in the hearing. Any person having prior involvement in the matter that is the basis for the suspension or debarment proceeding is disqualified from representing the OCC in the hearing. The hearing will be closed to the public unless the Comptroller, on the Comptroller's initiative or on the request of a party, otherwise directs. The ALJ will issue a recommended decision to the Comptroller, who will issue the final decision and order. The Comptroller may censure, debar, or suspend an individual, or take such other disciplinary action as the Comptroller deems appropriate.
§ 19.200
Effect of debarment, suspension, or censure.
(a)
Debarment.
If the final order against the respondent is for debarment, the individual may not practice before the OCC unless otherwise permitted to do so by the Comptroller pursuant to § 19.201.
(b)
Suspension.
If the final order against the respondent is for suspension, the individual may not practice before the OCC during the period of suspension.
(c)
Censure.
If the final order against the respondent is for censure, the individual may be permitted to practice before the OCC, but such individual's future representations may be subject to conditions designed to promote high standards of conduct. If a written letter of censure is issued, a copy will be maintained in the OCC's files.
(d)
Notice of debarment or suspension.
Upon the issuance of a final order for
suspension or debarment, the Comptroller will give notice of the order to appropriate officers and employees of the OCC and to interested departments and agencies of the Federal government. The Comptroller will also give notice to the appropriate authorities of the state in which any debarred or suspended individual is or was licensed to practice.
§ 19.201
Petition for reinstatement.
At the expiration of the period of time designated in the order of debarment, the Comptroller may entertain a petition for reinstatement from any person debarred from practice before the OCC. The Comptroller may grant reinstatement only if satisfied that the petitioner is likely to act in accordance with the regulations in this part, and that granting reinstatement would not be contrary to the public interest. Any request for reinstatement is limited to written submissions unless the Comptroller, at the Comptroller's discretion, affords the petitioner a hearing.

# Subpart L—Equal Access to Justice Act
§ 19.205
Authority and scope; waiver.
(a)
In general.
This subpart implements section 203 of the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA) (5 U.S.C. 504). EAJA provides for the award of attorney fees and other expenses to eligible individuals and entities that are parties in certain administrative proceedings (adversary adjudications) before agencies of the Government of the United States. An eligible party may receive an award when it prevails over an agency unless the agency's position was substantially justified or special circumstances make an award unjust. However, no presumption under this subpart arises that the agency's position was not substantially justified because the agency did not prevail.
(b)
Scope.
The types of adversary adjudications covered by this subpart are those proceedings listed in §§ 19.1, 19.110, 19.120, 19.190, 19.230, and 19.241.
(c)
Waiver.
After reasonable notice to the parties, the presiding officer or the OCC may waive, for good cause shown, any provision contained in this subpart as long as the waiver is consistent with the terms and purpose of EAJA.
§ 19.206
Definitions.
For purposes of this subpart:
(a)
Adversary adjudication
means an adjudication under 5 U.S.C. 554 in which the position of the OCC is represented by Enforcement Counsel.

Final disposition
means the date on which a decision or order disposing of the merits of a proceeding or any other complete resolution of the proceeding, such as a settlement or voluntary dismissal, becomes final and unappealable both within the OCC and to the courts.
(c)
Party
means a party, as defined in 5 U.S.C. 551(3), that is:
(1) An individual whose net worth did not exceed $2,000,000 at the time the adversary adjudication was initiated; or
(2) Any owner of an unincorporated business, or any partnership, corporation, association, unit of local government, or organization, the net worth of which did not exceed $7,000,000 at the time the adversary adjudication was initiated, and which had not more than 500 employees at the time the adversary adjudication was initiated; except that an organization described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the Code) exempt from taxation under section 501(a) of the Code, or a cooperative association as defined in section 15(a) of the Agricultural Marketing Act, may be a party regardless of the net worth of the organization or cooperative association. The net worth and number of employees of the applicant and any of its affiliates must be aggregated when determining the applicability of this paragraph (c).
(d)
Position of the OCC
means, in addition to the position taken by the OCC in the adversary adjudication, the action or failure to act by the OCC upon which the adversary adjudication is based, except that fees and other expenses may not be awarded to a party for any portion of the adversary adjudication in which the party has unreasonably protracted the proceedings.
(e)
Presiding officer
means the official, whether the official is designated as an ALJ or otherwise, that presided over
the adversary adjudication or the official that presides over an EAJA proceeding.
§ 19.207
Application requirements.
(a)
Timing of application.
A party seeking an award under this subpart must file an application with the OCC within 30 days after the OCC's final disposition of the adversary adjudication.

(2) Show that the applicant has prevailed and identify the position of the OCC that the applicant alleges was not substantially justified;
(3) State the basis for the applicant's belief that the OCC position was not substantially justified;
(4) Unless the applicant is an individual, state the number of employees of the applicant and describe briefly the type and purpose of its organization or business;
(5) Show that the applicant meets the definition of “party” in § 19.206(c), including documentation of its net worth pursuant to § 19.208, if applicable;

Net worth exhibit.
(a)
Required information.
Each applicant, except a qualified tax-exempt organization or cooperative association, must provide with its application a detailed exhibit showing the net worth of the applicant and, where appropriate, any of its affiliates at the time the adversary adjudication was initiated. Except as otherwise provided in this section, this exhibit may be in any form convenient to the applicant that provides full disclosure of the applicant's and its affiliates' assets and liabilities and is sufficient to determine whether the applicant qualifies under the standards in this subpart. A presiding officer may require an applicant to file additional information to determine its eligibility for an award.
(1) An unaudited financial statement is acceptable for individual applicants as long as the statement provides a reliable basis for evaluation, unless the presiding officer or the OCC otherwise requires. Financial statements or reports filed with or reported to a Federal or State agency before the initiation of the adversary adjudication for other purposes and accurate as of a date not more than three months prior to the initiation of the proceeding are acceptable in establishing net worth as of the time of the initiation of the proceeding, unless the presiding officer or the OCC otherwise requires.
(2) In the case of applicants or affiliates that are not banks or savings associations, net worth will be considered for the purposes of this subpart to be the excess of total assets over total liabilities as of the date the underlying proceeding was initiated.
(3) If the applicant or any of its affiliates is a bank or a savings association, the portion of the statement of net worth that relates to the bank or the savings association must consist of a copy of the bank's or savings association's last Consolidated Report of Condition and Income filed before the initiation of the adversary adjudication. Net worth will be considered for the purposes of this subpart to be the total equity capital as reported, in conformity with applicable instructions and guidelines, on the bank's or the savings association's Consolidated Report of Condition and Income filed for the last reporting date before the initiation of the proceeding.
(b)
Confidentiality of net worth submissions.
Ordinarily, the net worth exhibit will be included in the public record of the proceeding. However, an applicant
that objects to public disclosure of information in any portion of the exhibit and believes there are legal grounds for withholding it from disclosure may request that the documents be filed under seal or otherwise be treated as confidential.
§ 19.209
Documentation of fees and expenses.
The application must be accompanied by adequate documentation of the fees and expenses incurred after initiation of the adversary adjudication, including the cost of any study, analysis, report, test, or project. An application seeking an increase in fees to account for inflation pursuant to § 19.215(d)(1)(i) also must include adequate documentation of the change in the consumer price index for the attorney or agent's locality. The applicant must submit a separate itemized statement for each professional firm or individual whose services are covered by the application showing the hours spent in connection with the proceeding by each individual, a description of the specific services performed, the rate at which each fee has been computed, any expenses for which reimbursement is sought, the total amount claimed, and the total amount paid or payable by the applicant or by any other person or entity for the services provided. The presiding officer may require the applicant to provide vouchers, receipts, or other substantiation for any fees or expenses claimed.
§ 19.210
Filing and service of documents.
Any application for an award, or any accompanying documentation related to an application, must be filed and served on all parties to the proceeding in accordance with § 19.11, except as provided in § 19.208(b) for confidential financial information.
§ 19.211
Answer to application.
(a)
Filing of answer.
Except as provided in § 19.213, Enforcement Counsel may file an answer to an application within 30 days after service of the application. Unless Enforcement Counsel requests an extension of time for filing or files a statement of intent to negotiate a settlement under § 19.213, failure to file an answer within the 30-day period may be treated as a consent to the award requested.
(b)
Content of answer.
The answer must explain in detail any objections to the award requested and identify the facts relied on in support of the Enforcement Counsel's position. If the answer is based on any alleged facts not already in the record of the proceeding, Enforcement Counsel must include with the answer either supporting affidavits or a request for further proceedings under § 19.214.
§ 19.212
Reply.
Within 15 days after service of an answer, the applicant may file a reply. If the reply is based on any alleged facts not already in the record of the proceeding, the applicant must include with the reply either supporting affidavits or a request for further proceedings under § 19.214.
§ 19.213
Settlement.
The applicant and Enforcement Counsel may agree on a proposed settlement of the award before final action on the application, either in connection with a settlement of the underlying proceeding or after the underlying proceeding has been concluded, in accordance with § 19.15. If a prevailing party and Enforcement Counsel agree on a proposed settlement of an award before an application has been filed, the application must be filed with the proposed settlement. If a proposed settlement of an underlying proceeding provides that each side must bear its own expenses and the settlement is accepted, no application may be filed. If, after an application is filed, Enforcement Counsel and the applicant believe that the issues in the application can be settled, they may jointly file a statement of their intent to negotiate a settlement. The filing of this statement will extend, under § 19.211, the time for filing an answer for an additional 30 days, and further extensions may be granted by the presiding officer upon request by Enforcement Counsel and the applicant.
§ 19.214
Further proceedings.
(a)
Process for requesting further proceedings or additional information.
At the request of either the applicant or Enforcement Counsel, or on the presiding officer's own initiative, the presiding officer may, if necessary for a full and fair decision on the application, order the filing of additional written submissions; hold an informal conference or oral argument; or allow for discovery or hold an evidentiary hearing with respect to issues other than whether the OCC's position was substantially justified (such as those involving the applicant's eligibility or substantiation of fees or expenses). Any written submissions must be made, oral argument held, discovery conducted, and evidentiary hearing held as promptly as possible so as not to delay a decision on the application for fees.
(b)
Requirement to identify additional information sought and reason for requesting additional proceedings.
A request for further proceedings under this section must specifically identify the information sought or the disputed issues and must explain why the additional proceedings are necessary to resolve the issues.
§ 19.215
Decision.
(a)
Basis for decision.
The presiding officer must determine whether the position of the OCC was substantially justified on the basis of the administrative record as a whole of the adversary adjudication for which fees and other expenses are sought.
(b)
Timing of decision.
The presiding officer in a proceeding under this subpart will issue a recommended decision, in writing, on the application within 90 days after the time for filing a reply or, when further proceedings are held, within 90 days after completion of proceedings.
(c)
Contents of decision.
The decision on the application must include written findings and conclusions on the applicant's eligibility and status as a prevailing party, and, if applicable, an explanation of the reasons for any difference between the amount requested and the amount awarded. The decision also must include, if applicable, findings on whether Enforcement Counsel's or the OCC's position was substantially justified, whether the applicant unduly and unreasonably protracted the adversary adjudication, or whether special circumstances make an award unjust.
(d)
Awards.
—(1)
In general.
Awards under this subpart may include the reasonable expenses of expert witnesses; the reasonable cost of any study, analysis, report, test, or project; and reasonable attorney or agent fees. The applicant must have incurred these expenses, costs, and fees after initiation of the adversary adjudication subject to the EAJA application. The presiding officer will base awards on prevailing market rates for the kind and quality of the services furnished, even if the services were provided without charge or at reduced rate to the applicant, except that:
(i) No award for the fee of an attorney or agent under this subpart may exceed the hourly rate specified in 5 U.S.C. 504(b)(1)(A) except to account for inflation since the last update of the statute's maximum award upon the request of the applicant as documented in the application pursuant to § 19.209 or if a special factor, such as the limited availability of qualified attorneys or agents for the proceedings involved, justifies a higher fee; and
(ii) No award to compensate an expert witness may exceed the highest rate at which the OCC pays expert witnesses.
(2)
Award for fees of an attorney, agent, or expert witness.
In determining the reasonableness of the fee sought for an attorney, agent, or expert witness the presiding officer should consider:
(i) If in private practice, the attorney's, agent's, or witness' customary fee for similar services;
(ii) If an employee of the applicant, the fully allocated cost of the attorney's, agent's, or witness' services;
(iii) The prevailing rate for similar services in the community in which the attorney, agent, or witness ordinarily perform services;
(iv) The time actually spent in the representation of the applicant;
(v) The time reasonably spent in light of the difficulty or complexity of the issues in the proceeding; and
(vi) Any other factors that may bear on the value of the services provided.
(3)
Awards for costs of a study, analysis, report, test, project, or similar matter.
The presiding officer may award the reasonable cost of any study, analysis, report, test, project, or similar matter prepared on behalf of the applicant to the extent that the charge for the service does not exceed the prevailing rate for similar services and the presiding officer finds that the study or other matter was necessary for preparation of the applicant's case.
(4)
Reduction or denial of an award.
A presiding officer may reduce the amount to be awarded, or deny any award, to the extent that the party during the course of the proceedings engaged in conduct which unduly and unreasonably protracted the final resolution of the matter in controversy or if special circumstances make the award sought unjust.
(e)
Final agency decision.
The Comptroller will issue a final decision on the application or remand the application to the presiding officer for further proceedings in accordance with § 19.40.
§ 19.216
Agency review.

Stay of decision concerning award.
Any proceedings on an application for fees under this subpart will be automatically stayed until the OCC's final disposition of the decision on which the application is based and either the time period for seeking judicial review expires, or if review has been sought, until final disposition is made by a court and no further judicial review is available.
§ 19.219
Payment of award.
(a)
Requirement to submit final decision.
An applicant seeking payment of an award must submit to the OCC's Litigation Group a copy of the OCC's final decision granting the award, accompanied by a certification that the applicant will not seek review of the decision in the United States courts. Applicants should send the submissions to: Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Washington, DC 20219, Attention: Director, Litigation Group.

Grounds for reclassification.
(i) Pursuant to § 6.4 of this chapter, the OCC may reclassify a well capitalized insured depository institution as adequately capitalized or subject an adequately capitalized or undercapitalized insured depository institution to the supervisory actions applicable to the next lower capital category if:
(A) The OCC determines that the insured depository institution is in an unsafe or unsound condition; or
(B) The OCC deems the insured depository institution to be engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice and not to have corrected the deficiency.
(ii) Any action pursuant to this paragraph (a)(1) is referred to in this subpart as “reclassification.”

(1) A statement of the insured depository institution's capital measures and capital levels and the category to which the insured depository institution would be reclassified;
(2) The reasons for reclassification of the insured depository institution; and
(3) The date by which the insured depository institution subject to the notice of reclassification may file with the OCC a written response to the proposed reclassification and a request for a hearing, which must be at least 14 calendar days from the date of service of the notice unless the OCC determines that a shorter period is appropriate in light of the financial condition of the insured depository institution or other relevant circumstances.
(c)

Failure to file response.
Failure by an insured depository institution to file, within the specified time period, a written response with the OCC to a notice of proposed reclassification will constitute a waiver of the opportunity to respond and will constitute consent to the reclassification.
(e)
Request for hearing and presentation of oral testimony or witnesses.
The response may include a request for an informal hearing before the OCC under this section. If the insured depository institution desires to present oral testimony or witnesses at the hearing, the insured depository institution must include a request to do so with the request for an informal hearing. A request to present oral testimony or witnesses must specify the names of the witnesses and the general nature of their expected testimony.

(b)
Response to directive
—(1)
Request for reinstatement.
A director or senior executive officer who has been served with a directive under paragraph (a) of this section (Respondent) may file a written request for reinstatement. The Respondent must file this request for reinstatement within 10 calendar days of the receipt of the OCC directive, unless further time is allowed by the OCC at the request of the Respondent. Failure by the Respondent to file a written request for reinstatement with the OCC within the specified time period will constitute a waiver of the opportunity to respond and will constitute consent to the dismissal.

Contents of request; informal hearing.
The request for reinstatement must include reasons why the Respondent should be reinstated and may include a request for an informal hearing before the OCC or its designee under this section. If the Respondent desires to present oral testimony or witnesses at the hearing, the Respondent must
include a request to do so with the request for an informal hearing. The request to present oral testimony or witnesses must specify the names of the witnesses and the general nature of their expected testimony.

Standard for review.
A Respondent bears the burden of demonstrating that their continued employment by or service with the insured depository institution would materially strengthen the insured depository institution's ability:
(1) To become adequately capitalized, to the extent that the directive was issued as a result of the insured depository institution's capital level or failure to submit or implement a capital restoration plan; and
(2) To correct the unsafe or unsound condition or unsafe or unsound practice, to the extent that the directive was issued as a result of classification of the insured depository institution based on supervisory criteria other than capital, pursuant to section 38(g) of the FDIA.

# Subpart O—Civil Money Penalty Inflation Adjustments
§ 19.240
Inflation adjustments.
(a)
Statutory formula to calculate inflation adjustments.
The OCC is required by statute to annually adjust for inflation the maximum amount of each civil money penalty within its jurisdiction to administer.

(b)
Notice of inflation adjustments.
The OCC will publish notice in the
Federal Register
of the maximum penalties which may be assessed on an annual basis on or before January 15 of each calendar year based on the formula in paragraph (a) of this section, for penalties assessed on, or after, the date of publication of the most recent notice related to conduct occurring on, or after, November 2, 2015.

Removal, suspension, or debarment.
(a)
Good cause for removal, suspension, or debarment
—(1)
Individuals.
The Comptroller may remove, suspend, or debar an independent public accountant from performing audit services for insured national banks, insured Federal savings associations, or insured Federal branches of foreign banks that are subject to section 36 of the FDIA (12 U.S.C. 1831m) if, after service of a notice of intention and opportunity for hearing in the matter, the Comptroller finds that the accountant:
(i) Lacks the requisite qualifications to perform audit services;
(ii) Has knowingly or recklessly engaged in conduct that results in a violation of applicable professional standards, including those standards and conflicts of interest provisions applicable to accountants through the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Public Law 107-204, 116 Stat. 745 (2002) (Sarbanes-Oxley Act), and developed by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission;
(iii) Has engaged in negligent conduct in the form of:
(A) A single instance of highly unreasonable conduct that results in a violation of applicable professional standards in circumstances in which an accountant knows, or should know, that heightened scrutiny is warranted; or
(B) Repeated instances of unreasonable conduct, each resulting in a violation of applicable professional standards, that indicate a lack of competence to perform audit services;
(iv) Has knowingly or recklessly given false or misleading information, or knowingly or recklessly participated in any way in the giving of false or misleading information, to the OCC or any officer or employee of the OCC;
(v) Has engaged in, or aided and abetted, a material and knowing or reckless violation of any provision of the Federal banking or securities laws or the rules and regulations thereunder, or any other law;
(vi) Has been removed, suspended, or debarred from practice before any Federal or State agency regulating the banking, insurance, or securities industries, other than by an action listed in § 19.244, on grounds relevant to the provision of audit services; or
(vii) Is suspended or debarred for cause from practice as an accountant by any duly constituted licensing authority of any State, possession, commonwealth, or the District of Columbia.
(2)
Accounting firms.
If the Comptroller determines that there is good cause for the removal, suspension, or debarment of a member or employee of an accounting firm under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the Comptroller also may remove, suspend, or debar such firm or one or more offices of such firm. In considering whether to remove, suspend, or debar a firm or an office thereof, and the term of any sanction against a firm under this section, the Comptroller may consider, for example:
(i) The gravity, scope, or repetition of the act or failure to act that constitutes good cause for the removal, suspension, or debarment;
(ii) The adequacy of, and adherence to, applicable policies, practices, or procedures for the accounting firm's conduct of its business and the performance of audit services;
(iii) The selection, training, supervision, and conduct of members or employees of the accounting firm involved in the performance of audit services;
(iv) The extent to which managing partners or senior officers of the accounting firm have participated, directly, or indirectly through oversight or review, in the act or failure to act; and
(v) The extent to which the accounting firm has, since the occurrence of the act or failure to act, implemented corrective internal controls to prevent its recurrence.
(3)
Limited scope orders.
An order of removal, suspension (including an immediate suspension), or debarment may, at the discretion of the Comptroller, be made applicable to a particular insured national bank, insured Federal savings association, or insured Federal branch of a foreign bank or class of insured national banks, insured Federal savings associations, or insured Federal branches of foreign banks.
(4)
Remedies not exclusive.
The remedies provided in this subpart are in addition to any other remedies the OCC may have under any other applicable provisions of law, rule, or regulation.
(b)
Proceedings to remove, suspend, or debar
—(1)
Initiation of formal removal, suspension, or debarment proceedings.
The Comptroller may initiate a proceeding to remove, suspend, or debar an accountant or accounting firm from performing audit services by issuing a written notice of intention to take such action that names the individual or firm as a respondent and describes the nature of the conduct that constitutes good cause for such action.
(2)
Hearings under paragraph (b) of this section.
An accountant or firm named as a respondent in the notice issued under paragraph (b)(1) of this section may request a hearing on the allegations in the notice. Hearings conducted under this paragraph (b)(2) will be conducted in the same manner as other hearings under the Uniform Rules of Practice and Procedure in subpart A of this part, subject to the limitations in paragraph (c)(4) of this section.
(c)
Immediate suspension from performing audit services
—(1)
In general.
If the Comptroller serves a written notice of intention to remove, suspend, or debar an accountant or accounting firm from performing audit services, the Comptroller may, with due regard for the public interest and without a
preliminary hearing, immediately suspend such accountant or firm from performing audit services for insured national banks, insured Federal savings associations, or insured Federal branches of foreign banks, if the Comptroller:
(i) Has a reasonable basis to believe that the accountant or firm has engaged in conduct (specified in the notice served on the accountant or firm under paragraph (b) of this section) that would constitute grounds for removal, suspension, or debarment under paragraph (a) of this section;
(ii) Determines that immediate suspension is necessary to avoid immediate harm to an insured depository institution or its depositors or to the depository system as a whole; and
(iii) Serves such respondent with written notice of the immediate suspension.
(2)
Procedures.
An immediate suspension notice issued under this paragraph (c)(2) will become effective upon service. Such suspension will remain in effect until the date the Comptroller dismisses the charges contained in the notice of intention, or the effective date of a final order of removal, suspension, or debarment issued by the Comptroller to the respondent.
(3)
Petition for stay.
Any accountant or firm immediately suspended from performing audit services in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section may, within 10 calendar days after service of the notice of immediate suspension, file with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Washington, DC 20219 for a stay of such immediate suspension. If no petition is filed within 10 calendar days, the right to a petition is waived and the immediate suspension remains in effect pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
(4)
Hearing on petition.
Upon receipt of a stay petition, the Comptroller will designate a presiding officer who will fix a place and time (not more than 10 calendar days after receipt of the petition, unless further time is allowed by the presiding officer at the request of petitioner) at which the immediately suspended party may appear, personally or through counsel, to submit written materials and oral argument. Any OCC employee engaged in investigative or prosecuting functions for the OCC in a case may not, in that or a factually related case, serve as a presiding officer or participate or advise in the decision of the presiding officer or of the OCC, except as witness or counsel in the proceeding. In the sole discretion of the presiding officer, upon a specific showing of compelling need, oral testimony of witnesses may also be presented. In hearings held pursuant to this paragraph (c)(4) there will be no discovery and the provisions of §§ 19.6 through 19.12, 19.16, and 19.21 apply.
(5)
Decision on petition.
Within 30 calendar days after the hearing, the presiding officer will issue a decision. The presiding officer will grant a stay upon a demonstration that a substantial likelihood exists of the respondent's success on the issues raised by the notice of intention and that, absent such relief, the respondent will suffer immediate and irreparable injury, loss, or damage. In the absence of such a demonstration, the presiding officer will notify the parties that the immediate suspension will be continued pending the completion of the administrative proceedings pursuant to the notice.
(6)
Review of presiding officer's decision.
