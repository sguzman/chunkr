# Explanation
The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
Title 1 through Title 16
as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27
as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41
as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50
as of October 1
The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.

# LEGAL STATUS
The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

# HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, January 1, 2025), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

# EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.

# OMB CONTROL NUMBERS
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request.
Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.

# PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.

# “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.

# INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
What is incorporation by reference?
Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
What is a proper incorporation by reference?
The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
(b) The matter incorporated is adequately summarized in the preamble of the final rule and is available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?
If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or email fr.inspection@nara.gov.

# CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES
A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR
Index and Finding Aids.
This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.
An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

# REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

# Explanation of This Title
This volume of “Title 3—The President” contains a compilation of Presidential documents and a codification of regulations issued by the Executive Office of the President.
The 2024 Compilation contains the full text of those documents signed by the President that were required to be published in the
Federal Register.
Signature date rather than publication date is the criterion for inclusion. With each annual volume, the Presidential documents signed in the previous year become the new compilation.
Chapter I contains regulations issued by the Executive Office of the President. This section is a true codification like other CFR volumes, in that its contents are organized by subject or regulatory area and are updated by individual issues of the
Federal Register
.
Presidential documents in this volume may be cited “3 CFR, 2024 Comp.” Thus, the preferred abbreviated citation for Proclamation 10696 appearing on page 1 of this book, is “3 CFR, 2024 Comp., p. 1.” Chapter I entries may be cited “3 CFR.” Thus, the preferred abbreviated citation for section 100.1, appearing in chapter I of this book, is “3 CFR 100.1.”
This book is one of the volumes in a series that began with Proclamation 2161 of March 19, 1936, and Executive Order 7316 of March 13, 1936, and that has been continued by means of annual compilations and periodic cumulations. The entire Title 3 series, as of January 1, 2025, is encompassed in the volumes listed on page iv.
For readers interested in proclamations and Executive orders prior to 1936, there is a two-volume set entitled
Proclamations and Executive Orders, Herbert Hoover
(March 4, 1929, to March 4, 1933). Codified Presidential documents are published in the
Codification of Presidential Proclamations and Executive Orders
(April 13, 1945—January 20, 1989). Other public Presidential documents not required to be published in the
Federal Register
, such as speeches, messages to Congress, and statements, can be found in the
Compilation of Presidential Documents.
A selection of these Office of the Federal Register publications are available for sale from the Superintendent of Documents, Government Publishing Office, Washington, DC 20402.
This book was prepared under the direction of John Hyrum Martinez, Director of the Publications and Services Division; Kimberly R. Silver, Supervisor of the Presidential and Legislative Publications Unit; and Joshua H. Liberatore, Editor.

# Martin Luther King, Jr., Federal Holiday, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Today, we reflect on the life and legacy of Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and recommit to honoring his moral vision on the path to redeeming the soul of our Nation.
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was born into America when racial segregation was the law of the land. He had every reason to believe that history had already been written and division would be our Nation's destiny. But Dr. King rejected that outcome. He heard Scripture's command to do justice, love mercy, and walk humbly. He clung to the Declaration of Independence's promise of equality for all people.
Dr. King's mission was a moral one: from bridges and ballot boxes to pulpits, protests, and courthouses, he courageously stood for the sacred idea that embodies the soul of our Nation—we are all created equal in the image of God and deserve to be treated equally throughout our lives. He vocalized that idea on an August day in 1963 when he told our Nation about his dream. He saw that idea realized for many Americans with the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, ushering in a new era of greater equality and opportunity in our country. That work is not yet finished. It is the task of our time to take up Dr. King's mantle and make his dream a reality.
The battle for the soul of our Nation is perennial—a constant struggle between hope and fear, kindness and cruelty, and justice and injustice. There are still those who seek to thwart progress and roll back our rights as Americans. But Dr. King and countless crusaders across the span of American history teach us that each generation must answer the call to perfect
our Union. We must heed the whispers of our better angels. We must see each other as neighbors and not enemies. We must do our best to seek a life of light, hope, and truth. Because nothing is guaranteed about our democracy. We must fight to keep, defend, and protect it.
On this day, may we recommit to being guided by Dr. King's light and by the charge of Scripture: “Let us never grow weary in doing what is right, for if we do not give up, we will reap our harvest in due time.” We must continue Dr. King's march forward by choosing democracy over autocracy and a “Beloved Community” over chaos. We must be believers, doers, and, most of all, dreamers. We must be repairers of the breach and remember that the power to redeem the soul of America lies in all of us—“We the People.”
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim Monday, January 15, 2024, as the Martin Luther King, Jr., Federal Holiday. I encourage all Americans to observe this day with appropriate civic, community, and service projects in honor of Dr. King and to visit MLKDay.gov to find Martin Luther King, Jr., Day of Service projects across our country.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twelfth day of January, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.
Proclamation 10697 of January 12, 2024
Proc. 10697

# Religious Freedom Day, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
The constitutional right to practice our faiths peacefully and openly is a core tenet of our democracy and helps us fulfill one of our highest aspirations as a Nation: to be a citadel of liberty and a beacon of freedom. On Religious Freedom Day, we renew our pledge to protect that right by ensuring each person of any faith or belief can live out the deepest convictions of their conscience with dignity and respect.
Like so many Americans, faith has sustained me throughout my life—serving as a reminder of both our collective purpose and our responsibilities to one another. But for far too many people today, practicing their faith means facing fear and intimidation. In recent years, hate has been given too much oxygen. This year, in the wake of Hamas' brutal terrorist assault against Israel, we have seen horrific threats and attacks in this country that have both shocked our collective conscience and broken our hearts.
It is in the most challenging times that our commitment to freedom matters most. We must work harder than ever to practice the values that make us who we are. That is why my Administration is working tirelessly to protect and preserve the right to freedom of religion for everyone everywhere.
In 2022, I established a new inter-agency group to counter Antisemitism, Islamophobia, and Related Forms of Bias and Discrimination within the United States. Last May, my Administration released the first-ever United States National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism, which outlines more than 100 new actions we are taking to raise awareness of Antisemitism, protect Jewish communities, counter Antisemitic discrimination, and build solidarity across diverse communities. We are also developing the first-ever United States National Strategy to Counter Islamophobia and Related Forms of Bias and Discrimination in the United States, which will address the scourge of hate against Muslims in America. The strategy will also address hate against Sikh, South Asian, and Arab American communities, among others. Meanwhile, we continue to work with all communities to identify, prevent, and disrupt threats.
Everyone must be free to practice their faith without fear, whether they are gathering for worship, attending a religious school, participating in the activities of other faith-based organizations, or simply walking down the street wearing the symbols of their faith. That is why, working with the Congress, my Administration secured the greatest increase in funding in our history for the physical security of non-profits—including churches, gurdwaras, mosques, synagogues, temples, and other places of worship. In my 2024 Budget proposal to the Congress, I requested that this funding be raised to $360 million, and my Administration works continually to protect places of worship, including through an annual Protecting Places of Worship Week of Action. Through such initiatives, we are providing resources for faith communities and encouraging religious organizations to share their best practices in promoting security with one another.
As a world leader, we are also working to make it possible for people to practice their faith freely and peacefully around the globe. Billions of people worldwide are persecuted for or prevented from freely choosing, practicing, or teaching their faith. Repressive governments and violent extremists continue to reach across borders and target people for their beliefs. We have seen these abhorrent attacks on people of all faiths, including Christians in some countries. That is why, since the beginning of my Administration, we have provided more than $100 million to promote religious freedom and hundreds of millions more to provide humanitarian assistance to victims fleeing religious repression, including genocide. Further, we are denying the entry of goods into the United States that are made with forced labor—an abuse of human rights that is oftentimes associated with the genocide of religious minorities. We have imposed sanctions, visa restrictions, and export controls on actors and entities that are responsible for serious human rights abuses like religious persecution.
On this day, we recognize that the work of protecting religious freedom is never finished. In our quest to build a more perfect Union, may our faiths and beliefs help us heal divisions and bring us together to safeguard this fundamental freedom guaranteed by our Constitution and to ensure that people of all religions or no religion are treated with dignity and respect.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 16, 2024, as Religious Freedom Day.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twelfth day of January, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.
Proclamation 10698 of January 31, 2024
Proc. 10698

# American Heart Month, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
This American Heart Month, we recommit to promoting heart-healthy lifestyles, expanding access to quality health care, and breaking new bounds in heart disease research and treatment.
Each year, heart disease takes the lives of nearly 700,000 Americans. It is the leading cause of death in our country. Too many of us are familiar with the pain of losing a loved one to a heart attack, stroke, or coronary heart disease. There is still hope, however: With the adoption of a healthy lifestyle and access to good health care, these conditions can often be prevented and lives can be saved.
That is why my Administration is committed to giving families the tools they need to stay healthy. In 2022, we hosted the first White House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health in over 50 years and released a national strategy to end hunger and reduce diet-related diseases by 2030. Our strategy includes improving food access and affordability by providing free, healthy meals to millions of students, expanding incentives for fruits and vegetables in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, and expanding Medicaid and Medicare coverage to provide nutrition and obesity counseling.
I have often said that health care should be a right, not a privilege. Every American deserves access to the health care and treatment they need. In 2022, I was proud to sign the Inflation Reduction Act, which, once in effect will cap the total out-of-pocket drug costs for seniors and others with Medicare at $2,000 per year, saving nearly 19 million families an average of $400 per year. I have also improved access to dental services for people with Medicare who need certain cardiac procedures—these dental services have been shown to reduce unnecessary and preventable acute and chronic complications for the patient. These measures ensure that people on Medicare who have heart disease will be better able to access the preventative services and treatments they need.
Additionally, we are working to advance new breakthroughs on a range of diseases. Our Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health is working to accelerate major biomedical innovations in preventing, detecting, and treating life-threatening conditions like Alzheimer's, diabetes, and cancer. This is the kind of progress that can lead to new advancements for cardiovascular diseases.
It is also important for every American to be aware of individual actions we can take to keep our hearts healthy: Exercising regularly, eating well, managing weight, and avoiding smoking or vaping are proven to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. Experts also recommend that everyone should learn the warning signs of a heart attack and stroke and that they should consult a doctor if they experience risk factors or symptoms.
This Friday, February 2nd, I encourage every American to raise awareness about heart health by wearing red on National Wear Red Day. During American Heart Month, may we remember the lives of all those who have been lost to heart conditions and all the people who live with these conditions each day. My Administration will continue working to put a heart-healthy lifestyle within the reach of every American.
To learn more about heart health, please talk to your health care provider or visit CDC.gov/heartdisease.
In acknowledgement of the importance of the ongoing fight against cardiovascular disease, the Congress, by Joint Resolution approved December 30, 1963, as amended (36 U.S.C. 101), has requested that the President issue an annual proclamation designating February as “American Heart Month.”
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim February 2024 as American Heart Month, and I invite all Americans to participate in National Wear Red Day on February 2, 2024. I also invite the Governors of the States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, officials of other areas subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, and the American people to join me in recognizing and reaffirming our commitment to fighting cardiovascular disease and extending the promise of a long and healthy life across this country.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of January, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# National Black History Month, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
This National Black History Month, we celebrate the vast contributions of Black Americans to our country and recognize that Black history is American history and that Black culture, stories, and triumphs are at the core of who we are as a Nation.
The soul of America is what makes us unique among all nations. We are the only country in the world founded on an idea. It is the idea that we are all created equal and deserve to be treated with equal dignity throughout our lives. While we still grapple today with the moral stain and vestiges of slavery—our country's original sin—we have never walked away
from the fight to fully realize the promise of America for all Americans. Throughout our history, Black Americans have never given up on the promise of America. Unbowed by the forces of hate and undaunted as they fought for centuries against slavery, segregation, and injustice, Black Americans have held a mirror up to our Nation, allowing our country to confront hard truths about who we are and pushing us to live up to our founding ideals. They have helped redeem the soul of our Nation, ensuring the promises in our founding documents were not just words on a page but a lived reality for all people. In the process, the vibrancy of Black history and culture has enriched every aspect of American life.
Since taking office, the Vice President and I have worked to continue this legacy of progress and lay down a foundation for a stronger, more equitable Nation. On my first day as President, I signed a historic Executive Order on Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government. In February 2023, I signed an additional Executive Order to acknowledge the unbearable human costs of systemic racism and to direct the entire Federal Government to advance equity for those who have been historically underserved, marginalized, and adversely affected by persistent discrimination, poverty, and inequality, including the Black community. That includes building an economy that grows from the middle out and bottom up, not the top down. So far, we have created over 14 million jobs and in 2023, the Black unemployment rate was lower than in any other year on record.
We are addressing historic health inequities for Black Americans by making systemic changes to our health care systems that increase healthcare access while lowering costs. Today, more Black Americans have health insurance than at any previous time in American history. We are working to address the Black maternal health crisis—ensuring dignity, safety, and support for Black moms. The Vice President has helped elevate this critical issue to a national priority by calling on States to extend Medicaid postpartum coverage from two months to one year.
My Administration is also working to close racial gaps in education and economic opportunity. To that end, we have delivered over $7 billion in funding for Historically Black Colleges and Universities and are working to expand access to home-ownership—a major source of generational wealth for families—while aggressively combating racial discrimination in housing. Our update to the Thrifty Food Plan is keeping 400,000 Black kids out of poverty every month and making sure millions more have enough food to eat. By 2025, we are working to ensure that 15 percent of Federal contracting dollars goes to small disadvantaged businesses, including Black-owned small businesses. We are also replacing poisonous lead pipes so every American can turn on a faucet at home or school and drink clean water.
To deliver equal justice under the law, we are appointing judges to the Federal bench who reflect all of America, including Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson and more Black women to the Federal circuit courts than all previous administrations combined. I also signed a historic Executive Order that implemented key elements of the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act: banning chokeholds and restricting no knock warrants by Federal law enforcement, creating a national database of officer misconduct, and promoting effective and accountable community policing that
advances public trust and safety. I also signed the first major gun safety legislation in nearly 30 years as well as a long-overdue law to make lynching a Federal hate crime in Emmett Till's name. My Administration continues to call on the Congress to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and the Freedom to Vote Act to secure the right to vote for every American.
Today, I am reminded of something Amelia Boynton said when reflecting on her march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge on what would be known as Bloody Sunday: “You can never know where you're going unless you know where you've been.” America is a great Nation because we choose to learn the good, the bad, and the full truth of the history of our country—histories and truths that we must preserve and protect for the next generation. This National Black History Month, as we remember where we have been, may we also recognize that our only way forward is by marching together.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim February 2024 as National Black History Month. I call upon public officials, educators, librarians, and all the people of the United States to observe this month with relevant programs, ceremonies, and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of January, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# National Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Month, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
During National Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Month, we recommit to building a future where our Nation's young people can live free from violence, fear, and abuse.
About 1 in 12 high school students in the United States have experienced physical or sexual dating violence. Violence, intimidation, and fear—whether perpetrated in person or online—can upend the lives of young people during some of their most formative years and have lifelong consequences. Survivors of teen dating violence are more likely to suffer from symptoms of depression, anxiety, and trauma. Experiencing an unhealthy or abusive relationship as a teen can increase a young person's risk of facing violence in intimate relationships throughout their lives.
Throughout my career, I have fought against abuses of power. As a United States Senator, I wrote and championed the groundbreaking Violence Against Women Act that became law in 1994. Preventing and responding
to gender-based violence wherever it occurs and in all of its forms is a cause I care about deeply, and it has remained a cornerstone of my career in public service.
That is why, last year, my Administration released the first-ever National Plan to End Gender-Based Violence, which includes resources to prevent teen dating violence, promote healthier relationships, and equip survivors with the resources and care they deserve. In addition, the White House Task Force to Address Online Harassment and Abuse is working to help teens stay safe online and prevent the misuse of technology as tools of abuse, harassment, and exploitation. In 2022, I was proud to sign the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, which increased investment in programs working to reduce teen dating violence.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is providing tools and training for educators, families, and community members to teach young people how to form healthy relationships and safely leave abusive ones. Learn more at VetoViolence.CDC.gov. If you or someone you know is involved in an abusive relationship of any kind, immediate and confidential support is available through the National Domestic Violence Hotline's project focused on supporting young people by visiting loveisrespect.org, calling 1-866-331-9474 (TTY: 1-800-787-3224), or texting “LOVEIS” to 22522.
This month, may we come together to end teen dating violence and ensure our teens feel safe, protected, and empowered to live lives free from violence and full of dignity and respect.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim February 2024 as National Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Month. I call upon everyone to educate themselves and others about teen dating violence so that together we can stop it.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of January, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# National Tribal Colleges and Universities Week, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
I have always believed that the promise of America is big enough for everyone to succeed and that it is each generation's responsibility to open the doors of opportunity just a little bit wider to include those who have been left behind. During National Tribal Colleges and Universities Week, we honor and celebrate these critical institutions for doing just that: providing
opportunities for students and their communities throughout Indian Country.
A quality education can transform lives and give students the power to shape their future. But we know that not everyone has a fair shot at pursuing higher education—including many Native American students. We know that promoting educational opportunities is all the more important for Native people, after over a century of Federal assimilation policies that used education as a tool of cultural and physical violence—devastating Native communities and ripping Native families apart. We have seen time and again that Tribal Colleges and Universities uplift Native American students through culturally grounded education and put them on a path toward a brighter future. That is why my Administration has been working relentlessly to provide these institutions with the support they need to thrive.
During my first year in office, I was proud to issue an Executive Order on the White House Initiative on Advancing Educational Equity, Excellence, and Economic Opportunity for Native Americans and Strengthening Tribal Colleges and Universities. This initiative directs the Secretary of Education, the Secretary of the Interior, and the Secretary of Labor to collaborate with leaders from Tribal Nations to advance educational equity, excellence, and economic opportunity for Native American students. We are also investing millions of dollars to provide Tribal Colleges and Universities with the resources they deserve.
My Administration has also been working to make higher education more affordable for all students. To date, we have worked with the Congress to increase the maximum Pell Grant by $900—making it easier for millions of students to pay for school. We have also fixed the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program to ensure that students who become public servants receive the debt relief they are entitled to under the law. Through our Saving on a Valuable Education Plan, we are cutting payments for undergraduate loans in half, providing early forgiveness to many borrowers with low balance loans, and saving the typical borrower around $1,000 per year. We are pursuing new actions to relieve the burden of student debt for as many borrowers as we can, as fast as we can.
Every child in America has a dream. It is our responsibility to give them the opportunity to make those dreams a reality. This National Tribal Colleges and Universities Week, let us recommit to supporting these centers of academic excellence as they empower young Native American leaders to pursue their loftiest ambitions and build an America we can all be proud of.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim February 4 through February 10, 2024, as National Tribal Colleges and Universities Week.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixth day of February, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# National Eating Disorders Awareness Week, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
During National Eating Disorders Awareness Week, we shine a light on these serious health conditions, which impact nearly 1 in 10 people across America, and reaffirm our commitment to improving access to mental health services, treatment, recovery, and support.
Eating disorders are serious and life-threatening, but with early intervention, a full recovery is possible. Unfortunately, the stigmatization experienced by people struggling with eating disorders often prevents them from seeking health care and support. When left untreated, eating disorders can have devastating effects on the human body. Each of us has the power to show compassion to those who are struggling, help break down the barriers standing in the way of recovery, and create a culture that treats everyone with dignity and respect.
My Administration is taking action to support all those living with eating disorders. Federal agencies such as the National Institute of Mental Health have been working to improve the detection and prevention of eating disorders so we can save lives by developing effective therapies and interventions. Through the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) and funding for the National Center of Excellence for Eating Disorders, we are working to expand access to new tools and trainings for health care providers, families, caregivers, and community members so they can better detect and treat eating disorders. We are helping schools hire more mental health counselors, social workers, and nurses to make sure that young people have the support they need to live full and healthy lives.
At its core, tackling the mental health crisis is about providing hope. That is why my Administration is investing billions of dollars to improve access to mental health services, helping people get the care they deserve. Across the United States, we are expanding the number of Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics that provide 24/7 care regardless of a person's ability to pay. We are expanding training for health care professionals; integrating mental health services into primary care settings; improving coverage of mental health conditions; strengthening enforcement of parity laws; and addressing the harms of bullying and social media that fuel eating disorders, depression, and self-harm.
As Americans, we have a duty to reach out to one another and leave no one behind. Let us extend a helping hand to those struggling with an eating disorder and ensure that they have access to the treatment they deserve. This week, we recommit to showing compassion and empowering our fellow Americans to ask for help when they need it. For those in need of support, visit samhsa.gov/find-support or call the SAMHSA National Helpline at 1-800-662-4357 for confidential, free, 24-hours-a-day, 365-days-a-year information and referral services. For anyone experiencing a crisis, immediate and confidential help is also available by calling or texting 988, the National Suicide and Crisis Lifeline.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim February 26 through March 3, 2024, as National Eating Disorders Awareness Week. I encourage citizens, government agencies, private businesses, nonprofit organizations, and other interested groups to join in activities that will increase awareness of what Americans can do to prevent eating disorders and that will improve access to care and other support services for those currently living with an eating disorder.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-third day of February, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# American Red Cross Month, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
This month, we honor the American Red Cross for its humanitarian commitment to serve communities across the United States and around the world. We celebrate each and every selfless employee and volunteer as an ambassador of American generosity, who upholds a sacred mandate to leave no person behind.
Founded more than 140 years ago by Clara Barton, the American Red Cross has led with compassion and care, assisting neighbors and fellow Americans when they find themselves in some of the most agonizing circumstances they have ever faced. Throughout the biggest cities and the smallest towns, American Red Cross workers perform heroic acts of service across the United States and abroad. When wildfires devour neighborhoods, tornadoes uproot towns, earthquakes devastate homes and businesses, hurricanes whip beachfronts, and rivers rise and ruin neighborhoods and city streets, Red Cross volunteers are there to provide food, create temporary shelters, and help people recover and rebuild. While climate change has led to the increasing intensity and frequency of the world's natural disasters, Red Cross volunteers continue to serve as beacons of light, bringing hope to those facing some of the darkest hours and offering life-saving support at home and overseas.
During American Red Cross Month, I encourage everyone who is able to give blood and volunteer to help local communities in need. You can learn more about the process of donating blood online at redcross.org. Let us all use the dedication of the American Red Cross as an example this month and recommit in our own lives to lead with compassion and care. When we see others who are struggling, let us embody the generosity of the American spirit and resolve to lend them a helping hand.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America and Honorary Chair of the American Red Cross, by virtue of
the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 2024 as American Red Cross Month. I encourage all Americans to observe this month with relevant programs, ceremonies, and activities and to support the work of service and relief organizations.

# Irish-American Heritage Month, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
During Irish-American Heritage Month, we honor our Irish ancestors, all those who carry on their legacies, and the values that have always bound Ireland and the United States together.
These values—including determination, decency, and dignity—have been passed down from generation to generation in families like my own and have been grafted into the American character. Last year, I had the honor of visiting the home of some of my Irish ancestors, including the Blewitts of County Mayo and the Finnegans of County Louth. As I traveled across Ireland, I learned the true meaning of the Gaelic expression, “a hundred thousand welcomes.” I was reminded that everything between Ireland and America runs deep—from our history and sorrow to our future and joy. But more than anything, hope is what beats in the hearts of all of our people.
For centuries—even during times of darkness and despair—hope has kept us marching forward toward a better future. It is what led so many of our Irish ancestors to leave the only place they had ever called home and seek a new beginning in the United States. It is what drove generations of Irish immigrants to help build the foundations of America with grit and persistence, even as they endured discrimination and were denied opportunity. It is what continues to drive tens of millions of Irish Americans across our country to stand up for greater dignity, liberty, and possibilities for all. As we celebrate the 100th anniversary of United States-Irish diplomatic relations this year, hope remains the bedrock of our partnership, as evidenced by our work together to stand with the brave people of Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression, combat the climate crisis, and advance workers' rights across both of our nations.
In the years ahead, I look forward to strengthening the partnership and friendship between the people of Ireland and America even further. United by history, heritage, and hope, nothing is beyond our reach.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 2024 as Irish-
American Heritage Month. I call upon all Americans to celebrate the achievements and contributions of Irish Americans to our Nation with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of February, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# National Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
The second leading cause of cancer death in the United States today is colorectal cancer, and approximately 150,000 people in this country will be diagnosed with the disease this year. During National Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month, we honor all the Americans we have lost to this cancer, those currently living with or surviving it, and the loved ones who stand firmly by their side. We recommit to supporting all those helping drive progress against cancer and delivering incredible care to those facing this disease. We affirm our goal of ending cancer as we know it, once and for all.
As a country, we have made impressive progress in the struggle to end cancer over the past several decades due to advancements in prevention, early-detection measures, and new medicines and therapies. Despite remarkable breakthroughs, every year, more Americans are diagnosed with cancer under the age of 50. Earlier detection and improved treatment of colorectal cancer continue to be critical goals of medical research. Further progress is also needed to improve outcomes for those who are disproportionately impacted by this disease—including Americans over the age of 45, Native Americans, Black Americans, and people with a family history of colorectal cancer.
There is still more work to be done to ensure more Americans can prevent, detect, treat, and survive colorectal cancer. That is why the First Lady and I reignited the Cancer Moonshot with the ambition to cut the cancer death rate by at least half in the next 25 years and improve the experience of patients and families touched by cancer. I worked with the Congress to secure $2.5 billion in bipartisan funding for the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H). The scientists, innovators, and public health professionals funded by ARPA-H are working day and night to create a quantum leap in the prevention, detection, and treatment of cancer and other deadly, life-threatening, and life-altering diseases. Along the way, they are forging partnerships to deliver results to the people who need them most. ARPA-H is also partnering with the National Institutes of Health, the National Cancer Institute, and other agencies to develop a new Biomedical Data Fabric Toolbox for Cancer, which will ensure that knowledge gained
through research is available to as many experts as possible, with the goal of delivering groundbreaking innovations to patients sooner.
My Administration is also working tirelessly to get patients and their loved ones some much-needed breathing room by making cancer treatments more affordable. I was proud to strengthen Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act by expanding health care coverage to millions of Americans. Millions of people are saving $800 per year on health insurance premiums as a result of this extension. In addition, through the Inflation Reduction Act, the total out-of-pocket prescription drug costs for seniors and others with Medicare will be capped at $2,000 per year—including amounts they are required to pay for expensive cancer medications. For those on Medicare, we have also expanded access to health services that make it easier for patients and their families to navigate the complexities of cancer care. That includes dental services for people receiving certain kinds of cancer treatment, guidance from individuals who can help coordinate between health care teams, and community-based social services that can provide support outside of the health care system.
The independent United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends regular colorectal cancer screenings for all Americans starting at age 45. Colonoscopies and other preventive practices can detect cancer early, averting the disease before it starts. It is also recommended that all Americans should consult a doctor if they experience symptoms such as blood in their stool, a change in bowel activity, abdominal pain, bloating, persistent cramps, or unexplained weight loss. As part of my Administration's efforts to ensure people are able to receive timely screening, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services recently finalized a rule stating that no Medicare beneficiary has to pay for a diagnostic colonoscopy after a positive non-invasive screening test, like at-home stool-based tests.
Nearly every family in America has been touched by cancer—including mine. During National Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month, let us recognize the absolute courage and strength of patients, survivors, and their families by coming together as a country to provide the support and hope they need.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 2024 as National Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month. I encourage all citizens, government agencies, private businesses, non-profit organizations, and other groups to join in activities that will increase awareness and prevention of colorectal cancer. I also encourage Americans to visit HealthCare.gov and learn more about signing up for health coverage under the Affordable Care Act.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of February, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# Women's History Month, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
During Women's History Month, we celebrate the courageous women who have helped our Nation build a fairer, more just society.
Throughout history, the vision and achievements of powerful women have strengthened our Nation and opened the doors of opportunity wider for all of us. Though their stories too often go untold, all of us stand on the shoulders of these sung and unsung trailblazers—from the women who took a stand as suffragists, abolitionists, and labor leaders to pioneering scientists and engineers, groundbreaking artists, proud public servants, and brave members of our Armed Forces.
Despite the progress that these visionaries have achieved, there is more work ahead to knock down the barriers that stand in the way of women and girls realizing their full potential—in a country founded on freedom and equality, nothing is more fundamental. That is why my Administration has put women and girls at the heart of everything we do. When I first came into office, I established the White House Gender Policy Council to advance their rights and opportunities across domestic and foreign policy. I also released the Nation's first-ever National Gender Strategy to advance gender equity and equality across my Administration—from women's economic security and leadership opportunities to freedom from gender-based violence and equal access to education and health care. Women are seated at every table where decisions are made in my Administration—from our first female Vice President, Kamala Harris, to a record number of female cabinet secretaries to the most diverse set of judges ever nominated to the Federal bench, including Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson.
If we want to have the strongest economy in the world, we cannot leave women—half of our workforce—behind. Since I have been in office, the economy has created nearly 15 million jobs, and we have seen the lowest unemployment rate among women in more than five decades. As we implement major pieces of legislation like the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the CHIPS and Science Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act, we are ensuring that women get their fair share of opportunities. We are increasing their access to new jobs in sectors where women have been historically underrepresented, like manufacturing, construction, and clean energy. We are championing equal pay, including issuing new regulations that advance pay equity and pay transparency for Federal workers and employees of Federal contractors.
We are making sure women have access to the resources they need to enter and remain in the workforce, including high-quality, affordable child care. My Administration's American Rescue Plan helped working mothers, especially during the most challenging times of the pandemic, by keeping the doors of 220,000 child care centers open—90 percent of which are owned and staffed by women. Our Child Tax Credit cut the number of children in poverty by 50 percent and provided breathing room for 65 million children and their families, and we will keep fighting to restore it. I have also
signed legislation that provides new protections for pregnant and postpartum workers.
To promote the health and wellness of women in America, under the leadership of Vice President Harris, we launched the Blueprint for Addressing the Maternal Health Crisis to combat the high incidence of maternal mortality—especially for Black, Native, and rural women—due to systemic inequities in quality health care. We have expanded access to health care services for women veterans—the fastest growing group of veterans receiving services at the Department of Veterans Affairs. Last fall, we launched the White House Initiative on Women's Health Research to change how we approach and fund women's health research, and pioneer the next generation of discoveries in women's health care.
Further, Vice President Harris and I are fighting to protect women's reproductive freedom. In 2022, the Supreme Court made an extreme decision to overturn
Roe
v.
Wade,
reversing nearly five decades of recognizing a woman's constitutional right to choose and make deeply personal decisions about her health care. Now, tens of millions of women live in States with an extreme and dangerous abortion ban currently in effect. Across the country, women are being turned away from emergency rooms, forced to go to court to seek permission for the medical attention they need, and made to travel hundreds of miles for care. This is unacceptable. That is why I have taken action to safeguard access to reproductive care, including abortion and contraception. Vice President Harris and I will keep calling on the Congress to restore the protections of
Roe
v.
Wade
in Federal law—the only way to ensure women in every State have the right to choose.
As we lift up women's health and economic prosperity, we also have to protect their physical security. As a United States Senator, I was proud to write the Violence Against Women Act, which helped change the culture of silence around the scourge of gender-based violence in America. When we reauthorized the law, we increased our total investment in prevention and support to $700 million for 2023 alone—the highest funding ever to protect women from gender-based violence in nearly 30 years. I have also spearheaded historic military justice reforms to better protect survivors and ensure that, in cases of gender-based violence, prosecutorial decisions are fully independent from the chain of command. Last year, my Administration released the first-ever National Plan to End Gender-Based Violence, advancing a comprehensive Government-wide approach to preventing and addressing gender-based violence across the United States.
Globally, my Administration is supporting initiatives that help expand access to child care, end gender-based violence, cut the digital gender divide in half, promote women's leadership, and more. Thanks to the leadership of Vice President Harris, we have galvanized more than $2.9 billion in investments to advance the economic status of women around the world and ensure they play a meaningful role in the industries of the future.
This Women's History Month, may we recognize the long, storied history of great women helping to realize our Nation's founding promise and highest aspirations. May we all continue working to build a world worthy of the dreams and goals of all women and girls.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 2024 as Women's
History Month. I call upon all Americans to observe this month and to celebrate International Women's Day on March 8, 2024, with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities. I also invite all Americans to visit WomensHistoryMonth.gov to learn more about the vital contributions of women to our Nation's history.

# National Consumer Protection Week, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
As my Administration continues to build an economy that works for everyone, we cannot let fraud, cybercrimes, or unfair business practices interrupt the progress we have made. During National Consumer Protection Week, we recommit to protecting the rights of consumers and spreading awareness about the resources people have to defend themselves from predatory acts.
Since I took office, we have made enormous progress in building an economy from the middle out and the bottom up. To date, we have created nearly 15 million jobs, driven stable economic growth, and brought down inflation by two-thirds from its peak. Still, I know we have more work to do to protect the progress we have made by defending American consumers from unfair business practices.
In my first year in office, I issued an Executive Order on Promoting Competition in the American Economy, which directs and encourages Federal agencies to find ways to address powerful corporations' use of their market dominance to inflate prices of consumer goods and services. These corporations are also decreasing the quality of goods and services, deterring innovation, and limiting job mobility. Since then, agencies across the Federal Government have taken decisive action to encourage competition and lower costs for American households.
The Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) are cracking down on anticompetitive mergers, price fixing and price gouging, and other unfair practices that harm consumers. The Department of Agriculture has joined the effort to enforce antitrust and consumer protection laws in food and agriculture, which not only protect American families but farmers as well. At the same time, the FTC is working on a rule that would, if finalized as proposed, put an end to noncompete agreements, which restrict 30 million workers from switching jobs, even if they have opportunities that offer better pay and benefits. The FTC is also engaged in a rulemaking that proposes to require that companies make it as easy to cancel an online enrollment as it was to sign up so you are not left paying unwanted subscription fees because of a difficult cancellation process. The
FTC is working with law enforcement to counter predatory student loan scams, mortgage scams, and identity theft.
My Administration is fighting to eliminate hidden junk fees that some banks, airlines, health care companies, and other organizations use to rip off their customers. Since 2021, 15 of the 20 largest banks have responded to my call to stop charging customers for bounced checks and reduce overdraft fees, saving Americans $5.5 billion annually in eliminated junk fees. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has proposed a rule that will slash credit card late fees from an average of $31 when I took office to a new cap of $8, which will save Americans more than $9 billion annually. The CFPB is also taking steps to cut the average overdraft fee by more than half, down from its typical amount of over $30, a move that would save $150 per year for the more than 20 million households that pay these fees. The CFPB has also banned banks and credit unions from charging fees for basic services, like checking an account balance or retrieving old bank records. In addition, it has proposed a new rule that would make it easier for customers to switch banks, encouraging them to compete for customers based on the quality of their services.
The Department of Labor proposed a new rule that would, if finalized as proposed, minimize junk fees in retirement products by requiring financial advisers to provide retirement advice in the best interest of the saver. The Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of the Treasury have proposed a rule that would protect Americans from getting ripped off by health plans offering junk insurance that discriminate based on pre-existing conditions and trick consumers into buying insurance that provides little or no coverage when they need it most. Further, the Department of Transportation has challenged airlines to improve unfair business practices. Some airlines have already responded by eliminating fees that charge parents just to sit next to their child on a plane. Many have also begun guaranteeing free rebooking and reimbursement for hotels, meals, and ground transportation if a flight cancellation or delay is the airline's fault. Just last year, we saw the lowest rate of flight cancellations in a decade.
The FTC has enhanced its translation resources to make it easier for consumers to submit fraud reports and learn how to spot and avoid scams in languages other than English. Meanwhile, we are continuing to work with partners across the Government and in our communities to amplify and expand language access for consumers. Last year, the FTC proposed a rule that would ban hidden fees across the economy and require all companies to show consumers the all-in pricing of products upfront.
The American people should never be played like suckers. It is up to each of us to protect one another from harmful anticompetitive business practices. This National Consumer Protection Week, I encourage every American to visit consumer.ftc.gov to learn more about the resources available to defend the rights of consumers. I also encourage people to report cases of suspected fraud, issues with a consumer financial product, aggressive debt collection, inaccurate credit reporting, or unfair medical billing and other issues by visiting consumerfinance.gov/complaint online.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 3, 2024, through
March 9, 2024, as National Consumer Protection Week. I call upon government officials, industry leaders, and advocates across the Nation to share information about consumer protection and provide our citizens with information about their rights as consumers.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# Read Across America Day, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
On Read Across America Day, we celebrate the power of literacy to expand our minds and our understanding of the world around us. We salute all the parents, educators, authors, librarians, and mentors who encourage our children to read, and we appreciate the literature that dares them to think big.
For so many children, their dreams begin with a book. Whether it is through the stories they listen to at bed time or a trip to the local library, books introduce children to new ideas, cultures, and perspectives. They feed the imagination and stoke the fires of innovation that help them understand our world as it is and pioneer ways to make it better. I know firsthand how reading can change lives: the First Lady, a lifelong book lover, pursued a career as an educator because she wanted to share the gift of reading with people who “didn't know that joy.” As a community college professor, she continues to share that gift and remains committed to supporting all the teachers who do the same for their students.
The First Lady and I recognize there is still more work to do to improve literacy across the country. For more than a decade, studies show that reading competency of American students has been on the decline—and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic only made things worse. That is why, since day one of my Administration, we have been committed to supporting educators and improving literacy—from our youngest readers to adults.
To get our schools back open and running during the pandemic, my American Rescue Plan secured $130 billion, putting more teachers in our classrooms and more counselors in our schools. This funding is providing high-quality tutoring, expanding summer and after-school programming, and increasing student engagement. Over the past 3 years, school districts have added more than 610,000 educators and staff. Our National Partnership for Student Success is working to add another 250,000 caring adults in tutoring, mentoring, and other critical support roles. That equals hundreds of thousands of additional professionals who are giving students the support they deserve.
We also know that early education is a powerful stepping stone for academic success. Research shows that children who start school at 3 and 4 years old are more likely to graduate from high school and further their education. It is a big reason why I am working to ensure that every child in America has access to high-quality preschool.
We are also supporting adults in their efforts to become better readers through my Administration's Adult Education State Grants. These grants support adult literacy programs and provide the skills and resources needed to gain employment—from obtaining a secondary school diploma to transitioning to a postsecondary school.
This Read Across America Day, we must also acknowledge a difficult truth—that our children are growing up in a country where some extremist politicians are banning books in grade schools and high schools. In America, we do not ban books. Rather, we celebrate the full diversity of stories and perspectives—and their potential to expand our horizons.
Dr. Seuss once wrote, “The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you'll go.” Today, may we celebrate the power that is unleashed by reading—discovering the comfort of words in times of sorrow, finding inspiration to fuel our imagination, or having a clear-eyed understanding of our past so we can forge a future of limitless possibilities.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 2, 2024, as Read Across America Day. I call upon children, families, educators, librarians, public officials, and all the people of the United States to observe this day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# U.S. Hostage and Wrongful Detainee Day, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Today—and every day—the United States reaffirms our sacred pledge to American hostages and detainees wrongfully held abroad: We see you. We stand with you. We will not stop working until you are home and reunited with your family.
This has been a priority for my Administration since day one—and we have made important progress. Over the last 3 years, we have brought home more than 60 Americans being held hostage or wrongfully detained around the world, including from Afghanistan, Burma, Gaza, Haiti, Iran,
Russia, Rwanda, Venezuela, West Africa, and more. But we have much more work to do. Too many Americans remain illegally and wrongfully detained, fearing for their lives and not knowing what tomorrow will bring. Too many families remain ripped apart, living in agony and uncertainty every day their loved one remains wrongfully held abroad. No family—and no American—should have to endure this suffering and separation.
That is why my Administration has taken unprecedented action to secure the release of all Americans held hostage or wrongfully detained abroad. In 2022, I signed an Executive Order to strengthen our efforts to address the scourge of hostage-taking and wrongful detention, including issuing more severe consequences for actors that illegally detain American citizens and attempt to use human beings as bargaining chips. Last year, we issued the first-ever sanctions against actors—including in Russia and Iran—for engaging in this abhorrent practice. My Administration has also focused on preventing these cases from occurring in the first place. We have joined 74 nations around the world and the European Union in endorsing the Declaration Against Arbitrary Detention. Finally, we have focused on providing families with loved ones held hostage or wrongfully detained abroad with the resources and support services they deserve.
Here at home, the Department of State launched a risk indictor that warns travelers if there is a high threat of wrongful detention at their destination. For more information on travel advisories, go to travel.state.gov.
As President, I have no higher duty than ensuring the safety and security of my fellow Americans—including all those who remain held hostage or wrongfully detained abroad. I will continue to work to bring them home. I will continue to leverage every resource to punish and deter actors who engage in this despicable and unacceptable practice. I will not stop these efforts until every American is accounted for and safely back home. Today—and every day—that is my pledge.
The Congress, by Public Law 118-31 approved December 22, 2023, has designated March 9 of each year as “U.S. Hostage and Wrongful Detainee Day.”
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim March 9, 2024, as U.S. Hostage and Wrongful Detainee Day. On this day, as we fly the Hostage and Wrongful Detainee flag at the White House, I call upon the people of the United States to observe this day with relevant programs, ceremonies, and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.
Proclamation 10710 of March 11, 2024
Proc. 10710

# National Equal Pay Day, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
On National Equal Pay Day, we highlight the injustice of gender wage gaps by marking how far into this year women have to work, on average, to earn what men made last year. Over a lifetime, these inequities can amount to millions of dollars lost for women who do not receive the wages they deserve. Equal pay is about far more than a paycheck. It is about living up to the fundamental values that define who we are as a Nation—equality, dignity, and fairness. Today and every day, we continue working toward the promise of equal pay, recognizing that when women thrive, we all thrive.
Women's labor force participation is the highest it has been in decades, and the gender pay gap is the narrowest it has ever been on record. Yet, despite this progress, the fight for equal pay continues. Women working full-time and year-round are paid an average of 84 cents for every dollar paid to men. In more than 90 percent of occupations, women earn less than men—and these disparities are even greater for women of color and women with disabilities. The pay gap is a product of the systemic barriers that women have long faced when it comes to accessing good-paying jobs and opportunities. Further, caregiving responsibilities for children, loved ones with disabilities, and aging family members disproportionately fall on women, which can mean missing work, cutting hours, and leaving jobs.
America cannot have the strongest economy in the world while leaving women—half our workforce—behind. When I came into office, women's labor participation rate had fallen to its lowest level in more than three decades, in part because the COVID-19 pandemic had forced women out of the workforce to juggle caregiving responsibilities. In response, my Administration's American Rescue Plan invested billions of dollars to support working families, powering the strongest job creation in history. The law also helped keep the doors open to 220,000 child care centers, 90 percent of which were owned and staffed by women.
Since I took office, nearly 15 million jobs have been created, and we are working relentlessly to ensure these jobs are accessible to women. Across the major laws I have signed—such as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which is rebuilding our Nation; the CHIPS and Science Act, which is restoring our technological edge; and the Inflation Reduction Act, which is paving the way for a clean energy future—we are making sure women have a fair shot at securing the good-paying jobs being created. For the first time, firms receiving significant Federal dollars will be required to ensure they have high-quality child care available to their workers. I have signed a sweeping Executive Order that includes more than 50 directives to expand access to affordable, high-quality care and provide support for care workers and family caregivers. Additionally, I signed legislation that provides new protections for pregnant and nursing workers. This past year, the Small Business Administration delivered $5.1 billion in loans to women-owned businesses.
To advance pay equity, my Administration has committed to leading by example and making the Federal Government a model employer. That is why we have taken action to close persistent wage gaps. We finalized a rule ensuring that Federal agencies no longer consider an applicant's current or past pay when determining their future salaries—eliminating pay inequities that can otherwise follow workers from job to job. My Administration has proposed regulations to advance pay equity and pay transparency for workers on Federal contracts.
We are making tremendous progress, but there is still much more we must do. My Administration continues to call on the Congress to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act—commonsense legislation that would increase pay transparency and give workers more tools to fight sex-based pay discrimination.
On National Equal Pay Day, let us redouble our efforts to ensure that women get the pay they have earned and deserve. Let us recommit to giving our daughters the same opportunities as our sons. Let us remember our responsibility to live up to our Nation's fundamental values of equality, dignity, and fairness for all Americans.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 12, 2024, as National Equal Pay Day. I call upon all Americans to recognize the full value of women's skills and their significant contributions to the labor force, acknowledge the injustice of wage inequality, and join efforts to achieve equal pay.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eleventh day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

Proc. 10711

# National Poison Prevention Week, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Every year, Americans report more than 2 million cases of poisoning. During National Poison Prevention Week, we thank all those who staff our Nation's poison control centers for working around the clock to offer people in need life-saving guidance and care. We urge all Americans to learn how to prevent and respond to poison emergencies.
Poisoning risks abound in everyday items, from medicines and cosmetics to cleaning supplies and household chemicals. Tens of thousands of children a year end up in the emergency room after accidently ingesting household products like the small batteries found in toys and game controllers. Federal laws like the Poison Prevention Packaging Act of 1970 and the Child Nicotine Poisoning Prevention Act of 2015 have saved countless
lives, decreasing accidental childhood poisoning deaths by over 70 percent since 1972. There is still more to do.
In 2022, I signed Reese's Law, which established child safety standards to reduce the risk of injury from ingesting small batteries. To avoid dangerous mix-ups, we urge everyone to label their medications clearly, to keep them away from children in child-safe packaging, and to throw them out when expired or no longer needed. The liquid nicotine used in e-cigarettes can be deadly and should be stored in child-resistant packaging.
My Administration is also taking aggressive action to combat the opioid crisis. Following the directives outlined in our National Drug Control Strategy, my Administration is working to prevent dangerous illicit drugs from ever reaching our borders by working with countries like Mexico and the People's Republic of China to disrupt the trafficking of deadly illicit fentanyl and boosting law enforcement's capabilities at the border. My Administration is funding the expansion of substance use prevention, harm reduction, treatment, and recovery services including by expanding access to lifesaving opioid-overdose-reversal medications like naloxone nationwide.
Poisoning deaths are preventable, and awareness is essential to saving lives. If you believe that you or someone you know may have ingested a toxic substance, call the National Poison Control help line immediately at 800-222-1222 to be connected to a local poison control center. Trained experts are ready to offer real-time help and can often solve a poisoning emergency over the phone. Learn more about their lifesaving services at poisonhelp.hrsa.gov.
To encourage Americans to learn more about the dangers of unintentional poisonings and to take appropriate preventive measures, on September 26, 1961, the United States Congress, by joint resolution (75 Stat. 681), authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation designating the third week of March each year as “National Poison Prevention Week.”
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim March 17 through March 23, 2024, to be National Poison Prevention Week. I call upon all Americans to observe this week by taking actions to safeguard their families and friends from poisonous products, chemicals, and medicines often found in our homes and to raise awareness of these dangers to prevent accidental injuries and deaths.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.
Proclamation 10712 of March 18, 2024
Proc. 10712

# National Agriculture Day, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
On National Agriculture Day, we celebrate generations of American farmers, farmworkers, fishers, ranchers, foresters, and all those who work around the clock to put food on our tables and steward our Nation's lands. They represent the best of America—pride in community, love of family, and work ethic and strength that power our economy and help feed the world.
Over the last few decades, the failed trickle-down economic policies of the past have hit rural America especially hard. They have hollowed out communities, essentially telling farmers that the only path forward is to “get big” or “get out.” Food producers, meat processors, and grocery chains have consolidated, undercutting small local businesses and weakening the bargaining power of the farmers and ranchers who supply large corporations with goods. Meanwhile, corporations that sell seeds, fertilizer, and even farm equipment have used their own outsized market power to charge more even as farmers sold their own goods for less. Family farms have struggled, as the promise of keeping a farm in the family is too often slipping out of reach. When family farms go by the wayside, the small businesses, hospitals, and schools that depend on them suffer as well. Across rural America, thousands of young people have had to leave home to find a good-paying job and a fair shot at the American Dream. It is wrong.
I came to office determined to change that. The historic legislation I have signed is creating new income and new ways for new generations of rural Americans to thrive. We are investing in rural America, creating new opportunities for farmers and ranchers nationwide.
The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is strengthening farm supply chains by rebuilding roads, bridges, railways, ports, water systems, and more. It is bringing high-speed internet to every household in America, connecting rural communities to markets, customers, jobs, health care, education, and opportunity. The Inflation Reduction Act is investing nearly $20 billion to help farmers and ranchers earn a living while also helping to tackle the climate crisis, including adopting climate-smart practices like cover crops, rotational grazing, and nutrient management. It is expanding renewable energy, including homegrown biofuels, which is building a strong bio-economy for jobs of the future. Together, these laws are helping American farmers and ranchers remain strong and competitive in the face of a changing climate—from investing in watershed management and drought and flood protection to wildland fire protection. The Department of Agriculture (USDA) is providing billions of dollars in assistance to farmers who have previously experienced discrimination in their lending programs.
At the same time, my Administration is working across the board to promote competition and level the playing field for small farmers and ranchers. For example, the American Rescue Plan invested $1 billion in independent meat processors to help ease conglomerates' lock on the market and help small- and mid-sized companies grow. The USDA also published
a Packers and Stockyards Act final rule, which prohibits discrimination, retaliation, and certain unfair practices in livestock, meat, and poultry markets. The USDA also finalized a rule to increase transparency in the poultry tournament system so that growers have important information about the terms of their agreements. We have also pushed to cut costs for farmers by promoting farmers' “right to repair” their own equipment, without having to send it back to the manufacturer. We are working to expand double cropping insurance so farmers have the financial security they need to bear its risks and boost production.
We are also standing up for the farm and food workers who form the backbone of our Nation's economy. It is simple. Every worker in America deserves fair pay, safe conditions, and the free and fair choice to join a union. We promised to be the most pro-union Administration in history—and we are delivering. The USDA is also investing $45 million into partnerships with workforce development experts to better train agricultural employees. But there is still more to do, like finally providing undocumented farmworkers a pathway to citizenship. Our economy needs them, and they deserve dignity and respect.
It is simple: American agriculture feeds our families and powers our economy. National Agriculture Day is about celebrating the strength and tremendous contributions of our Nation's farmers and ranchers and making sure communities too long left behind have real reason to feel a new sense of hope and pride.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 19, 2024, as National Agriculture Day. I call upon all Americans to join me in recognizing and reaffirming our commitment to and appreciation for our country's farmers, farmworkers, ranchers, fishers, foresters, and all those who work in the agricultural sector across the Nation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighteenth day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# Greek Independence Day: A National Day of Celebration of Greek and American Democracy, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
On this day more than 200 years ago, revolutionaries throughout Greece rose up for the cause of freedom and declared their independence from the Ottoman Empire. Today, we honor the legacy of these courageous Greek women and men and rededicate ourselves to the cause of liberty and democracy for all.
Throughout our shared history, the people of Greece and the United States have been bound by this common belief—the power to shape our destiny should rest in the hands of “we the people.” Generation after generation, Americans and Greeks have come together to make those words a reality. We saw it during World War II, when our nations both fought the forces of fascism. We saw it during the Cold War, when our people stood united to prevail against communism. We see it today, as Greece and America stand together alongside a coalition of more than 50 nations to support the brave people of Ukraine as they fight for the same values those Greek revolutionaries did more than 200 years ago: liberty, freedom, and sovereignty.
Today, the partnership, alliance, and friendship shared by Greece and the United States is stronger than ever before—due in large part to the culture, courage, and character of the Greek American community. From standing up for social justice and advancing civil rights to striving to make our Nation freer and fairer, Greek Americans have pushed our country forward, fanning the flame of liberty that first sparked in Athens thousands of years ago. Throughout my career, I have been lucky to see this heart, hope, and commitment up close, and I have drawn lifelong inspiration from Greek American friends, families, leaders, and political mentors.
Today and every day, let us celebrate the unbreakable bonds of friendship shared by the United States and the Hellenic Republic. Let us continue to draw strength from the ideas put forth and the example set by our two countries. Guided by our highest hopes and ideals, let us recommit to preserving, defending, and protecting democracy—together.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 25, 2024, as Greek Independence Day: A National Day of Celebration of Greek and American Democracy. I call upon the people of the United States to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.

# Arab American Heritage Month, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
This month, we honor the rich heritage, history, and hopes of the more than 3.5 million Arab Americans across our country who have helped write the American story and move our Nation ever forward embodying the truth that diversity has been and always will be our country's greatest strength.
People with Arab heritage were among the many immigrants who came to our country's shores with a range of cultures, customs, backgrounds, and
beliefs, sharing a common courage to start new chapters in an unfamiliar land. As they built their lives, they helped build America—from fighting for our independence in the Continental Army to serving the cause of freedom during World War II to helping build cities and communities across our Nation, often in the face of discrimination and hate.
This legacy of courage, resilience, and service lives on today in Arab Americans across our country. We see it in the brave Arab American service members and public servants, who continue to defend our Nation's security and freedom. We see it in the Arab American engineers, scientists, and medical professionals, who are pioneering new breakthroughs and charting a better future for all. We see it in Arab American business owners and entrepreneurs, who are creating jobs and lifting up communities across the Nation. We see it in Arab American teachers and community leaders, who continue to inspire the next generation. And every day, I see it in the Arab Americans serving throughout my Administration, who are helping us build a stronger, more just Nation.
But as we come together this month to honor these contributions, we must also pause to reflect on the pain being felt by so many in the Arab American community with the war in Gaza. The trauma, death, and destruction in Israel and Gaza have claimed, and continue to claim, far too many innocent lives—including family and friends of Arab Americans across our Nation. I am devastated by the suffering of so many and mourn the lives taken, and I pray for the loved ones left behind and for all the innocent men, women, and children living in dire circumstances.
My Administration is working with partners across the region to respond to the urgent humanitarian crisis, deliver desperately needed aid to Gaza, free the hostages taken during the brutal Hamas terrorist attack on October 7th, and establish an immediate ceasefire that would last at least six weeks, which we would work to build into something more enduring. We are also focused on ensuring that calm is maintained and restored in neighboring states, including Lebanon. We must preserve the space for peace—for a two-state solution with equal measures of security and dignity for both Palestinians and Israelis. We are committed to working with the Arab American community, who remain critical advocates for the Palestinian and Arab people and a just and lasting peace.
This challenge also reminds us of our responsibility as a Nation here at home. Across our country, Arab Americans remain the target of bias and discrimination—including harassment, hate crimes, racist rhetoric, and violent attacks. In recent months, a Palestinian child was killed in his home, a young man was stabbed near a college campus, and a group of students were shot while just walking down the street—tragic reminders that hate never goes away. It only hides. It is up to all of us to give hate no safe harbor.
That is why we are fighting against the rise of all forms of hate, including against Arab Americans. On my first day in office, I rescinded the discriminatory Muslim travel ban that prevented individuals from primarily Middle Eastern and African countries from entering the United States. In 2022, my Administration convened the first United We Stand Summit, which brought together interfaith leaders to counter hate-motivated violence and foster unity. We are also developing our country's first-ever National Strategy to Counter Islamophobia and Related Forms of Bias and Discrimination
in the United States, which will identify concrete ways to address the scourge of hate against Muslim, Sikh, South Asian, and Arab American communities. To ensure Arab Americans are fully represented, my Administration finalized the addition of a new Middle Eastern and North African option for the 2030 census and other forms that ask for people's race and ethnicity—a vital step to ensure that Arab Americans are seen, counted, and valued as new policy is being made.
America is the only Nation in the world founded on an idea: that we are all created equal and deserve to be treated equally throughout our lives. We have never fully lived up to that promise, but we have never walked away from it either. This month, we vow that we never will. Together, we recommit to this promise of America by honoring and advancing the dignity, equity, and security of Arab Americans across our Nation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2024 as Arab American Heritage Month. I call upon all Americans to learn more about the history, culture, and achievements of Arab Americans and to observe this month with appropriate programs and activities.

# Care Workers Recognition Month, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Every day, care workers dedicate themselves to ensuring the people we love are safe and secure. They watch over our children, assist our parents, and support loved ones with disabilities. Their work makes all other work possible. During Care Workers Recognition Month, we honor their tireless efforts; express our gratitude for their unwavering devotion; and commit to ensuring they receive the pay, benefits, and recognition they deserve.
The services care workers provide are not only essential to so many lives—they are crucial for our economy. But for too long, care workers' paychecks have not reflected the value of their demanding and important work. In fact, care workers are among the lowest paid workers in the country. Of the millions of care workers in our Nation, the majority are women of color, deepening racial and gender wage and wealth gaps. Each year, half of the long-term care workforce and nearly 20 percent of the child care workforce end up leaving their jobs, which makes it difficult for the families who depend on care workers to find the stable and secure support they need.
My Administration is committed to getting care workers the resources and respect they deserve. In 2021, we invested over $60 billion from our American Rescue Plan in the care economy. That funding helped keep 225,000 child care centers open during the COVID-19 pandemic, ensuring that the 10 million children they served had a place to go. It also provided increased pay and bonuses and secured better benefits for child care workers, helping hundreds of thousands of mothers with young children enter or re-enter the workforce. Through our expanded earned income tax credit alone, we delivered financial relief to nearly 300,000 child care workers. My Budget includes robust proposals in care infrastructure, including through investments in caregiving for military families and investments in child care to increase accessibility and guarantee affordable, high-quality child care from birth until kindergarten.
In addition, the Executive Order I signed last year includes the most comprehensive set of actions any administration has taken to increase access to high-quality care and support for caregivers. It directs almost every cabinet-level agency to take over 50 actions that provide more peace of mind for families and more dignity for care workers who deserve jobs with good pay and good benefits. For example, the Department of Health and Human Services released a proposed rule that would raise Head Start teacher wages by more than $10,000 on average and strengthen Head Start's ability to recruit and retain staff. Further, I directed the Department of Veterans Affairs to give veterans who need assistance at home more flexibility to pick their own caregivers. The Department of Labor has invested tens of millions of dollars in boosting the quality of care jobs and expanding access to them.
Additionally, agencies are working to improve the quality of home care and nursing home jobs. My Administration is taking steps to get home care workers the pay they deserve by making sure they get a bigger share of Medicaid payments, and to strengthen requirements for nursing homes so that staff are not stretched thin and residents get the attention they need. My Administration is also promoting apprenticeship programs that put careers as registered and licensed nurses within reach so that we can both add and keep long-term care workers on the job.
Care workers are our Nation's hidden heroes. They support so many of our families across the country, and it is our responsibility to ensure that they are not left behind. This Care Workers Recognition Month, in addition to expressing our gratitude for their selfless dedication to our loved ones and honoring their tremendous value to our society, we also recommit to ensuring that they are rewarded for their extraordinary contributions to America.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2024 as Care Workers Recognition Month. I call upon all Americans to celebrate the contributions of care workers to our Nation with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# Month of the Military Child, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
This April, we celebrate children of our service members and veterans whose sacrifice and support allow their parents to serve our Nation and protect children everywhere.
Over the years, the First Lady and I have had the honor of meeting with military and veteran children from every corner of our Nation and witnessing their incredible sense of duty firsthand. These young patriots often pack up their lives every few years, starting new schools and making new friends. From watching our own grandchildren, we also know that military children embody courage and selflessness, remaining brave when their moms or dads are deployed and remaining resilient when celebrating birthdays and holidays with an empty seat at the dinner table. Military and veteran children also take care of loved ones who are wounded, ill, or injured—and far too many grow up with the unbearable pain of losing a parent. It is a solemn reminder that being a military child means sacrificing for our country without ever wearing a uniform.
Our Nation has many obligations, but we have only one truly sacred obligation: to prepare and equip those we send into harm's way and to care for them and their families—especially our military children—while deployed and when they return home. That is why I signed an Executive Order last year that establishes the most comprehensive set of administrative actions in our Nation's history to support the economic security of military and veteran spouses, caregivers, and survivors—including improving access to quality, dependable, and affordable child care. My Administration expanded the Military Parental Leave Program, ensuring that service members have the time they need with their families after a child's birth, adoption, or long-term foster care placement. We are working to guarantee universal pre-kindergarten for military children at Department of Defense schools. We have begun that work by launching a pilot program at a school in Japan. The First Lady's Joining Forces initiative is providing support to military children by improving economic opportunity for military families, making school transitions easier, and expanding resources to promote their families' health and well-being.
Military children embody the very best of America—shouldering the unique challenges military life places on families across our Nation and around the world with tenacity. This month—and every month—we honor their bravery and show our gratitude to the children of our military service members and veterans for their own service to our Nation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2024 as the Month of the Military Child. I call upon the people of the United States to honor the children of our service members and veterans with appropriate ceremonies and activities. I also encourage Americans everywhere to find ways to support military-connected children, including by wearing purple during the month of April in honor of their service.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

Proc. 10717

# National Cancer Prevention and Early Detection Month, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Cancer has touched nearly every American family. During National Cancer Prevention and Early Detection Month, we honor the enormous courage and strength of the millions of Americans facing the disease today and of the many millions of survivors, whose resilience inspires us all. Together, we will end cancer as we know it and get patients and families the quality care and support that they deserve.
In recent decades, we have made enormous progress toward beating cancer. In addition to new medicines and therapies, we have developed early detection methods and discovered prevention measures that extend and save lives. Studies have shown that over 30 percent of cancers diagnosed today could be prevented through methods like decreasing environmental and toxic exposures to carcinogens and making lifestyle changes like reducing tobacco use and improving nutrition. Still, cancer is the second-leading cause of death in our country.
I came to office determined to change that. Beating cancer is personal to my family, as it is to millions of families across America and around the world. That is why the First Lady and I re-ignited the Cancer Moonshot. The goal is to cut the cancer death rate by at least 50 percent in the next 25 years—starting by preventing the cancers we know we can stop and catching others as early as possible. We are also working to turn more cancers from death sentences into chronic diseases that people can live with and to create more supportive experiences for patients and their families. To help achieve that, I established the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health, securing $4 billion in bipartisan funding to date to help the scientists, innovators, and public health professionals who are working day and night to improve the prevention, detection, and treatment of cancers and other deadly diseases. We are not just working toward incremental changes—we are looking for quantum leaps forward.
It is important for every American to know that cancer screenings are lifesaving—early detection can make all the difference in beating the disease.
That is why my Administration is working to ensure that every American can get them. During my first year in office, we expanded coverage under the Affordable Care Act, which requires insurers to pay for cancer screenings and primary care visits. More Americans have insurance than under any President, ensuring that millions of Americans now have health coverage for those services and more. My Administration is also helping millions of families save an average of $800 per year on their health insurance premiums. To increase access to early detection, my Administration has partnered with community health centers to provide screenings closer to folks' homes, and we extended health care coverage for lung cancer screenings. Further, we have closed loopholes so that new stool-based screening tests and follow-up screenings do not lead to surprise costs for patients undergoing colonoscopies. Eliminating these barriers to screenings will save and extend countless lives. To learn your personal risk factors and know which screenings are right for you, please talk to your health care provider, visit cdc.gov/cancerscreening or cancer.gov/screeningtests, or call 1-800-4-CANCER for more information. We encourage everyone to schedule routine cancer screening appointments.
At the same time, healthy life habits—like maintaining a healthy body weight and reducing exposure to tobacco smoke—can prevent certain cancers, so we are working to help all Americans get and stay healthy. Our National Strategy on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health supports expanding incentives to purchase fruits and vegetables with SNAP, ensures more kids have access to free and nutritious school lunches, and expands access to nutrition and obesity counseling. For help with quitting smoking—the leading cause of cancer in America—visit SmokeFree.gov, call 1-800-QUIT-NOW, or text QUITNOW to 333888.
My Administration is working to reduce Americans' exposure to environmental toxins that can lead to cancer. Through our Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, my Administration has invested billions of dollars to clean up toxic sites and help States replace lead pipes and service lines, protecting millions of families from exposure to so-called “forever chemicals” and other contaminants that increase people's risk of getting cancer. I was also proud to sign the PACT Act, ensuring that veterans exposed to toxic substances during their military service get the cancer care and benefits that they deserve.
Ending cancer is the kind of big and ambitious goal that America has always embraced. For the patients fighting for a better day, the survivors who give us strength, the caregivers who share their hearts, the lives we have lost, and the lives we can save, let us recommit to this vital work.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim April 2024 as National Cancer Prevention and Early Detection Month. I encourage citizens, government agencies, private businesses, nonprofit organizations, and other interested groups to join in activities that will increase awareness of what Americans can do to prevent, detect, and beat cancer.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# National Child Abuse Prevention Month, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
There is no greater sin than the abuse of power, especially when that abuse is directed at a child. During National Child Abuse Prevention Month, we stand together to prevent abuse and neglect, support brave survivors, and build strong communities and families where every child can grow up happy and safe.
For far too many children across America, the violence, fear, and intimidation associated with physical and emotional abuse define their most formative years. The emotional scars can last a lifetime, making it hard to form healthy relationships, upending their futures, and perpetuating a toxic cycle of abuse. As a United States Senator, I fought to change that by writing and championing the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), the first law of its kind, which helped secure safety and justice for women and children impacted by domestic violence. Since then, each time we reauthorized VAWA, we have made it stronger—including in 2022, when we increased authorized resources available to children who have been exposed to domestic violence and extended greater jurisdiction to Tribal Courts prosecuting child abuse cases on their own lands.
We are also working to prevent abuse and give survivors the resources they need to heal and thrive. The American Rescue Plan invested $350 million in improving child protective services at the State level and in expanding local child abuse prevention programs. In 2022, I signed a bill that eliminates the Federal statute of limitations for civil claims filed by survivors of child sexual abuse so they can still pursue justice as adults. The Department of Justice is also investing in Children's Advocacy Centers across the country to help law enforcement investigate and prosecute child sexual abuse and exploitation, including acts committed online. The Department of Homeland Security is launching a Government-led campaign to combat the threat of child abuse and exploitation online, which will bring awareness to this growing threat; teach children, parents, caregivers, and educators how to report these crimes; and offer resources to survivors.
Every child in America deserves to grow up safe, supported, and surrounded by love. This month, we remember that we all play a part in making that real. For more information on how to recognize and report child abuse or neglect and to support loving families and safe communities visit childwelfare.gov.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2024 as National
Child Abuse Prevention Month. I call upon all Americans to observe this month by joining together as a Nation to promote the safety and well-being of all children and families and to recognize the child welfare professionals and allies who work tirelessly to protect our children. Let us also honor the strength and resilience of survivors of child abuse.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

Proc. 10719

# National Donate Life Month, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
I often say that we are a good Nation because we are a good people, and during National Donate Life Month, we are reminded of why that is true as we celebrate all the selfless organ donors across our country, who have saved countless lives. We honor the families and friends of donors who have supported their loved ones, and we recognize the professionals devoted to the transplant community. We call upon more Americans to register as organ, eye, tissue, or bone marrow donors and share the gift of life with those in need.
Across the country, organ transplants are being performed at a record pace because of the incredible generosity and courage of organ donors. America's doctors have performed over one million organ transplants to date. Each year, thousands of profoundly compassionate Americans choose to donate their organs, saving the lives of loved ones and people they have never even met.
Despite this progress, there is still so much more to do until every person who needs an organ receives one. More than 100,000 people, including nearly 2,000 children, are currently on the waiting list for an organ transplant—the majority of whom are people of color. With a shortage of organ donors and a high demand for them, 17 Americans die each day while waiting for a transplant.
We can each change that. After someone passes away, their organ donation can save up to 8 people and can improve 75 more lives through eye and tissue donation. What an extraordinary legacy to leave: giving people in need a second chance at life and giving families futures with their loved ones.
My Administration is working to improve the organ donation process and ensure living donors and recipients have access to quality, affordable health care. For the first time in nearly 40 years, we are breaking up the monopoly that has controlled the organ transplant system. A bipartisan law I signed, the Securing the U.S. Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network Act, will transform the organ transplant network by increasing
competition in the contracts process. This law allows us to implement an independent board of directors that can strengthen accountability and oversight. In addition, we established the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network Modernization Initiative, which will bring more transparency to the system and spearhead needed reforms. These actions are critical first steps toward cutting down the wait list for organs.
We have also taken action to extend Medicare coverage of vital drugs for kidney transplant patients and are working to ensure high-quality care for transplants. This year, through my Inflation Reduction Act, out-of-pocket drug costs for seniors on Medicare will be capped at $3,500 a year—even for medications that cost some organ recipients many times that.
In addition, I worked with the Congress to secure $2.5 billion in bipartisan funding for the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H). The scientists, innovators, and public health professionals receiving ARPA-H funding are working day and night to revolutionize the prevention, detection, and treatment of cancer and other deadly diseases. In time, these breakthroughs could one day reduce the need for organ transplants or eliminate the need for anti-rejection medication. For example, to make it easier and faster for patients to get a transplant, ARPA-H has already invested $26 million into addressing organ transplant shortages through on-demand 3D tissue printing, beginning with a human heart.
Millions of Americans have embraced the American spirit of helping those in need by signing up to be organ donors. Any adult can register, regardless of age or medical history. In many States you can sign up by simply checking a box when you renew your driver's license. I encourage all Americans to learn more about organ, eye, and tissue donation by visiting organdonor.gov or bloodstemcell.hrsa.gov for more information on donating bone marrow. This National Donate Life Month, let us redouble our efforts to save and improve more lives by lending a hand to our fellow Americans in need of life-saving organ transplants.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2024 as National Donate Life Month. I call on every person who can to share the gift of life and hope by becoming an organ, eye, tissue, or bone marrow donor. I also call on this Nation to observe National Pediatric Transplant Week from April 21 through April 27, a week dedicated to ending the pediatric transplant waiting list.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Sexual violence affects every community in this Nation, leaving millions of Americans—our neighbors, friends, colleagues, and loved ones—scarred. For many survivors, healing can take years, and for some, the pain never heals completely. During National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month, we recommit to standing with survivors, holding perpetrators accountable, and bringing an end to a culture that has allowed sexual assault to occur for far too long.
More than half of all women and nearly one-third of all men in America have experienced sexual violence. The rate of sexual violence is even higher for people of color. Survivors have faced this violence wherever life happens—at work, at school, at home, and online. It can upend people's jobs and contribute to mental health issues like depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder. It is an insult to our most basic humanity and everything we stand for as a Nation.
Ending gender-based violence has been the cause of my life. Thirty years ago, as a United States Senator, I wrote and championed the original Violence Against Women Act (VAWA). This law gave us the tools to prevent and prosecute sexual assault, provide support for survivors, and save lives. Every time we have re-authorized it, we have made it stronger. In December 2022, we secured $700 million for VAWA programs—the highest funding level in history—for the next fiscal year. Those funds have helped strengthen the public health response for domestic violence and sexual assault survivors and their children, and expand access to sexual assault medical forensic examinations and culturally specific resources for LGBTQI+ survivors, rural areas, and other underserved and marginalized communities. The reauthorization also established a new offense for Federal law enforcement officers who commit sexual misconduct under color of law and expanded Tribal jurisdiction so that non-Native perpetrators of sexual assault can be prosecuted for crimes they commit on Tribal lands.
My Administration has made ending gender-based violence a top priority in many other ways too. Our American Rescue Plan delivered $1 billion in funding for rape crisis centers, community support organizations, and other sexual violence services nationwide. We released the first-ever National Plan to End Gender-Based Violence, advancing a comprehensive Government-wide approach to preventing and addressing gender-based violence across the country. When we passed the most significant gun law in nearly 30 years, we narrowed the so-called “boyfriend loophole,” keeping guns out of the hands of domestic abusers. To combat online harassment and abuse, I worked with Vice President Kamala Harris to launch a Federal task force that has taken concrete steps on prevention, accountability, research, and support for survivors and launched the first 24/7 national helpline for survivors of image-based sexual abuse.
We are also ensuring people are safe from abuse at school and work. I signed an Executive Order that called on the Department of Education to protect students from discrimination based on sex, including sex-based harassment and sexual violence, and I remain steadfast in my commitment to ensuring all students have an educational environment free from discrimination. I have also signed laws limiting the enforcement of non-disclosure agreements for those who have been sexually assaulted or harassed in the workplace and ending forced arbitration so that survivors can get their day in court. Additionally, I have asked that Federal agencies take action to make leave more accessible for employees seeking safety and recovering from gender-based violence. Furthermore, I have spearheaded historic military justice reforms to better protect survivors in our military and ensure that prosecutorial decisions in cases of gender-based violence are fully independent from the chain of command.
This National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month, let us each recommit to stepping up and doing our part to intervene in, prevent, and end sexual assault in our communities. Let us redouble our efforts to support and stand with survivors of sexual assault. Let us pledge to work together to create a society that is truly safe, where all Americans can pursue their dreams without fear of assault, abuse, or harassment.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2024 as National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month. I urge all Americans to support sexual assault survivors, including when survivors reach out and disclose abuse, and to strengthen our efforts to prevent this abuse in the first place.

# Second Chance Month, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
America was founded on the promise of new beginnings. During Second Chance Month, we recommit to building a criminal justice system that lives up to those ideals so that people returning to their communities from jail or prison have a fair shot at the American Dream.
Every year, more than 650,000 people are released from State and Federal prisons, some leaving with nothing more than a few dollars and a bus ticket to start their new lives. In total, over 70 million Americans have a criminal history record, which can make it hard to secure a steady job, safe housing, affordable health care, or a good education—all important things
to have when trying to build a good life. Studies show that when these needs are met, we do not just empower formerly incarcerated people—we prevent crime and make our communities safer.
That is why, last year, my Administration released a comprehensive strategic plan to improve the criminal justice system and strengthen public safety. It includes over 100 concrete actions that my Administration is taking to boost public safety by improving rehabilitation in jails and prisons, helping people rebuild their lives, and reducing unnecessary interactions with the criminal justice system so police officers can focus on fighting crime.
We have also invested nearly $1 billion in job training, addiction recovery, and reentry services across the country, and we have expanded access to Pell Grants so people can earn a college degree while they are incarcerated, starting over with new skills. We are also helping folks find good-paying jobs rebuilding America on projects funded by our historic infrastructure law and expanding opportunities to serve in the Federal Government. We are working to make sure those who have served their time have an equal opportunity to obtain health care, housing, education, and consideration for small business loans. By meeting these needs, we not only empower people to chase their dreams and fuel our economy—we also prevent crime and make our communities safer and stronger.
At the same time, my Administration has taken historic steps to end America's failed approach to marijuana. Incarceration for marijuana possession alone has destroyed too many lives, particularly for Black and brown Americans, who have been arrested, prosecuted, and convicted at higher rates than other racial and ethnic groups. In 2022, I asked the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Attorney General to start formally reviewing how marijuana is scheduled under Federal law. I have issued categorical pardons for people convicted for simple possession and use under Federal and D.C. law while urging governors to do the same on the State level. It is simple: No one should be in jail or prison for using or possessing marijuana alone. Meanwhile, my Administration has made historic investments to expand access to mental health and substance use services. We have also provided $400 million to prevent juvenile justice involvement and make these systems more responsive to the needs of youth. We have provided over $3 billion in funding for education programs that provide support, services, and interventions, which keep students positively engaged in their schools and communities.
If we pursue this work together, our communities will be safer, stronger, and more just. It will make families and communities whole and help grow our economy, giving everyone a fair chance. I have always believed that our Nation's best days are ahead—and that is true for every single American too. This month, we recommit to fulfilling the fresh promise that every second chance holds.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2024 as Second Chance Month. I call upon government officials, educators, volunteers, and all the people of the United States to observe this month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# National Public Health Week, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
During National Public Health Week, we celebrate the life-saving care of public health professionals who work tirelessly to promote our country's health, safety, and well-being. We recognize that the healthier Americans are as individuals, the stronger we are as a Nation.
In the last few years, we have made enormous progress in recovering from the pandemic, vaccinating 230 million Americans and getting kids back in school. None of that would have been possible without the courage and dedication of millions of first responders and social workers, doctors and nurses, and scientists and researchers. Public health professionals have always played an essential role in the life of our Nation—working to boost immunizations, improve safety standards for food and transportation, protect clean air and water, and more. We owe them for carrying us through tough times and making our country healthier and more prosperous long-term. We have to help make their jobs easier by investing in the health of the American people.
I have long said that health care should be a right in this country, not a privilege. That is why my Administration expanded coverage through the Affordable Care Act. Today, more Americans have health care coverage than under any other President, and millions of families are saving an average of $800 per year on insurance premiums. We have also invested $7.6 billion in community health centers so people in rural and underserved areas can get care close to home. After years of trying, we have succeeded in reducing prescription drug costs—for example, capping insulin at $35 per month for seniors on Medicare, down from as much as $400, and finally getting Medicare the authority to negotiate lower drug prices, as the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs have long done. Starting next year, no senior on Medicare will have to pay more than $2,000 per year in total out-of-pocket drug costs—not even for expensive cancer medications that cost many times more.
At the same time, we are funding scientific research that will help us make quantum leaps forward in the prevention, detection, and treatment of deadly diseases. I established the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health, securing $2.5 billion in bipartisan funding for scientists, innovators, and public health professionals making these advances. Further, the First Lady and I reignited the Cancer Moonshot, setting a bold goal to cut the cancer death rate by at least 50 percent over the next 25 years and boost support for people impacted by cancer. We also launched the first-ever
White House Initiative on Women's Health Research to close research gaps and maximize our ability to prevent, diagnose, and treat health conditions in women, like cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer's disease, and endometriosis.
I am doing all I can to protect women's fundamental freedom to make their own health care decisions. In the wake of the Supreme Court's decision to overturn the constitutional right to choose, tens of millions of Americans are living under extreme State abortion bans that put women's health and lives at risk and threaten doctors with jail time for providing the health care their patients need. In response, my Administration has taken steps to safeguard access to emergency medical care, support the ability to travel for reproductive health care, and strengthen privacy protections for patients and health care providers. I will keep pressing the Congress to restore the protections of
Roe
v.
Wade
into Federal law. It is the only way to ensure reproductive freedom for women in every State. At the same time, Vice President Harris is leading the effort to combat the maternal health crisis that is gripping our country, which has been especially devastating to Black and Native women and women in rural communities, where maternal mortality rates are unconscionably high.
We are also making historic investments in improving mental health by putting more counselors in schools and pushing insurers to cover mental health care at the same level as any other care.
We are working hard to ensure that substance use disorder is treated like any other disease by funding the expansion of prevention, harm reduction, treatment, and recovery support services. My Administration removed decades—long administrative barriers to treatment of opioid use disorder and expanded access to opioid overdose reversal medications like naloxone, and we are continuing to advance efforts to address the overdose epidemic and save lives. We are working to end the epidemic of gun violence that has shattered far too many American lives. Two summers ago, I signed the most significant gun safety law in nearly 30 years, funding States' implementation of red flag laws and enhancing background checks for gun buyers under 21. I launched the first-ever White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention. I was also proud to sign the reauthorized Violence Against Women Act, building on the law that I first wrote years ago to expand protections and resources for today's domestic violence survivors.
Meanwhile, my Administration is making the largest investment ever in fighting the public health crises caused by climate change. We are working to make communities more resilient to extreme weather and ensuring that 40 percent of our clean energy investments flow to the disadvantaged areas that have borne the brunt of toxic pollution for too long. Through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we are also replacing every poisonous lead pipe in the country so anyone in America can turn on the faucet and drink clean water. We have released a national strategy to end hunger and reduce diet-related diseases, including expanding access to nutrition and obesity counseling, and we are providing millions of students with free, nutritious school meals.
Globally, we are making key investments to combat health challenges like HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, cancer, and COVID. With the G20 and other partners, we created the Pandemic Fund to strengthen global pandemic preparedness, prevention, and response. At home, we invested over
$7 billion to help State and local public health departments prepare for future crises, and we launched Public Health AmeriCorps to train a strong, diverse public health workforce for tomorrow.
These are vital steps needed to protect the American people. During National Public Health Week, we are reminded how interconnected everyone's health and well-being are and that we are truly all in this together. By continuing to invest in public health, we can help ensure that the lessons of the last 4 years make our Nation stronger for the future.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 1 through April 7, 2024, as National Public Health Week. I call on all citizens, government agencies, private businesses, nonprofit organizations, and other groups to take action to improve the health of our Nation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# National Park Week, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
America's natural wonders and historic treasures are the heart and soul of our Nation. From the high plateaus and deep ravines of the Grand Canyon to the hallowed grounds of Gettysburg and the rolling forests of the Great Smoky Mountains, our national parks unite and inspire us, connecting us to something bigger than ourselves. This week, we recommit to protecting and caring for all 429 parks and encourage Americans everywhere to enjoy them.
Protecting our national parks preserves their majestic beauty as well as meaningful pieces of our Nation's history and future. They contain irreplaceable ecosystems that help sustain the air we breathe and the water we drink, and make our Nation more resilient to the threat of climate change. They give families priceless memories of sharing the great outdoors and exploring our past, and create hundreds of thousands of jobs in recreation. Many of them help preserve sites and places that are sacred to Tribal Nations, who have stewarded these lands since time immemorial.
My Administration has pursued the most ambitious land and water conservation agenda in American history—and I am on track to conserve more lands and waters than any other President in history. That work began with setting our first-ever national conservation goal: to protect and conserve at least 30 percent of all our Nation's lands and waters by 2030 by investing in locally led, voluntary conservation and restoration efforts through our “America the Beautiful” Initiative. I signed an Executive Order protecting
America's forests and harnessing the power of nature to fight climate change while also launching a new National Nature Assessment to help evaluate the status of our lands, waters, and wildlife.
Since I took office, my Administration has conserved over 41 million acres of our Nation's precious lands and waters—from safeguarding the Tongass National Forest in Alaska, the Nation's largest national forest, to restoring protections for the desert buttes of Bears Ears National Monument in Utah. I established five new national monuments, including Baaj Nwaavjo I'tah Kukveni on the edge of the Grand Canyon, a place that is sacred to many Tribal Nations, and the Emmett Till and Mamie Till-Mobley National Monument, which tells the story of the events surrounding Emmett Till's murder and their significance in the civil rights movement. Just last month, I signed an Executive Order to better recognize and integrate the history of women and girls into the parks, monuments, and historic sites that the National Park Service helps protect.
National parks and the complex ecosystems they contain also help make our Nation more resilient to the existential threat of climate change. My Administration has made the biggest investment in conservation and climate action in history, including $700 million in our national parks for increased staff and much-needed maintenance. My Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests in sustaining our lands and waters with projects to protect salt marshes, remove invasive species from sagebrush ecosystems to reduce wildfire risk, and more. It is helping to build new trails, roads, bridges, and other transportation for our national parks as well, making our parks easier to visit. It pays for bonuses and training opportunities for over 20,000 wildland firefighters. Meanwhile, we have been working closely with Tribal Nations to recognize the value of their Indigenous Knowledge and expand Tribal co-stewardship of national parks. My recent Budget asks for over $3 billion for the National Park Service itself to upgrade park infrastructure, work with Tribal Nations in stewarding and managing culturally significant lands, support youth programs that can lead to good-paying jobs, and more. Through the Outdoor Recreation Legacy Partnership, the National Park Service is helping to create and renovate parks and outdoor spaces in communities that have been without them for too long.
I encourage everyone to explore America's national parks—and on April 20, entry will be free. Each time my family and I have visited one, we have left feeling inspired by our Nation's natural beauty and humbled by the responsibility that we all share to make sure that it endures. This National Park Week, we recommit to the work of protecting our Nation's natural treasures for the ages.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 20 through April 28, 2024, as National Park Week. I encourage all Americans to find their park, recreate responsibly, and enjoy the benefits that come from spending time in the natural world.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this nineteenth day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# National Crime Victims' Rights Week, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Each year, millions of Americans become victims of crime and acts of violence. During National Crime Victims' Rights Week, we recommit to pursuing justice for victims and providing them with the support and resources needed to heal from the emotional, psychological, physical, and financial scars of those traumatic experiences. We continue our work to prevent crime before it occurs. Every American deserves to know that they, their families, and their communities are safe and free from violence and crime.
Since I first came to office, my Administration has been working tirelessly with law enforcement, crime victims, and other community leaders across the country to keep Americans safe. Together, we have made historic progress. Last year, the United States had one of the lowest rates of all violent crime in more than 50 years. Murder, rape, aggravated assault, and robbery all dropped sharply, as did burglary, property crime, and theft.
Reducing violence and crime is a top priority for my Administration. We helped cities, counties, and States invest over $15 billion in fighting crime and preventing violence. We made the largest-ever Federal investment in public safety, enabling law enforcement to better serve their communities—helping to keep everyone safe. Our investment also has been used to implement proven crime-prevention strategies like community violence intervention programs that leverage community leaders and formerly incarcerated people to work with young people and those at most risk of violence, intervening before it is too late with culturally competent strategies.
As a United States Senator, I supported the law that established the Crime Victims Fund, which directly compensates victims and finances victim assistance services. As President, I signed a law to replenish and strengthen the fund so that victims can continue to access the resources they need.
My Administration is also supporting survivors of gender-based violence. As a Senator, I wrote the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), which brought survivors' stories into the forefront of the American consciousness and combatted the scourge of gender-based violence in America. VAWA has helped fund helplines, shelters, and rape crisis centers; offered survivors housing and legal assistance; and trained law enforcement agencies and courts on ways the justice system could better assist survivors of gender-based violence. When we reauthorized VAWA in 2022, we expanded Tribal courts' jurisdiction so that non-Native perpetrators of sexual assault,
sex trafficking, stalking, and child abuse can be prosecuted for the crimes they commit on Tribal lands. VAWA newly empowered individuals whose intimate visual images are disclosed without their consent to take perpetrators to court through a Federal civil cause of action. This year, I worked with the Congress to increase VAWA's funding to its highest level in history. Now, more survivors have access to trauma-informed care, including those in the LGBTQI+ community and from rural areas. Additionally, I have spearheaded historic military justice reforms to better protect victims of crime in our military and ensure that prosecutorial decisions in cases of gender-based violence are fully independent from the chain of command.
To address the gun violence epidemic in America, I signed the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the most significant gun safety law in nearly 30 years. It helps prevent domestic abusers from purchasing guns, tackles gun trafficking, provides funding for implementation of red flag laws, expands background checks, and strengthens crisis intervention programs and youth mental health programs. I also formed the first-ever White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention and my Administration has taken more executive actions to stop the flow of illegal guns than any other Administration in history. This new office is coordinating the first centralized Federal response to mass shootings and surges in gun violence in order to help victims and communities address the economic, physical, and emotional effects of gun violence.
Additionally, my Administration is cracking down on hate-fueled violence. Early on, I signed into law the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act that includes the Khalid Jabara-Heather Heyer NO HATE Act. These legislative actions help government agencies track and prosecute hate-fueled acts of violence against people from marginalized groups and establish State-run hotlines through which victims can report hate crimes. For the first time in history, we made lynching a Federal hate crime through the Emmett Till Antilynching Act. We also hosted the first-of-its-kind United We Stand Summit—bringing together civic, faith, philanthropic, and business leaders to ensure that hate has no safe harbor in America.
I also signed a historic Executive Order to advance effective and accountable community policing and strengthen trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve. My Administration provided States billions of dollars to purchase body-worn cameras, reduce court backlogs, and support crime victims. We are investing in more crisis responders who are able to de-escalate situations and respond to non-violent crimes. In addition, we are hiring more Federal prosecutors so justice for victims is not delayed, recruiting more United States Marshals to apprehend violent fugitives, and investing in better technology and training to clear court backlogs and solve murders.
This National Crime Victims' Rights Week, as each of us asks, “How should I help?” let us recommit to doing all we can to prevent crime and violence, support victims and help them secure the justice and healing they deserve, and make our Nation safer and more secure for all Americans. For more information on the rights of crime victims, visit Crimevictims.gov.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 21 through April
27, 2024, as National Crime Victims' Rights Week. I call upon all Americans to observe this week by participating in events that raise awareness of victims' rights and services and by volunteering to serve and support victims in their time of need.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this nineteenth day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# National Volunteer Week, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
America's volunteers embody the core values that define our Nation: an optimism that is tested yet resolute; a courage that digs deep when we need it most; and an unshakeable faith in one another, our Nation, and the future we can build together. During National Volunteer Week, we celebrate the millions of selfless Americans who keep faith in all of us and give their time, service, and hearts to make sure no one is left behind.
I have often said that America is a good Nation because we are a good people—every day, our country's volunteers prove that to be true. They lead by the power of their example. From helping rebuild homes after devastating disasters to tutoring our youth and helping ensure orderly elections, volunteers strengthen our communities and improve the lives of people across our Nation and around the world. Through these extraordinary acts of service, volunteers also have the opportunity to engage with new communities and try new things—building professional networks and friendships, learning skills, and finding a sense of purpose. Volunteering is truly at the heart of our American spirit: working together to build a future of greater possibilities.
My Administration is proud to have put more volunteering opportunities within reach of Americans. More than one million Americans have served as AmeriCorps volunteers, donating their time to improve communities across the country. This includes the 140,000 older Americans who serve as AmeriCorps' senior volunteers. Together, AmeriCorps volunteers have stepped up in the face of national emergencies—from helping put shots in arms during the COVID-19 pandemic to serving as recovery coaches for those impacted by the opioid crisis and responding to natural disasters. My Administration is proud to have made a historic $1 billion investment in AmeriCorps through our American Rescue Plan so they could expand operations and strengthen their programs. Around the world, our Peace Corps volunteers work alongside the members of thousands of communities to improve people's lives by helping small-scale farmers succeed, teaching small business skills in classrooms, promoting health equity, and so much more.
During National Volunteer Week, we remember that even one act of service—big or small—can make a difference. Volunteers spread hope and, in the process, inspire so many to give back to their communities. I encourage everyone to look for ways to volunteer in their own communities, show up for one another, and step up for those in need. For more information, visit AmeriCorps.gov and peacecorps.gov/volunteer.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 21 through April 27, 2024, as National Volunteer Week. I call upon all Americans to observe this week by volunteering in service projects across the country and pledging to make service a part of their daily lives.

Proc. 10732

# Earth Day, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
More than 50 years ago today, some 20 million Americans came together across the country to demand that we prioritize our planet's well-being. They came from every walk of life and political background, and were united around a common vision: to protect the Earth and our natural treasures for future generations. Their actions that day ignited an environmental movement and proved that nothing is beyond our capacity if we do it together. Today, we carry on their legacy by building a greener, more sustainable planet and, with it, a healthier, more prosperous Nation.
This work has never been more urgent. Climate change is the existential crisis of our time; no one can deny its impacts and staggering costs anymore. We have seen historic floods from Vermont to Kentucky to California. Droughts and hurricanes are growing more frequent and intense. Wildfires are destroying entire communities and spreading harmful smoky haze for thousands of miles while temperatures keep reaching record highs. Season after season, I have met with families who have lost everything to major storms, wildfires, and other climate disasters, and I have stood with the brave first responders and firefighters who sacrifice so much to protect their neighbors. Deforestation, nature loss, toxic chemicals, and plastic pollution also continue to threaten our air, lands, and waters, endangering our health, other species, and ecosystems. Our actions matter, and together we can protect our planet and our futures.
I am proud that my Administration has made the biggest investment ever to fight climate change. Through the Inflation Reduction Act, we are building a clean energy economy that creates good-paying jobs and investing in
research and development here at home. We are building a cleaner, more resilient power grid; expanding solar, wind, nuclear, and geothermal power; and upgrading the transmission system to bring clean electricity to more communities. We are saving families hundreds of dollars per year on their electric bills by providing tax credits to invest in efficient electric heat pumps. We are providing thousands of dollars in tax credits to people who buy new or used electric cars. Additionally, we are supporting farmers and ranchers in the adoption of climate-smart practices like cover crops and rotational grazing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Meanwhile, our American Rescue Plan has also helped States and cities become more energy efficient and resilient to extreme weather, including helping people weatherize their homes, restoring wetlands to protect against storm surges and flooding, and opening cooling centers where people can stay safe from extreme heat. We have also made America's biggest investment in infrastructure in generations. As a result, we are expanding our transit and rail systems to reduce traffic and emissions, and we are building a national network of 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations.
When I think about climate change, I think about jobs—the good-paying union jobs that our legislation is creating nationwide in this clean energy revolution. Our historic investments across the clean energy economy are creating good jobs, apprenticeships, and training opportunities for thousands of workers—from manufacturers and electricians to construction workers and linemen. American workers are installing solar panels, servicing wind turbines, capping old oil wells, manufacturing electric vehicles, and more. We are making sure coal and power plant communities, which have powered our economy for decades, have access to these jobs—we will not leave them behind. At the same time, we launched the American Climate Corps, which will put more than 20,000 young Americans to work restoring our lands and waters, deploying clean energy technologies, and helping communities prepare for and rebuild from extreme weather.
We are also bringing clean air, clean water, and clean energy to those who have historically been left behind. Through our Justice40 Initiative, we set a historic goal to direct 40 percent of the overall benefits of Federal clean energy, clean transit, and other investments that fight climate change to communities that are overburdened by pollution and disadvantaged by underinvestment. We set the strongest-ever pollution standards for cars and trucks, which will reduce carbon emissions by more than 7 billion tons while also slashing emissions of other pollutants. We are also tackling pollution from fossil fuel power plants, which have denied many Americans the clean air and water they deserve. We are replacing every lead pipe in America so that everyone can turn on their faucet and drink clean water. We are working to clean up toxic waste sites and partnering with communities to get dangerous “forever chemicals” out of their water supplies.
Today, I am on track to conserve more lands and waters than any President in history—getting us closer to my Administration's historic goal of conserving at least 30 percent of our Nation's lands and waters by 2030. It is a part of our “America the Beautiful” Initiative that supports locally led conservation, protection, and restoration through partnerships with Tribal Nations, local communities, and private landowners. So far, I have protected over 41 million acres of our Nation's lands and waters—from establishing national monuments like Baaj Nwaavjo I'tah Kukveni on the outskirts of the Grand Canyon and Camp Hale high in the Colorado Rockies,
to strengthening protections for treasures like the Tongass National Forest and Bristol Bay in Alaska. These majestic places unite and inspire us and should be preserved for the ages. To restore and protect the health of our ocean, my Administration is advancing America's first-ever Ocean Climate Action Plan, accelerating offshore wind energy development, and working to designate new national marine sanctuaries in California and the Pacific Remote Islands.
Climate change is a global issue. Certainly no one nation can tackle the climate crisis alone; we have to work together. On my first day in office, I immediately rejoined the Paris Climate Accord, reclaiming American leadership in this critical work. We have rallied the international community to tackle vital climate challenges, including collaborating with over 150 nations to commit to slashing methane emissions and over 140 nations to commit to halting and reversing forest loss by 2030 as we find new ways to boost resilience, strengthen our economies, and sustain our planet. Last year, the United States galvanized other countries to agree for the first time to transition away from the fossil fuels that jeopardize the health of our people and planet. Through our Women in the Sustainable Economy Initiative, we are working to ensure that women around the world have access to good-paying jobs in sectors such as clean energy, fisheries, recycling, forest management, and environmental conservation, that are critical to our future. By pledging a historic $3 billion to the Green Climate Fund to help reduce emissions and boost climate resilience in developing countries, we are catalyzing further global action.
Last fall, we released the Fifth National Climate Assessment, our Government's preeminent report on the impacts, risks, and responses to climate change nationwide and a go-to resource on emerging climate solutions. Together—climate activists and business leaders; farmers, manufacturers, union workers, and Indigenous communities; courageous young people; and anyone concerned about the future we leave for our kids—we can make the changes needed to protect our planet. America has emerged from every crisis we have ever faced stronger than when we went in. We can do that now for the world. On Earth Day, I urge everyone to do their part in that fight.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 22, 2024, as Earth Day. Today, I encourage all Americans to reflect on the need to protect our precious planet; to heed the call to combat our climate and biodiversity crises while growing the economy; and to keep working for a healthier, safer, more equitable future for all.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this nineteenth day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

Proc. 10733

# National Small Business Week, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Small businesses are the engine of our economy and the heart and soul of our communities. They employ nearly half of all private sector workers and contribute to every industry. Getting them what they need to grow is one of the best investments our country can make. During National Small Business Week, we celebrate the grit and strength of every entrepreneur who has chased a dream and put in the hard work each day to see their business and our Nation thrive.
When I took office, the pandemic was raging, and our economy was reeling. Hundreds of thousands of small businesses had closed forever, and millions more hung on by a thread. Too many families faced the possibility of losing not only their life's work but also their hopes of leaving something behind for their kids. But we turned that around. My Administration reformed the landmark Paycheck Protection Program, which got quick help to thousands of small businesses so they could keep paying their workers. We delivered $450 billion in relief to help 6 million small businesses cover their bills and stay afloat. I signed the American Rescue Plan, which provided additional support to 100,000 restaurants and to 225,000 child care centers, which so many parents rely on to be able to work themselves.
Three years later, America is in the midst of a historic small business boom. Americans have filed a record 17 million new business applications—and every one of them is an act of hope. The share of Black-owned businesses has more than doubled between 2019 and 2022, and Latino business ownership is growing at the fastest pace in at least a decade, generating new jobs and new wealth in local communities. In all, our economy has added 15 million new jobs since I took office. Growth is strong, wages are rising, and inflation is down. We are witnessing a small business boom. Across the country, we are experiencing a great comeback story—and small businesses are playing a key part.
From day one, they have been at the heart of my plan to grow our economy from the middle out and bottom up. That is why—as my Bipartisan Infrastructure Law makes the biggest investment in our Nation's infrastructure in generations, rebuilding roads, bridges, ports, public transit, and more—we are relying on America's Main Street entrepreneurs to help us rebuild. We set a goal of awarding $37 billion in these investments to small businesses so they can benefit from these projects and create good-paying jobs. We are making sure every home and business in America has access to affordable, high-speed internet by the end of the decade so entrepreneurs everywhere can access more customers and have a fair shot. We passed the CHIPS and Science Act to expand semiconductor manufacturing and ensure industries of the future are Made in America, creating tens of thousands of jobs, strengthening supply chains, and supporting small suppliers and businesses across the country. As our Inflation Reduction Act makes the most significant investment in fighting climate change ever in the
world, it is creating new markets for small clean-energy companies. Altogether, my Investing in America Agenda has attracted $688 billion in private-sector investments from companies that are bringing jobs back to America where they belong, helping to rebuild our economy, our supply chains, and our small businesses.
To help small businesses grow, we are also expanding access to capital and to markets by using the power of the Federal Government as both a lender and customer. Mom and pop businesses with only a handful of employees often need small loans of $100,000 or less, but not all banks offer them. That is why the Small Business Administration (SBA) is expanding access to low-cost small-dollar loans and increasing the number of lenders that offer affordable guaranteed loans. The SBA finalized rules that will provide rural and minority-, women-, and veteran-owned small businesses with more affordable loan options by authorizing more non-traditional lenders, like Community Development Financial Institutions, to offer guaranteed loans. Because the Federal Government buys more goods and services than any entity in the world, we set a goal of increasing the share of Federal contracting dollars that must go to small disadvantaged businesses from less than 10 percent before I took office to 15 percent. Last year, we awarded a record-setting $76 billion to these businesses, helping level the playing field and close the racial wealth gap.
Meanwhile, we invested $10 billion in State-level small-business programs, which will catalyze tens of billions in private investments to expand access to capital for small businesses and entrepreneurs. Further, my Administration has invested nearly $70 million in the Women's Business Centers network, which is designed to promote and support women-owned businesses and can now be found in all 50 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.
Small businesses may only employ a few people instead of thousands, but together they make up 40 percent of our economy and 99.9 percent of all American businesses. They are the glue that helps hold our Nation together. In their dedication to their communities and in their courage, hope, sweat, and drive, small business owners embody the spirit of America and our boundless possibilities. This week, we recommit to making that future real and leaving no one behind.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 28 through May 4, 2024, as National Small Business Week. I call upon all Americans to recognize the contributions of small businesses to the American economy, continue supporting them, and honor the occasion with programs and activities that highlight these important businesses.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-sixth day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# Workers Memorial Day, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
A job is about more than a paycheck—it is about dignity and respect. Our Nation's workers built this country, and we need to have their backs. On the most basic level, that means every worker in this Nation deserves to be safe on the job. Too many still risk their lives or well-being in unsafe work conditions or dangerous roles. On Workers Memorial Day, we honor our fallen and injured workers and recommit to making sure every worker has the peace of mind of knowing that they are protected at work and can return home safe to their families every night.
I am proud to be the most pro-labor President in history, and from day one, my Administration has fought to make workplaces safer and fairer. Our American Rescue Plan invested $200 million into keeping workers safe during the pandemic and guaranteeing that workers had sick leave available if they got COVID-19. We also used the full power of the Defense Production Act to deliver personal protective equipment to workers who needed it. We vaccinated 230 million Americans so they could return to offices, stores, factory floors, and more without worrying about their health.
Strong unions are at the core of all of this work. Every major law that protects workers' safety passed because unions fought for it. That is why, as my Administration makes the biggest investment in our Nation's infrastructure in generations, we are also incentivizing companies to hire union workers, pay prevailing wages, and support pre-apprenticeships and Registered Apprenticeships that help workers learn how to safely do the job. At the same time, my Administration finalized a rule requiring Project Labor Agreements for most large-scale Federal construction projects, helping ensure these projects are completed safely, efficiently, and on time.
I am proud of my work standing up for unions, from being the first sitting President to walk a picket line to nominating union advocates to the National Labor Relations Board, which has helped protect the right to organize. I also signed Executive Orders restoring and expanding collective bargaining rights for the Federal workforce, and I re-established labor-management forums at Federal agencies to ensure Federal workers on the job are heard. I signed the Butch Lewis Act, protecting the pensions that millions of Americans worked their whole lives for. I have expanded coverage through the Affordable Care Act and slashed prescription drug prices, making health care more affordable for millions of working families.
At the same time, the Department of Labor has also made it easier for whistleblowers to report unsafe working conditions, regardless of their immigration status, and are hiring and training hundreds of workplace inspectors to ensure employers are meeting health and safety requirements. Last year, my Administration issued the first-ever heat Hazard Alert to protect millions of farm, construction, and other workers who spend their days outside in increasingly extreme heat. We also finalized a new rule to limit miners' exposure to toxic silica dust—protecting more than 250,000 from its harmful effects. The Department of Labor has also ramped up the enforcement of heat-safety rules, conducting more than 4,000 heat inspections
in the past 2 years. They have also completed over 65,000 workplace safety and health inspections since 2022, helping keep workers in high-risk industries safe. Further, my Administration published a rule that allows workers to choose a representative to accompany an Occupational Safety and Health Administration official during a workplace inspection, ensuring workers are being heard. The Department of Labor is working to develop a national standard to protect indoor and outdoor workers from extreme heat that can be hazardous to their health.
We are also fighting for the courageous first responders who routinely run toward danger to protect the rest of us. The Department of Labor proposed a rule that would strengthen safety standards for emergency responder equipment, training, and vehicle operations for the first time in more than 40 years. These new standards would transform many current industry best practices to requirements and could prevent thousands of injuries for more than one million brave first responders across the country. I was also proud to sign the Federal Firefighters Fairness Act, which boosted pay for over 10,000 Federal firefighters to help recruit more to the job, because I know that nothing keeps firefighters safe like more firefighters. We are also committed to protecting firefighters from the harmful effects of toxic “forever chemicals”, which are still too often found in firefighting equipment and fire suppression agents. I signed legislation extending the Public Safety Officers' Benefits Program to firefighters who are permanently disabled and to families of firefighters who die after experiencing trauma like PTSD—it will not bring their loved ones back, but we owe them.
Today, our Nation is in the midst of a great comeback. Our economy is growing, wages are rising, and inflation is down. We have created a record 15 million jobs. On Workers Memorial Day, we recommit to making sure that every worker in this country is safe on the job. We honor those who lost their lives or have been injured on the job; we stand by their families; and we stand with the labor unions that are fighting to guarantee every worker safety, dignity, and respect.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 28, 2024, as Workers Memorial Day. I call upon all Americans to observe this day with appropriate service, community, and education programs and ceremonies in memory of those killed or injured due to unsafe working conditions.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-sixth day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
This month, we celebrate the Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander (AA and NHPI) communities, whose ingenuity, grit, and perseverance have pushed our great American experiment forward.
From Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders whose ancestors have called their lands home for hundreds of years to Asian immigrants who have newly arrived and those whose families have been here for generations—AA and NHPI heritage has long been a part of the history of our great country and a defining force in the soul of our Nation. As artists and journalists, doctors and engineers, business and community leaders, and so much more, AA and NHPI peoples have shaped the very fabric of our Nation and opened up new possibilities for all of us. I am proud that they serve at the highest levels of my Administration, including Vice President Kamala Harris, Ambassador Katherine Tai, Acting Secretary of Labor Julie Su, and Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy Arati Prabhakar, who make this country a better place each and every day. This year, we are also celebrating the 25th anniversary of the White House Initiative and President's Advisory Commission on Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders, who work across government to advance equity, opportunity, and justice for AA and NHPI communities.
I have always believed that diversity is our Nation's greatest strength. That is why I launched the first-ever National Strategy to Advance Equity, Justice, and Opportunity for AA and NHPI Communities. This strategy works to harness the full potential of these communities—from combating anti-Asian hate to making government services accessible in more languages. To ensure the legacies of AA and NHPI peoples are properly honored in the story of America, I signed historic legislation that will bring us closer to a National Museum of Asian Pacific American History and Culture. I also issued a Presidential Memorandum to consider expanding protections for the Pacific Remote Islands to conserve this unique area's significant natural and cultural resources and honor the traditional practices and ancestral pathways of Pacific Island voyagers, and I signed the Amache National Historic Site Act to establish a memorial honoring the 10,000 Japanese Americans who were unjustly incarcerated there during World War II. Throughout my time in office, the First Lady and I have hosted celebrations at the White House that highlight the incredible diversity of AA and NHPI communities, like Diwali and the first-ever White House Lunar New Year celebration. This year, to ensure that the full diversity of AA and NHPI communities is seen and valued as new policy is being made, we updated the Federal Government's standards for collecting data on race and ethnicity for the first time in over 25 years.
Meanwhile, we are creating new opportunities for AA and NHPI communities by building an economy that works for everyone, including investing in AA and NHPI small businesses and entrepreneurs. Since I took office, the Small Business Administration provided over $22 billion in loans to
AA and NHPI entrepreneurs. We have seen the results: During my Administration, we achieved the highest Asian American employment and entrepreneurship rates in over a decade.
Last year, the First Lady and I witnessed the absolute courage of the Native Hawaiian people and Hawaii's Asian American and Pacific Islander communities when we visited Maui in the wake of the devastating fires. The destruction upended so many lives, and yet the community showed up ready to help rebuild stronger than before. My Administration has their backs—we are committed to making sure Maui has everything the Federal Government can offer to heal and build back better and as fast as possible. Throughout these efforts, we remain focused on rebuilding the way the people of Maui want to build by respecting sacred lands, cultures, and traditions.
Racism, harassment, and hate crimes against people of AA and NHPI heritage also persist—a tragic reminder that hate never goes away; it only hides. Hate must have no safe harbor in America—that is why I signed the bipartisan COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, which makes it easier for Americans to report hate crimes, and I also hosted the first-ever White House summit against hate-fueled violence. We are also working to address the scourge of gun violence, which takes the lives of too many AA and NHPI loved ones. I signed the most significant gun safety law in nearly 30 years. My Administration has taken actions to expand background checks and fund efforts to strengthen red flag laws to keep Americans out of harm's way. There is still so much to do, and I continue to urge the Congress to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.
Our Nation was founded on the idea that we are all created equal and deserve to be treated equally throughout our lives. We have never fully realized this promise, but we have never fully walked away from it either. As we celebrate the historic accomplishments of AA and NHPIs across our Nation, we promise we will never stop working to form a more perfect Union.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2024 as Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander Heritage Month. I call upon all Americans to learn more about the histories of the AA and NHPI community and to observe this month with appropriate programs and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# Jewish American Heritage Month, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
For centuries, the perseverance, hope, and unshakeable faith of the Jewish people have inspired people around the world. During Jewish American Heritage Month, we celebrate the immeasurable impact of Jewish values, contributions, and culture on our Nation's character and recommit to realizing the promise of America for all Jewish Americans.
In 1654, a small band of 23 Jewish refugees fled persecution abroad and sailed into the port of modern-day New York City. They fought for religious freedom, helping define one of the bedrock principles upon which our Nation was built. Jewish American culture has been inextricably woven into the fabric of our country. Jewish American suffragists, activists, and leaders marched for civil rights, women's rights, and voting rights. Jewish American scientists, doctors, and engineers have made scientific breakthroughs that define America as a land of possibilities. They have served our Nation in uniform, on the Nation's highest courts, and at the highest levels of my Administration. As public servants, artists, entertainers, journalists, and poets, they have helped write the story of America, making it—as Emma Lazarus' poem on the Statue of Liberty states—a home for the “huddled masses yearning to breathe free.”
As we celebrate the Jewish American community's contributions this month, we also honor their resilience in the face of a long and painful history of persecution. Hamas' brutal terrorist attack on October 7th against Israel marked the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust, resurfacing, including here in the United States, painful scars from millennia of antisemitism and genocide of Jewish people. Jews across the country and around the world are still coping with the trauma and horror of that day and the months since. Our hearts are with all the victims, survivors, families, and friends whose loved ones were killed, wounded, displaced, or taken hostage—including women and girls whom Hamas has subjected to appalling acts of rape and sexual violence.
As I said after Hamas' terror attack, my commitment to the safety of the Jewish people, the security of Israel, and its right to exist as an independent Jewish state is ironclad. The recent attack by Iran, firing a barrage of hundreds of missiles and drones at Israel, reminds us of the existential threats that Israel faces by adversaries that want nothing less than to wipe it off the map. Together with our allies and partners, the United States defended Israel, and we helped defeat this attack.
At the same time, my Administration is working around the clock to free the hostages who have been held by Hamas for over half a year; as I have said to their families, we will not rest until we bring them home. We are also leading international efforts to deliver urgently needed humanitarian aid to Gaza and an immediate ceasefire as part of a deal that releases hostages and lays the groundwork for an enduring two-state solution.
Here at home, too many Jews live with deep pain and fear from the ferocious surge of antisemitism—in our communities; at schools, places of worship, and colleges; and across social media. These acts are despicable and echo the worst chapters of human history. They remind us that hate never goes away—it only hides until it is given oxygen. It is our shared moral responsibility to forcefully stand up to antisemitism and to make clear that hate can have no safe harbor in America.
That is why I released the first-ever United States National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism and clarified the civil rights protections for Jews under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In addition, the Department of Education has launched investigations into antisemitism on college campuses, the Department of Justice is investigating and prosecuting hate crimes, and the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are focused on enhancing security in Jewish communities. We also secured the largest increase in funding ever for the physical security of nonprofits like synagogues, Jewish Community Centers, and Jewish schools. I appointed Deborah Lipstadt, a Holocaust expert, as the first-ever Ambassador-level Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Antisemitism. Together, we are sending the message that, in America, evil will not win. Hate will not prevail. The venom and violence of antisemitism will not be the story of our time.
This Jewish American Heritage Month, we honor Jewish Americans, who have never given up on the promise of our Nation. We celebrate the contributions, culture, and values that they have passed down from generation to generation and that have shaped who we are as Americans. We remember that the power lies within each of us to rise together against hate, to see each other as fellow human beings, and to ensure that the Jewish community is afforded the safety, security, and dignity they deserve as they continue to shine their light in America and around the world.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2024 as Jewish American Heritage Month. I call upon all Americans to learn more about the heritage and contributions of Jewish Americans and to observe this month with appropriate programs, activities, and ceremonies.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# National Building Safety Month, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
During National Building Safety Month, we thank the engineers, construction workers, trades unions, building inspectors, and other building professionals, who make our buildings stronger, more sustainable, and more resilient.
Building codes help to keep us all safe at home, at work, and in our communities. But two in three communities have not yet adopted the latest building codes, leaving them more vulnerable to fires, floods, and storms, which pose a growing threat in the face of climate change. There is so much we can do to change that by investing in housing, infrastructure, and code enforcement to prevent accidents and protect our families.
Today, a record 1.7 million new housing units are under construction nationwide, and my Budget has a plan to build 2 million more affordable homes, boosting supply and bringing down costs for families. My Administration is making the most significant investment in generations in our Nation's infrastructure while working to remove poisonous lead pipes from every home and school in America so that every child can turn on the faucet and drink clean water. We are modernizing our power grid and investing in energy-efficient buildings and homes so that when disasters hit, the lights stay on. We are weatherizing homes so that families are safe and comfortable inside during extreme heat or cold, storms, and other extreme weather and pay less for utilities. For all of these Federal projects, we are making sure that construction materials are safe, environmentally friendly, high quality, and made in America.
I am calling on the Congress to pass legislation that would provide tax credits for first-time homebuyers and fortify housing to be safe from extreme weather and climate change and built to last.
At the same time, we are making the most significant investment in fighting climate change in history—providing tax credits so folks can make their homes more energy efficient and affordable while also ensuring that the clean energy industries of the future are being built here at home. We are working to dedicate 40 percent of the overall benefits of certain Federal investments in our sustainable housing, clean energy, and building safety projects to disadvantaged communities that have borne the brunt of economic disinvestment for too long so they can be stronger and more resilient in the face of a changing climate.
To make sure all of these new projects are safe, my Administration launched the National Initiative to Advance Building Codes and is investing over $1 billion to help thousands of communities adopt modern building codes to strengthen their housing and communities from risk. The Department of Housing and Urban Development is working to ensure federally funded housing is safe from flooding through safer flood standards. The Federal Emergency Management Agency is helping communities devastated by floods, fires, tornadoes, and hurricanes to rebuild more safely by
incentivizing the adoption of modern building codes. For every dollar invested in sturdier new buildings that meet modern codes, it saves 11 times that in avoided disaster repair and recovery costs down the line.
Every American has a part to play in keeping their homes safe and secure and building a more resilient Nation. You can start by changing the batteries in your smoke alarms regularly and ensuring you have backup power for your critical appliances. Get rid of mold and pests to avoid health issues. If wildfires are a concern where you live, clear leaves and debris from around your community and home to reduce the risk of fires. If you plan to renovate, make sure you follow local home improvement requirements or get expert advice and quality work from a professional contractor who honors those codes.
Today, America is in the midst of a great national comeback. Our economy is strong, and we are building a future of possibilities, investing in our infrastructure, our communities, and our people. That is what America is all about. This month, we recommit to the work of keeping our Nation's buildings safe and built to last for generations to come.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2024 as National Building Safety Month. I encourage citizens, government agencies, businesses, nonprofits, and other interested groups to join in activities that raise awareness about building safety. I also call on all Americans to learn more about how they can contribute to building safety at home, at work, and in their communities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# National Foster Care Month, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
The nearly 370,000 children in foster care deserve to grow up in safe and loving homes that help them reach their full potential. During National Foster Care Month, we share our gratitude for the foster parents who show foster youth unconditional love and the biological parents who work hard to reunite with their children despite difficult circumstances. We thank all the dedicated staff and volunteers who help foster youth find temporary and permanent homes. We commend the immeasurable courage of kids in foster care, who truly represent the best of our American spirit.
No young person should have to face the challenges that foster youth endure. The trauma they experience, including being separated from their biological families at a young age, can leave lasting emotional, mental, and
physical scars that take a toll on their adult lives. Too often, it is children of color who bear the brunt of this toll: One in nine Black children and one in seven Native American children have been in foster care. Our Nation has a moral responsibility to ensure all our children are taken care of, especially our foster youth.
That begins with giving families the support and resources they need to provide for their children. The Child Tax Credit I championed during the pandemic cut taxes for millions and cut child poverty in half—the lowest rate ever. It gave families some breathing room, making sure they had the funds they needed to provide for their children. Ensuring families have access to support and resources is so important, especially because poverty can lead to unnecessary interventions that remove children from their homes. My Administration has also invested hundreds of millions of dollars in expanding and improving neglect prevention and child protective services.
At the same time, we are prioritizing helping the children and youth already in the foster care system find supportive and caring temporary and permanent homes. Relative and kinship caregivers take care of one-third of all children in the foster care system. That is why I have called to make adoption and legal guardianship more affordable for those caregivers by making the adoption tax credit fully refundable and extending it to legal guardians—including grandparents, aunts, uncles, and other relatives. For biological parents who want to safely reunite with their children, we are working to ensure that they have access to legal representation, which is critical for navigating the child welfare system.
To ensure every capable, loving family has the opportunity to foster, I signed an Executive Order that removed barriers making it harder for LGBTQI+ families to foster and adopt. We are also making sure that the 30 percent of all foster youth who identify as LGBTQI+ are placed in environments that love and support them for who they are.
There is still so much to do to ensure our foster youth are set up for success in their adult lives. That is why I proposed providing $9 billion to establish a housing voucher program for all 20,000 youths aging out of foster care every year, giving them the security to begin adulthood. I have also called for over $2 billion to help youth aging out of foster care find a job, enroll in and afford higher education, obtain basic necessities, and access preventative health care.
Throughout my life, I have had the honor of meeting incredible young people who grew up in foster care with wonderful foster parents, who loved them unconditionally. This month, we affirm to foster youth across America that we have their backs, and we recommit to supporting both foster and biological parents in creating safe and loving homes.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2024 as National Foster Care Month. I call upon all Americans to observe this month by reaching out in their neighborhoods and communities to the children and youth in foster care and their families, to those at risk of entering foster care, and to kin families and other caregivers.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

Proc. 10739

# National Mental Health Awareness Month, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
During National Mental Health Awareness Month, we recognize the bravery and resilience of the tens of millions of Americans living with mental health conditions, and we show our gratitude for the dedicated mental health professionals and devoted loved ones who stand by them every step of the way. Mental health care is health care, and my Administration will ensure that every American has the care they need to thrive—we have your back.
Being able to get health care when you need it is essential to living a full, productive, and healthy life—that goes for mental health care too. Mental health care can help people find joy and purpose; ensuring they have access to the care they need is about dignity. But for millions of Americans, mental health care is out of reach. In 2020, less than half of all adults with a mental illness diagnosis received care for it. It is worse for kids—nearly 70 percent of children who need mental health care cannot get it. Imagine being a parent searching for a way to help their child but never finding it, no matter how hard they look. This is an all-too-common experience as many Americans face mental health challenges: Two in five adults report experiencing anxiety or depression, and suicide is a leading cause of death among young people. We know that mental health treatment works, but we need to make it more accessible and affordable for all Americans.
That is why, as President, I have taken steps to dramatically expand access to mental health care in America. I signed the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act—the largest investment in youth mental health ever, and we are investing $1 billion of that funding to help schools across the country hire and train new mental health counselors. We also added more than 140 Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics across the Nation, which serve everyone regardless of their ability to pay and provide a range of services, including 24-hour crisis support. We launched 988, the Nationwide Suicide and Crisis Lifeline, which anyone can call, text, or chat to be connected to a trained crisis counselor. Further, my Administration developed new resources to support the mental health and resilience of frontline workers; expanded Medicare coverage to include additional substance use disorder services and expand mental health services; made it easier for schools to leverage Medicaid to deliver mental health care to millions of children and youth; and invested in mental health programs that help service members and veterans as well as their families, caregivers, and survivors.
We are also working to ensure full mental health parity so that mental health care is covered the same as physical health care. We have proposed requiring health insurance plans to identify the gaps in the mental health care they provide, and if they find they are not covering mental health care on par with physical health care, to make changes to fix it. Finally, we are taking action to ensure that State and local government employees have the same mental health parity protections as millions of other Americans who get health insurance from their jobs, which is why we are working to close loopholes so these dedicated public servants can more easily access the mental health care they need with fewer limits on care and lower co-pays.
At the same time, my Administration is working to end the opioid and overdose epidemic by cracking down on fentanyl trafficking and increasing public health efforts to save lives. This month, we celebrate the absolute courage of the Americans in recovery and reaffirm our commitment to care for those suffering.
My Administration will also keep fighting to end the youth mental health crisis—and that means addressing social media's contributions to it. I continue to call on the Congress to restrict the personal data that companies collect, ban advertising that targets minors, and take action to ensure that social media platforms prioritize the health and safety of our Nation's children.
Each one of us has a role to play in changing the narrative and ending the stigmatization of mental health issues. We can start by showing compassion so everyone feels free to ask for help and learning the warning signs of emotional distress and suicide. If you are facing a crisis, dial 988 to reach the National Suicide and Crisis Lifeline. If you are a new or expecting mother, you can call 1-833-TLC-MAMA for confidential advice on mental health from a professional. If you are feeling overwhelmed or just need someone to talk to, ask your health care provider, contact the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's National Helpline at 1-800-662-HELP, or visit FindSupport.gov. To anyone struggling with mental health, know that you are not alone. As Americans, we have a duty of care to reach out to one another and leave no one behind. We are all in this together.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2024 as National Mental Health Awareness Month. I call upon citizens, government agencies, private businesses, nonprofit organizations, and other groups to join in activities and take action to strengthen the mental health of our communities and our Nation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# National Physical Fitness and Sports Month, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Sports and physical fitness reflect the best of the American spirit: hard work, collaboration, and big dreams. Some of my favorite memories and most enduring values come from the time I spent playing football as a kid. But you do not have to compete in organized sports to benefit from physical activity—being active in any way helps to improve your health, clear your mind, and make our Nation stronger. During National Physical Fitness and Sports Month, we commit to doing more to help give every American the opportunity to exercise and live a healthy life.
Whether doing yard work, walking to the store, going on a run with a friend, or playing basketball in the park, exercise makes us healthier and stronger. Exercise lowers the risk of heart disease, diabetes, stroke, certain cancers, and more; and it increases quality of life. It boosts mental health, easing depression and anxiety while improving memory and sleep. It helps young people build lasting friendships—teaching key lessons about discipline, teamwork, and winning and losing and preparing them to be leaders.
But not everyone has that same chance. Today, less than half of all Americans live within a half-mile of a park. Tens of millions of children do not have access to a playground within a 10-minute walk of their home. Cash-strapped schools are too often cutting physical education programs. Youth sports leagues can be expensive, leaving too many kids with few options. The United States of America can do better.
My Administration has kept that in mind from the start. We are making the biggest investment in infrastructure in generations, including $800 million to make sidewalks and crosswalks across the Nation safer for people to walk, run, bike, and skate. I signed the biggest investment in fighting climate change ever—protecting and restoring our great outdoors, which offer so many cherished recreational activities. We are providing over $300 million to help cities and towns build new parks and expand opportunities for outdoor recreation. To make National Parks more accessible to Americans, I signed legislation that made National Park entry free for our veterans and members of our Gold Star Families. We are also working to repair the bridges and roads that lead to our National Parks so more families can visit these natural treasures.
At the same time, I convened the first White House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health in a half-century, releasing a national strategy to end hunger and, among other things, make it easier for Americans to exercise. Since then, 14 major sports leagues and players associations have signed agreements with my Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition to expand access to physical activity, integrate messaging and education about nutrition, and promote healthy lifestyles to the millions of people who engage with their programs every year. My Administration galvanized nearly $10 billion from companies, non-profits, and other stakeholders to meet that goal—helping with everything from making youth sports more affordable to
taking children on trips to national parks. Meanwhile, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is working with local governments, schools, and community organizations to get 27 million Americans more active by 2027 by working with communities to implement evidence-based strategies for increasing physical activity across various sectors and settings. The Department of Health and Human Services' “Move Your Way” campaign launched a website with a tool that helps you build an exercise plan—go to health.gov/moveyourway.
We can all come together, feel better, and live longer if we stay active, exercise, and keep moving. It makes us healthier, and that is good for our families, our economy, and our Nation. This month, I encourage all Americans to do more—walk to the store, join a local sports team, sign up for a class or a race, and get out and enjoy the natural wonders of America. I will keep working to make sure everyone has the same fair shot to do so.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2024 as National Physical Fitness and Sports Month. I call upon the people of the United States to make daily physical activity a priority, to support efforts to increase access to sports opportunities in their communities, and to pursue physical fitness as an essential part of healthy living.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# Older Americans Month, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Older Americans have worked their whole lives to achieve the American Dream for their families and communities, making our Nation stronger and building a future of possibilities for new generations. This month, we celebrate their immense contributions to our country and stand firm in our efforts to ensure that every American can age with the dignity and financial security that they deserve.
Sixty years ago, a third of older Americans still lived in poverty, and close to half had no health insurance. Over the years, Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid helped to change that. Today, they are lifelines for tens of millions of Americans and proof of what government can do to transform lives for the better. I will always fight to protect and strengthen these programs. Folks have paid into Social Security and Medicare from their very first paychecks; the benefits of these programs belong to the American people. It is a sacred trust that people rely on. That is why I have proposed strengthening Social Security—not cutting it as others have suggested—by
asking the highest-income Americans to pay their fair share. My new Budget would also extend the life of the Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund indefinitely to protect the crucial health insurance that nearly 67 million Americans today rely on. At the same time, we are cracking down on so-called junk fees on retirement savings to ensure financial advisors give advice that is in your best interest rather than theirs, protecting the savings you have worked for your whole life.
Across the board, we are also working to cut the cost of health insurance and prescription drugs to give folks a little more breathing room. After years of others trying, we finally beat Big Pharma, giving Medicare the power to negotiate lower drug prices as the Department of Veterans Affairs has done for years. Our Inflation Reduction Act also caps the cost of insulin for people on Medicare at $35 per month, down from as much as $400 per month. Next year, it will cap out-of-pocket prescription drug costs for seniors on Medicare at $2,000 per year, even for expensive drugs that cost many times that. We have also expanded the range of services that people on Medicare have access to, including dental, mental health, and nutritional health services. Additionally, following an Executive Order I signed, hearing aids are now available over the counter, so millions of people with hearing loss can now buy them at a store or online without a prescription, saving up to $3,000 per pair.
Folks who have spent their whole lives building a community deserve to live, work, and participate in that community as long as they would like. That is why my Administration is also making historic investments in home care. The American Rescue Plan delivered $37 billion to help States strengthen their Medicaid home care programs by recruiting, training, and paying more home care workers and providing counseling, training, and support to family caregivers. Last year, I signed the Executive Order on Increasing Access to High-Quality Care and Supporting Caregivers, the most comprehensive set of executive actions in history for improving care for hardworking families. My new Budget would significantly expand Medicaid home care services to reduce the long waiting list and empower more folks to continue full lives in their communities. We made sure home care workers are getting a bigger share of Medicaid payments and nursing homes have enough staff to guarantee every resident the safe, healthy, caring environment they deserve. Further, we're making groundbreaking investments in the fight to end cancer and other deadly diseases as we know it, reminding us that our country can do big things when we work together.
There is still so much we can do to support our seniors. I have also called to strengthen the Earned Income Tax Credit for low-paid workers who are not raising children in their homes—saving Americans, including our Nation's older workers, an average of $800 on their taxes. My new Budget requests funding to extend my Administration's Affordable Connectivity Program, which has made internet more affordable for 4 million seniors.
Older Americans are the backbone of our Nation. They have built the foundation that we all stand upon today, guided by the core values that define America—freedom, equality, decency, and opportunity. Their work has helped prove that our Nation can do big things when we come together. Now, it is up to all of us to build a future on those same values—a future
where we defend democracy instead of diminish it, safeguard our freedoms, invest in communities that have too often been left behind, and deliver for older Americans while ensuring the people they love will be taken care of for generations to come.
This month, we celebrate older Americans' contributions by recommitting to those ideals and defending everyone's right to live full lives with dignity and respect. We will always have their backs.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2024 as Older Americans Month. This month and beyond, I call upon all Americans to celebrate older adults for their contributions, support their independence, and recognize their unparalleled value to our Nation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# Law Day, U.S.A., 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Over two centuries ago, our Founding Fathers created the United States of America based on an idea: We are all created equal and deserve to be treated equally throughout our lives. Ours would be a government by and for the people, enshrining in our Constitution, over time, the right to vote and to have that vote counted—the threshold of our liberty and democracy. On Law Day, we recommit to protecting this Constitutional right. We reflect on the enduring power of “We the People.” We rededicate ourselves to the ongoing pursuit of perfecting our Union.
Right now, we face a rare moment in the history of our Union: Freedom is under attack at home and abroad, at the very same time. Overseas, Russia is continuing its brutal assault against Ukraine's sovereignty, attempting to sow chaos throughout Europe and beyond. Here at home, our democracy is facing threats from waves of States that have proposed dozens of anti-voting laws to suppress the will of the people—reflecting the same dark motivations of the violent mob that stormed the Capitol 3 years ago in an effort to overturn a free and fair election.
Simply put: We are in a battle for the soul of our Nation—between those who want to pull America back to the past and those who want to move America into the future.
I am determined to move our Nation forward to build a future based on equality, decency, and dignity. In this country, that effort begins and ends with the ballot box. That is why I signed an Executive Order that promotes
access to voting—from making vote.gov available in 12 languages to providing voter registration services at naturalization ceremonies for our Nation's newest citizens. I also signed into law the Electoral Count Reform Act, which establishes clear guidelines for certifying and counting electoral votes so no mob can again believe that, through violence, it can suppress the will of the people. The Department of Justice has doubled its voting rights staff, increasing their capacity to hold people accountable for voter suppression. Further, the Department is promoting equal access to justice to help every American have access to quality legal aid. I continue to call on the Congress to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and the Freedom to Vote Act. Passing these laws would mean the Department can take action against discriminatory voting laws before they go into effect. It is critical to fully secure the right to vote in every State.
We also have to make sure every voice in America has an opportunity to be heard because diversity is our Nation's greatest strength. That is why I signed the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act into law, which helps State and local law enforcement better track and identify hate crimes. My Administration also convened the first-ever White House summit on combating hate-fueled violence, working with community leaders across the country to ensure hate has no safe harbor in America.
At the same time, we are committed to defending freedom around the world. The United States has brought together a coalition of more than 50 nations to support the brave people of Ukraine as they defend themselves and their sovereignty against Russia's vicious onslaught. We unified NATO—the greatest military alliance in the history of the world—and have continued to defend liberty, democracy, and the rule of law. Together, we have made it clear that the United States stands up for freedom. We stand strong with our allies. We bow down to no one—certainly not Vladimir Putin.
America can and should be a Nation that defends democracy, protects our rights and freedoms, and pioneers a future of possibilities for all Americans. History and common sense show us that this can only come to pass in a democracy, and we must be its keepers. Democracy begins with and will be preserved by “We the People,” in habits of the heart and in our character; in optimism that is tested yet endures; in courage that digs deep when we need it; and in the willingness to see each other not as enemies but as fellow Americans. This Law Day, U.S.A., may we recommit to protecting every American's right to vote as we build a Union that is free and fair, just and strong, and noble and whole.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, in accordance with Public Law 87-20, as amended, do hereby proclaim May 1, 2024, as Law Day, U.S.A. I call upon all Americans to acknowledge the importance of our Nation's legal and judicial systems with appropriate ceremonies and activities and to display the flag of the United States in support of this national observance.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# Loyalty Day, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
America is home to people from every place on Earth, some whose ancestors have been here for thousands of years and others who have only just arrived. We all came from somewhere, but we are all American—loyal not to a person or a place but to an idea: We are all created equal and deserve to be treated equally throughout our lives. This idea is our Nation's North Star. While we have never fully lived up to it, we have never stopped pursuing it. This Loyalty Day, we promise to always keep fighting for a more perfect Union.
Our Nation's North Star guided us through historic challenges to Nation-defining triumphs. Through abolition, the Civil War, women's suffrage, the Great Depression, World Wars, and the Civil Rights Movement, the idea of America animated our many movements and gave us hope for a better future. Today, that light—that promise—still shines brightly as we build an America that is more prosperous, free, and just.
Now more than ever, we must stay loyal to our North Star and the founding values that are the bedrock of this Nation. In the face of forces that want to pull America back into the past, we must honor our Constitution and uphold the rule of law. We must respect free and fair elections and honor the will of the people. We must reject violence as a political tool and stamp out hate, giving it no safe harbor in America. We must open the doors of opportunity wider for everyone and remember that diversity is our greatest strength. We must respect the dignity and integrity of our service members, who put their lives on the line for our flag. We must believe in honesty, decency, and respect for others as well as patriotism, justice for all, and possibilities.
Today, we also recognize the men and women across the country who have protected and defended our Nation. We owe a debt of gratitude to our brave service members and veterans along with their families, caregivers, and survivors, who have sacrificed so much to defend our democracy around the globe. We thank all the courageous first responders who protect our communities, the diplomats who support and protect American citizens abroad, and all the hardworking Americans who are the engines of our economy and strengthen our Nation.
This Loyalty Day, we recognize that nothing about our democracy is guaranteed—we must defend it, protect it, and stand up for it. Our democracy began and will be preserved in “We the People,” in the habits of our hearts, and in our character—in an optimism that is tested yet endures, a courage that digs deep when we need it, and an empathy that fuels our hearts and inspires all of us to see each other not as enemies but as fellow Americans.
To celebrate our shared American spirit and the sacrifices so many of our fellow citizens have made, the Congress, by Public Law 85-529, as amended, has designated the first day of May each year as Loyalty Day.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim May 1, 2024, as Loyalty Day. This Loyalty Day, I call upon the people of the United States to join in this national observance, display the American Flag, and pledge allegiance to our Republic for which it stands.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

Proc. 10744

# National Day of Prayer, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
On this National Day of Prayer, we recognize the power of prayer to strengthen our spirits, draw us together, and create hope for a better tomorrow.
The right to practice our faiths freely and openly is enshrined in the Constitution and remains at the core of our American spirit. For centuries, Americans of every religion and background have come together to lift up one another and our Nation in prayer. Throughout America's history, faith and prayer have helped fuel some of the greatest moral missions of our time—from the abolition of slavery to the fight for voting rights and the Civil Rights Movement. Many of our Nation's greatest leaders have been motivated by faith to push all of us toward a more perfect Union and to bend the arc of the moral universe toward justice.
Prayer is also deeply personal: For the First Lady and me, and so many across this Nation, prayer has helped us find solace during tough times and stay grounded in good ones. Prayer has helped the bravest among us—including our Nation's service members and their caregivers, survivors, and families—summon the courage to make great sacrifices for our democracy. It has guided the hands of medical professionals, who heal our loved ones, and steeled the nerves of our first responders, who put everything on the line to keep the rest of us safe. We will never know the full impact of prayer on our Nation or the world, but we remain confident that it makes a profound difference each and every day.
Scripture tells us to rejoice in hope, be patient in tribulation, and be constant in prayer. This year, my prayer for our Nation is that we keep faith that our best days are ahead of us and continue to believe in honesty, decency, dignity, and respect. May we see each other not as enemies but as fellow human beings, each made in the image of God and each precious in His sight. May we leave no one behind, give everyone a fair shot, and give hate no safe harbor. May we remember that nothing is beyond our capacity if we act together.
The Congress, by Public Law 100-307, as amended, has called on the President to issue each year a proclamation designating the first Thursday in May as a “National Day of Prayer.”
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2, 2024, as a National Day of Prayer. I call upon the citizens of our Nation to give thanks, in accordance with their own faith and conscience, for our many freedoms and blessings, and I invite all people of faith to join me in asking for God's continued guidance, mercy, and protection.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

Proc. 10745

# Boundary Enlargement of the Berryessa Snow MountainNational MonumentBy the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Through Proclamation 9298 of July 10, 2015, President Obama established the Berryessa Snow Mountain National Monument (monument) to protect an array of spectacular historic, cultural, geologic, and ecological resources in the heart of northern California's Inner Coast Range. Straddling the eastern edge of the monument boundary, Molok Luyuk—which means “Condor Ridge” in the language of the Patwin people—is a striking 11-mile north-to-south ridgeline that is sacred to the Patwin people and contains a mosaic of historic objects and rare natural communities supported by the unique geologic and hydrologic features of the area. The ridgeline, also known as Walker Ridge, is flanked by chaparral-covered canyons, serpentinite outcroppings, oak and cypress woodlands, and spring-fed meadows. Lands within the Molok Luyuk area show evidence of occupation by Indigenous peoples for more than 10,000 years. The historical significance of Molok Luyuk contributes to its cultural and spiritual significance to the Patwin people, and many other Indigenous peoples from northern California also have ties to the area, including the Pomo, Lake Miwok, Yuki, and Nomlaki. While much of the western slope of the ridge was designated as part of the monument by Proclamation 9298, expanding the monument's eastern boundary to include the full Molok Luyuk area—from the ridgeline to the point where the foothills recede into the flatlands of Bear Valley—will protect additional objects of scientific and historic interest and enable holistic management of a culturally significant landscape.
Since time immemorial, Molok Luyuk has held a deep cultural significance for Tribal Nations of the Patwin people, including the Yocha Dehe Wintun Nation, the Kletsel Dehe Band of Wintun Indians, and the Cachil Dehe Band of Wintun Indians. Their history is connected to Molok Luyuk and
their lifeways are intertwined with the features, plants, and wildlife of the expansion area. The name Molok Luyuk recalls a time when condors were a common sight soaring above the ridge, and the Patwin people would often celebrate them with dances and ceremonies. On a clear day, the highest points of Molok Luyuk offer a commanding view of the surrounding rugged and undeveloped landscape, encompassing Mount Shasta to the north, Mount Tamalpais to the southwest, and Sutter Buttes to the east. This viewshed, and particularly the view of the sun rising over Sutter Buttes, is central to the Patwin origin story and connected the Patwin communities that once lived in the hills of Molok Luyuk and beyond with the River Patwin communities that populated Bear Valley, which lies just to the east, before they were displaced by trappers, ranchers, and miners. The expansion area includes sites of historic and ceremonial importance to members of all three Patwin Nations along the ridgeline and around its numerous natural springs.
The area around Molok Luyuk has long contained numerous objects of scientific and historic interest. Molok Luyuk played an important role in providing for the sustenance of the Patwin communities that were once found in the area. Occupants of nearby villages made seasonal forays to the ridge and flanks of Molok Luyuk in search of manzanita berries, clover, gray pine nuts, acorns, bulbs, and tubers, as well as to hunt elk and deer. Evidence of this cultural story marks the landscape today through numerous lithic scatters—sites containing ancient tools, tool fragments, and lithic flakes from tool production and maintenance—found along Molok Luyuk and around the area's cold springs. These scatter sites, which in some cases date back thousands of years, likely represent hunting and gathering camps and sites used by generations of Indigenous people for ceremonial purposes. Artifacts from these sites include obsidian tools made from sources in the region.
Trails once crossed and stretched out from the ridgeline. These trails, which ran atop the ridge and just inside the northern and southern boundaries of the expansion area, are important to the history of how Patwin communities were connected to other Indigenous communities in northern California. For instance, they enabled cultural exchanges among Indigenous people in the region, connected villages, and facilitated access to seasonal camps and ceremonial sites. Knowledge of the trails lives within Patwin oral history and cultural expertise and has been documented in ethnographic studies. Some trails were part of a larger interregional network by which other northern California Indigenous peoples would access Molok Luyuk and the healing hot springs that today lie on private land just to the south of the expansion area.
A tumultuous geologic history underpins the expansion area's diverse ecological communities. The backbone of Molok Luyuk is an ophiolite formed by unusual ultramafic rocks. Serpentinite, as this rock is more commonly known, was originally formed deep within the Earth's mantle and eventually thrust upward through the forces of plate tectonics. The landscape is subtly marked by the smoky gray-green of serpentine rocks and their derivative soils. Rare serpentine soils resulting from eroded serpentinite dominate the ridgeline and eastern flank of Molok Luyuk. These soils have unusually high levels of magnesium and iron and very low levels of nutrients, such as calcium and phosphorus, that are critical for the survival of most plants. This soil chemistry imposed evolutionary pressure resulting in a
profusion of unique species and habitats that are inhospitable to non-native species that may dominate elsewhere.
Protecting serpentine soils like those found in the expansion area is essential to the preservation of California's endemic and rare plant life. While serpentine soils occur on less than 1.5 percent of California's land base, they are home to nearly 15 percent of California endemic species and nearly 11 percent of its rare plant taxa. Consistent with this State-wide data, the great majority of special-status plant taxa within the Molok Luyuk area occur primarily on serpentine soils.
Molok Luyuk's diverse topography and geology, which also include sandstone and shale, create the conditions for its 13 distinct plant communities, 9 of which spring from serpentine soils. These habitats include serpentine and non-serpentine chaparral, McNab and Sargent cypress and blue and live oak woodlands, serpentine riparian woodland, native wildflower fields, and serpentine seeps. This diversity of plants and plant communities provided the wide array of foods, tools, and medicines that the Patwin gathered from Molok Luyuk. Nearly 500 native California plant taxa have been identified within the expansion area, including at least 38 different special-status plant taxa. The expansion area also includes suitable habitat for another 30 special-status plants that have been documented in the surrounding area. Numerous studies—particularly those focused on species that grow on serpentine soils—have made use of botanical samples from the expansion area, and protecting these rare and sensitive plants will preserve opportunities for important future botanical research.
Brilliant fields of native wildflowers and bunchgrasses are scattered throughout Molok Luyuk. Springtime brings a kaleidoscopic display of butter-yellow golden fairy lantern, flame-like woolly Indian paintbrush, and brilliant orange starbursts of flame ragwort, all of which are native species that thrive in the area's serpentine meadows. The delicate violet flowers of the Indian Valley brodiaea, a bulbiferous perennial herb that is listed as a State of California endangered species, can also be found tucked into serpentine seeps. Throughout the summer, the small white flowers of the drymary dwarf flax, a Bureau of Land Management (BLM) sensitive species that is endemic to California, are widespread on Molok Luyuk's higher elevation serpentine slopes.
Unusual serpentine wetlands occur along Molok Luyuk, as well as on downslope benches and along Highway 20 near the Colusa-Lake county line. Many of these wetlands are fed by the numerous seeps and springs scattered across the area, which are of critical importance to the area's botanical richness. These include Barrel Springs in the northeastern portion of the expansion area, Cold Spring near the center of the ridgeline, and Til Jones and Eaton Springs in the south, along with numerous other unnamed springs. Protecting these springs, and the wetlands they feed, is critical to preserving the rare and endemic species that thrive within the monument and expansion area—and to preserving opportunities for future scientific study.
Despite substantial fragmentation due to fires in 2008 and 2018, McNab cypress woodland, a California-designated sensitive natural community that is vulnerable at both the global and State scales, dominates portions of the northern, higher elevations. In addition to being a rare and vulnerable natural community of scientific interest, the McNab cypress, for which these
woodlands are named, have been used for Patwin ceremonies and medicines for generations and continue to be used today.
A wide variety of mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians use or make their homes in Molok Luyuk. More than 80 species of birds have been recorded in the area, including 18 special-status species. Both bald and golden eagles can be observed gliding through the sky above Molok Luyuk. Foothill yellow-legged frogs, a BLM sensitive species, can be found in lower-elevation streams within the expansion area. Members of the oldest free-ranging tule elk herd in California also reside within the expansion area. Tule elk, which are endemic to California, had vanished from the wild until a formerly captive herd was released in 1922 in Colusa County. Other wildlife species that make their homes in Molok Luyuk include black-tail deer, black bear, coyote, bobcat, gopher snake, and western rattlesnake. The slopes of Molok Luyuk provide an avenue for wildlife to move from the lower elevations of Bear Valley to the higher elevation of the ridgeline. Conserving this expansion area will fortify protection for the critical north-south migration corridor provided by the existing monument.
As night falls over Molok Luyuk, other residents of the area emerge. At least 14 species of bats occur in the area, including the western red bat, pallid bat, and Townsend's big-eared bat, each of which is a California Species of Special Concern. The night skies through which they fly are remarkably unmarred by light pollution, which can disturb many species of bats as well as other mammals and birds, and provide increasingly rare and extraordinary stargazing opportunities to those who venture out after sunset.
In light of threats, including impacts from climate change, increased recreational use, and development potential, expanding the boundaries of the Berryessa Snow Mountain National Monument to protect the area described above will preserve a diverse array of natural and scientific resources and cultural and historic legacy sites, ensuring that the scientific and historic values of this area endure for the benefit of all Americans. The expansion area contains numerous objects of historic and scientific interest, and it also provides opportunities for those who seek out places of beauty and botanical wonder, whether through hiking, hunting, scenic driving, camping, wildflower viewing, or lying under a vast expanse of undimmed starry sky.
WHEREAS, section 320301 of title 54, United States Code (the “Antiquities Act”), authorizes the President, in his discretion, to declare by public proclamation historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic or scientific interest that are situated upon the lands owned or controlled by the Federal Government to be national monuments, and to reserve as a part thereof parcels of land, the limits of which shall be confined to the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected; and

Proc. 10746

# Boundary Enlargement of the San Gabriel Mountains National MonumentBy the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Through Proclamation 9194 of October 10, 2014, President Obama established the San Gabriel Mountains National Monument (monument) to protect the rich cultural history, striking geologic features, and vibrant ecological diversity contained within a portion of the Angeles National Forest. Situated in the mountains north of Los Angeles, the monument is a verdant oasis that contains abundant and distinctive flora and fauna; unique geology; and evidence of centuries of occupation and use by Tribal Nations and Indigenous peoples, Spanish missionaries and colonists, Mexican rancheros, and Euro-American settlers and prospectors. In addition to protecting these and other objects of historic and scientific interest, the monument's pristine natural lands and proximity to Los Angeles make it a unique place of rejuvenation and recreation for the people of the ever-changing urban and suburban communities of greater Los Angeles.
Expanding the monument to include the expanse of the Angeles National Forest that stretches south and west from the current boundary to the National Forest boundary near foothill communities of Los Angeles will protect additional objects of scientific and historic interest. This expansion area contains evidence of thousands of years of use and occupation by Indigenous peoples, as well as evidence of more recent human uses, including the ruins of grand recreation resorts and of a missile unit built during the Cold War. A diversity of animals, birds, reptiles, and other wildlife, including numerous threatened and endangered species, live among the unique geological and ecological features of the expansion area, including its unusual canyons, chaparral, and coastal sage scrub lands, and use the area to travel from the lowlands in the south to the soaring mountains in the north.
Since time immemorial, the rich landscape within the expansion area has sustained a mosaic of Indigenous peoples, including the people known as the Gabrielino, Kizh, or Tongva, and the Chumash Kitanemuk, Serrano, and Tataviam peoples. The displacement of these peoples from the area began between 1770 and 1816, when Spanish missionaries forcibly assimilated the region's Indigenous families into surrounding missions, and continued past California's admission into the Union. Today, their descendants are part of Tribal Nations and other Indigenous peoples in the region, some of whose members continue to use the area for ceremonial purposes, as well as for collecting traditional plants important for basketry, food, and medicine.
Evidence of many eras of human history can be found in the expansion area. Dozens of known sites shed light on the daily life and activities of Indigenous peoples, including seasonal habitation, plant and mineral resource collection, food processing, tool manufacturing, and transportation corridors. One known site contains a seasonal encampment where there is evidence of food processing and tool production use from 1150 to 1771, including midden, flaked lithics and tools, ground stones, and hearths and
earth ovens. The area also contains evidence of use associated with permanent Indigenous villages that were located adjacent to the expansion area at the base of the area's canyons, including the Tongva villages of Muuhonga and Tohuunga.
Other sites contain lithic materials, including fused shale and obsidian that came from areas far to the north. These materials provide evidence of the ancient Indigenous trade routes that crisscrossed the area, bringing small game, deer, acorns, sage, piñon nuts, yucca, elderberry, and manzanita berry, among other resources, south into the Los Angeles Basin, and asphaltum, shell and soapstone cooking vessels, beads, pipes, effigies, pendants, and comals north into the mountains.
Mining made its way to the San Gabriel Mountains in the 19th century, following the discovery of gold in Placerita Canyon in 1842. Visitors to the area today can still see evidence of this first gold rush, including the remains of a mine shaft and ore cart rails of the Dawn Mine and mill site, which remained in operation until 1954. The remains of the Tujunga Mining District, including the shafts of the Josephine Mine above Mill Creek, evidence a second minor gold rush in the late 1880s.
The expansion area also contains evidence of Euro-American settlers who looked to these lands to provide mineral resources, wood for fuel and construction, other building materials, and water. Near Little Tujunga Canyon, three well-preserved limekilns, eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places, were constructed around 1870 with local limestone and granite cobbles within a mortar matrix. Visitors to the area can also traverse trails first developed by Indigenous peoples and later modified by Euro-American settlers. For example, ranchero and later Mayor of Los Angeles Benjamin Davis Wilson, also known as Don Benito, using labor from Indigenous and Spanish workers, built the trail known today as the Mount Wilson Trail to transport timber to his rancho. The Gabrielino Trail, which the Congress designated as America's first National Recreation Trail in 1970, incorporates trails that another 19th century trail maker, Wilbur Sturtevant, developed possibly along established Indigenous routes.
The expansion area also contains evidence of highly popular recreational pursuits of the Great Hiking Era of the early 20th century, when throngs of hikers and outdoor enthusiasts went to the mountains of southern California. This evidence includes the remains of the Mount Lowe Electric Railway (Railway), which was opened in 1893 to transport passengers from foothill communities to three impressive mountain resorts. The Railway, which is listed in the National Register of Historic Places as a Historic District, was the only scenic mountain electric traction railway ever built in the United States and became a tourist destination because of its remarkable location and engineering audacity. It recorded an estimated three million visitors between 1893 and 1938.
Today's visitors who hike to Echo Mountain will see portions of the railroad bed and crossties, a platform, trestle foundations, and scattered remains of the powerhouse's massive cog-wheel or “bullwheel” used to pull the incline car up the mountain. Nearby, visitors can also observe the remains of a once grand resort served by the Railway, including a staircase and the foundation footprint of a 70-room hotel, the remains of a zoo, the foundation of an observatory and telescope pedestal, two large concrete
water tanks, and rock retaining walls outlining the tennis courts and casino. Visitors can also see remnants of a three million candlepower searchlight installed on the mountain from the 1893 Columbia Exposition World's Fair, and a largely intact, original “echophone” used by visitors to hear the canyon's echoes. A trestle abutment of the Railway can also be found near the Mount Lowe Campground. Nearby, at the head of Grand Canyon, visitors can see the rear wall of another of the resorts served by the Railway, the 12-room Swiss-style Ye Alpine Tavern.
To the north and west of the Railway, ruins of hike-in camps include the foundation of Switzer's Camp, developed by Commodore Perry Switzer in the early 1880s. That camp hosted Henry Ford, Shirley Temple, and numerous other celebrities.
The southeastern portion of the expansion area contains 64 cabins that were once part of the Big Santa Anita Canyon Summer Home Tract. This development was established to respond to the burgeoning early 20th century desire to be closer to, and have second homes in, natural settings. The tract originally contained 88 cabins and 12 associated campgrounds. Eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places, the cabins epitomized the rustic architectural design style of the early 20th century, and are notable for the care taken in sensitively siting them into the rugged topography.
Above El Prieto Canyon, in the southern portion of the expansion area, is the homestead site of a former cabin built and lived in by Robert Owens. Owens was a formerly enslaved person who built a thriving wood and building supply business in and around the canyon, becoming the wealthiest African American in Los Angeles County in 1865.
The expansion area also includes the historic Big Tujunga Dam, completed in 1931, and Brown Mountain Dam, constructed by the United States Forest Service (Forest Service) in 1943. The Lincoln Avenue Water Company water system is also in the area, which was constructed in the 1880s and is eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places.
The Los Pinetos Nike Missile site, which is eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places, played a vital role in United States national defense during the Cold War era. This site, along with the Mount Gleason Nike Missile site, which was destroyed by a wildfire in 2009, is among the 300 Nike Missile sites constructed across the country from 1955 to 1958 that were intended to serve as the last line of defense against Soviet bomber planes. The Los Pinetos Nike Missile site is unusual because its launch, administrative, and battery control facilities are located within a single line of sight.
In addition to extensive historical resources, the expansion area reflects massive geologic forces over hundreds of millions of years that created an exceptional landscape, providing views deep into the ancient Earth. The steep and rugged San Gabriel Mountains are one of the fastest growing mountain ranges in the world. These mountains form a major part of the east-west trending Transverse Ranges of southern California, a portion of which is in the expansion area. They were formed from eons of geological movement during the Mesozoic and Cenozoic Eras when the geologic Farallon Plate and the North American Plate crashed together. Dragged as
much as 50 degrees in some places by these powerful forces, the San Gabriel Mountains have an unusual east-west orientation, instead of the more typical north-south orientation.
Around Mount Lowe, the uplift of rare anorthosite complex rocks that are 1.2 billion years old, including anorthosite pluton, syenite, and mafic rocks, reveals the dramatic twisting that can occur as mountains are formed. Evidence of this geological process typically lies far below the surface, making the area a hotbed of geological study and a natural classroom for the public. Around Mendenhall Peak, the bands and swirls of 1.7 to 1.8 billion-year-old Mendenhall Gneiss, the region's oldest rocks, are exposed.
The expansion area also contains scientifically important paleontological resources, particularly invertebrate fossils such as oysters and gastropods, at sites including Gold Canyon near Little Tujunga Canyon.
The expansion area is composed of many distinct and diverse ecosystem zones that support rich biodiversity, including more than 500 native plants and fungi, as well as important habitat including riparian woodlands, montane hardwood and conifer forests, coastal sage scrub, alluvial sage scrub, and extensive chaparral. The area also provides important connectivity to enable species to move from the foothills of the south to the soaring mountains of the north.
Perennial streams, springs, and associated riparian areas, and numerous seasonal tributaries, all support wetland-dependent plant species such as the California muhly and the Sonoran maiden fern, the latter of which is designated as rare by the State of California. These riparian areas also provide critical habitat for sensitive fish and amphibians, including the threatened Santa Ana speckled dace and the threatened Santa Ana sucker found in Big Tujunga Creek, and the endangered Arroyo Toad found in both the Arroyo Seco and Big Tujunga Creek. Habitats for the steelhead trout and the Arroyo chub, a State species of special concern, are also found in Arroyo Seco and Big Tujunga Creek.
A rich variety of rare plants can be found in the expansion area, including the San Gabriel manzanita, San Gabriel Mountains leather oak, San Gabriel Mountains sunflower, San Gabriel bedstraw, and San Gabriel Mountains dudleya, all of which are found only or primarily in the San Gabriel Mountains, and the California muhly, fragrant pitcher sage, Greata's aster, and Plummer's mariposa lily, found only in southern California. Other rare species include the Mount Gleason paintbrush, California satintail, and Chaparral yucca, which is part of an extraordinary, mutually beneficial partnership with the interdependent California yucca moth.
While extremely reduced from its overall historic range, pockets of alluvial scrub habitat, particularly around Big Tujunga Canyon, provide a home for the rare endemic Davidson's bushmallow. Southern California's bigcone Douglas-fir, which is well adapted to the region's natural wildfire regime, is present in strongholds around San Gabriel Peak, the Switzer Falls Trail, and south of Mount Wilson, providing important nesting and roosting habitat for the California spotted owl, which the United States Fish and Wildlife Service has proposed to list as endangered.
Coastal sage scrub, among the most threatened plant communities in California, occurs primarily at elevations below 2,500 feet south of Mount Wilson and along the north side of Big Tujunga Creek. This rare plant community includes California sagebrush, brittlebush, California buckwheat, and various types of sage. Coastal sage scrub, which can be found in Placerita Canyon, provides critical habitat for the threatened coastal California gnatcatcher.
Montane hardwood and conifer forests south of Big Tujunga Bridge and Mount Wilson are typified by live oak, bigleaf maple, California bay, incense cedar, Pacific madrone, Coulter pine, sugar pine, and California incense cedar, as well as understory species such as ceanothus, coffeeberry, gooseberry, and currants. These forests provide habitat for a wide variety of wildlife such as black bears, mule deer, various reptiles, birds, and butterflies, as well as fish and amphibians that rely on the cool water found there. Birds that can be found seasonally or year-round in the expansion area include the endangered California condor and Least Bell's vireo; the threatened western population of yellow-billed cuckoo; the Swainson's hawk, which is listed as threatened by the State of California; the Peregrine falcon; and the California-listed willow flycatcher. The southwestern pond turtle, which the United States Fish and Wildlife Service has proposed to list as threatened, is also found in the area, along with the two-striped garter snake and the Southern California legless lizard, which are designated as sensitive species by the Angeles National Forest. Many species of bats use the area's canyons and waters, including the pallid bat and big free-tailed bat, both California special status species, along with migrants and resident bats, such as the hoary bat, Yuma myotis, small-footed myotis, canyon bat, big brown bat, Mexican free-tailed bat, long-eared myotis, and California myotis.
In addition to these key habitats, the area also contains important migration corridors that connect vulnerable habitats throughout the greater region. A striking example in the northwest portion of the expansion area is Bear Divide, which funnels thousands of migratory birds through a narrow pass along the Pacific Flyway, the primary avian migration route on the West Coast that extends from Central America to the Arctic. Another important corridor is the Arroyo Seco-Hahamongna Corridor, which connects the south-central portion of the expansion area to other nearby natural areas outside the Angeles National Forest boundary.
Despite its proximity to urban Los Angeles, the expansion area includes secluded and largely undeveloped areas such as the 4,700-acre Arroyo Seco Inventoried Roadless Area, which is an iconic landscape feature.
Protecting the expansion area will preserve an important spiritual, cultural, prehistoric, and historic landscape; maintain a diverse array of natural and scientific resources; and help ensure that the objects of historic and scientific interest within the area endure for the benefit of all Americans. As described above, the expansion area contains numerous objects of historic and scientific interest in need of protection. In addition, it provides exceptional outdoor recreational opportunities, including hiking, hunting, fishing, biking, horseback riding, backpacking, scenic driving, and wildlife viewing, all of which are important to residents of and visitors to the Los Angeles region.
WHEREAS, section 320301 of title 54, United States Code (the “Antiquities Act”), authorizes the President, in his discretion, to declare by public proclamation historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic or scientific interest that are situated upon the lands owned or controlled by the Federal Government to be national monuments, and to reserve as a part thereof parcels of land, the limits of which shall be confined to the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected; and

The advisory committee shall consist of a fair and balanced representation of interested stakeholders, including State agencies and local governments; Tribal Nations and Indigenous peoples with cultural, traditional, or ancestral ties to the area; recreational
users; conservation organizations; wildlife, hunting, and fishing organizations; the scientific community; business owners; and the general public in the region.
Nothing in this proclamation shall be deemed to revoke any existing withdrawal, reservation, or appropriation; however, the monument shall be the dominant reservation.
Warning is hereby given to all unauthorized persons not to appropriate, injure, destroy, or remove any feature of the monument and not to locate or settle upon any of the lands thereof.
If any provision of this proclamation, including its application to a particular parcel of land, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this proclamation and its application to other parcels of land shall not be affected thereby.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this second day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# Days of Remembrance of the Victims of the Holocaust, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
During
Yom HaShoah
and these days of remembrance, we mourn the six million Jews who were systematically targeted and murdered in the Holocaust, one of the darkest chapters in human history. We also mourn the Roma, Sinti, Slavs, people with disabilities, LGBTQI+ people, racial minorities, and political dissidents who were killed or endured abuse by the Nazis and their collaborators, as well as those who risked or lost their lives to protect others. We honor the memories of the victims, the courage of the survivors, and the heroism of those who stood up to the Nazis, and we recommit ourselves to making real the promise of “Never Again.”
I often reflect on memories of sitting around our kitchen table where my father would educate my siblings and me about the horrors of the Holocaust. Entire families wiped out. Communities savagely destroyed. Survivors left with memories and traumas that will never go away—even as the tattoos etched into their skin by the Nazis fade and the number of survivors dwindles. My dad taught us that silence is complicity—a lesson I have passed down to my children and grandchildren by taking them to the Dachau concentration camp in Germany. As United States Senator, as Vice President, and now as President, I have met with many Holocaust survivors, promising them that our Nation would neither forget what they endured nor ever again stand by silently in the face of antisemitism.
The charge has never been more urgent than in the aftermath of Hamas' vicious terrorist attack on October 7th—the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust. Among the 1,200 innocent people who were slaughtered and the hundreds taken hostage were elderly survivors of the Shoah, who were forced to relive the horrors they thought they had escaped decades ago. My Administration is working tirelessly to free the hostages who have been held by Hamas for over half a year—and as I have said to their families, we will not rest until we bring them home.
While Jews across the country and around the world are still coping with the trauma of that day and its aftermath, we have seen an alarming surge in antisemitism at home and abroad that resurfaces painful scars of millennia of antisemitism and hate against the Jewish people. This includes harassment and calls for violence against Jews—in our schools, in our communities, and online. This blatant antisemitism is reprehensible and dangerous. Antisemitic hate speech has absolutely no place on college campuses or anywhere else in our country. As Americans, we cannot stay silent as Jews are attacked, harassed, and targeted. We must also forcefully push back attempts to ignore, deny, distort, or revise the history of Nazi atrocities during the Holocaust or Hamas' murders and other atrocities committed on October 7th—including the appalling and unforgiveable use of rape and sexual assault to terrorize and torture Jewish women and girls.
My commitment to the safety of the Jewish people and the security of Israel is ironclad. Under the first-ever National Strategy to Combat Antisemitism, my Administration is mobilizing the full force of the Federal Government to crack down on antisemitism and to ensure hate has no safe harbor in
America. We clarified civil rights protections for Jews under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Department of Education is leading investigations into antisemitism on college campuses. The Department of Justice is investigating and prosecuting hate crimes. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is focused on delivering security resources to Jewish communities. We provided the largest-ever increase in funding for the physical security of non-profits, including synagogues, Jewish community centers, and Jewish schools. I appointed Deborah Lipstadt, a Holocaust expert, to be the first-ever Ambassador-level Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Antisemitism around the world.
During these somber days of remembrance, we mourn the lives tragically stolen in the Shoah and on October 7th. As we hold the Jewish community close to our hearts, we recommit to remembering so that what happened can never be erased. Some injustices are so heinous, horrific, and grievous that they cannot be buried, no matter how hard people try. In silence, wounds deepen, but in remembrance comes healing, justice, and repair. Toward those aims, we must all forcefully act against antisemitism and all forms of hate-fueled violence. As we do, we honor the courage, strength, and resilience of the Jewish people, who have inspired the world for generations by turning pain into purpose, healing into hope, and darkness into light.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 5 through May 12, 2024, as a week of observance of the Days of Remembrance of the Victims of the Holocaust, and I call upon the people of the United States to observe this week and pause to remember victims and survivors of the Holocaust.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this third day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# National Hurricane Preparedness Week, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Too many families know the pain of having their lives and livelihoods devastated by powerful hurricanes, tropical storms, and typhoons. During National Hurricane Preparedness Week, we shed light on the dangerous impacts of hurricanes and share best practices on how to prepare and stay safe. We also show our gratitude to the first responders, volunteers, and all those who help to prepare communities in advance and rescue, recover, and rebuild in the wake of their darkest moments.
In Louisiana, Florida, New York, and Puerto Rico, I have walked the empty streets that hurricanes left behind. Community members have told me
about the homes, churches, and small businesses that stood there only a few days before—how everything they had worked for had been wiped out. Hurricanes have caused billions of dollars in damage. With the climate crisis, extreme weather events like hurricanes may grow more frequent and intense.
My Administration has taken action to make our Nation more resilient to and prepared for extreme weather. Our Bipartisan Infrastructure Law—the most significant investment in infrastructure in decades—is strengthening, restoring, and building roads, bridges, and ports across our country. I also signed the Inflation Reduction Act—the most significant climate investment in the history of the world. With these pieces of legislation, we are investing tens of billions of dollars in building a future that keeps Americans safe from the threat of extreme weather. We are modernizing building codes to be more protective and upgrading electric grids so the power does not go out when storms land. We are helping States prepare safe evacuation routes and launch new construction projects that keep vulnerable coastal communities safe against extreme weather events like hurricanes and storm surges. We are revitalizing critical ecosystems like reefs, beaches, and wetlands that naturally keep us safer during storms by buffering shorelines against the waves.
This week, as we approach hurricane season, every American can take steps to plan, prepare, and better protect their families and homes. Review emergency plans and insurance policies and make sure they are up to date. Store important documents in a secure and accessible place, learn local evacuation routes, and prepare an emergency kit. If a storm approaches, keep a close eye on storm surge and hurricane warnings, and follow guidance from local authorities. Spreading awareness about preparation for hurricanes can make a huge difference in keeping friends, families, and neighbors safe. For more information, visit ready.gov for tips on how to protect yourself from all hazards.
I have often said that America is the only country that has emerged from every crisis stronger than when we entered it. That is in no small part due to the courage and compassion of volunteers, first responders, and everyday people who show up in the wake of disaster. They have put roofs over people's heads, rebuilt what was lost, and saved lives. This National Hurricane Preparedness Week, we honor their service, and we recommit to doing our part in keeping America's communities safe and secure from these disasters.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 5 through May 11, 2024, as National Hurricane Preparedness Week. I urge all Americans to help build our climate-resilient Nation so that individuals, organizations, and community leaders are empowered to take action to make their communities more secure in the face of extreme weather and climate change. I call on our Federal, State, Tribal, territorial, and local government agencies to share information that will protect lives and property.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this third day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

Proc. 10749

# Public Service Recognition Week, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Our Nation's over 20 million public servants work hard to deliver for our families, communities, and country. Their work matters to people's everyday lives: They keep neighborhoods safe and the buses running, and build futures for people in their hometowns. They are the lifeblood of our democracy, acting as brave first responders, election workers, and service members defending our country. This week, we recognize our Nation's public servants, who do the humble yet critical work of keeping our country running.
When I came into office, our country was facing an unprecedented crisis—a pandemic was raging and the economy was reeling. But we turned things around—in no small part because of our public servants. I signed the American Rescue Plan, providing $350 billion to ensure public servants could stay on the job. That money put more police officers in our communities and more teachers and education support professionals in our schools. It went directly to every community in America so public servants could decide how to best help their communities. Because of public servants' work, child care centers stayed open, families stayed in their homes, and small businesses stayed afloat. At the same time, this legislation also made one of the biggest investments ever in public safety. Our public servants have done an incredible job of putting these resources to work by hiring more officers for accountable, effective community policing and supporting violence intervention programs that help prevent crime in the first place. Together, we created new jobs, new businesses, and new hope for folks across the country.
Our Nation relies on our public servants every day, and they deserve to be treated with dignity and respect. That is why I issued an Executive Order to increase the minimum wage for Federal employees to $15 per hour, ensuring our public servants are paid fairly while also attracting more competitive applicants to these critical roles. I established a White House Task Force on Worker Organizing and Empowerment, led by Vice President Harris, to strengthen the right to organize and bargain collectively, including for Federal Government workers. Further, I launched a Government-wide initiative to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion in the Federal workforce so that it reflects all the communities we serve. My Administration finalized a rule prohibiting Federal agencies from considering an applicant's current or past pay when determining their future salaries—eliminating gender and racial pay inequities that can otherwise follow those
seeking a job in public service. To ensure all Federal employees feel safe and supported in the workplace, I took executive action to protect Federal employees from discrimination on the basis of their gender identity or sexual orientation—pushing the Federal Government to become the model employer it can and should be.
My Administration has also taken significant action to provide student debt relief—giving our public servants some well-deserved breathing room. I fixed the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, which was designed to make sure public servants could get their student loans forgiven once they made payments for 10 years. When I took office, only 7,000 public servants had had their debts forgiven—it was past time to fix it. Thanks to my Administration's reforms, nearly 876,000 public servants have had their student debts forgiven.
We must do more to protect our Nation's public servants, who provide the expertise necessary for our democracy to function. To guarantee that career civil servants can continue to share their expertise and keep our democracy working, my Administration finalized a rule to protect the jobs of 2.2 million career civil servants—no matter who is in office.
Meanwhile, my Administration is working to empower and strengthen the career Federal workforce more than ever before. My Budget includes a focus on hiring more public servants into mission critical jobs, helping provide better services to the American people.
This week, I hope all the public servants feel proud. Across the country, we are seeing new shovels in the ground, people going to work, and families thriving. People are feeling pride in their hometowns and their country again and in knowing that we can get big things done when we work together. We are witnessing the greatest comeback our country has ever known—in no small part because of the hard work and dedication of our Nation's public servants.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 5 through May 11, 2024, as Public Service Recognition Week. I call upon all Americans to celebrate public servants and their contributions this week and throughout the year.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this third day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# National Teacher Appreciation Day and National Teacher Appreciation Week, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Teachers are the heart and soul of our Nation. They care for our Nation's students, pass on knowledge to rising generations, and inspire our children to dream up new possibilities for their futures. The power of a great teacher is profound, and—on National Teacher Appreciation Day and during National Teacher Appreciation Week—we thank them for their tireless efforts and recommit to taking care of our teachers, just as they have taken care of all of us.
Our Nation asks so much of our teachers, and that is why my Administration supports them in all that we do. Our American Rescue Plan provided historic funding for schools to reopen safely after the pandemic so that teachers could return to their classrooms. It also delivered critical support for schools—from supporting early childhood programs and funding after-school and summer programs to hiring more teachers, counselors, and school psychologists.
We also passed the most significant bipartisan gun safety law in nearly 30 years because teaching should not be a life-threatening profession and teachers should never be on the frontlines of the gun violence epidemic. The law enhanced background checks for people under the age of 21 and gave States funding to enact red flag laws. At the same time, the law provided $1 billion to help schools hire and train mental health counselors. But we need to do more—I continue to call on the Congress to implement commonsense gun safety laws that protect our kids and teachers.
Teachers deserve so much more breathing room: As I said in my State of the Union Address, let us give public school teachers a raise. Let us help relieve them of the student debt they took on to become teachers. My Administration has already worked to take the crushing weight of student debt off teachers' shoulders by fixing the Public Student Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program. To date, we have canceled over $62.8 billion in student debt for nearly 900,000 public service workers, including teachers. That is up from the only 7,000 workers who had received PSLF when I took office.
There is still much more to do to make sure our teachers are fully supported. My Budget proposes investing nearly $3 billion in teachers and other educators, including $650 million to support pathways into the profession, help keep great teachers in the profession, and increase the diversity of the profession. My Budget also proposes eliminating the origination fees charged to borrowers on every new Federal student loan, which would save the typical teacher $1,000 or more throughout the repayment process. Further, my Administration proposed a rule that would boost Head Start teacher wages by $10,000 on average, ensuring that they are getting the wages they deserve.
The First Lady has reminded me over the years that for teachers, teaching is more than what they do—it is who they are. That sense of purpose powers our Nation's teachers every day—even through the long hours they
spend setting up classrooms, preparing lesson plans, and educating our future leaders. I have had the honor of meeting so many of our Nation's great teachers, who have poured their hearts into caring for their students—not only by educating them but motivating and inspiring them. Teachers hold the kite strings that keep our national ambitions aloft. The future of our Nation is in their hands. Today and this week, may we all show them the gratitude they deserve. We will always have their backs.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 7, 2024, as National Teacher Appreciation Day and May 6 through May 10, 2024, as National Teacher Appreciation Week. I call upon all Americans to recognize the hard work and dedication of our Nation's teachers and to observe this day and this week by supporting teachers through appropriate activities, events, and programs.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this third day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# National Fallen Firefighters Memorial Weekend, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
I have often said that God made man, and then made firefighters. Their extraordinary courage embodies the best of America—with every call they answer, they put their lives on the line to keep the rest of us safe. It is more than what they do; it is who they are. This weekend, we honor the brave service of every fallen hero who has made the ultimate sacrifice for our communities.
Last year, when the First Lady and I visited Maui in the wake of the devastating fires there, we met firefighters who had performed breathtaking acts of heroism, rescuing families and saving lives, even while many of their own homes burned. Over the years, I have had the honor of knowing many like them, and I know their bravery comes at a cost. They respond to hundreds of thousands of fires, medical calls, and other emergencies every year, some of which they were never trained for. As the effects of climate change worsen, local and wildland fire departments are being called to fight deadlier and stronger blazes. Too often, they are also exposed to toxic chemicals not only in smoke, but in their own protective gear, risking their health down the line. It is a dangerous profession, with everything at stake.
Firefighters have always had our backs; as a Nation, we have to have theirs. I know that few things protect firefighters better than more firefighters. That is why, in my first months as President, I signed the American Rescue
Plan, getting States and cities the funding needed to hire more firefighters during the pandemic, often boosting pay and keeping these essential heroes on the job. That law also increased Federal firefighting grants by $300 million, paying for hundreds of emergency response vehicles and thousands of sets of turnout gear, while putting more local firefighters in the field.
At the same time, we are making sure more firefighters have the quality health care they deserve. After years of incredible valor battling dangerous flames, cancer is in fact one of the leading causes of death in this community—a silent killer that stays with folks long after the blaze is out. Through our Cancer Moonshot Initiative, my Administration is working to end cancer as we know it. It aims to cut the cancer death rate in half over 25 years by investing in research and development, early detection, and screening, and better supporting patients and their families from the moment of their diagnosis. The Department of Labor has established a new unit to more quickly process claims for Federal firefighters with cancer. We are cracking down on exposure to toxic PFAS—the so-called “forever chemicals” that are used to make firefighting gear, equipment, and suppression agents. We have increased funding for research into the specific PFAS risks that firefighters face, looking for new ways to address them.
When a firefighter is harmed in the line of duty, it is on us all to make sure they get the support they deserve. We have expanded benefits for those who are permanently disabled, and extended them to family members of those who have passed away after experiencing trauma on duty. In 2022, I was proud to sign the Federal Firefighters Fairness Act, getting more than 10,000 Federal firefighters and their families critical workers' compensation and other benefits, by making sure certain heart problems, lung diseases, and cancers are classified as job-related. After years of service, we also have to make sure firefighters get the retirement pay and benefits they have earned. I was proud to sign legislation to keep their disability retirement benefits tax-free. And I will always stand with labor and defend their right to collectively bargain for the good pay, benefits, and safety protections they deserve. This Nation owes every firefighter who gets up each morning and goes to work not knowing if they will make it home. We owe their families. We owe everyone who has ever lost a firefighter that they loved. They lost a piece of their soul. These heroes' courageous legacy lives on in the communities they kept safe, and in our work to be there for one another the way that they were always there for us.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim May 4 through May 5, 2024, as National Fallen Firefighters Memorial Weekend. On Sunday, May 5, 2024, in accordance with Public Law 107-51, the flag of the United States will be flown at half-staff at all Federal office buildings in honor of the National Fallen Firefighters Memorial Service. I call upon all Americans to observe these events with appropriate ceremonies and activities and honor our Nation's courageous firefighters who gave their lives to keep the rest of us safe.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this third day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# Missing or Murdered Indigenous Persons Awareness Day, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
For decades, Native communities across this continent have been devastated by an epidemic of disappearances and killings, too often without resolution, justice, or accountability. On Missing or Murdered Indigenous Persons Awareness Day, we honor the individuals missing and the lives lost, and we recommit to working with Tribal Nations to end the violence and inequities that drive this crisis, delivering safety and healing.
Across Indian Country, justice for the missing has been elusive for too long. Too many Native families know the pain of a loved one being declared missing or murdered, and women, girls, and LGBTQI+ and Two-Spirit individuals are bearing the brunt of this violence. In the depths of their grief, the work of investigating these disappearances, demanding justice, and fighting for the hopeful return of their loved ones has fallen on the shoulders of families. Legions of brave activists have sought to change that. We need to provide greater resources and ensure the accountability that every community deserves.
During my first year in office, I signed an Executive Order directing Federal agencies to join Tribal Nations in responding to this crisis with new urgency. Since then, the Department of Justice and the Department of the Interior have worked together to accelerate investigations and bring families closure in ways that respect their cultures and the trauma they have endured. The Department of the Interior created a unit dedicated to this work, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation has hired personnel to focus on these cases and ensure that victims' families are heard throughout this process. Further, as a result of an effort spearheaded by Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland when she was in the Congress, Federal agencies are responding to and implementing the recommendations of the Not Invisible Act Commission—a commission composed of loved ones of missing or murdered individuals, law enforcement, Tribal leaders, Federal partners, service providers, and survivors of gender-based violence—to combat this epidemic. We will continue working with the governments of Canada and Mexico through the Trilateral Working Group on Violence Against Indigenous Women and Girls to make sure our efforts are coordinated and incorporate Tribal input.
At the same time, we are supporting efforts within the community to crack down on gender-based violence in Indian Country. We reauthorized the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) in 2022, which included historic provisions to strengthen Tribal sovereignty and safety, expanding Tribal jurisdiction to include prosecution of non-Native perpetrators of stalking, sexual assault, sex trafficking, and child abuse for crimes committed on Tribal lands. Further, my Administration invested in training for law enforcement and Federal court officers to ensure they respond to cases of gender-based violence through a trauma-informed and culturally responsive approach. My new Budget designates $800 million for the Department of Justice to
support VAWA programs, including a new grant program that will work to address the missing or murdered Indigenous persons crisis.
The United States has made a solemn promise to fulfill its trust and treaty obligations to Tribal Nations and to help rebuild Tribal economies and institutions. Ending this devastating epidemic is an important piece of that work. Today, we mourn with the families who have lost a piece of their soul to this crisis, and we honor the Indigenous activists and advocates who have summoned the courage to shine light on the tragedy. Their actions have already saved countless lives. Together, we will resolve these unanswered questions and build a future for everyone based on safety, security, and self-determination.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 5, 2024, as Missing or Murdered Indigenous Persons Awareness Day. I call on all Americans and ask all levels of government to support Tribal governments and Tribal communities' efforts to increase awareness and address the issues of missing or murdered Indigenous persons through appropriate programs and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this third day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# Military Spouse Appreciation Day, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Today, we honor the nearly one million military spouses for their service and sacrifice for our Nation. They are resilient. They are courageous. Like our service members, they make our country stronger.
Through long tours, frequent moves, and constant demands, these men and women remain unwavering, representing the very best of our American spirit. They step up to care for their fellow military families and friends during deployments, often singlehandedly doing the job of two parents. They make incredible contributions to our country and communities, even as they shoulder the unique demands of military life. They exude patience and selflessness during uncertainty and unpredictability. In ways big and small, military spouses answer the call to serve every day—acting as both the backbone of their families and the steel spine of our Nation.
We owe them. As a Nation, we have only one truly sacred obligation: to prepare those we send into harm's way and to care for them and their families while they are deployed and when they come home. That is why, last year, I signed an Executive Order that established the most comprehensive
set of administrative actions in our country's history to support the economic security of military and veteran spouses, caregivers, and survivors. It directs all Federal agencies to do more to retain military spouses through flexible policies, enables spouses to seek advice on overseas employment issues through military legal assistance offices for the first time, and helps military spouses maintain their careers—including by improving access to quality, dependable, and affordable child care.
My Administration has also expanded the Military Parental Leave Program, ensuring that service members have the time they need with their families after a child's birth, adoption, or placement in long-term foster care. Through the First Lady's Joining Forces initiative, we are working with employers to create more flexible, transferable, and remote job opportunities for military spouses so they can balance the demands of military life while building sustainable, long-term careers. We are working to ensure that military spouses and families have access to health and wellness resources.
The English poet John Milton once wrote: “They also serve who only stand and wait.” Today and every day, let us come together to thank our military spouses. Let us honor their courage and commitment. Let us continue to meet the sacred obligation we bear to them and all those who wear the uniform. May God bless our military spouses, and may God protect our troops.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 10, 2024, as Military Spouse Appreciation Day. I call upon the people of the United States to honor military spouses with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

Proc. 10754

# National Defense Transportation Day and National Transportation Week, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
During National Defense Transportation Day and National Transportation Week, we recommit to embarking on an infrastructure decade. Because the stronger and safer our infrastructure is, the stronger and safer we are as a Nation.
America used to have the best infrastructure in the world. But for years, we stopped investing in our infrastructure and our workers. We embraced trickle-down economics, shipping jobs overseas to the cheapest places in the world for labor and importing low-quality products back home. It never worked. Trickle-down economics hollowed out the middle class, left America's workers behind, and kept our Nation's infrastructure stuck in the past.
That is why I signed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law—a once-in-a-generation investment in American infrastructure and the largest investment in public transit in history. Over 51,000 new projects are transforming our communities—including modernizing our rail infrastructure and ports, fixing our roads and bridges, bringing public transportation to more communities, providing high-speed internet all over America, and more. These investments will make our Nation safer—from decreasing traffic and crashes to facilitating quicker responses from emergency responders when every minute counts. It also means goods will be shipped more quickly and commerce will flow more freely, ensuring our military, business, and all Americans have what they need on demand. We are doing all this work with American products and American workers. To date, the economy has created over 15 million jobs since the beginning of my Administration, including nearly 800,000 manufacturing jobs.
I also signed the CHIPS and Science Act to bring the manufacturing of semiconductors back home. Semiconductors are those tiny chips that power everything from automobiles and smartphones to satellites and weapons systems—and when I came into office, our country was only producing 10 percent of them, leaving our markets and national security vulnerable. I was determined to turn that around, and thanks to my Administration's investment in semiconductors, private companies have invested over $395 billion to bring semiconductor manufacturing back to America, creating tens of thousands of jobs across the country.
On top of this, I signed the Inflation Reduction Act—the most significant climate investment in the history of the world—to build America's clean energy future here at home. We are building a national network of electric vehicle chargers while providing tax credits for consumers to buy electric cars. So far, we have quadrupled the number of electric vehicles sold, and 11,000 dealerships have now signed up to sell more. We are also modernizing our Nation's electric grid so that Americans have access to power even when extreme weather hits. Like I have often said, when I think of climate, I think of jobs—and these investments in our Nation's clean energy market are providing Americans with good-paying jobs in their hometowns. At the same time, we are working with industry partners to implement the Biden Trucking Action Plan, which helps keep our Nation's truck drivers safe.
My Administration is working to build an America for all Americans, and we are making sure that these new infrastructure projects benefit our communities. When our country began building highways, they would cut straight through communities, especially ones with Black or Brown residents, dividing and destroying entire neighborhoods. To address this harmful legacy and unify these communities once again, my Administration launched the Reconnecting Communities Pilot Program—the first-ever Federal initiative to cap highways and create new green spaces that connect neighborhoods. We are leaving no one behind, opening new doors of opportunity, and making sure every community is treated with the dignity and respect they deserve.
Meanwhile, we are making sure that as we rebuild America, we are making our infrastructure more resilient to threats like extreme weather and cyber-attacks—upfront and by design through new policy like the National Security Memorandum on Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience (NSM-
22). Under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law alone, we have delivered $50 billion for infrastructure resilience—including nearly $9 billion to make our transportation system stronger—which will help keep Americans safe and protect our national security.
In thousands of cities and towns across America, our workers are writing the greatest comeback story ever told. They are getting shovels in the ground and operating the cranes in the sky and are hard at work rebuilding our Nation's infrastructure. All the while, they are bringing pride back to our communities and our Nation because they are proving we can still get big things done when we work together. That is what America is all about—building a future of possibilities, investing in all of America and in all Americans, and making sure everyone has a fair shot.
In recognition of the ongoing contributions of our Nation's transportation system and in honor of the devoted professionals who work to sustain its tradition of excellence, the United States Congress has requested, by joint resolution approved May 16, 1957, as amended (36 U.S.C. 120), that the President designate the third Friday in May of each year as “National Defense Transportation Day” and, by joint resolution approved May 14, 1962 (36 U.S.C. 133), that the week in which that Friday falls be designated as “National Transportation Week.”
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim Friday, May 17, 2024, as National Defense Transportation Day and May 12 through May 18, 2024, as National Transportation Week. I urge all Americans to observe these occasions with appropriate ceremonies, programs, and activities as we show our appreciation to those who build and operate our Nation's transportation systems.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this tenth day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

Proc. 10755

# Peace Officers Memorial Day and Police Week, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Every day, police officers pin on their shields and walk out the door, rushing into harm's way to keep the rest of us safe. Being a police officer is more than what they do—it is who they are. On Peace Officers Memorial Day and during Police Week, we recognize the incredible courage of our Nation's police officers and honor the fallen heroes, whose ultimate sacrifice we can never repay.
During the pandemic, States and cities saw violent crime rising as they faced deep cuts in law enforcement and public safety budgets. That is why the American Rescue Plan, one of the first bills I signed as President, provided $350 billion that States could use to keep law enforcement on the
beat and communities safe from violence. That led to the largest Federal investment in public safety in our history. Police departments used that funding to establish training facilities, hire more officers, and raise salaries. I also expanded benefits for first responders disabled in the line of duty and for their families. I increased access to mental health resources for police officers, who too often experience emotional and physical trauma on the job. Supporting our police officers with resources they need to do their jobs has paid off. Last year, the United States had one of the lowest rates of violent crime in more than 50 years.
My Administration recognizes that being a police officer is harder than ever. We expect them to be everything to everyone—counselors to people experiencing a crisis, social workers to kids who have been abandoned, and guardians to communities flooded with weapons of war. That is why we have invested in more crisis responders who work alongside police officers to respond to non-violent crimes. We have also increased investments in recruiting, retaining, and training officers and in violence prevention to get guns off the streets. We are working hard to strengthen the bonds of trust between officers and the people they serve. My Budget requests over $10 billion to recruit, train, support, and hire 100,000 additional police officers trained in effective, accountable community policing—working hand in hand with community leaders and local partners to gain trust and advance public safety.
My Administration has also taken historic action to end the scourge of gun violence in America, which puts far too many police officers at risk. To date, my Administration has taken more executive actions to stop the flow of illegal guns than any other administration in history. I formed the first-ever White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention, overseen by Vice President Harris. I signed the most significant gun safety law in nearly 30 years. I appointed the first Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) Director to lead the agency in over 7 years, who has since led efforts to crack down on gun trafficking, ghost guns, rogue gun dealers, and unlicensed sellers that fuel the flow of illegal firearms. I continue to call on the Congress to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, require safe storage of guns, fully fund ATF, and pass universal background checks and a national red flag law.
This year, we also honor our Nation's law enforcement families, who serve and sacrifice alongside their loved ones. Every day, they summon courage as their loved ones put on their badges and leave for work, praying for their safe return home. To those who have lost a loved one who served, I know that no memorial can fill the void left in your heart. But I hope you find solace in knowing that their memory lives on through you, the community they served, and all those that they inspired through their example. Our Nation will never forget their sacrifice.
Last year, I bestowed six law enforcement officers with the Medal of Valor for going to unimaginable lengths to protect their fellow citizens. They exemplified a selflessness of character and a bravery that inspires. On Peace Officers Memorial Day and during Police Week, let us show our gratitude for all the women and men of our Nation's law enforcement community, who make extraordinary sacrifices every day. Let us honor the memory of
those who have fallen in service to their fellow Americans. Let us recommit to supporting the people in uniform and their families, who ensure the safety of our communities all across the Nation.
By a joint resolution approved October 1, 1962, as amended (76 Stat. 676), and by Public Law 103-322, as amended (36 U.S.C. 136-137), the President has been authorized and requested to designate May 15 of each year as “Peace Officers Memorial Day” and the week in which it falls as “Police Week.”
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim May 15, 2024, as Peace Officers Memorial Day and May 12 through May 18, 2024, as Police Week. I call upon all Americans to observe these events with appropriate ceremonies and activities and salute our Nation's brave law enforcement officers and remember their peace officer brothers and sisters who have given their last full measure of devotion in the line of duty. I also call on the Governors of the United States and its Territories, and appropriate officials of all units of government, to direct that the flag be flown at half-staff on Peace Officers Memorial Day. I further encourage all Americans to display the flag at half-staff from their homes and businesses on that day.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this tenth day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

Proc. 10756

# National Women's Health Week, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Women comprise more than half our population, but women's health is understudied, and its research is vastly underfunded. Too many of our medications, treatments, and textbooks are instead based on men's needs. As a result, women spend more of their lives in poor health—too often having their symptoms dismissed, leaving medical appointments with more questions than answers, or waiting years to get the diagnosis and treatment they need. During National Women's Health Week, we commit to changing that by investing in women's health, closing the research gap, and getting every woman in this country access to the affordable, quality health care that she deserves.
Last year, the First Lady and I were proud to launch the first-ever White House Initiative on Women's Health Research, pioneering the next generation of medical breakthroughs and transforming the care that women receive. We jumpstarted this effort with an investment of $200 million to the National Institutes of Health specifically for cross-cutting research on women's health, and I called on the Congress to deliver $12 billion more to accelerate this work. These investments will spur much-needed research into
conditions that affect women uniquely, like menopause and endometriosis, or that affect women differently or at higher rates, like heart disease and Alzheimer's. Further, I issued the most comprehensive set of executive actions ever to expand and improve research on women's health, ensuring that women's health gets integrated and prioritized across Federal agencies. These actions will galvanize new research on a wide range of topics and help prevent, diagnose, and treat women's health conditions once and for all. Meanwhile, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health is investing $100 million in its first-ever “Sprint for Women's Health” to radically accelerate the next generation of discoveries.
Early in the Administration, the First Lady and I re-ignited the Cancer Moonshot initiative to end cancer as we know it—building a future where the one in three women who will be diagnosed with cancer in their lifetimes have access to the best treatments and care. Screening is an essential tool for survival; my Administration has boosted funding for breast and cervical cancer early detection and other diagnostic services for low-income Americans and those who do not have adequate insurance so everyone can access life-saving preventive care. We are also funding new research into heart disease—the top killer of women in America—while enacting a national strategy to help everyone access healthier food and get more exercise.
Health care should be a right in America, not a privilege. As Vice President, I helped pass the Affordable Care Act, expanding coverage to millions of women and guaranteeing that no one can be denied health insurance due to a pre-existing condition or pregnancy. It also ensures that important preventative services, like Pap smears and mammograms, are covered. As President, I am not only protecting the Affordable Care Act—I am strengthening it, saving millions of working families an average of $800 per year on their health insurance premiums. We are also cracking down on junk insurance so that people are not scammed into low-quality coverage. We finally secured Medicare the ability to negotiate lower prescription drug prices. We have slashed the cost of insulin for seniors on Medicare to just $35, down from as high as $400. Starting next year, we are capping out-of-pocket prescription drug costs at $2,000 per year for 30 million women on Medicare, even for drugs that can cost many times that amount.
Even as we have made progress in expanding access to care and lowering health care costs, the threat to women's reproductive health is greater today than at any time in generations. In the wake of the Supreme Court overturning
Roe
v.
Wade
, millions of women live in States with dangerous abortion bans that put women's health and lives at risk, force them to travel out of State for care, and threaten doctors with jail time. We are seeing threats to a broad range of reproductive health care, from contraception to fertility services, undermining women's ability to make decisions about their own futures and families. These are the most personal and private health care decisions that a person can make and should be left to a woman and her doctor, not to politicians. I have signed three Executive Orders to protect access to reproductive health care and will continue to take action to defend reproductive freedom. I will continue to call on the Congress to send me a bill supporting the right to choose. I will sign it and restore
Roe
v.
Wade
as the Federal law of the land.
We have also taken steps to protect the health and lives of our Nation's mothers, and data shows that rates of maternal mortality are decreasing across the country. Thanks to Vice President Kamala Harris' efforts, 46 States now ensure access to Medicaid postpartum coverage for 12 months after childbirth. We will continue to work toward guaranteeing access to essential care before, during, and after childbirth so that we can finally end the unconscionable maternal mortality crisis that we have in this country today. To support new moms struggling with postpartum depression, anxiety, or a substance use disorder, my Administration has launched the National Maternal Mental Health Hotline so that mothers can get confidential help from a professional right away by calling 1-833-TLC-MAMA.
Meanwhile, we are supporting the healing and recovery of domestic and sexual violence survivors. I wrote the original Violence Against Women Act years ago; today, we are bringing its funding to record levels, supporting shelters and rape crisis centers, addressing the needs of LGBTQI+ people and other underserved groups, and broadening protections for survivors.
This Women's Health Week, I encourage women across America to make their health a priority, and I promise that we are making it a national priority as well. To realize our potential as a land of possibilities, we have to protect and support the health of every woman and girl in our Nation and build a health care system that puts women, their lives, and their lived experiences at its center.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 12 through May 18, 2024, as National Women's Health Week. During this week, I encourage all Americans to join us in a collective effort to improve and support the health of women and girls and promote health equity for all. I encourage all women and girls to prioritize their health and catch up on any missed screenings, routine care, and vaccines.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this tenth day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# Mother's Day, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Today, we show gratitude to moms and mother-figures for loving their children unconditionally; raising them with care, courage, and grit; and leading by the power of their example.
On my desk in the Oval Office, I have a picture of my mother, Catherine Eugenia “Jean” Finnegan, in Grant Park on the night that President Barack Obama and I won the 2008 election. That night, my mother walked on
stage, took my and President Obama's hands, and said, “Come on honey, it's going to be okay.” That was my mother—fearless, caring, and ready to lend anyone the bravery that always resided in her heart. She taught my siblings and me that courage was the greatest virtue, instilled in us the belief that everyone is your equal, and inspired us to lead lives defined by honor and integrity.
I have also seen the way that my wife, First Lady Jill Biden, has put her whole heart into being a wonderful mother and grandmother. She brings our family so much joy and is the source of so many of our best memories. She has also guided our family forward through the most difficult times, always finding the strength to hold us together. Every day, she shares her heart with the students she teaches full time and so many others who find inspiration in her leadership, kindness, and wisdom.
Across the country, mothers are raising their children, caring for their families, and making history. Mothers are leaders in every field—from Main Street to Wall Street, they are driving innovation and strengthening our economy. They are the health care heroes, service members, and public servants, who sacrifice so much for all of us. They are the artists, journalists, engineers, and scientists creating new possibilities. They serve at the highest levels of my Administration, working hard to open the doors of opportunity wider for the next generation.
Moms do so much for all of us, and my Administration has their backs. During the pandemic, I signed the American Rescue Plan, which helped keep the doors open for 225,000 child care providers so families could go to work while their children were cared for. At the same time, we expanded the Child Tax Credit, giving moms and families some breathing room—which helped slash child poverty rates in half during my first year in office. My Administration is also making sure that the good-paying jobs from our once-in-a-generation investments in infrastructure and clean energy go to women, who have been underrepresented in these sectors for too long. I also signed legislation to ensure employers make reasonable accommodations for pregnant and nursing mothers, who deserve to have job security and common-sense workplace protections—such as breaks to drink water, eat, rest, or use the restroom. These protections help ensure that pregnant workers and new moms do not have to choose between their job and their health.
My Administration is working to make sure that mothers have access to the health care they need. With the leadership of Vice President Kamala Harris, we released a Blueprint for Addressing the Maternal Health Crisis, which outlines actions the Federal Government will take to combat maternal mortality and improve maternal health. Further, the American Rescue Plan also gave States the option to provide a full year of postpartum coverage to women on Medicaid, increasing it from just 60 days previously. Now, 46 States, Washington, D.C., and the United States Virgin Islands provide a full year of this critical care.
This Mother's Day, may we all show gratitude to our mothers, who are our rocks, believing in us so that we may believe in ourselves. May we pray for those who have lost their mothers and miss their comfort each day and for the mothers who have lost a child—a piece of their soul. May we wholeheartedly support the countless mothers across the country who work tirelessly to make the American Dream real for their children and families.
The Congress, by joint resolution approved May 8, 1914 (38 Stat. 770), has designated the second Sunday in May each year as “Mother's Day” and requested the President to call for its appropriate observance.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim May 12, 2024, as Mother's Day. I urge all Americans to express their love, respect, and gratitude to mothers everywhere. I call upon all citizens to observe this day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this tenth day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# 70th Anniversary of
Brown

# v.
Board of Education

# By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Seventy years ago, the Supreme Court delivered a unanimous decision in
Brown
v.
Board of Education
that outlawed racial segregation in our Nation's public schools, finding that “separate but equal” is “inherently unequal.” That landmark decision helped us move closer to realizing the idea that defines who we are as a Nation: We are all created equal and deserve to be treated equally throughout our lives. While our society has never fully lived up to that idea, we have never fully walked away from it either—and on this milestone anniversary, we promise we will not walk away from it now.
As we commemorate 70 years since
Brown
v.
Board of Education
changed our Nation, we also commemorate the important foundation that was laid in Delaware. A mother in Hockessin, joined by the parents of eight other students in Claymont, simply wanted their children to attend school and be treated with dignity and respect. Through
Bulah
v.
Gebhart
and
Belton
v.
Gebhart
, courageous lawyers and judges in Delaware—like Louis Redding and Chancellor Collins Seitz—helped lay the legal groundwork for the
Brown
v.
Board of Education
decision to strike down the insidious doctrine of separate but equal.
Brown
v.
Board of Education
may have opened up schools to all our Nation's students, but the fight to get these students into classrooms persisted. There were still people in power who wanted to pull America back to the past, doing everything they could to keep school doors shut to Black students. Our Nation will never forget the stories of the Little Rock Nine, the group of students who were refused entry to their local high school by the National Guard blocking the doors. We will never forget the story of Ruby Bridges, who at only six-years-old had to be escorted by United States Marshals to her elementary school because an angry mob tried to prevent her from entering. Across the country, Black students who entered newly desegregated schools endured discrimination, harassment, and racism from
their peers, educators, and school administrators. Yet, these students in the face of danger returned to class again and again, backed by community and civil rights leaders who were determined to take a stand for racial justice and equity that would benefit future generations of Americans. They showed us that bravery exists in the youngest of hearts, possessing the guts and courage to stand up for the best of our country. All the while, they kept faith in our Nation and in our North Star—the sacred ideals at the heart of who we are.
Today, we know that the lessons learned from
Brown
v.
Board of Education
served as a catalyst for the most fundamental civil rights legislation of our time like the 1964 Civil Rights Act and 1965 Voting Rights Act. But while the decision in
Brown
v.
Board of Education
has allowed so many schools to develop diverse, inclusive learning communities that value empathy, kindness, and tolerance, the full potential of
Brown
v.
Board of Education
remains unfulfilled. There is still so much work to do to ensure that every student has equal access to a quality education and that our school systems fully benefit from the diversity and talent of our students—because diversity has always been one of our Nation's greatest strengths.
Since I came into office, we have prioritized making our schools more equitable. My Administration secured nearly $2 billion in additional Title I funding under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act to help provide a high-quality education to our most underserved students. Additionally, my American Rescue Plan delivered historic funding to our Nation's schools, supporting critical programs that help level the playing field like after-school and summer programs. Further, after the Supreme Court effectively ended affirmative action in college admissions, I directed the Department of Education to analyze what practices help build more inclusive and diverse student bodies. At the same time, we are making sure to tell the full truth of our Nation's history, and I am proud to have signed a bill to expand the historic sites of
Brown
v.
Board of Education
National Historical Park, preserving this essential history.
On this milestone anniversary, may we honor the
Brown
v.
Board of Education
decision and all the people who have fought so hard to open classroom doors to every student. It is a reminder that the promise of America is big enough for everyone to succeed and that every generation of Americans has benefited by opening the doors of opportunity just a little bit wider to include those who have been left behind. Today, may we recognize the inherent value in having diverse, thriving schools and continue working together to build a future worthy of the dreams and aspirations of our Nation's students.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 17, 2024, as the 70th anniversary of
Brown
v.
Board of Education.
I call upon Americans to honor all the civil rights leaders, activists, educators, and students who have fought for decades to make our schools more equitable and work together to realize the promise of America for every American.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixteenth day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

Boating is a beloved American pastime—each year, nearly 100 million people find peace and freedom on our Nation's lakes, rivers, bays, and oceans. This week, as so many of us look forward to summer, we remind Americans to be safe and responsible on the water.
Taking basic steps to protect yourself and your loved ones can save lives. Everyone on board should wear a life jacket at all times. Boat operators should always check the weather forecast; bring maps and emergency communication tools; and wear their engine-cut-off switch lanyard, which will automatically stop the vessel if they slip or are thrown overboard. They should always boat sober. Operating a boat is like driving a car and demands full attention.
Americans who own a boat should meanwhile make sure it meets Federal safety standards. The civilian Coast Guard Auxiliary can send volunteers to inspect your boat and its safety equipment for free. Free courses on boat safety are available in all 50 States by qualified volunteer organizations, and many offer in-person and online trainings on important topics like boat handling, marine navigation, engine maintenance, weather prediction, and more.
This week, we thank every member of the United States Coast Guard and its Federal, State, Tribal, and local partners, who not only work to prevent boating accidents through education and safety boardings but also protect and rescue distressed mariners. They have helped save thousands of lives, and we can honor their brave service by each doing our own part in staying safe on the water.
In recognition of the importance of safe boating practices, the Congress, by joint resolution approved on June 4, 1958 (36 U.S.C. 131), as amended, has authorized and requested the President to proclaim annually the 7-day period before Memorial Day weekend as “National Safe Boating Week.”
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim May 18 through May 24, 2024, as National Safe Boating Week. I encourage all Americans who participate in boating activities to observe this occasion by learning more about safe boating practices and by taking advantage of boating safety education opportunities. I also encourage the Governors of the States and Territories, and appropriate officials of all units of government, to join me in encouraging boating safety in every community.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventeenth day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# National Emergency Medical Services Week, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
During National Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Week, we honor our Nation's courageous EMS providers, who put it all on the line to deliver urgent, life-saving care to people across our country in times of great need.
Whether paramedics, emergency medical technicians, 911 and 988 dispatchers, or other first responders, EMS providers routinely work long hours away from loved ones to keep other families whole. They risk their own lives and health, staring down storms, floods, or fires and rushing to rescue people in need. For many Americans, they are a beacon of hope in some of life's toughest moments and let us know we are going to be okay. We have a duty to show up for them the way they show up for us.
That is why my Administration is working to get every EMS department in America the equipment and support they deserve. During my first months in office, we passed the American Rescue Plan, investing billions of dollars to support EMS roles. Today, we are working with State, local, Tribal, and territorial governments to keep EMTs on the job and to help them handle trauma and burn out. We are working to get departments the resources they need to provide better training and equipment for EMS providers. To help ease staffing shortages, we are also helping communities recruit and train more firefighters, who often provide emergency medical services as well. We are fighting to ease the burden of student loans. In all, we have cancelled debt for 4.6 million student borrowers, including for nearly 900,000 public service workers by fixing the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, which many non-profit or government EMS provider employees could be eligible for.
I have often said that courage lies in every heart, and the expectation is that it will one day be summoned. It is summoned every day for America's EMS providers. They embody the best of our Nation—bravery, honor, and respect, never failing to answer the call to help others. This week, we thank them and the unions that protect so many of our EMS providers and promise to always have their backs.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 19 through May 25, 2024, as National Emergency Medical Services Week. I call upon public officials, doctors, nurses, paramedics, EMS providers, and all the people of
the United States to observe this week with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities to honor our brave EMS workers and to pay tribute to the EMS providers who have lost their lives in the line of duty.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventeenth day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.
Proclamation 10761 of May 17, 2024
Proc. 10761

# World Trade Week, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
This week, we recommit to ensuring that global trade reflects America's highest values: fairness, transparency, innovation, dignity, and opportunity for American workers, American businesses, and American families.
For decades, our country embraced trickle-down economics which rewarded wealth, not work. Companies took their jobs overseas to get cheaper labor. Factories closed down. Manufacturing slowed. Entire communities became hollowed out as American workers lost their paychecks and sense of pride.
My Administration is changing that. Since I came into office, we have focused on rebuilding our economy from the bottom up and middle out—not the top down. We have seen the results: We have created over 15 million jobs since I took office, including nearly 800,000 manufacturing jobs. Unemployment has been at under 4 percent for more than 2 years for the first time in more than 6 decades. A record 17 million Americans are starting small businesses. As a result of investments during my Administration, factories are coming back, producing everything from semiconductors to clean energy technology here at home. We have launched over 56,000 infrastructure projects across the country—rebuilding our Nation's roads, highways, bridges, railroads, ports, airports, and so much more.
As we rebuild at home, we are also ensuring American workers and businesses have a fair shot abroad. Together with 13 nations across the Indo-Pacific, we are creating a new Economic Framework that will strengthen our supply chains, raise labor standards, advance our clean energy transition, and combat the corruption that too often robs workers of a fair share of the value they create. I am taking action to protect American workers and businesses from China's unfair trade practices and ensure they compete on a level playing field, including increasing tariffs on $18 billion of imports from China to protect American workers and businesses. At the same time, we are working to increase trade with Kenya, Taiwan, and other partners around the world.
No region impacts the economic security of the United States more directly than the Western Hemisphere. Together with 11 partners, we have launched the Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity to build more
resilient supply chains, mobilize high-standard investments in our partners' economies, and ensure that trade-enabled growth means inclusive growth across all of our nations. My Administration is helping to better protect workers' rights, end unfair labor practices, and support free and fair union elections. For example, through the Partnership for Workers' Rights we launched with Brazil, we are taking collective action to promote workers' empowerment and end violations of workers' rights, which is key to achieving sustainable economic growth.
My Administration has launched historic trade initiatives with the European Union to promote clean manufacturing and create new jobs on both sides of the Atlantic. For example, through the Global Arrangement on Sustainable Steel and Aluminum, we are partnering to tackle non-market excess capacity and emissions intensity in the steel and aluminum sectors, which threaten the competitiveness of our workers and producers. Together, we created the U.S.-E.U. Trade and Technology Council that has deepened our cooperation on sustainable, high-standard trade.
The United States is also working with our partners to combat non-market policies and practices and structural overcapacity that distort global markets, create unfair competitive advantages, and lead to dependencies that make us vulnerable to coercion. From the G7 to our partnerships with developing countries and our engagement at the WTO, we are working across the board to protect our workers, industries, and economic security.
As my Administration takes these steps, American workers will remain front of mind. Through the first-ever Presidential Memorandum on Advancing Worker Empowerment, Rights, and High Labor Standards Globally, my Administration is making workers' rights central to all of our international economic partnerships and diplomacy, ensuring that workers get the dignity and opportunity they deserve. We are working to expand trade opportunities for communities that have too often been left behind—including helping small businesses compete in international markets through our new National Export Strategy and making it easier for small and medium sized businesses to access loans from the Export-Import Bank of the United States. The Department of Commerce launched a Global Diversity Export Initiative to help minority-owned businesses overcome barriers to entering international trade.
All across our country, American workers are writing the greatest comeback story our Nation has ever known. This week and every week, my Administration recommits to ensuring our trade supports them, protects them, and helps forge a better future for our Nation—one where no one is left behind and everyone gets a fair shot.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 19 through May 25, 2024, as World Trade Week. I call upon all Americans to observe this week and to celebrate with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventeenth day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

Proc. 10762

# Armed Forces Day, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Our Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Space Force, Coast Guard, National Guard, and Reserve Forces comprise the greatest fighting force the world has ever known. Throughout the annals of history, they have stood on the frontlines of freedom—risking everything to keep the light of liberty burning bright at home and around the globe. On Armed Forces Day, we honor their service. We remember their selfless sacrifices. We renew our solemn vow to them and their families, caregivers, and survivors.
Our Nation has many obligations but only one that is truly sacred: to train and equip those we send into harm's way and care for them and their families when they come home. Since I came into office, I have signed over 30 bipartisan bills to support our service members, our veterans, and their families. That includes the PACT Act—the most significant law in our Nation's history to help the millions of veterans who were exposed to toxic substances and burn pits during their military service. Further, we are working to ensure that service members and their families have access to the mental health care they need—an important step toward ending the silent scourge of suicide that has already taken too many lives.
At the same time, we are working to give service members, veterans, and their families some well-deserved breathing room. My Administration helped fix the student loan system, easing the burden of $160 billion of student debt for nearly 4.6 million Federal student loan borrowers through various actions. This year, I took the most comprehensive set of administrative actions in our Nation's history to support the economic security of military families, spouses, caregivers, and survivors. We are making it easier for military spouses to find work by making it easier for the Federal Government to hire them, encouraging employers to offer more flexible leave policies, and lowering the cost of child care for military families. Through the First Lady's Joining Forces Initiative, we are taking further action to support military and veteran spouses in finding and keeping good-paying jobs as well as health and wellness resources.
As Commander in Chief, I am committed to ensuring that every member of our military feels safe and respected—and that means ensuring inclusivity, dignity, and decency remain at the core of the culture of our Armed Forces. I am proud to have implemented historic, bipartisan reforms to our military justice system, which better protect victims and ensure prosecutorial decisions for sexual assault, domestic violence, and other crimes are fully independent from the chain of command. One of my earliest acts in office was to end the ban on transgender Americans serving openly in the military. My Administration will continue to stand up to all forms of harassment and hate within our ranks so that all our service members can thrive.
No matter how high the cost, how great the risk, or how heavy the burden—through long deployments and dangers, frequent moves and challenging trainings, and the many other unique burdens of serving our country—our Nation's Armed Forces have always met the moment. They exemplify the very best of our Nation. Today—and every day—let us honor their service, sacrifice, courage, and commitment. Let us continue to meet our sacred obligation to them and their families, caregivers, and survivors.
May God bless and protect our service members and veterans.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America and Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces of the United States, continuing the precedent of my predecessors in office, do hereby proclaim the third Saturday of each May as Armed Forces Day.
I direct the Secretary of Defense, on behalf of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Space Force, and the Secretary of Homeland Security, on behalf of the Coast Guard, to plan for appropriate observances each year, with the Secretary of Defense responsible for soliciting the participation and cooperation of civil authorities and private citizens. I invite the Governors of the States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and other areas subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to provide for the observance of Armed Forces Day within their respective jurisdictions each year in an appropriate manner designed to increase public understanding and appreciation of the Armed Forces of the United States. I also invite veterans, civic leaders, and other organizations to join in the observance of Armed Forces Day each year.
Finally, I call upon all Americans to display the flag of the United States at their homes and businesses on Armed Forces Day, and I urge citizens to learn more about military service by attending and participating in the local observances of the day.
Proclamation 10585 of May 19, 2023, is hereby superseded.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventeenth day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# National Hepatitis Testing Day, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Millions of Americans have viral hepatitis, an infection of the liver that can be cured or managed with the right treatment, but every year, it takes the lives of thousands of Americans who for too long did not realize that they were sick. Testing saves lives. On National Hepatitis Testing Day, we encourage folks everywhere to help spread the word and get tested, and we commit to continuing our work to get every American the high-quality health care they need to live long, healthy lives.
Hepatitis C, the most common strain of the disease, is spread through contact with infected blood. It can take years to cause noticeable symptoms, leaving many folks unaware that anything is wrong. As a result, they can unintentionally spread the virus; pregnant women with hepatitis C can, for example, pass it on to their newborns. Left untreated, it can lead to cirrhosis, liver failure, liver cancer, and even death. Fortunately for patients and their families, there is a cure that is 95 percent effective, once folks know to seek it. But it can be very expensive for people without health insurance, putting it out of reach for too many Americans in need, and that is wrong.
We have the tools to end this public health threat, saving thousands of lives. I have proposed a comprehensive plan that would speed up testing, increase access to life-saving medication, train more medical providers, and boost research into a vaccine. For example, my plan would simplify testing by accelerating the availability of point-of-care diagnostics, which means patients could be diagnosed in a single visit rather than having to follow up with multiple tests. It would launch an innovative subscription model for hepatitis C drugs, which would expand access to life-saving treatments for individuals who are uninsured, enrolled in Medicaid, eligible to receive healthcare from the Indian Health Service, or incarcerated. It would invest in health centers and programs that deliver hepatitis care and in training more health care professionals, including programs that serve Black and Native communities—who are disproportionately affected by hepatitis C. It also supports efforts to raise awareness of the critical benefits of testing and treatment, reaching out directly to communities with high infection rates, including people who are incarcerated or in drug treatment programs. My Budget proposes investments that would help prevent serious illness and avoid serious complications from hepatitis C so that we can save lives and finally end hepatitis C in America once and for all.
At the same time, we are working to prevent hepatitis B, the second most common strain of viral hepatitis, which ultimately contributes to as many as 25 percent of people dying prematurely from liver-related diseases. Over 600,000 Americans, many from Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander communities, are living with a chronic hepatitis B infection. The good news is that there is already a hepatitis B vaccine that can save lives. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urges all adults under 60 to be screened and vaccinated and for 30 years has recommended that children be vaccinated as well.
America has always been a place where we can get big things done together. That includes beating hepatitis once and for all. This work begins with every American taking steps to protect their own health by asking your health care provider about getting tested for hepatitis B and C and getting vaccinated for hepatitis B. My Administration will keep pushing to advance prevention, testing, treatment, and cures. Together, we can save lives.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 19, 2024, as National Hepatitis Testing Day. I encourage all Americans to join in activities that will increase awareness about viral hepatitis and what we can do to prevent and treat it.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventeenth day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# National Maritime Day, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Our Nation's merchant mariners embody the highest aspirations of our democracy, always answering our country's call with commitment and courage. Today, we honor their service and sacrifice. Together, we recommit to meeting our sacred obligation to care for them and their families.
Unbreaking and unbending in their devotion to duty, our merchant mariners have stood for our Nation's freedom and liberty throughout history—from delivering critical goods and troops to the battlefields of World War II to responding to devastating natural disasters around the world and shipping the goods and military cargo that keep our Nation safe and prosperous. Today, our merchant mariners are continuing this legacy of service, delivering humanitarian aid to people in need and transporting military equipment around the world. At the same time, merchant mariners are engines of our economy. They facilitate international trade and strengthen our supply chains by transporting billions of dollars of goods across oceans, seas, and waterways to the hands of American businesses and consumers.
Our merchant mariners have always met the moment—and my Administration will always have their backs. That is why we are ensuring that ships traveling between United States ports are American-built, American-owned, and American-crewed by enforcing the Jones Act. This will not only support American shipbuilding but will also support good union jobs. Meanwhile, we have made historic investments in our Nation's infrastructure, including rebuilding our ports so that they are safer, cleaner, and easier and more affordable to move through.
We also recognize that our merchant mariners are strongest when they reflect the full diversity of our Nation. My Budget proposes $191 million for the United States Merchant Marine Academy to educate and train the next generation of seagoing officers and maritime leaders. Additionally, my Administration established Every Mariner Builds A Respectful Culture Standards to prevent sexual assault and harassment and to support survivors.
Today, as we honor all that merchant mariners have done for our Nation, we also recognize the mariners who have made the ultimate sacrifice for our Nation. We owe these fallen heroes a debt of gratitude we can never fully repay. But our Nation will never forget their legacy and that of every mariner who has dared all, risked all, and given all for our Nation.
The Congress, by a joint resolution approved May 20, 1933, has designated May 22 of each year as “National Maritime Day” to commemorate the first
transoceanic voyage by a steamship in 1819 by the S.S. Savannah. By this resolution, the Congress has authorized and requested the President to issue annually a proclamation calling for its appropriate observance. I also request that all ships sailing under the American flag dress ship on that day.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim May 22, 2024, as National Maritime Day. I call upon all Americans to observe this day and to celebrate the United States Merchant Marine and maritime industry with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-first day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# Prayer for Peace, Memorial Day, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
This Memorial Day, we honor the brave women and men who made the ultimate sacrifice for our Nation's freedom. We recommit to keeping our sacred obligation to their survivors, families, and caregivers. Together, we vow to honor their memories by carrying on their work to forge a more perfect Union.
Since our Nation's founding, members of our Armed Forces have been willing to lay down their lives—not for a person or a place but for an idea unlike any other in human history: the idea of the United States of America. We are the only Nation in the world founded on the idea that we are all created equal and deserve to be treated equally throughout our entire lives. Generations of America's beloved daughters and sons have dared all, risked all, and given all for this idea. Today, as they lie in eternal peace, we continue to live by the light of liberty they kept burning bright.
To all those grieving the loss of a loved one who wore the uniform, including our Gold Star Families, and to all those who have a loved one still missing or unaccounted for: Our country sees you and mourns with you. I know how painful this day can be—how it can bring you back to the day you lost a piece of your soul. It is overwhelming. No words can ease that grief. But I hope you find a small measure of solace in knowing that we will never forget the price your loved one paid for our freedom—and we will never stop trying to repay the debt of gratitude we owe you and them.
That is our vow today—and that is our vow always. May God bless our fallen heroes. May God bring comfort to their families. May God protect our troops.
In honor and recognition of all of our fallen service members, the Congress, by a joint resolution approved May 11, 1950, as amended (36 U.S.C. 116),
has requested that the President issue a proclamation calling on the people of the United States to observe each Memorial Day as a day of prayer for permanent peace and designating a period on that day when the people of the United States might unite in prayer and reflection. The Congress, by Public Law 106-579, has also designated 3:00 p.m. local time on that day as a time for all Americans to observe, in their own way, the National Moment of Remembrance.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim Memorial Day, May 27, 2024, as a day of prayer for permanent peace, and I designate the hour beginning in each locality at 11:00 a.m. of that day as a time when people might unite in prayer and reflection. I urge the press, radio, television, and all other information media to cooperate in this observance. I further ask all Americans to observe the National Moment of Remembrance beginning at 3:00 p.m. local time on Memorial Day.
I request the Governors of the United States and its Commonwealths and Territories, and the appropriate officials of all units of government, to direct that the flag be flown at half-staff until noon on this Memorial Day on all buildings, grounds, and naval vessels throughout the United States and in all areas under its jurisdiction and control. I encourage families, friends, and neighbors to post tributes to our fallen service members through the Veterans Legacy Memorial at vlm.cem.va.gov so that we may learn more about the lives and contributions of those buried in National, State, and Tribal veteran cemeteries. I also request the people of the United States to display the flag at half-staff from their homes for the customary forenoon period.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fourth day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# Black Music Month, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
During Black Music Month, we celebrate the Black artists and creatives whose work has so often been a tidal wave of change—not only by defining the American songbook and culture but also by capturing our greatest hopes for the future and pushing us to march forward together.
Our Nation has only recognized Black Music Month for 45 years, but its legacy stretches back to our country's earliest days. Black music began when enslaved people, who were cruelly prohibited from communicating in their native languages, found ways to express themselves through music. Set to the sound of African rhythms, they captured the inhumanity, tragedy, and toll that America's original sin took on their lives while also telling the stories of their hopes and dreams, faith and spirituality, and love
and purpose. Ever since, Black performers have carried on that tradition of using art to break down barriers, create sacred spaces for expression, and give voice to the promise of America for all Americans. They have created and shaped some of our most beloved genres of music—like folk, blues, jazz, hip-hop, country, rock and roll, gospel, spirituals, and R
B. Black music has set the beat of the Civil Rights Movement; expressed the inherent dignity and captured the pride and power of Black communities; and held a mirror to the good, the bad, and the truth of our Nation.
Black music is a staple of American art and a powerhouse of our culture—that is why we must continue to open doors for the next generation of Black artists. Since I came into office, I have had the honor of bestowing some of our Nation's highest awards to some of our most important Black performers and producers like Gladys Knight, Berry Gordy, Tania León, Queen Latifah, Dionne Warwick, and more—uplifting their talent and inspiring others to follow their example. After making Juneteenth a National Holiday, I also hosted the first Juneteenth concert on the South Lawn—where the voices of Jennifer Hudson, Audra McDonald, Ledisi, and other incredible performers reminded us all of the beauty of Black music and Black culture that is American music and American culture. Last year, Vice President Kamala Harris hosted the first-ever hip-hop house party at the Vice President's Residence. At the same time, I have helped secure over $100 million to keep concert halls, theaters, and other venues afloat during the pandemic. In my Budget, I ask for a total of over $400 million for the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities—that includes funding for arts programs in underserved communities.
Black music embodies the best of American art—inspiring us, challenging us, and bringing us together. This month, may we show gratitude to all the Black artists, whose work speaks to the soul of who we are, shows us the way forward together, and reminds us to lift every voice.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2024 as Black Music Month. I call upon public officials, educators, and all the people of the United States to observe this month by honoring Black musicians and raising awareness and appreciation of Black music.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, and Intersex Pride Month, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
During Pride Month, we celebrate the extraordinary courage and contributions of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, and Intersex (LGBTQI+) community. We reflect on the progress we have made so far in pursuit of equality, justice, and inclusion. We recommit ourselves to do more to support LGBTQI+ rights at home and around the world.
For generations, LGBTQI+ Americans have summoned the courage to live authentically and proudly—even when it meant putting their lives and livelihoods at risk. In 1969 at the Stonewall Inn in New York, brave LGBTQI+ individuals protested the violence and marginalization they faced, boosting a civil rights movement for the liberation of LGBTQI+ people that has transformed our Nation. Since then, courageous LGBTQI+ Americans continue to inspire and bring hope to all people seeking a life true to who they are. LGBTQI+ people also continue to enrich every aspect of American life as educators, entertainers, entrepreneurs, athletes, actors, artists, scientists, scholars, diplomats, doctors, service members, veterans, and so much more.
Advancing equality for the LGBTQI+ community is a top priority for my Administration. I signed the historic Respect for Marriage Act, which protects the marriage of same-sex and interracial couples. As Commander in Chief, I was proud to have ended the ban on transgender Americans serving in the United States military. I signed historic Executive Orders strengthening civil rights protections for housing, employment, health care, education, and the justice system. We are also combating the dangerous and cruel practice of so-called “conversion therapy” and implementing a national strategy to end the HIV epidemic in this country. We ended the disgraceful practice of banning gay and bisexual men from donating blood. We are doing this work here at home and around the globe, where LGBTQI+ community members are fighting for recognition of their fundamental human rights and seeking to live full lives, free from hate-fueled violence and discrimination.
But for all the progress, we know real challenges persist. Last year, as we celebrated Pride Month on the South Lawn of the White House, I had the honor of meeting survivors of the Club Q and Pulse shootings, which tragically took the lives of LGBTQI+ Americans. Although my Administration passed the most significant gun law in nearly 30 years, the Congress must do its part and ban assault weapons. At the same time, families across the country face excruciating decisions to relocate to a different State to protect their children from dangerous and hateful anti-LGBTQI+ laws, which target transgender children, threaten families, and criminalize doctors and nurses. These bills and laws attack our most basic values and freedoms as Americans: the right to be yourself, the right to make your own medical decisions, and the right to raise your own children. Some things should never be put at risk: your life, your safety, and your dignity.
To the entire LGBTQI+ community—and especially transgender children—please know that your President and my entire Administration have your back. We see you for who you are: made in the image of God and deserving of dignity, respect, and support. That is why I have taken historic action to protect the LGBTQI+ community. We are ensuring that the LGBTQI+ community is protected against discrimination when accessing health care, and the Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Homeland Security, and Department of Justice launched a safety partnership to provide critical training and support to the community, including resources to help report hate crimes and better protect festivals, marches, community centers, businesses, and health care providers serving the community. The Department of Education and the Department of Justice are also addressing whether book bans may violate Federal civil rights laws when they target LGBTQI+ students or students of color and create hostile classroom environments. Additionally, we are providing specialized services through the nationwide crisis hotline for LGBTQI+ youth who feel isolated and overwhelmed—anyone who needs help can call 988 and then press 3 to be connected to a professional counselor. We are committing more resources for mental health programs that help families support and affirm their kids and are starting a new Federal initiative to address LGBTQI+ homelessness. We finalized new regulations requiring States to protect LGBTQI+ kids in foster care.
America is the only Nation in the world founded on an idea: We are all created equal and deserve to be treated equally throughout our lives. We have never fully lived up to that idea, but we have never fully walked away from it either. This month, we recommit to realizing the promise of America for all Americans, to celebrating courageous LGBTQI+ people, and to taking pride in the example they set for our Nation and the world.

# National Caribbean American Heritage Month, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
During National Caribbean American Heritage Month, we celebrate the contributions and the diverse cultures of the millions of people across our Nation with Caribbean heritage, who have never let us walk away from our Nation's most sacred values of opportunity and freedom.
Caribbean Americans are dreamers and doers, always finding ways to push our country forward, reach new heights, and forge a more perfect Union. From the Caribbean Americans who helped build our country from the ground up to those who have only just arrived, they have all believed in the possibilities our country has to offer and strengthened the diverse fabric of our Nation. Above all, Caribbean Americans are leaders—they are our beloved doctors, nurses, teachers, athletes, artists, community organizers, entrepreneurs, and our service members and first responders, who put their lives on the line to keep the rest of us safe. I am especially proud of the Caribbean Americans serving across my Administration and working hard to sustain our democracy—including Vice President Kamala Harris, Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas, and White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre.
My Administration recognizes that, to keep the torch of liberty that has led generations of immigrants to America burning bright, we must keep ensuring that everyone has a fair shot and access to opportunity. And we are delivering. My Administration has powered a historic economic recovery that created 15 million jobs, achieved the fastest creation rate of Black-owned businesses in more than 30 years, and broke records as Latino entrepreneurs have started new businesses at the fastest rate in over 10 years.
Caribbean Americans also form the foundation of our country's partnerships with nations across the Caribbean as we work to advance opportunity and security across the region. My Administration announced over $275 million in Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding for projects in the U.S. Virgin Islands that will deliver clean and safe water, access to high-speed internet, public transit, and modern roads and bridges. We launched the Puerto Rico Economic Dialogue and made more than $140 billion in Federal obligations, which have driven the island's economic turnaround. Since I came into office, Puerto Rico has added more than 100,000 new jobs and unemployment reached a historic low of under six percent. We are continuing to work with Caribbean countries to tackle climate change and support clean energy development. In partnership with the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), we launched the Crime Gun Intelligence Unit to combat firearms trafficking. Last summer, my Administration appointed a Coordinator for Caribbean Firearms Prosecutions to lead our efforts to stem firearms trafficking in the Caribbean. Meanwhile, we have been working with CARICOM to restore stability and security in Haiti by facilitating meaningful and inclusive political dialogue and supporting the deployment of the Kenyan-led Multinational Security Support mission. We must complement our security investments with economic support. This is why my
Administration supports the reauthorization of the HOPE/HELP trade preferences program in order to spur greater economic prosperity in Haiti.
At the same time, we have been working since day one of my Administration to fix the broken immigration system so that it is safe, orderly, and humane—especially for those in the Caribbean community who are fleeing oppressive rule and trying to escape gang violence to ensure a better life for them and their families. We are working to expand lawful pathways to the United States for Caribbean individuals and establish a faster process for deciding claims of asylum for people who are credibly seeking protection from persecution. My Administration will continue to do everything we can, including calling on the Congress to finally act and pass critical resources and reforms.
America was founded on the idea that all people are created equal and deserve to be treated equally throughout their lives. That promise beats in the hearts of all Caribbean Americans, who have added new meaning to our Nation's founding values. That idea is what connects us to all the Caribbean nations and territories working toward a future rooted in freedom and democracy. This month, may we celebrate all that Caribbean heritage, history, and contributions have meant to our Nation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2024 as National Caribbean American Heritage Month. I encourage all Americans to join in celebrating the history, culture, and achievements of Caribbean Americans with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# National Homeownership Month, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Owning a home is about more than putting a roof over your family's head—it is part of the American Dream. For generations, it has been a pathway to the middle class, an opportunity to build community and to pass down wealth to your children. But too many Americans today still struggle to buy a home. This National Homeownership Month, we recommit to giving every American a fair shot at that dream.
Whether they rent or buy, Americans deserve a safe place to call home. That is why when I signed the American Rescue Plan during the pandemic, we made sure it kept six million families in their homes by preventing foreclosures and evictions. Today, we are seeing fewer foreclosures than at
any time in decades; and more people own homes now than did before the pandemic. But we have more to do.
My Administration is delivering on the most consequential housing plan in more than 50 years, lowering costs now and for the future. We have already saved approximately 850,000 homeowners $800 per year with Federal Housing Authority (FHA) mortgages. We are providing financial assistance to help homeowners repair and upgrade their homes, by doing things like removing toxic lead pipes. Through my Inflation Reduction Act—the largest climate bill in history—we are lowering families' utility costs by helping them make their homes more modern, energy-efficient, and climate-resilient. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is helping Americans to access resources that help avoid foreclosure and eviction and that promote homeownership, financial literacy, and financial planning.
For new homeowners, my plan proposes a tax credit of $5,000 per year for the next 2 years for any family earning under $200,000—money they can put toward a mortgage when they buy their first home or trade up for more space. My plan would also provide first-generation homebuyers with $25,000 for a down payment. The Federal Housing Finance Agency is running a pilot program to make it more affordable to refinance your home by eliminating title insurance fees on certain federally backed mortgages, which would save folks $1,500 at closing. The FHA is now considering positive rental history when making decisions about creditworthiness—ensuring that the people who could qualify for mortgage financing receive it. We are also working to advance fair housing, including by rooting out bias in the home appraisal process, which keeps too many Black and Brown families from enjoying the full financial returns of homeownership.
To ensure affordable housing is available long-term, we also have to increase supply—and that means building new homes. With help from the Congress, my Administration has cut red tape so more builders can get Federal financing for new projects. Thanks in part to these efforts, a record 1.7 million new housing units are now under construction nationwide. My new plan would build two million more affordable homes, including 400,000 that would be for-sale, rather than for rent, through the creation of the Neighborhood Homes Tax Credit. My Administration is also making it easier for communities to use Federal financing to build and renovate, or convert spaces like empty offices or hotels into housing.
Across the country, Americans are today writing one of the greatest comeback stories ever told. Not only are we getting shovels in the ground and building homes for the next generation, but we are also seeing more people buy homes for the first time—taking that next step toward long-term security for themselves and their families. Today, more folks can feel that pride of getting their first home, pride in settling down with their families in a new home, pride in our communities and pride in America. We are going to keep creating those new cycles of hope.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2024 as National Homeownership Month. I call upon the people of this Nation to safeguard the American Dream by ensuring that everyone has access to an affordable home in a community of their choice.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# National Ocean Month, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
This National Ocean Month, we celebrate the wonder and power of our magnificent ocean and recommit to protecting and conserving it for generations to come. The ocean powers millions of jobs; feeds and sustains us; and is a rejuvenating source of inspiration, exploration, and recreation. Its rich ecosystems of marine animals, plants, and other species have been stewarded by Tribal Nations and Indigenous communities since time immemorial. And protecting and caring for the ocean is critical to tackling the existential threat of our time: climate change.
Today, the ocean is facing unprecedented threats. Record-breaking ocean temperatures, together with pollution and ocean acidification, have forced marine life from their historic habitats, damaging ecosystems and straining communities who rely on the ocean for sustenance and work. Rising sea levels and warmer ocean waters have also endangered food supply chains and contributed to increasingly dangerous storms, which devastate coastal communities.
That is why my Administration is taking aggressive action to deliver the most ambitious climate agenda in history. We launched the Nation's first Ocean Climate Action Plan, a bold and coordinated effort to address the climate crisis. We are protecting and restoring key coastal habitats, such as marshes, mangroves, seagrass beds, coral reefs, and more, helping protect communities on land, reduce the impact of natural disasters along our shores, and protect biodiversity.
With historic investments from my Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we are expanding offshore wind projects so that we have enough capacity to power 10 million homes by 2030 while creating good-paying jobs. Meanwhile, as we launch tens of thousands of projects to modernize our Nation's infrastructure, we are working to lower the carbon footprint of cargo ships, build cleaner supply chains, and reduce pollution. We are cracking down on illegal fishing and strengthening sustainable fisheries so that we protect hardworking Americans who rely on our ocean to make a living.
My Administration has also been working tirelessly to fulfill our goal of protecting and conserving at least 30 percent of America's lands and waters, including our ocean. To that end, I took executive action to consider designating more than 700,000 square miles of the Pacific Ocean southwest of Hawaii as a new National Marine Sanctuary—which could
make this one of the largest marine protected areas on the planet. If the sanctuary is completed, it would conserve significant natural and cultural resources and honor the traditional practices and ancestral pathways of Pacific Island voyagers. My Administration is also carefully evaluating the potential Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary, the first Indigenous-led nomination for a National Marine Sanctuary. Through the first-ever United States Ocean Justice Strategy and my Investing in America agenda, we are bringing environmental justice to communities that have suffered the consequences of climate change and pollution for too long—including millions of dollars in investments for ocean debris prevention and removal through my Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and funding for communities to restore their coasts through my Inflation Reduction Act.
This National Ocean Month, let us remember our responsibility to our environment and recommit to conserving, protecting, and restoring the bounty and beauty of our ocean.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2024 as National Ocean Month. I call upon Americans to take action to protect, conserve, and restore our ocean and coasts.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# Adjusting Imports of Steel Into the United StatesBy the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
1. On January 11, 2018, the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) transmitted to the President a report on the Secretary's investigation into the effect of imports of steel mill articles (steel articles) on the national security of the United States under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1862). The Secretary found and advised the President of the Secretary's opinion that steel articles are being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States.
2. In Proclamation 9705 of March 8, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Steel Into the United States), the President concurred in the Secretary's finding that steel articles, as defined in clause 1 of Proclamation 9705, as amended by clause 8 of Proclamation 9711 of March 22, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Steel Into the United States), are being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States, and decided to adjust the imports of those steel articles by imposing a 25 percent ad valorem tariff on such
articles imported from all countries except Canada and Mexico. The proclamation further stated that any country with which the United States has a security relationship is welcome to discuss with the United States alternative ways to address the threatened impairment of the national security caused by imports from that country, and noted that, should the United States and any such country arrive at a satisfactory alternative means to address the threat to the national security such that the President determines that imports from that country no longer threaten to impair the national security, the President may remove or modify the restriction on steel articles imports from that country and, if necessary, adjust the tariff as it applies to other countries, as the national security interests of the United States require.
3. In Proclamation 10403 of May 27, 2022 (Adjusting Imports of Steel Into the United States), I suspended the tariffs set forth in Proclamation 9705 for the import of steel articles and derivative steel articles from Ukraine for 1 year. In Proclamation 10588 of May 31, 2023 (Adjusting Imports of Steel Into the United States), I extended the suspension of tariffs for an additional year and expanded the scope of Proclamation 10403 to include the suspension of tariffs on steel articles from Ukraine further processed in countries that are members of the European Union. In both proclamations, I also instructed the Secretary to monitor the situation in the domestic steel industry and developments in Ukraine's steel industry and inform me of any need to terminate or extend this suspension.
4. The Secretary has informed me that the situation with regard to Ukraine's steel industry has not changed since the issuance of Proclamation 10403 or Proclamation 10588. Ukraine's steel industry continues to be significantly disrupted by the Russian Federation's unjustified, unprovoked, unyielding, and unconscionable war against Ukraine. The significant disruption in Ukraine's steel production has decreased the total amount of steel produced by Ukraine. The amount of steel imported into the United States from Ukraine decreased in 2023 compared to 2022, and it is still below the average import volume prior to 2021. In 2023 the amount of steel imported into the United States from Ukraine accounted for less than 1 percent of all steel imports into the United States. At the same time, the steel industry has been historically important to Ukraine, and both the United States and Ukraine have an interest in maintaining that industry as an economic lifeline while the country recovers. The Secretary has also informed me that the United States and Ukraine continue to be engaged in broad security discussions. The current disruption of Ukrainian steel production has been part of those discussions, and the ongoing discussion is anticipated to include alternative measures to prevent imports of steel from Ukraine from threatening the national security of the United States as Ukraine's steel production recovers from the significant disruption caused by the war.
5. In light of the Secretary's findings, I conclude that Ukraine's present situation remains a special case and that an extension of the suspension of tariffs in Proclamation 10403, as extended and expanded by Proclamation 10588, is warranted. The Secretary shall continue to monitor the situation in the domestic steel industry and developments in Ukraine's steel industry and inform me of any need to terminate or extend this suspension.
6. In light of my determination to adjust the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9705 as applied to eligible steel articles and derivative steel articles that are the product of Ukraine, I have considered whether it is necessary and appropriate in light of our national security interests to make any corresponding adjustments to such tariff as it applies to products of other countries. I have determined that it is necessary and appropriate, at this time, to maintain the current tariff level as it applies to products of other countries.
7. Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, authorizes the President to adjust the imports of an article and its derivatives that are being imported into the United States in such quantities or under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security.
8. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) the substance of statutes affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, do hereby proclaim as follows:

A Proclamation
America is the only country in the world with a heart and soul that draws from old and new. We are home to people whose ancestors have been here for thousands of years and home to people from every place on Earth. Some people came freely, some came chained by force, some came when famine struck or to flee persecution, and some came to chase dreams that are only possible here in America. We all come from somewhere, but we are all Americans. This month, we honor the contributions and celebrate the remarkable courage of our Nation's immigrants, whose hopes and dreams helped found this country and continue to push us forward today.
My own family came to America in the mid-1800s, when famine struck their homeland in Ireland. The Finnegans of County Louth and the Blewitts of County Mayo traveled across an ocean, landing on America's shores with an unbending belief in the possibilities our Nation had to offer. Vice President Kamala Harris' parents emigrated from India and Jamaica to pursue their education in medicine and economics. So many Americans share a similar story—their families leaving everything behind to pursue the American Dream and working tirelessly to build good lives for themselves and good futures for their families.
Immigrants keep our economy strong and help drive the success of our Nation. They ensure our safety as first responders and military service members; they maintain the health of our communities as doctors and nurses; they are there for our family members and children as educators and care workers; they feed and fuel our population as more than half of the Nation's farmworkers; they are one in five of our business owners; and they are leaders in technology, philanthropy, and media. All told, they contribute hundreds of billions of dollars in taxes each year and create millions of jobs. The ingenuity, grit, and perseverance of immigrants are driving forces in every aspect of American life.
On day one of my Administration, I sent a comprehensive plan to the Congress to fix our broken immigration system. It aimed to expand legal pathways of immigration; provide protections for Dreamers and others who contribute to this country; and address the violence, corruption, and instability that leads many to flee their homes. My Administration has worked tirelessly to strengthen our legal immigration system and support those who are here. We have rebuilt the United States Refugee Admissions Program, which once again serves as a beacon for displaced persons around the world. We continue to vigorously defend the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) policy, which has allowed more than 800,000 Dreamers to live and work in the place they call home, against attacks in the courts. For the first time ever, we have extended Affordable Care Act coverage to DACA recipients. We have also expanded legal pathways for people from Venezuela, Cuba, Nicaragua, and Haiti and instituted reunification programs so that families stay together while they complete the immigration process. My Administration will continue to do everything we
can, but we need the Congress to take action and provide funding and resources necessary to secure our border and reform our immigration system.
As Americans, we have an obligation to ensure that everyone feels safe and respected. We must give hate no safe harbor. But too often, immigrant communities remain the target of bias and discrimination. That is why my Administration is fighting against the rise of all forms of hate. In 2021, I signed the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, making it easier to report hate crimes, and I also established the White House Initiative on Hate-Motivated Violence to counter these types of attacks and foster national unity.
During my trip to Ireland last year, I walked the streets my ancestors used to walk and looked out at the ocean they crossed two centuries earlier to reach America. For hundreds of years, people from around the world have made the courageous trek to our Nation's soil. They are drawn to our shores by the American idea that we are all created equal and deserve to be treated equally throughout our lives. We have never fully lived up to that promise, but we have never walked away from it either. This month—and every month—may we recommit to keeping lit the torch of liberty that has led generations of immigrants to America.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2024 as National Immigrant Heritage Month. I call upon the people of the United States to learn more about the history of our Nation's diverse and varied immigrant communities and to observe this month with appropriate programs and activities that remind us of the values of diversity, equity, and inclusion.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.
Proclamation 10773 of June 3, 2024
Proc. 10773

# Securing the BorderBy the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
There are more people around the world who are displaced from their homes today than at any point in time since World War II. Many factors have contributed to this problem. Failing regimes and dire economic conditions afflict many countries, including several in the Western Hemisphere. Violence linked to transnational criminal organizations has displaced substantial numbers of people in Latin America. The global COVID-19 pandemic upended societies around the globe. Natural disasters have forced people from their homes.
As a result of these global conditions, we have been experiencing substantial levels of migration throughout the Western Hemisphere, including at our southwest land border. In 2019, encounters nearly doubled from their
2018 level to almost 1 million. In 2020, the global COVID-19 pandemic led countries throughout the world to shut their borders and suspend international travel; however, once the pandemic began to recede, international travel resumed, and we again experienced elevated levels of migration throughout the Western Hemisphere, including at our southwest land border.
On May 11, 2023, as part of my Administration's work to prepare for the end of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's public health order under title 42, United States Code, and to return to processing all noncitizens under immigration authorities under title 8, United States Code (title 8), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) issued a final rule, entitled Circumvention of Lawful Pathways (Lawful Pathways rule), encouraging the use of lawful pathways and imposing a rebuttable presumption of asylum ineligibility on those who do not use them.
The Lawful Pathways rule was designed to address the high levels of migration throughout the Western Hemisphere and further discourage irregular migration by encouraging migrants to use lawful, safe, and orderly processes for entering the United States or to seek protection in other partner nations; imposing a presumptive condition on asylum eligibility for those who fail to do so; and supporting the swift return of those who do not have valid protection claims.
As a complement to the Lawful Pathways rule and associated enforcement efforts, the Department of State and DHS have taken significant steps to expand safe and orderly pathways for migrants to enter the United States lawfully. Those steps include establishing Safe Mobility Offices in Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, and Guatemala to facilitate access to lawful pathways; expanding country-specific and other available processes to seek parole on a case-by-case basis for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit; expanding access to visa programs for seasonal employment; establishing a mechanism for noncitizens to schedule a time and place to present at ports of entry in a safe, orderly, and lawful manner through the CBP One mobile application; and expanding refugee admissions from the Western Hemisphere from 5,000 in Fiscal Year 2021 to up to 50,000 in Fiscal Year 2024.
The Lawful Pathways rule and these complementary measures have made a substantial impact. On May 12, 2023, DHS returned to processing all noncitizens under title 8 immigration authorities and is processing noncitizens at record scale and efficiency. Since then, my Administration has maximized the use of expedited removal to the greatest extent possible given limited resources, placing more than 970 individuals encountered at and between ports of entry at the southwest land border into the process each day on average and conducting more than 152,000 credible fear interviews, both of which are record highs. As a result, from May 12, 2023, to May 1, 2024, my Administration removed or returned more than 720,000 noncitizens who did not have a lawful basis to remain in the United States, the vast majority of whom crossed the southwest land border. Total removals and returns in the 12 months following May 12, 2023, exceeded removals and returns in every full Fiscal Year since 2010. The majority of all individuals encountered at the southwest land border from Fiscal Year 2021 to Fiscal Year 2023 were removed, returned, or expelled.
Despite these efforts, and after months of reduced encounter levels following the changes put in place after May 12, 2023, encounter levels increased toward the end of 2023, and December 2023 saw the highest level of encounters between ports of entry in history, as increasing numbers of people migrated through the Western Hemisphere. The challenges presented by this surge in migration, which would have been even worse had the Lawful Pathways rule and other measures not been in place, were compounded by the fact that the surge was focused increasingly on western areas of the border in California and Arizona that are geographically remote, challenging to address, and without sufficient pre-existing infrastructure or resources to respond to the surge. From January to March 2024, encounters decreased from and have remained below levels experienced in November and December 2023, including as a result of increased enforcement by the United States and partner countries. However, the factors that are driving the unprecedented movement of people in our hemisphere remain, and there is still a substantial and elevated level of migration that continues to pose significant operational challenges.
The current situation is also the direct result of the Congress's failure to update an immigration and asylum system that is simply broken—and not equipped to meet current needs. While my Administration has vigorously enforced the law within the constraints imposed by the existing system, the statutory framework put in place by the Congress is outdated. For the vast majority of people in immigration proceedings, the current laws make it impossible to quickly grant protection to those who require it and to quickly remove those who do not establish a legal basis to remain in the United States. This reality is compounded by the fact that the Congress has chronically underfunded our border security and immigration system and has failed to provide the resources or reforms it needs to be able to deliver timely consequences to most individuals who cross unlawfully and cannot establish a legal basis to remain in the United States.
Despite the strengthened consequences in place at our border through the Lawful Pathways rule and the related measures that have led to record returns and removals, encounter levels are exceeding our capacity to deliver those consequences in a timely manner due to the outdated laws and limited resources we have available.
My Administration has repeatedly asked the Congress to update the outdated and inadequate immigration statutes, to create a legal framework that is functional and addresses current realities, and to provide additional resources so that we can more effectively deliver consequences at the border. In August 2023, I requested more than $4 billion in additional funding for border security and related migration issues, including more than $2 billion for urgent DHS border management requirements. The Congress failed to act. In October 2023, I requested $13.6 billion for border enforcement and migration management. This request included more than $5 billion for DHS to manage conditions on the southern border, as well as funding for critical capacity enhancements to keep the southern border secure. The Congress once again failed to provide our border and immigration system with the resources it needs to deliver timely consequences to those who cross unlawfully.
In early February 2024, a bipartisan group of Senators introduced legislation (bipartisan legislative proposal) containing the toughest and fairest reforms of our asylum laws in decades that would have provided new authorities to significantly streamline and speed up immigration enforcement proceedings for individuals encountered at the border, including those who are seeking protection. Critically, the bipartisan legislative proposal included nearly $20 billion in additional resources for DHS and other departments to implement those new authorities, such as:
(a) over 1,500 new U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) personnel, including Border Patrol agents and CBP officers;
(b) over 4,300 new asylum officers and additional U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services staff to facilitate timely and fair decisions;
(c) 100 new immigration judge teams to help reduce the asylum caseload backlog and adjudicate cases more quickly;
(d) shelter and critical services for newcomers in our cities and States; and
(e) 1,200 new U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement personnel for functions including enforcement and deportations.
While the bipartisan legislative proposal did not include everything we wanted, senior officials from my Administration worked closely with the bipartisan group of Senators to ensure that the reforms would adequately address the challenges that we have been facing at our southern border for more than a decade. However, the Congress failed to move forward with this bipartisan legislative proposal.
The Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024 (Public Law 118-47) increased funding for DHS over Fiscal Year 2023, but it did not address the needs identified in various related supplemental requests, nor did it equip the Federal Government with the new authorities from the bipartisan legislative proposal. In May 2024, when the Senate again considered the bipartisan legislative proposal, the Senate failed to advance the measure.
Our broken immigration system is directly contributing to the historic migration we are seeing throughout the Western Hemisphere, exacerbated by poor economic conditions, natural disasters, and general insecurity, and this fact, combined with inadequate resources to keep pace, has once again severely strained our capacity at the border. The result is a vicious cycle in which our United States Border Patrol facilities constantly risk overcrowding, our detention system has regularly been at capacity, and our asylum system remains backlogged and cannot deliver timely decisions, all of which spurs more people to make the dangerous journey north to the United States.
The Congress's failure to deliver meaningful policy reforms and adequate funding, despite repeated requests that they do so, is a core cause of this problem. Under current law, whenever a noncitizen in expedited removal indicates an intention to apply for asylum or a fear of persecution, they are referred for an interview with an asylum officer and cannot be removed through expedited removal if there is a significant possibility that they could establish eligibility for asylum. This screening standard is a requirement imposed by the Congress, but it has not functioned well in predicting ultimate success in asylum proceedings. From 2014 to 2019, 83 percent of
individuals referred for an interview with an asylum officer passed the screening stage, meaning that they were not removed pursuant to expedited removal, but less than 25 percent of cases ultimately resulted in a grant of asylum or other protection, often after waiting years to reach a final decision. By imposing a rebuttable presumption of asylum ineligibility on those who cross the border unlawfully, the Lawful Pathways rule has made a meaningful impact in reducing this disparity. The screen-in rate from May 12, 2023, to March 31, 2024, dropped to 52 percent for individuals who are subject to the rebuttable presumption of asylum ineligibility. However, the Lawful Pathways rule alone is inadequate during times of record encounter levels and cannot change the underlying statutory limitations.
Data confirm that the system has been badly strained for many years and is not functioning to provide timely relief for those who warrant it or timely consequences for those without viable protection claims. Due to an outdated and inefficient system and insufficient resources that do not allow for prompt adjudication of claims, too many people have had to be processed by the Border Patrol and released with a notice to appear in removal proceedings before an immigration judge since May 2023. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service affirmative asylum backlog is now over 1 million cases and growing, with over 300,000 applications filed prior to 2021 still pending. At the end of Fiscal Year 2023, there were over 2.4 million cases pending in the immigration courts. Pending cases more than doubled from the end of Fiscal Year 2016 to the end of Fiscal Year 2020 and doubled again between that time and the end of Fiscal Year 2023. Between Fiscal Year 2006 and the end of Fiscal Year 2023, in tandem with historic increases in filings to initiate immigration court proceedings, the immigration courts' pending caseload increased from approximately 170,000 to approximately 2.46 million. During Fiscal Year 2023, immigration judges completed more cases than they ever had before in a single year, but more than twice as many cases were received by the immigration courts than were completed.
The status quo system—the result of outdated laws and inadequate resources—has become a driver for unlawful migration throughout the region and an increasingly lucrative source of income for dangerous transnational criminal organizations and other criminal smuggling organizations that, without countermeasures, will continue to grow in strength and pose significant threats to the safety and security of United States communities and migrants, as well as countries throughout the region.
Considering these trends and the decades-long failure of the Congress to address the problem through systemic reform and adequate funding, and following the Congress's failure to pass the bipartisan legislative proposal, I must exercise my executive authorities to meet the moment. This proclamation answers the call by suspending entry of noncitizens across the southern border during this time of high border crossings. Appropriate exceptions are provided, such as for those who are particularly vulnerable or present pursuant to a process the Secretary of Homeland Security determines is appropriate to allow for safe and orderly processing into the United States. That process will continue to allow for individuals to seek entry to this country each day in a safe and orderly manner, and following their arrival, to seek protection through the appropriate process. This proclamation, in conjunction with steps to be taken by DOJ and DHS, is needed to enhance our ability to address the historic levels of migration and more
efficiently process migrants arriving at the southern border given current resource levels.
These actions do not change or fully compensate for the fact that our immigration system is under-resourced and broken, nor do they change the fact that there are significant limits to what can be achieved without the Congress fulfilling its responsibility to help solve the unprecedented challenge that we are facing. No executive action can deliver the significant policy reforms and additional resources that were in the bipartisan legislative proposal. But I will continue to take actions, within these constraints, to address the situation at our southern border.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including sections 212(f) and 215(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1182(f) and 1185(a)) and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, hereby find that, absent the measures set forth in this proclamation, the entry into the United States of persons described in section 1 of this proclamation under circumstances described in section 2 of this proclamation would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and that their entry should be subject to certain restrictions, limitations, and exceptions.

# National Day of Remembrance of the 80th Anniversary of D-DayBy the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
On the evening of June 6, 1944, President Franklin D. Roosevelt broadcast a prayer for the Nation. At the time, war was raging in Europe, and Hitler controlled most of it. Freedom and democracy were under assault around the world. But on that day, hope had landed on the beaches of Normandy when 73,000 Americans joined the Allied forces to carry out one of the greatest military missions of all time—a mission that would become known as D-Day. Knowing the fate of the free world rested in their hands, President Roosevelt asked our Nation to pray for these courageous service members' strength as they “set upon a mighty endeavor, a struggle to preserve our Republic, our religion, and our civilization, and to set free a suffering humanity.” On the 80th anniversary of D-Day, may we thank these service members for their bravery and sacrifice. May we honor their heroism, which liberated a continent and saved the world. And may we recommit to the future they fought and which many died for.
The brave Airmen, Coast Guardsmen, Sailors, Soldiers, and Marines who fought on D-Day faced unparalleled resistance. Nazi Germany had reinforced the Atlantic Wall, lining miles of dangerous cliffs and rocky coastlines with landmines, beach and water obstacles, and machine gunners while also reinforcing its bunkers. So, when 7,000 vessels carrying nearly 160,000 service members from eight Allied countries approached Normandy, victory was never guaranteed. Our paratroopers that jumped behind enemy lines in the night and other military forces had to endure barrages of gunfire, trek through barbed wire, and climb steep sea walls. Over 2,500 Americans made the ultimate sacrifice, giving their lives so that the whole world might know freedom.
Today, we remember all the Americans who laid down their lives on D-Day to help end the tyranny of fascism across Europe, liberate oppressed peoples, and ensure the flame of liberty would burn bright around the world. Their success marked the beginning of the end of Nazi brutality, World War II, and the Holocaust—one of the darkest chapters in human history. It set the foundations of an enduring peace that still helps guide international cooperation and affairs today. We owe these service members, who represent the greatest of the Greatest Generation, as well as their families a debt of gratitude that we can never fully repay.
As we reflect on the sacrifices made on D-Day, we are reminded that freedom is not free and it has never been guaranteed. Every generation has to earn it, fight for it, and defend it in the battle between autocracy and democracy—between the greed of a few and the rights of many. Eighty years after our Nation's brave Airmen, Coast Guardsmen, Sailors, Soldiers, and Marines embarked on D-Day—and as Americans everywhere answered the call to prayer and filled their hearts and homes with hope—may we honor the faith they kept in our Nation and their legacy by upholding the future that they died for—one grounded in freedom, democracy, opportunity, and equality for all.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 6, 2024, as a National Day of Remembrance of the 80th Anniversary of D-Day. I call upon all Americans to observe this day with programs, ceremonies, and activities that honor those who fought and died so that men and women they had never met might know what it is to be free.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifth day of June, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

Proc. 10775

# Flag Day and National Flag Week, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
For people across America, our flag is a reminder of our Nation's founding principle. It stands for the sacred idea that we are all created equal and deserve to be treated equally throughout our lives. Our flag is also a reminder of our shared calling: to stand for the ideals our country was founded on—democracy, freedom, and justice for all. On Flag Day and during National Flag Week, we take pride in the promise and purpose represented by our Nation's flag.
Our country's flag was created in 1777, when America was still a new idea. Americans flew it at their homes during the Revolutionary War as brave troops fought for our country's independence from British rule—representing the resolve and resilience of our Nation's 13 colonies with 13 stripes and stars. As our Nation evolved, so too did our flag—with every new star added to Old Glory, we were reminded that the work of forging a more perfect Union never ends.
Ever since, our flag has served as a source of pride and inspiration. It has flown high on many battlefields, acting as a beacon of light and purpose at home and around the globe. It flies over military cemeteries where our country's service members have been laid to rest, reminding us of the unmoving faith they had in our Nation and the ultimate sacrifice they made. It flies over buildings, classrooms, and courthouses—across small towns, in big cities, and around the world—a constant reminder that democracy begins and will be preserved in the habits and the hearts of ordinary people and that we all share a responsibility to stand up for it each and every day.
Across the country, Americans are writing the greatest comeback story our Nation has ever known. They are finding new ways to lead America into a future of possibilities, helping build a democracy with dignity—one worthy of our dreams. On Flag Day and during National Flag Week, we honor all that the flag means to the American people and continue working to ensure that America is a land of possibilities for all. No matter how dark the
night, Americans will always pursue our Nation's North Star—our flag will always be there.
To commemorate the adoption of our flag in 1777, the Congress, by joint resolution approved on August 3, 1949, as amended (63 Stat. 492), designated June 14 of each year as “Flag Day” and requested the President issue an annual proclamation calling for its observance and for the display of the flag of the United States on all Federal Government buildings. The Congress also requested, by joint resolution approved June 9, 1966, as amended (80 Stat. 194), that the President issue annually a proclamation designating the week in which June 14 occurs as “National Flag Week” and calling upon all citizens of the United States to display the flag during that week.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim June 14, 2024, as Flag Day and the week starting June 9, 2024, as National Flag Week. I direct the appropriate officials to display the flag on all Federal Government buildings during this week, and I urge all Americans to observe Flag Day and National Flag Week by displaying the flag and honoring all of our brave service members and revering those who gave their last full measure of devotion defending our freedoms. I encourage the people of the United States to observe with pride and all due ceremony those days from Flag Day through Independence Day, set aside by the Congress (89 Stat. 211), as a time to honor the American spirit, to celebrate our history and the foundational values we strive to uphold, and to publicly recite the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventh day of June, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# World Elder Abuse Awareness Day, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Older Americans are the heart and soul of our families, our communities, and our Nation. But every year, up to five million older Americans face some form of abuse. Around the world, too many are denied the opportunity to age with dignity and security. During World Elder Abuse Awareness Day, we recommit to standing with elder abuse survivors, shedding light on this important issue, and creating a world in which no older person has to live in fear of violence, abuse, or neglect.
Elder abuse comes in many forms. It can include physical or emotional abuse and neglect, sexual violence, or financial exploitation. These and other abuses can leave older Americans with scars, both visible and invisible, that impact them for the rest of their lives. They can happen anywhere—at home, at a care facility, at work, or online.
Elder abuse goes against everything we stand for as a Nation—and my Administration is working relentlessly to stop it. To date, my Administration has dedicated over $430 million to Adult Protective Services, making it easier to investigate reports of elder abuse and give survivors the resources they need to heal—from emergency resources like food, shelter, and law enforcement protection to medical and mental health treatment, legal services, and financial assistance. My new Budget proposes a $30 million investment to sustain and strengthen these resources. Furthermore, I reauthorized the Violence Against Women Act and increased its funding to the highest levels to date—which includes funding for service providers, law enforcement, and prosecutors to respond to domestic and sexual violence experienced by older adults.
Concurrently, we are working to protect the savings that older Americans have worked their entire lives to build up. Last year alone, Americans over 60 years old lost over $3 billion to scams. In response, the Federal Trade Commission, the Federal Communications Commission, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and other regulatory agencies are taking aggressive action to identify and crack down on loan scams, mortgage scams, junk fees, and price gouging, which too often prey on older Americans.
Meanwhile, my Administration is working to ensure that older Americans have access to the quality care they deserve—whether they are at home or in another residential setting. By signing an Executive Order on Increasing Access to High-Quality Care and Supporting Caregivers, I took the most comprehensive set of executive actions in history to support family caregivers and care workers. Additionally, we are helping home care workers get a larger share of Medicaid payments. We are ensuring nursing homes have enough staff to guarantee every resident a safe, quality environment. My new Budget would also significantly expand Medicaid home care services to reduce the long waitlist, ensure nursing homes can be regularly audited for safety and quality, and empower more older Americans to live full lives in settings of their choice.
Globally, my Administration is ensuring that our partnerships with nations abroad reflect the same care for older people that we prioritize here at home. Through the Department of State, local law enforcement agencies are training their foreign counterparts in best practices to investigate elder abuse and support survivors. We are also working to implement our Strategy on Global Women's Economic Security, which includes a focus on expanding opportunities and protections for caregivers around the world, including older women. With our Strategy to Prevent and Respond to Gender-Based Violence Globally, we are tackling violence that affects older adults, particularly older women and widows.
This World Elder Abuse Awareness Day, let us remember the integral and irreplaceable role that older Americans have in our families, our communities, and our society. Let us recommit to ensuring that they can live with the comfort, dignity, and respect they earned and deserve. Let us celebrate the blessings of their wisdom, their contributions, and their love, which nurture who we are as people and shape all that we are as a Nation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 15, 2024, as World Elder Abuse Awareness Day. I encourage all Americans to be diligent; work
together to strengthen existing partnerships; and develop new opportunities to improve our Nation's prevention of and response to elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of June, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# Father's Day, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Every Father's Day, we pay tribute to the fathers and father figures in our lives who shower us with unconditional love and support. These men shape our character, help us reach our full potential, and believe in us so that we can believe in ourselves. Today, we honor their tremendous sacrifices, their unwavering devotion, and their tireless work to build better futures for our families.
When I was growing up, my father, Joseph Robinette Biden Sr., taught me lifelong values that I have tried to pass down to my own children and grandchildren. Among these many values, he taught me that every person deserves to be treated with dignity and respect. He taught me that our character is not measured by how many times or how hard we get knocked down; rather, it is measured by how quickly we get back up. He taught me that a job is not just about a paycheck—it is about dignity, pride, and self-worth. All these principles have not only shaped my perspective in life—they are also at the heart of my commitment to building an economy where every father can thrive.
That commitment begins by building an economy from the middle out and bottom up. Toward that aim, my Administration is creating new jobs in manufacturing, construction, clean energy, and more. We are rebuilding American infrastructure with American products built by American workers. We are creating good-paying jobs in people's hometowns so they can support a family without having to move.
At the same time, we also lowered the cost of health insurance premiums for millions of families, giving them some breathing room. We are cutting the cost of prescription drugs, giving Medicare the power to negotiate lower prices just like the Department of Veterans Affairs does for our veterans. We are trying hard to make child care more affordable and paid leave more accessible. We are working to ensure that our elderly fathers and grandfathers can live their lives with the dignity they deserve by protecting Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid while strengthening access to home care services.
This Father's Day, my heart is also with all the children who have tragically lost a father figure and the fathers who have tragically lost a child.
Though the grieving process never truly ends, I know from my own experience that the day will come when the memory of your loved one brings a smile to your lips before it brings a tear to your eye. As we honor all that they meant to us, we recommit to safeguarding their legacies and building a future of possibilities for generations to come. Today and every day, let us remember to cherish the precious moments we have with our dads, stepdads, grandfathers, and father figures and to thank them for all they do to enrich our lives, our families, and our Nation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, in accordance with a joint resolution of the Congress approved April 24, 1972, as amended (36 U.S.C. 109), do hereby proclaim June 16, 2024, as Father's Day. I direct the appropriate officials of the Government to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on this day. Let us honor our fathers, living and deceased, and show them the love and gratitude they deserve.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of June, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# Juneteenth Day of Observance, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
On June 19, 1865, freedom finally came for the 250,000 enslaved people of Texas. That day, which would become known as Juneteenth, the Army arrived to enforce what had already been the law of the land for two and a half years—the Emancipation Proclamation. Today, we recognize that Juneteenth not only marks the end of America's original sin of slavery but also the beginning of the work at the heart and soul of our Nation: making the promise of America real for every American.
One of my proudest moments as President was signing into law Juneteenth as a new Federal holiday—the first Federal holiday to be established since Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day four decades prior. Juneteenth is an acknowledgment of the truth of our Nation's history. It is about realizing the idea that America was founded on: All people are created equal and deserve to be treated equally throughout their lives. It is about the generations of brave Black leaders and selfless activists who never let us walk away from that idea, including Ms. Opal Lee, whom I awarded the Medal of Freedom for her work as the grandmother of Juneteenth, and former State Representative Al Edwards, who authored the bill to designate it a holiday in Texas.
My Administration is working to ensure we continue to deliver on that idea—creating a country that truly stands for freedom, justice, dignity, and opportunity for all. Today, record numbers of Black Americans have jobs
and health insurance, and Black business ownership is growing at the fastest pace in over 30 years. We are investing more money than ever in Black families and communities. That includes the funding we are delivering to support predominantly Black neighborhoods that had been divided and left behind by segregation and racial discrimination, the checks we delivered that reduced Black child poverty to the lowest rate in history, the changes we have made to the appraisals process to root out biases that put Black homeowners at a disadvantage, and the over $16 billion investment in Historically Black Colleges and Universities so that we can ensure the next generation of Black leaders has equal opportunities for a quality education and pathways for economic mobility. We are working to rebuild and strengthen all of America by removing every lead pipe across our country, delivering affordable high-speed internet, forgiving $167 billion in student loan debt, and creating good-paying jobs that you can raise a family on. We are creating a new sense of pride and dignity in communities across the country.
As we work to make history, my Administration is also working to tell our Nation's history instead of erasing it. That is why I signed a law, which had been more than 100 years in the making, to designate lynching as a Federal hate crime. I designated the Emmett Till and Mamie Till-Mobley National Monument to preserve historic sites and cultural resources in Mississippi and Illinois so that we never forget the brutal lynching of Emmett Till in Mississippi in 1955 and the subsequent courage of his mother, Mamie Till-Mobley, who made sure our Nation would never forget her son. I have honored some of our country's greatest Black scholars, humanitarians, and artists, who dare to tell the good, bad, and truth of our Nation. We are writing new chapters of our history, and I am proud to have the most diverse Administration ever to tap into the full talents of our Nation—including the first Black woman Vice President of the United States, Kamala Harris—and to have appointed the first Black woman as a Justice on the United States Supreme Court, Ketanji Brown Jackson. Meanwhile, we are also working to secure the right to vote—with which anything is possible.
On Juneteenth, may we celebrate the essence of freedom that galvanized the country, the progress we have made in our Nation, and all that is possible when we march forward together. May we all recommit to redeeming the very soul of America—choosing love over hate, unity over division, and progress over retreat.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 19, 2024, as Juneteenth Day of Observance. I call upon the people of the United States to acknowledge and condemn the history of slavery in our Nation and recognize how the impact of America's original sin remains. I call on every American to celebrate Juneteenth and recommit to working together to eradicate systemic racism and inequity in our society wherever they find it.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighteenth day of June, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

Proc. 10779

# To Further Facilitate Positive Adjustment to Competition From Imports of Certain Crystalline Silicon Photovoltaic Cells (Whether or Not Partially or Fully Assembled Into Other Products)By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
1. On January 23, 2018, pursuant to section 203 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the “Trade Act”) (19 U.S.C. 2253), the President issued Proclamation 9693, imposing a safeguard measure for a period of 4 years that included both a tariff-rate quota (TRQ) on imports of certain crystalline silicon photovoltaic (CSPV) cells, not partially or fully assembled into other products, provided for in subheading 8541.40.60 (currently 8541.42.00) of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS), and an increase in duties (safeguard tariff) on imports of CSPV cells exceeding the TRQ and all imports of other CSPV products, including modules provided for in subheading 8541.40.60 (currently 8541.43.00) of the HTS. Proclamation 9693 exempted imports from certain designated beneficiary countries under the Generalized System of Preferences from the application of the safeguard measure.
2. Clause (4) and Annex I of Proclamation 9693 directed the United States Trade Representative (USTR) to establish procedures for interested persons to request the exclusion of particular products from the safeguard measure. Pursuant to the procedures that the USTR enacted, effective June 13, 2019, the USTR excluded bifacial solar panels that absorb light and generate electricity on each side of the panel and that consist of only bifacial solar cells that absorb light and generate electricity on both sides of the cells (bifacial modules). Exclusion of Particular Products From the Solar Products Safeguard Measure, 84 FR 27684 (June 13, 2019).
3. After taking into account the United States International Trade Commission's (USITC) report on the results of its monitoring of developments with respect to the domestic solar industry (USITC, Crystalline Silicon Photovoltaic Cells, Whether or Not Partially or Fully Assembled Into Other Products: Monitoring Developments in the Domestic Industry, No. TA-201-075 (Monitoring)) and the USITC's report regarding the probable economic effect on the domestic CSPV cell and module manufacturing industry of modifying the safeguard measure (USITC, Crystalline Silicon Photovoltaic Cells, Whether or Not Partially or Fully Assembled Into Other Products: Advice on the Probable Economic Effect of Certain Modifications to the Safeguard Measure, No. TA-201-075 (Modification)), and after receiving a
petition from a majority of the representatives of the domestic industry with respect to each of the following modifications, on October 10, 2020, the President issued Proclamation 10101 under section 204(b)(1)(B) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2254(b)(1)(B)). In Proclamation 10101, the President determined that the domestic industry had begun to make a positive adjustment to import competition, as shown by the increases in domestic module production capacity, production, and market share. Proclamation 10101 also:
(a) revoked the exclusion of bifacial modules from application of the safeguard measure on the basis that it had impaired and was likely to continue to impair the effectiveness of the safeguard action; and
(b) adjusted the safeguard tariff for the fourth year of the safeguard measure from 15 percent to 18 percent on the basis that the exclusion of bifacial modules from application of the safeguard tariff had impaired the remedial effectiveness of the 4-year action proclaimed in Proclamation 9693, and to achieve the full remedial effect envisaged in that action.
4. On November 16, 2021, the United States Court of International Trade (CIT) held in
Solar Energy Industries Association et al.
v.
United States
that the President acted outside of his statutory authority in issuing Proclamation 10101, and enjoined the Government from enforcing that proclamation. However, in November 2023, a panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed the CIT's decision.
5. After receiving the USITC's December 8, 2021, determination and report pursuant to section 204(c) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2254(c)), which found that the safeguard action continues to be necessary to prevent or remedy the serious injury to the domestic industry and that there was evidence that the domestic industry was making a positive adjustment to import competition (USITC, Crystalline Silicon Photovoltaic Cells, Whether or Not Partially or Fully Assembled Into Other Products, Investigation No. TA-201-75 (Extension)), and after taking into account the information provided in the USITC's report and the information received from the public through the process published in the
Federal Register
on September 30, 2021 (86 FR 54279), pursuant to section 203(e)(1)(B) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253(e)(1)(B)), I issued Proclamation 10339 on February 4, 2022. In Proclamation 10339, I determined that the safeguard action on imports of CSPV cells, whether or not partially or fully assembled into other products, continued to be necessary to prevent or remedy the serious injury to the domestic industry, and that there was evidence that the domestic industry was making a positive adjustment to import competition. I further determined to extend the safeguard measure proclaimed in Proclamation 9693, as modified by Proclamation 10101, in relevant part, as follows:
(a) continuation of the increase in duties on imports of modules described in paragraph 1 of Proclamation 10339 for an additional period of 4 years, with annual reductions in the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth years, as described in Annex I to Proclamation 10339; and
(b) exclusion of bifacial panels from the extension of duties proclaimed in paragraph 9 of Proclamation 10339.
6. If an extension of an action taken under section 203 of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253) exceeds 3 years, section 204(a)(2) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2254(a)(2)) requires the USITC to issue a report to the President and
the Congress on its monitoring of developments with respect to the domestic industry, including the progress and specific efforts made by workers and firms in the domestic industry to make a positive adjustment to import competition, no later than the midpoint of the period of the extension.
7. On February 6, 2024, the USITC issued its second midterm report pursuant to section 204(a)(2) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2254(a)(2)) on its monitoring of developments within the industry producing CSPV products since the President's imposition of the safeguard measure (USITC, Crystalline Silicon Photovoltaic Cells, Whether or Not Partially or Fully Assembled Into Other Products: Monitoring Developments in the Domestic Industry, No. TA-201-075 (Second Monitoring)). In its report, the USITC found that the safeguard measure has resulted in positive adjustments from the domestic industry in light of increased actual and planned module production; various announcements of planned domestic cell production; and improvements in several of the domestic industry's financial, trade, and employment indicators. The USITC's report also noted a shift in imports from non-bifacial CSPV cells and panels toward primarily bifacial CSPV cells and modules from 2020-2022 and, when comparing the first half of 2023 with the first half of 2022, with bifacial cells and panels increasingly used in traditionally non-bifacial applications.
8. On February 23, 2024, a majority of the representatives of the domestic industry submitted a petition under section 204(b) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2254(b)(1)(B)) to modify the safeguard measure by revoking the exclusion of bifacial products from safeguard relief proclaimed in Proclamation 10339, thus subjecting bifacial modules to the remedy under section 201 of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2251). The petition explains how the domestic industry has continued to make a positive adjustment to import competition. It also explains how the exclusion of bifacial panels has led to large import volumes of bifacial modules competing in all sectors of the United States market, thus negatively impacting the domestic industry's efforts to increase substantially its market share notwithstanding the increase in apparent United States consumption.
9. Section 204(b)(1)(B) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2254(b)(1)(B)) authorizes the President, upon submission of a petition from a majority of the representatives of the domestic industry, to reduce, modify, or terminate an action taken under section 203 of the Trade Act when the President determines that the domestic industry has made a positive adjustment to import competition.
10. After taking into account the information provided in the USITC's second midterm report, and after receiving a petition from a majority of the representatives of the domestic industry with respect to the aforementioned modification, I have determined that the domestic industry has been making and is continuing to make a positive adjustment to import competition, shown by increased actual and planned module production; various announcements of planned domestic cell production; and improvements in several of the domestic industry's financial, trade, and employment indicators. Furthermore, I have determined that imports of bifacial panels have surged in recent years, such that the exclusion of bifacial panels proclaimed in Proclamation 10339 has impaired the effectiveness of the action taken in Proclamation 9693, as extended by Proclamation 10339, and that to achieve the full remedial effect envisaged for that action, it is necessary
to modify the section 201 action by revoking the exclusion of bifacial panels and applying the safeguard tariff to bifacial panels.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, including sections 203, 204, and 604 of the Trade Act, do proclaim that:
(1) In order to modify the action applicable to imports of CSPV cells under HTS subheading 8541.42.0010 and other CSPV products, such as modules under HTS subheading 8541.43.0010, subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTS is modified as set forth in Annex I to this proclamation.
(2) The modifications to the HTS made by this proclamation, including Annex I hereto, shall be effective with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time 5 days after the date of this proclamation, and shall continue in effect as provided in Annex I to this proclamation, unless such actions are earlier expressly reduced, modified, or terminated.
(3) Bifacial panels that are subject to the modifications described in clause (1) of this proclamation shall be exempt from the safeguard tariff, provided that:
(i) the imported bifacial panels are fulfilling in whole or in part a contract for sale, purchase, or delivery in the United States that was in effect and dated as executed prior to May 17, 2024, that provides for importation to or delivery within the United States within 90 days after the effective date of this proclamation, and that has not been modified on or later than May 17, 2024, with regard to importation or delivery date;
(ii) the bifacial panels are entered into the United States within 90 days after the effective date of this proclamation;
(iii) the bifacial panels are declared and entered under heading 9903.45.29 of the HTS, and meet the conditions thereof; and
(iv) the importer completes the certification in Annex II to this proclamation and provides the completed certification as part of the importer's electronic entry summary to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) by uploading it to the Document Imaging System in the Automated Commercial Environment at the time that classification is declared under heading 9903.45.29 of the HTS.
(4) Where bifacial panels that are subject to the modifications described in clause (1) of this proclamation are entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after the effective date of this proclamation and do not satisfy the requirements specified in clause (3) of this proclamation, such bifacial panels shall be subject to the safeguard tariff.
(5) CBP shall take such actions as are necessary to ensure compliance with the requirements in clauses (3) and (4) of this proclamation. Such actions may include requiring the provision of any additional information deemed necessary by CBP, including a copy of the pre-existing contract described in subsection (i) of clause (3) of this proclamation, in order to verify such compliance.
(6) One year from the termination of the safeguard measure referenced in this proclamation, as modified by this proclamation, the U.S. note and
tariff provisions established in Annex I to this proclamation shall be deleted from the HTS.
(7) Any provision of previous proclamations and Executive Orders that is inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation is superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-first day of June, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# Granting Pardon for Certain Violations of Article 125 Under the Uniform Code of Military JusticeBy the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Our Nation has made tremendous progress in advancing the cause of equality for LGBTQI+ Americans, including in the military. Despite their courage and great sacrifice, thousands of LGBTQI+ service members were forced out of the military because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Many of these patriotic Americans were subject to a court-martial. While my Administration has taken meaningful action to remedy these problems, the impact of that historical injustice remains. As Commander in Chief, I am committed to maintaining the finest fighting force in the world. That means making sure that every member of our military feels safe and respected.
Accordingly, acting pursuant to the grant of authority in Article II, Section 2, of the Constitution of the United States, I, Joseph R. Biden Jr., do hereby grant a full, complete, and unconditional pardon to persons convicted of unaggravated offenses based on consensual, private conduct with persons age 18 and older under former Article 125 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), as previously codified at 10 U.S.C. 925, as well as attempts, conspiracies, and solicitations to commit such acts under Articles 80, 81, and 82, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. 880, 881, 882. This proclamation applies to convictions during the period from Article 125's effective date of May 31, 1951, through the December 26, 2013, enactment of section 1707 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014 (Public Law 113-66).
The purpose of this proclamation is to pardon only offenses based on consensual, private conduct between individuals 18 and older that do not involve any aggravating factor, including:
(1) conduct that would violate 10 U.S.C. 893a, prohibiting activities with military recruits or trainees by a person in a position of special trust;
(2) conduct that was committed with an individual who was coerced or, because of status, might not have felt able to refuse consent;
(3) conduct on the part of the applicant constituting fraternization under Article 134 of the UCMJ;
(4) conduct committed with the spouse of another military member; or
(5) any factors other than those listed above that were identified by the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces in
United States
v.
Marcum
as being outside the scope of
Lawrence
v.
Texas
as applied in the military context, 60 M.J. 198, 207-08 (2004).
The Military Departments (Army, Navy, or Air Force), or in the case of the Coast Guard, the Department of Homeland Security, in conjunction with the Department of Justice, shall provide information about and publicize application procedures for certificates of pardon. An applicant for a certificate of pardon under this proclamation is to submit an application to the Military Department (Army, Navy, or Air Force) that conducted the court-martial or, in the case of a Coast Guard court-martial, to the Department
of Homeland Security. If the relevant Department determines that the applicant satisfies the criteria under this proclamation, following a review of relevant military justice records, the Department shall submit that determination to the Attorney General, acting through the Pardon Attorney, who shall then issue a certificate of pardon along with information on the process to apply for an upgrade of military discharge. My Administration strongly encourages veterans who receive a certificate of pardon to apply for an upgrade of military discharge.
Although the pardon under this proclamation applies only to the convictions described above, there are other LGBTQI+ individuals who served our Nation and were convicted of other crimes because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. It is the policy of my Administration to expeditiously consider and to make final pardon determinations with respect to such individuals.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-sixth day of June, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# 60th Anniversary of the Civil Rights ActBy the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Sixty years ago, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed into law one of the most significant pieces of civil rights legislation in history—the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It prohibited discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. That day, our Nation moved closer to our North Star, the founding ideal of America: We are all created equal and deserve to be treated equally throughout our lives. We have never fully lived up to that idea, but we have never walked away from it either. On this anniversary, we promise we will not walk away from it now.
On July 2, 1964, when President Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act, a crowd gathered behind him. Among them were some of the Black leaders and activists who had led the movement that made it possible: Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., A. Philip Randolph, Dr. Dorothy Height, and others, who had fought, protested, and prayed for this moment. It was the work of changemakers like them—from the countless protests, sit-ins, and marches they organized to the many speeches and sermons they gave—and the courageous activism and participation of everyday Americans that brought the bill to President Johnson's desk. It was an answer to President John F. Kennedy's call for national action to guarantee the equal treatment of every American regardless of race. Change only rippled out from there: The Civil Rights Act of 1964 also helped set the foundation for other critical legislation like the Voting Rights Act of 1965.
The legacies of those activists and extraordinary Americans have had a profound impact on me and others of my generation. It inspired me to become
a public defender and then a county councilman, working to change our State's politics to embrace the cause of civil rights. Their efforts made us fundamentally better as Americans, opening the doors of opportunity wider and bringing our Nation closer to its promise of liberty, equality, and justice for all.
Despite this critical step forward, securing our civil rights remains the unfinished fight of our time. Our country is still facing attacks to some of our most fundamental civil liberties and rights, including the right to vote and have that vote counted and the right to live free from the threat of violence, hate, and discrimination. That is why my Administration is remaining vigilant—fighting actively to protect the rights of every American. I signed the Electoral Count Reform Act to protect the will of the people and the peaceful transfer of power. I appointed Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, the first Black woman to be on the Supreme Court, and have appointed more Black women to the Federal appellate court than every other President in history.
We are also working to reverse the shameful legacy of segregation in our country and creating new opportunities for every American to thrive. My Administration is investing more money than ever in Black families and Black communities. We are reconnecting historic business districts and neighborhoods cut off by old highways, redlining, and decades of discrimination and disinvestment. We have invested over $16 billion in Historically Black Colleges and Universities, which will help raise the next generation of Black leaders. At the same time, we are creating good-paying jobs that people can raise a family on; making capital and loans for starting small businesses and buying homes more accessible; and making health insurance and prescription drugs more affordable. I also signed the boldest policing reform Executive Order in history. My Administration is changing our Nation's failed approach to marijuana, which disproportionately impacts communities of color. I have used executive clemency more than any recent President at this point in my Presidency in pursuit of justice and fairness. And I continue to call on the Congress to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and the Freedom to Vote Act—it is the only way to fully secure the sacred right to vote.
On this anniversary, may we recommit to continuing the work that the Civil Rights Act began six decades ago—it is still the task of our time to build a democracy where every American is treated with dignity and has an equal opportunity to follow their dreams. We must continue to move forward together, stand with one another, and choose democracy over autocracy and beloved community over chaos. We must choose to be believers, dreamers, and doers.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim July 2, 2024, as the 60th Anniversary of the Civil Rights Act. I call upon all Americans to observe this day with programs, ceremonies, and activities that celebrate this accomplishment and advance civil rights in our time.

Proc. 10782

# Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United StatesBy the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
1. On January 19, 2018, the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) transmitted to the President a report on the Secretary's investigation into the effect of imports of aluminum articles on the national security of the United States under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1862). The Secretary found and advised the President of the Secretary's opinion that aluminum articles are being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States.
2. In Proclamation 9704 of March 8, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States), the President concurred in the Secretary's finding that aluminum articles are being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States, and decided to adjust the imports of aluminum articles by imposing a 10 percent ad valorem tariff on such articles imported from all countries except Canada and Mexico. Proclamation 9704 further stated that any country with which the United States has a security relationship is welcome to discuss alternative ways to address the threatened impairment of the national security caused by imports from that country, and noted that, should the United States and any such country arrive at a satisfactory alternative means to address the threat to the national security such that the President determines that imports from that country no longer threaten to impair the national security, the President may remove or modify the restriction on aluminum articles imports from that country and, if necessary, adjust the tariff as it applies to other countries, as the national security interests of the United States require.
3. In Proclamation 9704, the President also directed the Secretary to monitor imports of aluminum articles and inform the President of any circumstances that in the Secretary's opinion might indicate the need for further action under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, with respect to such imports.
4. In Proclamation 9893 of May 19, 2019 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States), the President noted that the United States had successfully concluded discussions with Mexico on satisfactory alternative means to address the threatened impairment of the national security posed by aluminum imports from Mexico. The United States agreed on a range of measures with Mexico that were expected to allow imports of aluminum from Mexico to remain stable at historical levels without meaningful increases, thus permitting the domestic capacity utilization to remain reasonably commensurate with the target level recommended in the Secretary's report. In the President's judgment, these measures would provide effective, long-term alternative means to address the contribution of Mexico's imports to the threatened impairment of the national security.
5. The President determined in Proclamation 9893 that, under the framework in the agreement reached with Mexico, imports of aluminum from
Mexico would no longer threaten to impair the national security and accordingly excluded Mexico from the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704, as amended. The President noted that the United States would monitor the implementation and effectiveness of these measures in addressing our national security needs, and that the President may revisit this determination as appropriate.
6. In Proclamation 9980 of January 24, 2020 (Adjusting Imports of Derivative Aluminum Articles and Derivative Steel Articles Into the United States), the President noted that, among other things, imports of certain derivatives of aluminum articles had significantly increased since the imposition of tariffs and quotas on imports of aluminum articles in 2018. The President further noted the Secretary's assessment that foreign producers increased shipments of such derivative articles to the United States to circumvent the duties on aluminum articles imposed in Proclamation 9704 and that the net effect of the increase of imports of these derivatives had been to erode the customer base for United States producers of aluminum and undermine the purpose of Proclamation 9704.
7. Based on such assessments by the Secretary, the President concluded in Proclamation 9980 that it was necessary and appropriate in light of our national security interests to adjust the tariffs imposed by previous proclamations to apply to certain derivatives of aluminum articles from most countries, excluding Argentina, Australia, Canada, and Mexico. This action was necessary and appropriate to address circumvention that was undermining the effectiveness of the adjustment of imports made in Proclamation 9704, as amended, and to remove the threatened impairment of the national security of the United States found in that proclamation.
8. The Secretary has informed me that domestic aluminum producers' capacity utilization remains below the target 80 percent capacity utilization recommended in the Secretary's report of January 19, 2018, and imports of aluminum articles from Mexico have increased significantly as compared to their levels at the time of Proclamation 9893. Furthermore, Mexico lacks primary aluminum smelting capabilities, and the country of smelt or country of most recent cast is unknown for a significant volume of aluminum imports from Mexico. In the Secretary's opinion, these developments indicate the need for further action under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, with respect to such aluminum imports. In monitoring the implementation and effectiveness of the agreement with Mexico in addressing our national security needs, I have determined that it is appropriate to revisit the President's determination in Proclamation 9893 regarding the applicability of the tariff imposed in Proclamation 9704 to aluminum articles imports from Mexico.
9. Accordingly, the United States will implement a country of smelt and country of most recent cast requirement for imports of aluminum articles that are products of Mexico, and will increase the section 232 duty rate for imports of aluminum articles and derivative aluminum articles that are products of Mexico containing aluminum for which the reported primary country of smelt, secondary country of smelt, or country of most recent cast is China, Russia (subject to paragraph 10 of this proclamation), Belarus, or Iran. In order to be eligible for importation free from section 232 tariffs, aluminum articles and derivative aluminum articles that are products of
Mexico must be accompanied by a certificate of analysis and must not contain primary aluminum for which the reported primary country of smelt, secondary country of smelt, or country of most recent cast is China, Russia (subject to paragraph 10 of this proclamation), Belarus, or Iran. In my judgment, these measures will provide an effective, long-term alternative means to address any contribution by Mexican aluminum articles imports to the threatened impairment of the national security by restraining aluminum articles imports to the United States from Mexico, limiting transshipment, and discouraging excess aluminum capacity and production. The United States will monitor the implementation and effectiveness of the measures agreed upon with Mexico in addressing our national security needs, and I may revisit this determination, as appropriate.
10. In Proclamation 10522 of February 24, 2023 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States), the President determined that it was necessary and appropriate to impose a 200 percent ad valorem tariff on aluminum articles where any amount of primary aluminum used in the manufacture of the aluminum articles is smelted in Russia, or the aluminum articles are cast in Russia, and derivative aluminum articles where any amount of primary aluminum used in the manufacture of the derivative aluminum articles is smelted in Russia, or the derivative aluminum articles are cast in Russia. Proclamation 10522 shall continue to apply to aluminum articles and derivative aluminum articles that are products of Mexico to the extent such articles contain any primary aluminum that is smelted or cast in Russia. If Proclamation 10522 is suspended, this proclamation shall apply with respect to aluminum articles and derivative aluminum articles that are the product of Mexico and contain primary aluminum for which the primary country of smelt, secondary country of smelt, or country of most recent cast, is Russia. While in effect, Proclamation 10522 supersedes this proclamation.
11. To prevent transshipment, excess production, or other actions that would lead to increased exports of aluminum articles to the United States, the United States Trade Representative, in consultation with the Secretary, shall advise me if there is a surge in imports of aluminum articles to the United States from Mexico and on the appropriate means to ensure that such imports from Mexico do not undermine the national security objectives of the tariff imposed in Proclamation 9704, as amended. If necessary and appropriate, I will consider directing the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) of the Department of Homeland Security to no longer exclude imports of aluminum articles from Mexico from the tariff imposed in Proclamation 9704, as amended.
12. In light of my determination to adjust the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704, as amended, as applied to eligible aluminum articles imports from Mexico, I have considered whether it is necessary and appropriate in light of our national security interests to make any corresponding adjustments to such tariff as it applies to other countries. I have determined that it is necessary and appropriate, at this time, to maintain the current tariff level as it applies to other countries.
13. Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, authorizes the President to adjust the imports of an article and its derivatives that are being imported into the United States in such quantities or under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security.
14. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) the substance of statutes affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, do hereby proclaim as follows:
(1) To establish a country of smelt and country of most recent cast requirement for imports of aluminum articles and derivative aluminum articles from Mexico, and an increase in the duty rate for imports of aluminum articles and derivative aluminum articles that are products of Mexico containing aluminum for which the reported primary country of smelt, secondary country of smelt, or country of most recent cast is China, Russia (subject to paragraph 10 of this proclamation), Belarus, or Iran, amendments to U.S. note 19 to subchapter III of chapter 99 and new HTSUS headings are provided for in the Annex to this proclamation. Imports of aluminum articles and derivative aluminum articles that are products of Mexico shall be exempt from the new duty provided that such aluminum products do not contain primary aluminum for which the reported primary country of smelt, secondary country of smelt, or country of most recent cast is China, Russia (subject to paragraph 10 of this proclamation), Belarus, or Iran.
(2) Aluminum articles eligible for treatment under clause 1 of this proclamation must be accompanied by a certificate of analysis in order to receive such treatment. Eligible aluminum articles must not contain primary aluminum for which the reported primary country of smelt, secondary country of smelt, and country of most recent cast is China, Russia (subject to paragraph 10 of this proclamation), Belarus, or Iran. “Primary country of smelt” is defined as the country where the largest volume of new aluminum metal is produced from alumina (or aluminum oxide) by the electrolytic Hall-Héroult process. “Secondary country of smelt” is the country where the second largest volume of new aluminum metal is produced from alumina (or aluminum oxide) by the electrolytic Hall-Héroult process. “Country of most recent cast” refers to the country where the aluminum (with or without alloying elements) was last liquified by heat and cast into a solid state. The final solid state can take the form of either a semi-finished product (slab, billets or ingots) or a finished aluminum product. The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security and the United States Trade Representative, is authorized to take such actions as are necessary to ensure compliance with this requirement. Failure to comply could result in applicable remedies or penalties under United States law.
(3) For purposes of implementing this and other proclamations, importers shall provide to CBP the information necessary to identify the countries where the primary aluminum used in the manufacture of aluminum articles
imports covered by clause 1 of Proclamation 9704 are smelted and information necessary to identify the countries where such aluminum articles imports are cast. CBP shall implement the smelt and cast information requirements as soon as practicable.
(4) The modifications to the HTSUS made by clause 1 of this proclamation shall be effective with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on July 10, 2024, and shall continue in effect, unless such actions are expressly reduced, modified, or terminated.
(5) Any imports of aluminum articles that are products of Mexico and that were admitted into a U.S. foreign trade zone under “privileged foreign status” as defined in 19 CFR 146.41, prior to 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on July 10, 2024, shall be subject upon entry for consumption made on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on July 10, 2024, to the provisions of Proclamation 9893, Proclamation 9980, and Proclamation 10522 (for imports containing aluminum smelt or cast in Russia).
(6) Any provision of previous proclamations and Executive Orders that is inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation is superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this tenth day of July, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# Adjusting Imports of Steel Into the United StatesBy the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
1. On January 11, 2018, the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) transmitted to the President a report on the Secretary's investigation into the effect of imports of steel mill articles (steel articles) on the national security of the United States under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1862). The Secretary found and advised the President of the Secretary's opinion that steel articles are being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States.
2. In Proclamation 9705 of March 8, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Steel Into the United States), the President concurred in the Secretary's finding that steel articles, as defined in clause 1 of Proclamation 9705 (as amended by clause 8 of Proclamation 9711 of March 22, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Steel Into the United States)), are being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States, and decided to adjust the imports of steel articles by imposing a 25 percent ad valorem tariff on such articles imported from all countries except Canada and Mexico. Proclamation 9705 further stated that any country with which the United States has a security relationship is welcome to discuss alternative ways to address the threatened impairment of the national security caused by imports from that country, and noted that, should the United States and any such country arrive at a satisfactory alternative means to address the threat to the national security such that the President determines that imports from that country no longer threaten to impair the national security, the President may remove or modify the restriction on steel articles imports from that country and, if necessary, adjust the tariff as it applies to other countries, as the national security interests of the United States require.
3. In Proclamation 9705, the President also directed the Secretary to monitor imports of steel articles and inform the President of any circumstances that in the Secretary's opinion might indicate the need for further action under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, with respect to such imports.
4. In Proclamation 9894 of May 19, 2019 (Adjusting Imports of Steel Into the United States), the President noted that the United States had successfully concluded discussions with Mexico on satisfactory alternative means to address the threatened impairment of the national security posed by steel imports from Mexico. The United States agreed on a range of measures with Mexico that were expected to allow imports of steel from Mexico to remain stable at historical levels without meaningful increases, thus permitting the domestic capacity utilization to remain reasonably commensurate with the target level recommended in the Secretary's report. In the President's judgment, these measures would provide effective, long-term alternative means to address the contribution of Mexico's imports to the threatened impairment of the national security.
5. The President determined in Proclamation 9894 that, under the framework in the agreement reached with Mexico, imports of steel from Mexico would no longer threaten to impair the national security and accordingly excluded Mexico from the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9705, as amended. The President noted that the United States would monitor the implementation and effectiveness of these measures in addressing our national security needs, and that the President may revisit this determination as appropriate.
6. In Proclamation 9980 of January 24, 2020 (Adjusting Imports of Derivative Aluminum Articles and Derivative Steel Articles Into the United States), the President noted that, among other things, imports of certain derivatives of steel articles had significantly increased since the imposition of tariffs and quotas on imports of steel articles in 2018. The President further noted the Secretary's assessment that foreign producers increased shipments of such derivative articles to the United States to circumvent the duties on steel articles imposed in Proclamation 9705, and that the net effect of the increase of imports of these derivatives had been to erode the customer base for United States producers of steel and undermine the purpose of Proclamation 9705.
7. Based on such assessments by the Secretary, the President concluded in Proclamation 9980 that it was necessary and appropriate in light of our national security interests to adjust the tariffs imposed by previous proclamations to apply to certain derivatives of steel articles from most countries, excluding Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, and South Korea. This action was necessary and appropriate to address circumvention that was undermining the effectiveness of the adjustment of imports made in Proclamation 9705, as amended, and to remove the threatened impairment of the national security of the United States found in that proclamation.
8. The Secretary has informed me that domestic steel producers' capacity utilization remains below the target 80 percent capacity utilization recommended in the Secretary's report of January 11, 2018, and imports of steel articles from Mexico have increased significantly as compared to their levels at the time of Proclamation 9894.

In monitoring the implementation and effectiveness of the agreement with Mexico in addressing our national security needs, I have determined that it is appropriate to revisit the President's determination in Proclamation 9894 regarding the applicability of the tariff imposed in Proclamation 9705 to steel articles imports from Mexico.
9. Accordingly, the United States will implement a melt and pour requirement for imports of steel articles that are products of Mexico and will increase the section 232 duty rate for imports of steel articles and derivative steel articles that are products of Mexico that are melted and poured in a country other than Mexico, Canada, or the United States. In order to be eligible for importation free from section 232 tariffs, steel articles and derivative steel articles that are products of Mexico must be melted and poured in Mexico, Canada, or the United States. In my judgment, these measures will provide an effective, long-term alternative means to address any contribution by Mexican steel articles imports to the threatened impairment of the national security by restraining steel articles imports to the United
States from Mexico, limiting transshipment, and discouraging excess steel capacity and production. The United States will monitor the implementation and effectiveness of the measures agreed upon with Mexico in addressing our national security needs, and I may revisit this determination, as appropriate.
10. To prevent transshipment, excess production, or other actions that would lead to increased exports of steel articles to the United States, the United States Trade Representative, in consultation with the Secretary, shall advise me if there is a surge in imports of steel articles to the United States from Mexico and on the appropriate means to ensure that such imports from Mexico do not undermine the national security objectives of the tariff imposed in Proclamation 9705, as amended. If necessary and appropriate, I will consider directing the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) of the Department of Homeland Security to no longer exclude imports of steel articles from Mexico from the tariff imposed in Proclamation 9705, as amended.
11. In light of my determination to adjust the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9705, as amended, as applied to eligible steel articles imports from Mexico, respectively, I have considered whether it is necessary and appropriate in light of our national security interests to make any corresponding adjustments to such tariff as it applies to other countries. I have determined that it is necessary and appropriate, at this time, to maintain the current tariff level as it applies to other countries.
12. Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, authorizes the President to adjust the imports of an article and its derivatives that are being imported into the United States in such quantities or under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security.
13.

(1) To establish a melt and pour requirement for imports of steel articles and derivative steel articles that are products of Mexico, and an increase in the duty rate for imports of steel articles and derivative steel articles that are products of Mexico that are melted and poured in a country other than Mexico, Canada, or the United States, amendments to U.S. note 16 to subchapter III of chapter 99 and new HTSUS headings are provided for in the Annex to this proclamation. Imports of steel articles and derivative steel articles that are products of Mexico shall be exempt from the duty provided that such steel products are melted and poured in Mexico, Canada, or the United States.
(2) For purposes of implementing the melt and pour requirements in this and other proclamations, importers of steel and steel derivative articles
shall provide to CBP the information necessary to identify the countries where the steel used in the manufacture of steel articles imports, covered by clause 1 of Proclamation 9705, and derivative steel articles, specified in Annex II of Proclamation 9980, are melted and poured. CBP shall implement the melt and pour information requirements as soon as practicable.
(3) The modifications to the HTSUS made by clause 1 of this proclamation shall be effective with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on July 10, 2024, and shall continue in effect, unless such actions are expressly reduced, modified, or terminated.

# National Atomic Veterans Day, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Our military service members and veterans live by a code of duty, putting their lives on the line to keep all of us safe. Few exemplify that creed better than Atomic Veterans. These former members of our Armed Forces not only courageously served our country but also participated in the nuclear tests done between 1945 and 1962 or were exposed to radioactive materials. Today, we honor their service, sacrifice, and dedication to our Nation and recommit to fulfilling the great debt of gratitude we owe them.
For five decades, the service members who suffered from the impact of nuclear warfare here at home were forced to remain silent. Many had been present for nuclear testing, posted nearby as atomic bombs detonated. They suffered the consequences for their entire lives, including serious health problems and cancers. For some, the mental scars of what they endured never fully went away. Forbidden from telling anyone, they could never fully disclose their past to their doctors, which delayed diagnoses, while their families struggled to get the benefits they were entitled to. Thousands of Atomic Veterans died before telling their stories.
I have often said that our Nation has many obligations, but only one is truly sacred: to prepare those we send into harm's way and care for them and their families when they return. For Atomic Veterans, that began with finally being able to share their stories. The 1996 repeal of the Nuclear Radiation and Secrecy Agreements Act allowed them to tell people what they had experienced so they could receive the benefits they deserved from the Department of Veterans Affairs. But there is still so much more to do. That is why I signed the PACT Act, one of the most significant laws ever to help millions of veterans who were exposed to toxins and other hazards, including radiation and burn pits during their military service. Further, I have signed laws that support individuals who developed cancer and other medical conditions due to their work related to the World War II nuclear program. And in 2022, the Department of Defense began recognizing Atomic Veterans' service and sacrifice through the Atomic Veterans Commemorative Service Medal.
Today, on behalf of a grateful Nation, we honor the service of our Atomic Veterans. May we not only tell the truth of their history but also build a future worthy of their highest hopes for our country—one that is peaceful and stable and where all veterans are cared for.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim July 16, 2024, as National Atomic Veterans Day. I call upon all Americans to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities that honor our Nation's Atomic Veterans, whose brave service and sacrifice played an important role in the defense of our Nation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of July, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# Captive Nations Week, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
During Captive Nations Week, we remember all those around the world living under oppression and fighting for their liberty. They remind us that freedom is never free and that even the most brutal regime cannot erase the human yearning for dignity and self-determination.
As we marked the 80th anniversary of D-Day this year, we were reminded of the dark forces that the United States and its allies fought against in World War II, like aggression, greed, and the desire to dominate and change borders by force. Still today, the struggle between dictatorship and freedom continues. We see it in various places around the world, where rulers govern with contempt for basic human rights, the rule of law, and democratic governance. In countries like Belarus, Cuba, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Iran, Nicaragua, the People's Republic of China, Syria, Russia, Venezuela, and more, millions live without basic freedoms.
In Europe, we see another stark example. Russia is waging an illegal, unjustifiable, and unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine. For 2 years, the Ukrainian people have fought with extraordinary courage and bravery. The United States is standing with them, alongside a coalition of more than 50 countries, and we will not walk away or bow down. The autocrats of the world are watching closely to see what happens in Ukraine and if we will let this illegal aggression go unchecked. We cannot let that happen. That is why I signed a national security package into law that provided $61 billion to the people of Ukraine to meet their urgent security and defense needs, ensuring they have the support they need to defend their country.
At the same time, we support the equal and inalienable rights of all people everywhere. That is why my Administration has been working with the Congress to provide up to $11.8 billion through the end of Fiscal Year 2025 to strengthen democracies across the globe. This year, at the Third Summit for Democracy, the United States and countries around the world came together to strengthen democratic resilience, respect for human rights, and good governance globally. But there is still so much we must do. We must continue working to ensure that women and girls enjoy equal rights and equal participation. We must ensure that Indigenous groups; racial, ethnic, and religious minorities; and people with disabilities do not have their potential stifled by systemic discrimination. We must remember wrongfully detained Americans around the world. And we must ensure that LGBTQI+ people are not targeted with violence because of who they are. When human rights are not upheld, the effects are felt everywhere. They are essential to the advancement of human progress that brings us together.
The challenges of our time remind us that we must continue to secure our freedom and democracy here at home. I signed an Executive Order to promote access to voter registration and election information so every American has an opportunity to exercise their right to vote. And I signed the Electoral Count Reform Act to ensure that our elections answer to the will of the people. I continue to call on the Congress to pass the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, which would further protect the sacred right to vote.
As Americans, we represent something special to the world. We are the only Nation on Earth founded on the idea that all men and women are created equal. Both at home and abroad, our actions every day will ensure that our democracy endures, the soul of our Nation endures, and the free world remains free. This week, we recommit to ensuring that democracy is preserved, is defended, and prevails.
The Congress, by joint resolution approved July 17, 1959 (73 Stat. 212), has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation designating the third week of July of each year as “Captive Nations Week.”
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim July 21 through July 27, 2024, as Captive Nations Week. I call upon all Americans to reaffirm our commitment to championing those around the world who are working, often at great personal risk, to secure liberty and justice for all.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this nineteenth day of July, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# Made in America Week, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Across the Nation, American workers are writing the greatest comeback story in our country's history. After a once-in-a-century pandemic, they are bringing new jobs, businesses, and hope to their communities. This week, we celebrate the American workers, unions, companies, and innovators who are the backbone of America's economy, who make “Made in America” not just a slogan but a reality, and who are leading our Nation's transformation to win the global economic competition of the 21st century.
For decades, manufacturing products here at home created good-paying jobs across the country and forged a clear path to the middle class. But over the years, trickle-down economics reversed that progress. American manufacturers shut down their factories. American jobs were exported overseas. And American communities were hollowed out. People and families throughout the United States were robbed of not just their jobs but their dignity, hope, and pride.
My Administration was determined to turn things around by investing in America and Americans once again—building an economy from the middle out and bottom up, not the top down. The results are clear: Since I came into office, the economy has created over 15 million jobs—including nearly 800,000 manufacturing jobs. The unemployment rate fell to its lowest level in half a century. And manufacturing is roaring back with new factories being built all across the country—in big cities and rural communities. So far, companies have invested more than $700 billion in American manufacturing.
On my watch, Federal projects are being made with American products and are being built by American workers. I signed the “Invent It Here, Make It Here” Executive Order, which directs Federal agencies to prioritize domestic manufacturing when it comes to research, development, innovation, and bringing inventions to market. We are also using the immense purchasing power of the Federal Government—the largest buyer of consumer goods in the world—to bring manufacturing back home. My Administration has implemented the most robust change to the Buy American Act in almost 70 years by raising the domestic content threshold for Federal procurement from 55 percent to 65 percent in 2024—and we are set to raise the bar even higher to 75 percent in 2029.
Additionally, thanks to our Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, 60,000 new infrastructure projects have been announced across the country, rebuilding our roads, bridges, airports, ports, rail networks, water systems, and more. We are investing $90 billion to provide affordable, reliable, high-speed internet to everyone in the United States, which is driving manufacturing jobs in industries like fiber optic cable manufacturing. My CHIPS and Science Act is investing in more research and development for manufacturing than ever before, attracting $348 billion in private sector investments to build new semiconductor factories. This manufacturing boom is creating hundreds of thousands of jobs—many of which pay over $100,000 and do not require a college degree.
At the same time, our Inflation Reduction Act is ensuring that the clean energy future is built here in America. Our investments have spurred the private sector to build and create new jobs here at home. To date, the private sector has announced investments in 126 new and expanded solar manufacturing plants; more than 30 wind manufacturing facilities; more than 150 new or expanded sites for electric vehicle assembly, component manufacturing, and charger manufacturing; and more than 250 new or expanded facilities in the battery manufacturing and critical mineral supply chain. These investments are supporting historic growth in clean energy deployment and adoption and creating good-paying jobs across the country. Altogether, since taking office, companies have committed more than $400 billion in private-sector investment in manufacturing and deployment of clean energy, electric vehicles, and batteries.
For the first time in a long time, American workers are putting shovels in the ground and leading our Nation's greatest economic comeback. Thousands of cities and towns across the country are proving that we can get big things done when we work together. This Made in America Week, let us celebrate America's incredible workers who are restoring American pride. Let us honor the proud legacy and promising future of American
products. And let us recommit to nurturing the spirit of innovation that will continue to drive American prosperity for generations to come.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim July 21 through July 27, 2024, as Made in America Week. I call upon all Americans to observe this week by celebrating Made in America and supporting American workers and domestic businesses that are the backbone of building a future here in America.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this nineteenth day of July, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# Anniversary of the Americans With Disabilities Act, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Today, we celebrate the anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), one of our Nation's most significant civil rights laws to protect people with disabilities from discrimination. For the more than 70 million Americans living with a disability, the ADA enshrines into law the idea that we all deserve opportunity, inclusion, respect, and dignity. I am proud to have co-sponsored this landmark legislation years ago, and I am honored to celebrate its lasting legacy today.
The ADA was a historic triumph against discrimination that opened the doors to opportunity and independence for people with disabilities. But more work still needs to be done. Disabled Americans often earn less for the same work as nondisabled people. Additionally, too often, disabled Americans face obstacles that keep them from voting, prohibit them from getting to and from work and school, or limit their ability to enjoy public spaces.
I believe in building an America for all Americans. That is why, in my first few months in office, I signed an Executive Order establishing a Government-wide commitment to advancing equality and equity in Federal employment, including for people with disabilities. It brought together the Department of Labor and the Office of Personnel Management to ensure that Federal workplaces are fully accessible to people with disabilities and that the dignity and rights of disabled Americans are built into our policies.
At the same time, the Department of Labor is also ensuring our workers are protected by ending unjust employment practices across our economy. For example, my Administration is helping State and local governments, businesses, and nonprofits access Federal funds to hire more disabled Americans. And we are making the Federal Government a model employer when it comes to wages, accommodations, and opportunities to advance for people with disabilities.
Further, we are ensuring that every child with a disability, including early learners, receives a rigorous education in a learning environment that supports their development and well-being and leads to promising pathways after high school. To that end, the Department of Education announced funding to involve parents of children with disabilities as partners in creating equitable and inclusive schools.
Concurrently, my Administration is also taking action to improve access to health care for disabled Americans. Through my Inflation Reduction Act, we have lowered health care costs for people with disabilities. The Department of Health and Human Services issued a rule to bar denials of medical care related to organ donations or lifesaving care for disabled Americans based on their disability alone. They also launched long COVID clinical trials to study its debilitating health effects and created the Office of Long COVID Research and Practice with a first-of-its-kind initiative in our history. The United States Access Board has proposed updated medical diagnostic equipment guidelines to ensure people with disabilities can access health care providers and improve accessibility for manual and powered wheelchair users. Further, the National Institutes of Health made it easier for scientists to get funding for research on health disparities in the disability community by designating people with disabilities a “health disparity population.” We also launched the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health, which is advancing new biomedical science breakthroughs and is opening up new funding for unmet health needs specific to disabled Americans, like biomedicine to prevent, detect, and treat diseases like cancer, diabetes, and multiple sclerosis.
Meanwhile, we are making public spaces and care more accessible to people with disabilities. The American Rescue Plan provided $37 billion to enhance, expand, and strengthen home-based services. That empowers more people with disabilities—including intellectual and developmental disabilities—to live independently at home. In April, the Department of Health and Human Services finalized a rule that will help ensure access to these critical services. Further, our Bipartisan Infrastructure Law makes the biggest investment in our history—$1.75 billion—to make transit and rail stations more accessible. At the same time, we are investing $5 billion to add wheelchair ramps and accessible restrooms at airports and other locations. In addition to issuing a rule that now requires all new single-aisle aircraft over a certain size to have wheelchair-accessible restrooms, the Department of Transportation proposed a new rule to ensure that travelers using wheelchairs can fly safely and with dignity.
Everyone in America should be able to share in the benefits of technology. That is why my Administration has taken action to ensure that we are improving our digital infrastructure for people with disabilities. The Department of Justice issued standards for State and local governments to make their web content and mobile apps more accessible to Americans with disabilities so they can more easily access local government services, emergency services, voting information, and publicly funded education. And my Administration is working to make online health services and applications for jobs in the Federal Government more accessible.
As we celebrate the anniversary of the ADA, we honor the courageous activists who worked so hard to get this historic legislation passed. We recognize the strength of people with disabilities, who remind us every day that
America is stronger when we tap into the talents of all our people. And we renew our commitment to moving America closer to the promise of equal opportunity for all Americans.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim July 26, 2024, as the Anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act. I encourage Americans to celebrate the 34th year of this defining moment in civil rights law and the essential contributions of individuals with disabilities to our Nation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fifth day of July, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# National Korean War Veterans Armistice Day, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
On National Korean War Veterans Armistice Day, we honor the service and sacrifice of the American and Korean service members who fought valiantly in the Korean War from 1950 to 1953. We hold in our hearts the memories of the 36,000 Americans and more than 7,000 Korean Augmentation to the United States Army soldiers who laid down their lives for the sacred cause of freedom. We recommit to upholding their legacy through our alliance with the Republic of Korea and by securing the future they gave everything for—one of peace, stability, and prosperity.
Today, I am thinking of Korean War veterans like Colonel Ralph Puckett, Jr., USA (Ret.), whom I awarded the Medal of Honor to in 2021. Prior to his passing in April, Colonel Puckett was the last living Korean War veteran to have received the Medal of Honor. His story, though one of uncommon valor, was reflected in the experiences and trials of so many of our Nation's Korean War veterans—trudging through frozen rice paddies, fighting on the rocky terrain of the Korean Peninsula, and persisting in spite of the fact that the enemy often far outnumbered our troops. Like I said to Colonel Puckett and his family years ago: Though the Korean War is sometimes called the “Forgotten War,” the heroes who were there under his command will never forget his bravery, and neither will we. Our entire Nation owes a debt of gratitude to every Korean War veteran for their service and sacrifice. As we recognize the service and sacrifice of our Nation's Korean War veterans, we also remember the thousands of service members who went missing in action during the Korean War—we will never stop working to bring each of them home.
Last year, I joined President Yoon of the Republic of Korea to mark the 70th anniversary of our countries' alliance. It is an unbreakable bond because it was forged in bravery and the sacrifice of both of our peoples—sanctified by the American and Korean troops who fought and died to defend liberty. Our Korean War veterans are the reason the alliance stands
and remains strong today as two vibrant and innovative democracies. This alliance is why I was proud to sign the Korean American VALOR Act into law, helping Korean veterans who fought alongside American troops and are now American citizens receive access to Department of Veterans Affairs health care services.
Our Nation's Korean War veterans answered the call to duty. Like every generation before them, these veterans knew that freedom is never guaranteed—one has to fight for it and defend it in the battle between autocracy and democracy, between the greed of a few and the rights of many. As Colonel Puckett said: “Our country depends on you, me, what you do every day, and how you live . . . It depends on us.” May we all show our gratitude for our service members, who show us every day what it means to put our democracy and our Nation first.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim July 27, 2024, as National Korean War Veterans Armistice Day. On this day, I encourage all Americans to reflect on the strength, sacrifices, and sense of duty of our Korean War veterans and bestow upon them the high honor they deserve. I call upon all Americans to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities that honor and give thanks to our distinguished Korean War veterans.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fifth day of July, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# National Health Center Week, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Federally funded community health centers are a lifeline for over 30 million Americans nationwide—providing affordable access to quality medical, dental, and behavioral health services, which save lives. Community health center sites are especially critical for people in Tribal, rural, and underserved communities because they are often the closest and most convenient sources of care. During National Health Center Week, we recognize the importance of the nearly 1,400 federally funded community health centers that provide critical services to Americans. We express our gratitude to their dedicated staff, who tirelessly devote themselves to the well-being of their patients. And we recommit to ensuring that every American has access to good-quality, affordable health care.
I have seen firsthand just how vital community health centers are to our entire Nation. At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, we invested $7.6 billion in our Nation's health center network so Americans could get the care they needed, no matter their background or zip code. It worked. For
example, health centers distributed over 20 million COVID-19 vaccines—2 out of 3 went to people of color, and 2 out of 10 went to rural residents. And every day, health centers have empowered Americans to access the affordable, quality health care services they need—from cancer screenings and maternal health care to telehealth services that reach people where they are.
Community health centers play a key role in making sure health care is a right in this country, not a privilege—that is why my Administration is investing in them at a historic rate. My Budget would put the Health Center Program on a pathway to double in size. We have also delivered funding for community health centers to expand critical services, including substance use disorder treatments, behavioral health care, pregnancy-related care, and preventative cancer screenings.
At the same time, my Administration is lowering health care costs so every American has access to the care that they need. We strengthened the Affordable Care Act, and more people in this country have health care coverage under my Administration than ever before. We are also capping total prescription drug costs for seniors on Medicare at $2,000 per year, even for expensive medications. We slashed the price of insulin to $35 per month for seniors on Medicare, down from as much as $400 per month. And we finally beat Big Pharma by giving Medicare the power to negotiate lower drug prices.
During National Health Center Week, we honor all of the health center staff, who sacrifice so much to care for the health and well-being of their communities. We celebrate the impact of health centers across the country, and we recommit to supporting their efforts and their vision—a future where everyone has access to affordable, quality health care.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim the week of August 4 through August 10, 2024, as National Health Center Week.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this second day of August, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# To Further Facilitate Positive Adjustment to Competition From Imports of Certain Crystalline Silicon Photovoltaic Cells (Whether or Not Partially or Fully Assembled Into Other Products)By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
1. On January 23, 2018, pursuant to section 203 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the “Trade Act”) (19 U.S.C. 2253), the President issued Proclamation 9693, imposing a safeguard measure for a period of 4 years that included both a tariff-rate quota (TRQ) on imports of certain crystalline silicon photovoltaic (CSPV) cells, not partially or fully assembled into other products, provided for in subheading 8541.40.60 (currently 8541.42.00) of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS), and an increase in duties (safeguard tariff) on imports of CSPV cells exceeding the TRQ and all imports of other CSPV products, including modules provided for in subheading 8541.40.60 (currently 8541.43.00) of the HTS. Proclamation 9693 exempted imports from certain designated beneficiary countries under the Generalized System of Preferences from the application of the safeguard measure.
2. After taking into account the United States International Trade Commission's (USITC) report on the results of its monitoring of developments with respect to the domestic solar industry (USITC, Crystalline Silicon Photovoltaic Cells, Whether or Not Partially or Fully Assembled Into Other Products: Monitoring Developments in the Domestic Industry, No. TA-201-075 (Monitoring)) and the USITC's report regarding the probable economic effect on the domestic CSPV cell and module manufacturing industry of modifying the safeguard measure (USITC, Crystalline Silicon Photovoltaic Cells, Whether or Not Partially or Fully Assembled Into Other Products: Advice on the Probable Economic Effect of Certain Modifications to the Safeguard Measure, No. TA-201-075 (Modification)), and after receiving a petition from a majority of the representatives of the domestic industry with respect to each of the following modifications, on October 10, 2020, the President issued Proclamation 10101 under section 204(b)(1)(B) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2254(b)(1)(B)). In Proclamation 10101, the President determined that the domestic industry had begun to make a positive adjustment to import competition, as shown by the increases in domestic module production capacity, production, and market share. Proclamation 10101 also:
(a) revoked the exclusion of bifacial modules from application of the safeguard measure on the basis that it had impaired and was likely to continue to impair the effectiveness of the safeguard action; and
(b) adjusted the safeguard tariff for the fourth year of the safeguard measure from 15 percent to 18 percent on the basis that the exclusion of bifacial modules from application of the safeguard tariff had impaired the remedial effectiveness of the 4-year action proclaimed in Proclamation 9693, and to achieve the full remedial effect envisaged in that action.
3. On November 16, 2021, the United States Court of International Trade (CIT) held in
Solar Energy Industries Association et al.
v.
United States
that the President acted outside of his statutory authority in issuing Proclamation 10101, and enjoined the Government from enforcing that proclamation. However, in November 2023, a panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed the CIT's decision.
4. After receiving the USITC's December 8, 2021, determination and report pursuant to section 204(c) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2254(c)), which found that the safeguard action continues to be necessary to prevent or remedy the serious injury to the domestic industry and that there was evidence that the domestic industry was making a positive adjustment to import competition (USITC, Crystalline Silicon Photovoltaic Cells, Whether or Not Partially or Fully Assembled Into Other Products, Investigation No. TA-201-75 (Extension)), and after taking into account the information provided in the USITC's report and the information received from the public through the process published in the
Federal Register
on September 30, 2021 (86 FR 54279), pursuant to section 203(e)(1)(B) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253(e)(1)(B)), I issued Proclamation 10339 on February 4, 2022. In Proclamation 10339, I determined that the safeguard action on imports of CSPV cells, whether or not partially or fully assembled into other products, continued to be necessary to prevent or remedy the serious injury to the domestic industry, and that there was evidence that the domestic industry was making a positive adjustment to import competition. I further determined to extend the safeguard measure proclaimed in Proclamation 9693, as modified by Proclamation 10101, in relevant part, as follows:
(a) continuation of the TRQ on imports of solar cells not partially or fully assembled into other products imposed by Proclamation 9693, as described in paragraph 1 of Proclamation 10339 and paragraph 1 of this proclamation, for an additional period of 4 years, with unchanging within-quota quantities of 5.0 gigawatts (GW) for each year and annual reductions in the rates of duty applicable to goods entered in excess of those quantities of cells in the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth years, as described in Annex I to Proclamation 10339; and
(b) continuation of the safeguard tariff on imports of modules imposed by Proclamation 9693, as described in paragraph 1 of Proclamation 10339 and paragraph 1 of this proclamation, for an additional period of 4 years, with annual reductions in the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth years, as described in Annex I to Proclamation 10339.
5. If an extension of an action taken under section 203 of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253) exceeds 3 years, section 204(a)(2) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2254(a)(2)) requires the USITC to issue a report to the President and the Congress on its monitoring of developments with respect to the domestic industry, including the progress and specific efforts made by workers and firms in the domestic industry to make a positive adjustment to import competition, no later than the midpoint of the period of the extension.
6. On February 6, 2024, the USITC issued its midterm report pursuant to section 204(a)(2) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2254(a)(2)) on its monitoring of developments within the industry producing CSPV products since the President's extension of the safeguard measure (USITC, Crystalline Silicon Photovoltaic Cells, Whether or Not Partially or Fully Assembled Into Other Products: Monitoring Developments in the Domestic Industry, No. TA-
201-075 (Second Monitoring)). In its report, the USITC found that the safeguard measure has resulted in positive adjustments from the domestic industry in light of increased actual and planned module production; various announcements of planned domestic cell production; and improvements in several of the domestic industry's financial, trade, and employment indicators.
7. On September 19, 2023, a majority of the representatives of the domestic industry submitted a petition under section 204(b) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2254(b)(1)(B)) to modify the safeguard measure by eliminating the TRQ and providing for tariff-free treatment of all imports of CSPV cells, or alternatively to increase the TRQ from 5 GW to 20 GW annually. The petition explains how the domestic industry has continued to make a positive adjustment to import competition. It also explains that expected domestic module production coupled with current lack of sufficient domestic cell production will require domestic module producers to rely on imports in the near term, in excess of the current 5 GW within-quota TRQ amount.
8. Section 204(b)(1)(B) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2254(b)(1)(B)) authorizes the President, upon submission of a petition from a majority of the representatives of the domestic industry, to reduce, modify, or terminate an action taken under section 203 of the Trade Act when the President determines that the domestic industry has made a positive adjustment to import competition.
9. After taking into account the information provided in the USITC's midterm report, and after receiving a petition from a majority of the representatives of the domestic industry requesting expansion or elimination of the TRQ on imports of certain CSPV cells, I have determined that the domestic industry has been making and is continuing to make a positive adjustment to import competition, shown by increased actual and planned module production; various announcements of planned domestic cell production; and improvements in several of the domestic industry's financial, trade, and employment indicators. Furthermore, I have determined that expected domestic module production and associated imports of CSPV cells have increased such that it is necessary to modify the action taken in Proclamation 9693, as extended by Proclamation 10339, by expanding the TRQ to unchanging within-quota quantities of 12.5 GW.
10. The in-quota quantity in each year of the TRQ described in paragraph 9 of this proclamation shall be allocated among all countries except those countries the products of which are excluded from such TRQ pursuant to clause (4) of Proclamation 10339 or paragraph 10 of Proclamation 9693.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, including sections 203, 204, and 604 of the Trade Act, do proclaim that:
(1) In order to modify the action applicable to imports of CSPV cells under HTS subheading 8541.42.0010 and other CSPV products, such as modules under HTS subheading 8541.43.0010, subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTS is modified as set forth in Annex I to this proclamation.
(2) The modifications to the HTS made by this proclamation, including Annex I hereto, shall be effective with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after
12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on August 1, 2024, and shall continue in effect as provided in Annex I to this proclamation, unless such actions are earlier expressly reduced, modified, or terminated.
(3) CSPV products that are subject to the modifications described in clause (1) of this proclamation, and which are entered into the United States above the prior TRQ limit of 5 GW on or after August 1, 2024, shall be included within the modified TRQ limit of 12.5 GW and shall not be assessed safeguard tariffs unless they enter into the United States above the modified TRQ limit of 12.5 GW.
(4) U.S. Customs and Border Protection shall take such actions as are necessary to ensure proper application of clauses (1), (2), and (3) of this proclamation.
(5) One year from the termination of the safeguard measure referenced in this proclamation, as modified by this proclamation, the U.S. note and tariff provisions established in Annex I to this proclamation shall be deleted from the HTS.
(6) Any provision of previous proclamations and Executive Orders that is inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation is superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twelfth day of August, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# National Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve Week, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Every member of the National Guard and Reserve forms a link in the chain of honor that stretches back far before our Nation's founding. Throughout the centuries, these extraordinary citizens have committed themselves to a life of service and sacrifice for the United States. During National Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve Week, we show gratitude for the members of our National Guard and Reserve, who protect, defend, and serve our Nation. And we thank their patriotic civilian employers, who go above and beyond to support their mission.
The First Lady and I have a special place in our hearts for the National Guard and Reserve because our son Major Beau Biden served in the Delaware Army National Guard. We know firsthand the sacrifices these brave women and men make. The members of our National Guard and Reserve must be ready to answer the call of duty at a moment's notice—leaving their civilian jobs behind to serve on missions across the country and around the world. It is a sacrifice that requires agility to adapt to an often unpredictable schedule that affects not only their lives and their families, but their employers as well.
That is why, this week, we thank all the outstanding employers who go above and beyond to ensure the members of our National Guard and Reserve receive the critical support they need. Employers have stepped up when they are away for military training or deployed—from offering flexible leave policies to ensuring their families continue to have access to health care and benefits. Our National Guard and Reserve members' civilian employers empower them to take on critical missions that support national security efforts and keep all of us safe.
Our National Guard and Reserve service members serve to preserve our freedom because they know that freedom is never guaranteed. Every generation has to earn it, fight for it, and defend it. Our service members' sacrifices ensure that America continues to have the greatest fighting force in the history of the world, and we are grateful to all the employers across the country who help make it possible. These employers are a reminder that there is truly nothing we cannot accomplish as a Nation if we work together. This week, may we show our gratitude for our troops and all the employers who support their mission.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim August 18 through August 24, 2024, as National Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve Week. I call upon all Americans to observe this week by honoring our National Guard and Reserve service members, who sacrifice so much to keep our country and communities safe and secure, and to commend the employers who empower these service members to thrive.

# Establishment of the Springfield 1908 Race Riot National MonumentBy the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
In August 1908, mere blocks from the former home of President Abraham Lincoln, a white mob attacked the Black community in Springfield, Illinois, lynching two Black Americans and burning homes down to their foundations. By the time the National Guard quelled the violence, the mob had looted and destroyed businesses, razed city blocks, and displaced hundreds of people from their homes. Labeled by the media as a race riot, the event was emblematic of the racism, intimidation, violence, and lynchings that Black Americans experienced in communities across the country in the late 19th and early 20th Centuries. The horror that became known as the Springfield 1908 Race Riot drew the attention of national newspapers and Black and white activists interested in social change. In the wake of the devastation and ensuing outcry, a group of visionary civic leaders launched the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, which went on to achieve momentous civil rights victories and continues to work toward racial justice and equity.
Today, the foundations of destroyed homes and the objects they contain are tangible markers of these historic events and reminders of the impact that the Springfield 1908 Race Riot had on our Nation. The area located between North 9th and 11th Streets, and between East Mason and East Madison Streets, constitutes the Springfield 1908 Race Riot Site. This site weaves together two important threads in our Nation's story: the hateful violence targeted against Black Americans, and the power of dedicated individuals to come together across racial lines to transform shock and grief into hope and action.
At the turn of the 20th Century, the United States was still struggling to fulfill the promises of the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments to the Constitution—amendments that abolished slavery; guaranteed due process and equal protection under the law; and prohibited abridgement of the right to vote on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude. Numerous States and municipalities, primarily in the South, passed anti-Black legislation, including Jim Crow laws, to enforce racial segregation and to maintain white structural power by restricting Black people's daily lives. As millions of Black people migrated to towns and cities in the North seeking a better life, they were often confronted with racial bias, segregated schools, discriminatory and restrictive housing
practices, and other forms of discrimination. Black people were also subjected to a nationwide wave of racial violence that began after the Civil War. Between 1882 and 1910, there were 2,503 recorded lynchings of Black people in the United States. Many lynchings during this grim chapter of American history occurred during riots led by white mobs engaged in a broader pattern of violence, similar to the one that took place in Springfield.
There, on Friday, August 14, 1908, a crowd of mostly white men gathered outside the Sangamon County Jail, which was 2 blocks from the edge of the Badlands neighborhood, a community northeast of the center of the city that included many low-income Black residents and families. The mob was calling for the lynching of two Black men: Joe James and George Richardson. James stood accused of the murder of a white man and attempted assault on his daughter. Richardson was accused of sexually assaulting a white woman.
The sheriff, hoping to defuse the situation and avoid the white-mob lynchings that had occurred in similar circumstances, arranged for the two men to be quietly transferred to a jail in another town. Harry Loper, a local white leader who shared the sheriff's concerns, agreed to help with the transfer. When the crowd learned of the sheriff's and Loper's actions, it erupted in violence. The mob wreaked havoc and destruction in the surrounding Badlands and Levee neighborhoods—attacking and destroying dozens of Black-owned businesses and residences, as well as some Jewish-owned businesses and other businesses that served the predominantly Black community. Loper also paid a price for helping the men; after he returned, the mob set fire to his car and vandalized his restaurant.
One of the buildings the mob torched was in the Badlands neighborhood on 12th Street between Madison and Mason Streets where Scott Burton, a Black barber, was trying to protect his home. At approximately 2:30 a.m. on Saturday, August 15, 1908, the mob beat Burton into unconsciousness before dragging him half a block south to the corner of Madison and 12th Streets. There, he was further brutalized and hanged from a tree, and he died from his injuries. All the while, the rioters celebrated his lynching.
On Saturday, the second day of the riot, the violence briefly abated as State militia reinforcements arrived and Governor Charles Deneen designated the Illinois State Arsenal as a temporary refuge for Black residents. Black firefighters of Firehouse No. 5 responded to fires and fought to quench the flames and save the homes of Black residents and Black-owned businesses, even after being dismissed by the Mayor of Springfield. Despite these actions, by 7:00 p.m. Saturday evening, crowds again amassed and resumed the mob violence of the previous night.
That same day, the riot reached the home of William K. Donnegan, a Black 84-year-old retired cobbler who had made shoes for Abraham Lincoln and served as an Underground Railroad operative. Donnegan was married to a white woman and lived with his family in a nearby middle-class white neighborhood. On Saturday night, a group of white men gathered outside of Donnegan's house, beat him with bricks, and cut his throat with a razor. They dragged him across the street and hanged him from a tree in the neighboring schoolyard, just 2 blocks from the Illinois State Capitol. The police and National Guard personnel found Donnegan still alive, and took him to St. John's Hospital, where he received medical care along with other
people injured in the riot—Black and white alike. Although he survived the night, he died the next day from his injuries.
Soon after the riot, George Richardson's accuser issued a signed statement confessing that her assailant had in fact been a white man. Joe James's story took a different turn. His lawyer tried to remove James's case from Sangamon County, arguing he would not be able to get an impartial jury there, but those efforts failed and James was tried and convicted in the same community that carried out the race riot. On October 23, 1908, James was executed by hanging at the Sangamon County Jail. Only one white rioter was convicted of a violent crime in connection with the destruction wrought on Springfield's Black community. In a poignant postscript, the two men lynched, Scott Burton and William K. Donnegan, were laid to rest in the same Springfield cemetery as President Lincoln.
The national and local press covered the Springfield 1908 Race Riot extensively. The devastation of the Badlands neighborhood and nearby sites captured the attention of prominent civil rights leaders and spurred new action. In response to the Springfield 1908 Race Riot, an interracial group of dozens of civil rights leaders, including W.E.B. Du Bois, William English Walling, Mary White Ovington, Ida B. Wells-Barnett, and Mary Church Terrell, issued an open letter in February 1909 “taking stock of the nation's progress” on the centennial of Lincoln's birth. Invoking Lincoln's words from 1858 that “[a] house divided against itself cannot stand,” the group “call[ed] upon all the believers in democracy to join in a national conference for the discussion of present evils, the voicing of protests, and the renewal of the struggle for civil and political liberty.”
This call led to a meeting in the spring of 1909 of a group initially called the National Negro Committee to discuss forming a permanent, national organization that would advocate to combat lynching and racial prejudice, improve the lives of Black Americans, and secure the civil and political rights guaranteed to them by the Constitution. On May 12, 1910, the National Negro Committee formally named the new organization the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).
For more than a century, the NAACP has been at the forefront of key legal and political movements to end lynching, remove barriers of racial discrimination, and advance civil and political rights. The NAACP and its legal team devised the transformative, decades-long legal strategy culminating in
Brown
v.
Board of Education
(1954), in which the Supreme Court declared the “separate but equal” doctrine to be unconstitutional and gutted the legal underpinnings of segregation and Jim Crow laws.
The NAACP, along with partners and allies, turned the Springfield 1908 Race Riot's legacy from one of tragedy alone into one that led to enduring progress and change. Yet those violent and fateful days had persistent discriminatory effects on Springfield. Although the rioters did not succeed in driving Black residents from the city entirely, their actions led to the displacement of Black people from the Badlands and other affected neighborhoods and paved the way for so-called “urban renewal projects” that erased much of the neighborhoods' physical imprint. One of the country's first public housing projects was constructed on remnants of the Badlands neighborhood. The 8-block John Hay Homes housing complex, built in the 1940s, provided low-income housing, primarily to white people. The John
Hay Homes and other projects drastically altered the landscape, demolishing blocks of structures to develop facilities including high-rise apartments, low-rent apartments, an expressway, and a civic center.
Notwithstanding the changes to the surrounding neighborhoods, the Springfield 1908 Race Riot Site, a 2-block area stretching northward from East Madison Street between North 9th and 11th Streets, still contains archeological remains and scars of the riot. The site, which has been identified as the approximate point where the violent assault on the Badlands neighborhood began in 1908, provides some of the last physical remains of the race riot and the neighborhood it destroyed, including the charred foundations of five houses burned by the white mob in 1908.
Archeological excavations of the site have uncovered other historic objects remaining at the site, including a partial cellar, stone steps, and a brick walk. This area and the archeological artifacts it contains have a singular ability to tell the story of the race riot and its impacts on Black residents at this pivotal point in Springfield and the Nation's history.
Archeological studies have concluded that the site likely contains significant additional resources and artifacts that could help further illuminate the history of the Badlands neighborhood. In addition to the five burned houses, the site encompasses the plots of several other buildings demolished in the riot. Spared the architectural erasure of urban renewal, the Springfield 1908 Race Riot Site can help bring greater attention to this chapter in American history. The National Park Service has recognized the historical significance of this site to civil rights history by adding it to the African American Civil Rights Network.
Preservation of the Springfield 1908 Race Riot Site will protect the objects of historic interest found therein from removal, development, or other activities that could erase their presence in the area. It will also ensure that the site and its objects remain available for future generations to learn about the Springfield 1908 Race Riot and how this brutal event near President Lincoln's home underscored the pattern of racially motivated violence perpetrated on Black people throughout the country and catalyzed the formation of the NAACP. Ida B. Wells-Barnett, one of the co-founders of the NAACP and a national hero who led the campaign against lynching, described the Springfield 1908 Race Riot as showing that “the hue and cry once started stops at no bounds.” Protecting the Springfield 1908 Race Riot Site is essential to preserve and narrate the history that galvanized civil rights leaders to establish an institution to work for real and lasting change, creating hope for our democracy out of the embers of this neighborhood in Springfield, Illinois.
WHEREAS, section 320301 of title 54, United States Code (the “Antiquities Act”), authorizes the President, in his discretion, to declare by public proclamation historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic or scientific interest that are situated upon the lands owned or controlled by the Federal Government to be national monuments, and to reserve as a part thereof parcels of land, the limits of which shall be confined to the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected; and

# Overdose Awareness Week, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
During Overdose Awareness Week, we mourn those who have lost their lives to overdose deaths. We acknowledge the devastating toll the opioid epidemic has taken on individuals, families, and communities across America. We reflect on the progress we have made so far in reducing the number of annual overdose deaths and protecting American lives—and how much more there is to do. And we reaffirm our commitment to doing more to disrupt the supply of fentanyl and other synthetic opioids and support those who suffer with substance use disorder and their families in all of our communities.
My Administration made beating the opioid epidemic a key priority in my Unity Agenda for the Nation, calling for Republicans and Democrats to work together to stop fentanyl from flowing into our communities, hold those who brought it here accountable, and deliver life-saving medication and care across America.
We are working to tackle this crisis through a comprehensive approach, including by expanding access to evidence-based prevention, treatment, harm reduction, and recovery support services as well as reducing the supply of illicit drugs. We have expanded access to life-saving treatments, like medications to treat opioid use disorder, and have increased the number of health care providers who can prescribe these medications by 15 times. In February 2024, the Department of Health and Human Services issued a rule to comprehensively update the regulations in governing Opioid Treatment Programs for the first time in 20 years—removing barriers to the treatment of substance use disorder and expanding access to care. My Administration has made historic investments in the State Opioid Response and Tribal Opioid Response programs to improve prevention; expand treatment; and deliver free, life-saving medications across America. Already, this program has delivered nearly 10 million kits of opioid overdose reversal medications, such as naloxone.
We also continue to fight the stigmatization that surrounds substance use and accidental overdose so that people feel comfortable reaching out for help when they need it. Naloxone is now available over-the-counter for people to purchase at their local grocery stores and pharmacies. We also launched the White House Challenge to Save Lives from Overdose and several awareness campaigns, raising awareness and securing commitments from local governments and cross-sector organizations to increase training on and access to opioid overdose reversal medications in schools, worksites, transit systems, and other places where overdose may occur in our communities. My Fiscal Year 2025 Budget requests $22 billion to expand substance use treatment and help more Americans achieve and stay in recovery.
Under my Administration, Federal law enforcement agents are keeping more deadly drugs out of our communities than ever before. We are seizing deadly drugs at our borders so that illicit drugs never reach our neighborhoods. Officials have stopped more illicit fentanyl at ports of entry over the
last 2 fiscal years than in the previous 5 fiscal years combined. The Department of Justice has prosecuted leaders of the world's largest and most powerful drug cartel along with thousands of drug traffickers. The Department of the Treasury has sanctioned more than 300 people and organizations involved in the global illicit drug trade. I have also deployed cutting-edge drug detection technology across our southwest border, and I continue to call on the Congress to strengthen border security, increase penalties on those who bring deadly drugs into our communities, and close loopholes that drug traffickers exploit. And in July 2024, I issued a National Security Memorandum that calls on all relevant Federal departments and agencies to work collaboratively to do even more than they are already doing to stop the supply of illicit fentanyl and other synthetic opioids into our country.
I am also committed to working with partners across the globe to address this crisis. Last year, I negotiated the re-launch of counternarcotics cooperation between the United States and the People's Republic of China—which has led to increased law enforcement coordination, increased efforts to tackle illicit financing of drug cartels, and increased regulation of certain precursor chemicals. I have increased counternarcotics cooperation with other key foreign governments; launched the Global Coalition to Address Synthetic Drug Threats, which brings together more than 150 countries in the fight against drug trafficking cartels; put in place new initiatives between the United States, Mexico, and Canada targeting the supply of illicit drugs; and made countering fentanyl and other synthetic opioids a key priority of the G7.
Now for the first time in 5 years, the number of overdose deaths in the United States has started to decline. But even one death is one too many, and far too many Americans continue to lose loved ones to fentanyl.
Today I grieve with all the families and friends who have lost someone to an overdose. This is a time to act. And this is a time to stand together—for all those we have lost and all the lives we can still save.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim August 25 through August 31, 2024, as Overdose Awareness Week. I call upon citizens, government agencies, civil society organizations, health care providers, and research institutions to raise awareness of substance use disorder so that our Nation can combat stigmatization, promote treatment, celebrate recovery, and strengthen our collective efforts to prevent overdose deaths. August 31 also marks Overdose Awareness Day, on which we honor and remember those who have lost their lives to the overdose epidemic.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-third day of August, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

Proc. 10794

# Women's Equality Day, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
One hundred and four years ago, American women won the right to vote with the ratification of the 19th Amendment, bringing us closer to living up to our Nation's most fundamental values of dignity, fairness, freedom, and equality. On Women's Equality Day, we recognize the courage of generations of visionaries who fought tirelessly for the sacred cause of women's suffrage and all those who continue to work toward a more equitable future for women and girls in America.
The 19th Amendment marked a critical milestone in our Nation's history, but it did not guarantee the right to vote for all. For many women of color, that right would not be secured until decades later when the Voting Rights Act was passed in 1965. Today, our Nation is still facing relentless assaults on the sacred right to vote freely and fairly and to have every vote count. At the same time, women's fundamental rights are under attack, which undermines our democracy and our freedoms. These challenges serve as a critical reminder that our work as a Nation is never done—realizing the full promise of the 19th Amendment is as important today as ever before.
My Administration is committed to upholding the vision of suffragists, who understood that equality at the ballot box was a critical step to advancing rights and opportunities for American women. Over the past three and a half years, Vice President Harris and I have leveraged the full force of the Federal Government to protect those rights and remove barriers that prevent women and girls from reaching their full potential. We are defending reproductive freedom, delivering the highest women's prime-age labor force participation and the narrowest gender pay gap on record, making historic investments in the care economy, fighting to end violence against women, increasing access to educational opportunity, and promoting women's representation, leadership, and human rights here at home and around the globe.
Guaranteeing women access to affordable, quality health care has also been a top priority for my Administration. That is why we have been working to address the maternal health crisis, with Vice President Kamala Harris announcing our Blueprint for Addressing the Maternal Health Crisis. Furthermore, in addition to issuing an Executive Order directing the most comprehensive set of executive actions to expand research on women's health, last year the First Lady and I were proud to launch the first-ever White House Initiative on Women's Health Research, and the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health has dedicated $100 million to solve challenges in women's health. As part of the Biden Cancer Moonshot, we are taking significant actions to save and improve the lives of the millions of American women facing cancer. During my first year in office, we expanded coverage under the Affordable Care Act, which requires insurers to pay for cancer screenings and primary care visits, including those that will detect cancer early when outcomes are best. Furthermore, I have taken action to safeguard access to reproductive care—and the Vice President and I will keep calling on the Congress to restore
Roe
v.
Wade
as the law of the land.
Americans show time and again that they agree that health care decisions should be made by a woman with the help of her doctor, not politicians—and we will continue fighting to ensure that women can access the health care they need in every State.
To be the strongest economy in the world, we cannot leave women—who make up half our workforce—behind. Through our American Rescue Plan, my Administration made the biggest investment in child care ever, helping over 225,000 child care programs that serve 10 million children across the country keep their doors open and enabling parents, especially mothers, to enter or remain in the workforce. We have taken steps to advance pay equity and transparency for Federal employees and contractors, eliminating practices that allow pay discrimination to follow workers from job to job and helping workers better negotiate and reduce pay inequities. We are also ensuring that women have access to the millions of good-paying jobs created by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the CHIPS and Science Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act.
Women and girls deserve to live free from violence and fear. Next month marks 30 years since the Congress passed the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA)—a historic law that I championed and wrote. VAWA gave our Government more comprehensive tools to prevent and prosecute sexual assault, provide support for survivors, and save countless women's lives. Today, this law, which I reauthorized in 2022, has record funding levels and grant programs. In addition, my Administration is working to address online harassment and abuse, including image-based sexual abuse generated by artificial intelligence. And we restored and strengthened vital protections under Title IX for students who have experienced campus sexual assault and other forms of sex discrimination in schools and universities.
Since I took office, I have been proud to serve alongside the first woman ever elected as Vice President, Kamala Harris, and to have appointed women to the highest levels of my Administration, including a record number of female Cabinet Secretaries. I established the White House Gender Policy Council to advance the rights of women and girls at home and abroad. My Administration released the first-ever National Strategy on Gender Equity and Equality. And during Women's History Month this year, I signed an Executive Order to increase the representation of women's history in the National Park System and to help honor the legacy and contributions of women and girls to our country.
My Administration will continue to fight for every American's sacred right to vote—carrying on the legacy of the suffragists we celebrate today. I continue to call on the Congress to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and the Freedom to Vote Act to restore and expand access to the ballot and prevent voter suppression—because every American's voice deserves to be heard.
We are making tremendous progress, but more must be done to ensure equal rights and opportunity for women and girls. I urge the Congress to recognize the ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment and affirm the fundamental truth that all Americans should have equal rights and protections under the law. This Women's Equality Day, let us recommit to building a country and a world where our daughters have the same opportunities as our sons. Because when women thrive, we all thrive.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim August 26, 2024, as Women's Equality Day. I call upon the people of the United States to celebrate and continue to build on our country's progress toward gender equality and to defend and strengthen the right to vote.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-third day of August, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# National Childhood Cancer Awareness Month, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
During National Childhood Cancer Awareness Month, we honor the extraordinary courage of the hundreds of thousands of children who are facing cancer, who survived cancer, or who were taken too soon by this deadly disease. We offer strength and support to their families and friends, who devotedly care for their loved ones through every step of their cancer journeys. And we recommit to finally ending cancer as we know it so that every child has the opportunity to realize their full potential and lead healthy, long, fulfilling lives.
Cancer is the leading cause of death by disease for children in America. As every family who has dealt with cancer knows—of all the things cancer steals from us, time is the cruelest. So many young, bright children who should be exploring our world are forced to spend their precious time confined to hospital rooms. Meanwhile, families and caregivers are left to navigate mountains of medical information, decipher complex treatment options, and find the means to pay for exorbitant medical bills as the emotional, physical, and financial toll mounts.
For my family, and for millions of Americans, the fight against cancer is personal. When I lost my son Beau after his courageous battle with cancer, I buried a piece of my soul. It is a feeling too many families know all too well. That is why I came into office with a mission to accelerate research into curing cancer and to ensure that cancer patients and their families are treated with dignity throughout the process. Toward that aim, the First Lady and I reignited the Biden Cancer Moonshot—mobilizing the entire country to cut the cancer death rate in half within 25 years and to strengthen support for patients and families. Additionally, I formed the first-ever Cancer Cabinet to break down silos and deliver all of the cancer prevention, early detection, treatments, care, and support needed to save more than 4 million Americans' lives by 2047.
Through these and other initiatives, we are making tremendous progress. We secured $4 billion in bipartisan funding from the Congress to realize
my Administration's vision for a new biomedical research agency, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health, to drive breakthroughs in prevention, diagnosis, and treatment for cancer and other diseases. The National Cancer Institute developed a National Cancer Plan to fast-track effective cancer treatments, including for children, and this year alone we have secured $7.3 billion for work across the National Cancer Institute. We are creating a national network to connect eligible children, adolescents, and young adults to opportunities to participate in clinical trials by launching the Childhood Cancer-Data Integration for Research, Education, Care, and Clinical Trials. The Institute's Childhood Cancer Data Initiative is also providing free molecular testing of tumors. Moreover, we are working to implement the RACE for Children Act to identify and approve precision pediatric drugs quickly. And I signed the Childhood Cancer STAR Reauthorization Act to increase funding for childhood cancer research.
My Administration is also working hard to ensure that treatment is more accessible and affordable. I am proud to strengthen Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act (ACA) by keeping children covered under Medicaid for a full year and expanding ACA coverage to millions of families—saving them approximately $800 per year on health insurance premiums. And we are receiving commitments from companies, nonprofits, and patient groups to increase screening, prevent exposure to toxic substances, deliver new research innovations, and improve access for more Americans to effective care.
At the same time, my Administration is making sure that no family is left behind in the cancer treatment process. Everyone needs a navigator who can help guide them through each step of their cancer journey—from sorting through health care costs to figuring out transportation to the hospital. We delivered new reimbursement codes so that, for the first time ever, families facing cancer can get patient navigation services paid for through Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurance. Cancer navigation services are personalized assistance to patients, caregivers, and families to help guide them through the many decisions and challenges that come with a cancer diagnosis, which have been shown to reduce cancer disparities, improve health outcomes, and make an enormous difference in people's lives. To date, 40 cancer centers and community oncology practices nationwide along with 7 leading insurance companies who serve more than 150 million Americans have committed to providing and paying for navigation services for families facing cancer.
Across the Nation, millions of families hold on to hope that their loved ones will get the cancer treatment they need to be cured for good. During this National Childhood Cancer Awareness Month, let us give strength to all the pediatric patients, their families, and their caretakers. Let us pay tribute to all the brave kids who inspire us to keep fighting and never give up. And let us recommit to doing all we can together to create a brighter, cancer-free future for America's youth.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2024 as National Childhood Cancer Awareness Month. I encourage citizens, government agencies, private businesses, nonprofit organizations, the media, and other interested groups to increase awareness of what Americans can do to
support the fight against childhood cancer. I encourage anyone experiencing uncertainty around risk factors or treatment options or looking for other opportunities for support to connect with a trained specialist at 1-800-4-CANCER or visit cancer.gov.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of August, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Too many Americans know the pain of losing a mother, sister, wife, daughter, or friend to ovarian cancer—the deadliest of all female reproductive system cancers. This year alone, nearly 20,000 women will be diagnosed with this terrible disease. During National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month, we honor the memories of all the women we have tragically lost. We reaffirm our support for all the brave women living with ovarian cancer and all those who have survived it. And we thank their loved ones, who stand loyally by their side, and the medical researchers, health care providers, and caretakers who fight tirelessly to save lives every day.
In our decades-long fight to find cures for cancers, scientists have made incredible breakthroughs and discovered better ways to prevent, detect, and treat them. But for ovarian cancer, in particular, there remains no reliable method for asymptomatic screening and detection, which can delay a diagnosis until the cancer has become deadly. Even after a diagnosis has been made, the flood of medical information, appointments, procedures, and financial expenses is overwhelming. And too often, families, caregivers, and patients are left to advocate for themselves for effective care.
Jill and I know from personal experience that a cancer diagnosis takes a severe toll on the whole family. That is why I made fighting cancer a top priority for our Administration. I reignited the Biden Cancer Moonshot with the goal of cutting the cancer death rate by at least 50 percent over 25 years and improving the experience of patients and loved ones. I established the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health, securing $4 billion in bipartisan funding to support scientists, innovators, and public health professionals who are pioneering efforts to prevent, detect, and treat cancer and other life-threatening and life-altering diseases. And we delivered new reimbursement codes so that, for the first time ever, families facing cancer can get patient navigation services paid for through Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurance. Cancer navigation services are personalized assistance to patients, caregivers, and families to help guide them through the many decisions and challenges that come with a cancer diagnosis, which has been shown to reduce cancer disparities, improve health outcomes, and make an enormous difference in people's lives.
My Administration has also been working hard to make cancer treatments more affordable. I am proud to strengthen Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act (ACA) by expanding health care coverage to millions of Americans—saving millions of families $800 per year on health insurance premiums. And through the Inflation Reduction Act, we are capping total out-of-pocket prescription drug costs for seniors and others with Medicare at $2,000 per year—including for ovarian cancer medications, which can cost more than $10,000 per year.
Additionally, because early detection is essential to beating ovarian cancer, my Administration is working to ensure that every American can access life-saving cancer screenings. During my first year in office, we expanded coverage under the ACA, which requires insurers to pay for recommended cancer screenings and primary care visits. I encourage all women to discuss risk factors with their doctors and remain vigilant against symptoms. Experts recommend that patients with a personal or family history of breast or ovarian cancer—or whose ancestry is associated with harmful gene variants—discuss risk factors with their doctors to see if genetic counseling and testing is appropriate.
During National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month, let us resolve to doing all we can together to provide patients, survivors, and their families the treatments, care, and support they need and deserve. Let us rededicate ourselves to the urgent work of increasing awareness about ovarian cancer so that we can save more lives more quickly. And let us never lose hope or waver in our resolve to ending cancer as we know it—for all the lives lost and all those we can still save.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2024 as National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month. I call upon the people of the United States to speak with their doctors and health care providers to learn more about ovarian cancer. I encourage citizens, government agencies, private businesses, nonprofit organizations, the media, and other interested groups to increase awareness of what Americans can do to detect and treat ovarian cancer.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of August, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# National Preparedness Month, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
During National Preparedness Month, we honor our first responders for their bravery in helping us respond to natural disasters, and we recommit
to equipping Americans with the resources they need to overcome the climate crisis and bouts of extreme weather and emerge stronger, more resilient, and more secure.
Across the country, historic heat waves, flooding, and fires have tragically claimed the lives of too many Americans. These crises have impacted communities by keeping children out of schools, hurting small businesses, and destroying infrastructure—and they are only getting more ferocious and costly with climate change. Disasters affect people across our Nation, but the most vulnerable among us typically bear the greatest impacts—from housing insecurity to financial hardship.
My Administration has taken historic action to prepare and protect communities and make our Nation more resilient. Thanks to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act, we are investing more than $50 billion in climate resilience, ensuring communities can prepare for and recover from extreme weather events. For example, we are elevating roads and bridges over projected flood zones, and we are upgrading buildings to make them stronger and more energy efficient. We are also planting trees to protect neighborhoods from extreme heat.
Since taking office, Vice President Harris and I have traveled across the country and directed our team to meet people where they are when they need our help the most. To that end, we have made substantial changes to our Federal assistance policies, making it easier for disaster survivors to receive much-needed support and resources. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has expanded benefits for Americans applying for disaster relief and simplified the disaster assistance application process, reducing the burden on overwhelmed families and individuals. My Administration also secured $6.8 billion for FEMA under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to support communities suffering from disaster and avoid future disaster. In total, we have provided hundreds of billions of dollars in disaster relief funding to communities nationwide, including FEMA public and individual assistance, Small Business Administration disaster assistance loans, COVID Economic Injury Disaster Loans, and other supplemental funds.
There is still more work to do to improve the safety and security of our country, so my Administration has also taken steps to protect Americans' lives and livelihoods. No American should worry about how they will get the care they need if disaster strikes. That is why we have expanded the Affordable Care Act and lowered the cost of health care for Americans and working families. We have also created new jobs that strengthen our country and ensure that we have the resources we need—especially in times of crisis. To get prepared and learn more about how to keep your family and community ready, visit Ready.gov or Listo.gov for Spanish speakers.
During National Preparedness Month, we recommit to ensuring that our Nation is ready for any challenge that comes our way. We support efforts to keep Americans safe, and we encourage optimism and preparation for our shared future.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2024 as National Preparedness Month. I encourage all Americans to recognize the importance of preparedness and work together to enhance our resilience and readiness.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of August, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# National Prostate Cancer Awareness Month, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Too many Americans know the grief of losing a father, son, brother, or friend to prostate cancer. Nearly 300,000 American men get diagnosed with this terrible disease and over 35,000 people lose their lives to it, making prostate cancer the second leading cause of cancer death for men. This National Prostate Cancer Awareness Month, we mourn all the courageous men we have tragically lost too soon to prostate cancer. We honor the extraordinary resilience of those currently living with and surviving this disease. And we thank the families who tirelessly support their loved ones every step of the way.
Despite the enormous strides made over the last few decades in fighting and treating prostate cancer, challenges persist. Far too many men—approximately one in every eight—will be diagnosed in their lifetime. Furthermore, the disease disproportionately affects Black and Hispanic men. And too many patients and their families are left to decipher complex medical information alone, are saddled with the overwhelming cost of treatment, and are forced to advocate for effective medical care for their loved ones.
I came into office committed to putting our country's best minds and resources toward ending cancer as we know it. Toward that aim, I reignited the Cancer Moonshot with the goal of cutting the cancer death rate by at least 50 percent over 25 years. I secured $4 billion in bipartisan funding for the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health to pioneer new breakthroughs in preventing, detecting, and treating cancer and other life-threatening diseases. The Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs expanded research efforts to provide more service members and veterans facing prostate cancer with the opportunity to participate in clinical studies to learn about this disease and develop new treatment approaches. And the National Institutes of Health is funding groundbreaking research to better treat prostate cancer in the early stages and help people with prostate cancer live longer, healthier lives.
I believe that health care is a right, not a privilege. That is why my Administration is working to ensure that every American has free access to a doctor by expanding and strengthening coverage under the Affordable Care
Act, Medicaid, and Medicare. Now, millions of Americans have access to free cancer screenings and primary care visits, and millions of families are saving approximately $800 per year on their health insurance premiums. I also signed the Inflation Reduction Act, which will soon cap total out-of-pocket prescription drug costs for people on Medicare at $2,000 per year, which could save beneficiaries with prostate cancer thousands per year. Additionally, we are making cancer navigation resources, which guide families through the diagnosis and treatment process, more accessible—from transportation to the hospital to determining how to pay for the exorbitant health care costs. I am proud that, since I took office, millions of Americans have gained access to these critical services for the first time.
During National Prostate Cancer Awareness Month, we are reminded that early detection and screening are critical to beating prostate cancer. Experts recommend that men—especially those at high risk for cancer—discuss screening for prostate cancer with their doctors. This month and every month, let us come together and recommit to finally ending cancer as we know it—for all the lives we have tragically lost and the lives we can still save.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2024 as National Prostate Cancer Awareness Month. I encourage citizens, government agencies, private businesses, nonprofit organizations, and other interested groups to join in activities that will increase awareness of what Americans can do to prevent and cure prostate cancer.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of August, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

Proc. 10799

# National Recovery Month, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
This month, we recognize the more than 21 million Americans in recovery from substance use disorder. They exemplify courage, hope, and resilience as they seek new beginnings and help countless others find pathways to healing. People in recovery serve in every sector of society as business leaders, public servants, community leaders, and more. During National Recovery Month, we celebrate their contributions, and we honor the loved ones who have supported them on their recovery journeys. We also reaffirm our commitment to making sure every American has the resources they need to recover and thrive.
Substance use disorder impacts Americans in communities nationwide. Too many families have lost their children, siblings, parents, and friends to substance misuse and overdose. Every loss is a painful call to action.
With adequate support and resources, recovery is possible. Our Nation is stronger when people in recovery do well.
The main goal of my Administration's National Drug Control Strategy is to save lives. My Administration is taking steps to provide the resources needed to ensure people can achieve and sustain recovery, no matter where they are. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration opened the Office of Recovery to improve community-based recovery services across the country. And last year, we released the Recovery-Ready Workplace Toolkit to help employers create a safe and healthy work environment, reduce stigmatization of people with substance use disorder and mental illness, and promote treatment and recovery services.
We are also disrupting the flow of illicit drugs across our borders and into our neighborhoods; increasing prevention efforts; and expanding access to treatment for substance use disorder and mental health conditions, overdose reversal medications, and recovery services. Under my Administration, Federal law enforcement agents are keeping more deadly drugs out of our communities than ever before. Officials have stopped more illicit fentanyl at ports of entry over the last 2 fiscal years than in the previous 5 fiscal years combined. The Department of Justice has prosecuted thousands of drug traffickers, and the Department of the Treasury has sanctioned more than 300 people and organizations involved in the global illicit drug trade. And in July 2024, I issued a National Security Memorandum that calls on all relevant Federal departments and agencies to work collaboratively to do even more to disrupt the supply of illicit drugs.
We have expanded access to life-saving treatments, like medications to treat opioid use disorder, and have increased the number of health care providers who can prescribe these medications by 15 times. In February 2024, the Department of Health and Human Services issued a rule to comprehensively update the regulations in governing Opioid Treatment Programs for the first time in 20 years—removing barriers to the treatment of substance use disorder and expanding access to care. My Administration has made historic investments in the State Opioid Response and Tribal Opioid Response programs to improve prevention; expand treatment; and deliver free, life-saving medications across America. Already, this program has delivered nearly 10 million kits of opioid overdose reversal medications, such as naloxone.
And I have proposed a Budget that includes $1.8 billion for recovery, including over $200 million of Federal Substance Use Prevention, Treatment, and Recovery Services Block Grant program funding for recovery support services to help all Americans access health care, no matter where they are in their recovery process, as well as $22 billion to expand substance use treatment and help more Americans achieve and stay in recovery.
During National Recovery Month, we support everyone in their journey to and during recovery. We recommit to helping them live long, successful, and healthy lives, and we thank them for their contributions to our country. And we continue to ensure that those battling substance use disorder are supported.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2024 as National Recovery Month. I call upon all citizens, government agencies, private businesses, nonprofit organizations, and other groups to take action to promote recovery and improve the health of our Nation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of August, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

Proc. 10800

# National Sickle Cell Awareness Month, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Every person in this country deserves to live a healthy and fulfilling life, but nationwide, approximately 100,000 Americans have Sickle Cell Disease (SCD)—a painful genetic blood disorder that causes life-threatening complications such as strokes, infections, and organ damage. Those living with SCD often have to put the goals and plans of everyday life on hold because of the chronic pain and serious health difficulties associated with it. During National Sickle Cell Awareness Month, we recommit to finding a cure for SCD, supporting those who suffer from the disease, and addressing the health disparities that exist in communities across our Nation.
From dealing with the costs of expensive medical treatments and unplanned hospital trips to facing stigma and lacking access to health care providers with SCD expertise, many living with the disease face barriers to getting care, and there is no widely available cure. Though SCD impacts people of all backgrounds, it disproportionately affects Black and Hispanic Americans. Many children in the United States living with SCD are not receiving the treatments they need to prevent serious complications, and adults too often struggle with uncoordinated and fragmented care.
My Administration is working to deliver for people with SCD and their families—and that work begins with following the science to find new, improved treatments. Last year, the Food and Drug Administration approved the first gene therapies to treat those living with SCD and offer long-lasting results for SCD patients. They have also approved new drug therapies that can help people with SCD manage pain. And the National Institutes of Health is working to improve the quality of life for people with SCD. Those efforts include funding clinical trials for SCD pain management, identifying cost-effective drugs to treat SCD, and finding therapies that can lead to a full recovery.
At the same time, my Administration is working to make treatment for SCD more accessible and affordable to help close health disparities. We are empowering people with SCD on Medicare and Medicaid to have greater access to cell and gene therapy treatments. This will give hope to thousands of Americans with this rare and severe disease while improving health outcomes, increasing access to treatment, and lowering health care costs. The
Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) is also expanding access to quality care for those with SCD through community-based organizations, ensuring they are taken care of no matter if they are at home or in the hospital. HRSA also provides resources to families whose newborns were diagnosed with SCD from the moment they were screened and throughout their treatment. Additionally, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has expanded data collection efforts to better target resources to regions of the United States with the greatest need for SCD support. And the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology is improving data collection and coordination efforts to drive more effective research, increase integrated care, and improve health outcomes for individuals with SCD and their families.
During National Sickle Cell Awareness Month, we recommit to finding better treatments, developing a cure, and celebrating the courage and resilience of all those living with this terrible disease. We also find hope in the health care professionals, researchers, and scientists working tirelessly to find transformative treatments for SCD.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2024 as National Sickle Cell Awareness Month. I call upon the people of the United States to learn more about Sickle Cell Disease and the progress we are making to reduce the burden of this disease on our fellow Americans.

# National Wilderness Month, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
America's beautiful natural landscapes are part of our Nation's identity, history, and heritage. One century ago, the Gila Wilderness was established as our country's first designated wilderness area, protecting this national treasure and beginning a new era of Federal conservation. Across our Nation, designated wilderness areas protect some of our most precious sites—soaring mountains, winding rivers, expansive deserts, and lush forests. These special places unite us, inspire us, and connect us to something bigger than ourselves. During National Wilderness Month, we recommit to the essential work of protecting our Earth, celebrate our country's natural places, and continue our work to ensure that every community has access to nature's gifts.
By conserving our wilderness, we not only protect key pieces of our Nation's history—we also protect the livelihoods of people who depend on our lands and waters. We protect and preserve Tribal communities' sacred
landscapes. We sustain wildlife and conserve landscapes to help fight climate change and improve our Nation's resilience. And we ensure that generations of Americans will be able to enjoy the beauty and power of our country's wilderness today and into the future.
That is why my Administration set the most ambitious conservation goal ever—committing to conserve at least 30 percent of all our Nation's lands and waters by 2030. That goal is at the heart of my “America the Beautiful” initiative to support locally led, voluntary conservation and restoration efforts across the country. To that end, my Administration has made historic investments to protect our shared natural heritage, such as investing $1.4 billion in ecosystem restoration and resilience through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.
To date, my Administration has conserved more than 41 million acres of our Nation's lands and waters. I restored protections for the desert buttes of both the Bears Ears National Monument and the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in Utah and the underwater canyons of Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument. I established six new national monuments, including the Baaj Nwaavjo I'tah Kukveni in Arizona and the Avi Kwa Ame National Monument in Nevada. And I expanded the San Gabriel Mountains National Monument and the Berryessa Snow Mountain National Monument in California.
Further, I withdrew the United States Arctic Ocean from new oil and gas leasing. And I took executive action to consider designating more than 700,000 square miles of the Pacific Ocean southwest of Hawaii as a new National Marine Sanctuary, which could make this one of the largest marine protected areas on the planet.
My Administration is taking action to harness our natural resources in the fight against climate change; protect our forests; and improve the health of our Nation's lands, waters, and wildlife. Together, we can continue to advance locally led and locally supported proposals for conserving our most unique and beautiful lands and waters. And we can continue our partnership with Tribal Nations, working together as co-stewards and ensuring that Indigenous Knowledge is respectfully included in the care of our natural heritage.
During National Wilderness Month, may we celebrate the people who steward and care for our Nation's designated wilderness areas. And may we continue to protect and conserve these areas so that generations of Americans will know their beauty, serenity, and power.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2024 as National Wilderness Month. I encourage all Americans to experience our Nation's outdoor heritage, to recreate responsibly and leave no trace, to celebrate the value of preserving an enduring wilderness, and to strengthen our commitment to protecting these vital lands and waters now and for future generations.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of August, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

Proc. 10802

# Labor Day, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Every year on Labor Day, we celebrate the dignity of America's workers and the labor unions they have built. I often say that Wall Street did not build America—the middle class built America, and unions built the middle class. Labor unions have done so much for our Nation—giving workers a voice at the workplace, raising standards on the job, and fighting for better benefits and wages for us all. Today, we honor the pioneers who fought for the rights of working people, pay tribute to the dedication of our American workforce, and honor the enduring movement that powers our economy and strengthens our Nation.
My father taught me from a young age that a job is about far more than just a paycheck—it is about your dignity. When I came into office, too many people had lost both their paychecks and their sense of dignity. Our economy was failing working-class and union families. Decades of trickle-down economics sent jobs overseas, shut down factories, and hollowed out our communities. People had lost their sense of pride, their security, and their pathway to the middle class.
That is why I promised to be the most pro-labor, pro-union President in history and ensure unions have the support they need to fight for our workers. Last year, the Department of the Treasury released a comprehensive report detailing how unions are not just good for union workers but non-union workers as well, showing that union growth helps to build a strong middle class in America. I am proud to be the first sitting President to walk the picket line to support workers who were striking for better conditions. I am also proud that, to date, we have created nearly 16 million new jobs, including almost 800,000 manufacturing jobs and nearly 900,000 construction jobs. In fact, investment in construction of new factories has nearly tripled since I took office. My Administration announced more than 60,000 projects to rebuild America's roads, bridges, airports, ports, and more through our Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Wages are up, inflation is down, and we have had the fastest recovery of any advanced economy in the world since the pandemic started.
Furthermore, we are positioning American workers to lead the world in innovation. I signed the Inflation Reduction Act, the largest investment in clean energy and climate action in history, creating nearly 335,000 clean energy jobs according to outside estimates. I also signed the CHIPS and Science Act to bring semiconductor manufacturing back home and ensure that America's clean energy jobs go to American workers. To date, we have attracted nearly $900 billion in private-sector commitments to invest in
manufacturing and clean energy. I am proud that this manufacturing boom we ignited is being done with American products and led by American workers—the most highly skilled workers in the world—because of “Made in America” provisions that I championed and my Administration enforced.
Today, more Americans are joining the workforce, and we have the highest share of working-age Americans in the workforce in over 20 years. And over the past 2 years, more workers have been petitioning for union representation. To ensure those workers have a voice on the job, I have required the use of project labor agreements for nearly all large-scale Federal construction projects. I have also strengthened Davis-Bacon requirements to guarantee that prevailing wages pay workers what they deserve and enacted the Butch Lewis Act—the most significant law for union retirement security in 50 years—that has protected the pensions of 1 million union workers. We issued a rule that expands overtime protections to millions of workers, and my Administration is working to crack down on noncompete agreements, which prevent 30 million Americans from taking new, higher-paying jobs.
My Administration is also making sure that workers feel safe and secure on the job. That is why the Department of Labor is proposing a new rule that will establish the Nation's first-ever Federal safety standard for excessive heat in the workplace. That rule includes developing a response to heat illness, training employees and supervisors, implementing rest breaks, and ensuring access to shade and water. And we are limiting workers' exposure to toxic materials like silica dust to prevent them from developing preventable and irreversible illnesses. My Administration also issued a rule to ensure that workers are empowered to have a representative accompany an Occupational Safety and Health Administration official during workplace inspections.
I have long believed that workers deserve a seat at the table and an opportunity to join a union, organize, and bargain collectively with their employer without coercion or intimidation. That is why I appointed people who actually care about American workers to the National Labor Relations Board. And I established the White House Task Force on Worker Organizing and Empowerment, led by Vice President Harris, which resulted in over 70 actions to promote worker organizing and collective bargaining.
As we look to the future, my Administration is creating long-term pathways to help people secure good-paying jobs, including union jobs. We invested nearly $730 million to expand Registered Apprenticeships, which support the education and training needs of apprentices across the country. And I signed an Executive Order that expands Registered Apprenticeship programs in the Federal workforce, encourages Federal agencies to hire people who have participated in these programs, and increases workers' voices in Federal programs and contracts.
This Labor Day, let us stand in solidarity with America's workers, who are the engines behind our Nation's prosperity. Let us celebrate labor unions, who give voice to our workers and ensure they are given the dignity, respect, and protections in the workplace that they deserve. And let us recommit to ensuring that every hardworking American has a fair shot at achieving the promise of the American Dream for generations to come.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2, 2024, as Labor Day. I call upon all public officials and people of the United States to observe this day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities that honor the energy and innovation of working Americans.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of August, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# National Days of Prayer and Remembrance, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Twenty-three years ago—on September 11, 2001—2,977 precious lives were ripped from us in an evil attack on our Nation. During these solemn days, we renew our sacred vow: Never Forget. Never forget the loved ones we lost. Never forget the first responders who ran toward the rubble to save others. Never forget the hundreds of thousands of patriots who signed up to serve in the years after. And never forget that, when an enemy tried to tear us apart, our country came together. We stood united.
While every year we mark this hallowed day, it is never easier. To all those who are grieving a lost child, parent, spouse, sibling, friend, or coworker—and to all those who still bear the wounds from that September morning—I know how hard this time can be. It can reopen that black hole in your chest, bringing you back to the moment you saw the news or the moment you got the phone call. Today and every day, the First Lady and I are holding you close to our hearts.
We are also thinking of all the families of Americans who showed extraordinary bravery, selflessness, and sacrifice that day. They are the firefighters, police officers, and first responders who ran into the inferno of jet fuel and debris at Ground Zero and refused to stop searching for months. They are the civilians and service members at the Pentagon who rushed into the fiery breach to rescue their colleagues. They are the passengers of Flight 93, who confronted terror with absolute courage. They are the heroes who signed up to serve and defend our homeland from future attacks. And they include every American—from communities across our country—who stepped up and stood together.
Today—as we remember all those we lost on that searing September day 23 years ago—let us renew our faith in one another. Let us continue to seek light, even in the darkest of hours. And drawing from their example, let us resolve to continue building a Nation that stands as a beacon of liberty and justice for all. That is the truest memorial to their lives—our actions, every day, to ensure that our democracy endures, that our freedom endures, and that the very soul of our Nation endures.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 6, 2024, through September 8, 2024, as National Days of Prayer and Remembrance. I ask that the people of the United States honor the victims of September 11, 2001, and their loved ones with prayer, contemplation, memorial services and visits, bells, candlelight vigils, and other activities. I invite people around the world to join. I call on the citizens of our Nation to give thanks for our many freedoms and blessings, and I invite all people of faith to join me in asking for God's continued guidance, mercy, and protection.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifth day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# National Hispanic-Serving Institutions Week, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Education is a ticket to a better life, and for more than 4.7 million Hispanic and Latino students, Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) make it possible. The over 500 HSIs across our country are home to over half of Hispanic and Latino college students. During National Hispanic-Serving Institutions Week, we celebrate these critical postsecondary institutions, which empower our students to pursue the full limits of their talent and ambition.
HSIs are engines of opportunity, success, and upward mobility. They serve Dreamers, first-generation college students, and many who come from low-income and underserved communities. HSIs empower their students, no matter the students' backgrounds, to obtain their degrees and begin building a more secure, prosperous future for themselves and their families.
My Administration is committed to giving HSIs the resources they need to support the students they serve. That is why we invested over $15 billion in HSIs, including $11 billion through the American Rescue Plan—the largest investment in Hispanic and Latino college students in our Nation's history. I also established the first-ever White House Initiative on Advancing Educational Equity, Excellence, and Economic Opportunity through Hispanic-Serving Institutions, which will support HSIs in building their capacity to provide a high-quality education, identify opportunities for these institutions to participate in Federal programs, and help to ensure HSIs can continue to be engines of educational opportunity and economic mobility.
We are also working to make college more affordable for every American and to relieve the crushing burden of student loan debt. We have approved the cancellation of nearly $170 billion in student loan debt for nearly 5 million people through various actions. We repaired the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program (PSLF), giving more breathing room to teachers, nurses, law enforcement officials, first responders, and other public servants. My Administration has already provided relief to 946,000 borrowers
through PSLF—before I took office, only 7,000 public servants had received debt relief through this program. We secured a $900 increase to the maximum Pell Grant award—the largest increase in over a decade—lowering the cost of higher education for underserved students. We are also taking steps to help borrowers manage their payments through income-driven repayment and get access to benefits through fixes to public service loan forgiveness, borrower defense, and other key types of discharges. And earlier this year, I laid out my Administration's new plans that would provide debt relief for more than 30 million Americans when combined with everything we have done so far.
The promise of America is big enough for everyone to succeed—we just have to make sure we keep the doors of opportunity open. This week, may we celebrate the more than 500 HSIs, which support our Latino students, put new possibilities within their reach, and give them a fair shot at the American Dream.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 9 through September 15, 2024, as National Hispanic-Serving Institutions Week. I call on public officials, educators, and all the people of the United States to observe this week with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities that acknowledge the many ways these institutions and their graduates contribute to our country.

For so many Americans, grandparents are the first people they look to for comfort, love, and guidance. Grandparents carry family wisdom, share their stories, and are the core of their families. On National Grandparents Day, we give thanks to grandparents and recognize their continuing contributions to our Nation.
Throughout my life, I have carried the values my grandparents instilled in me—but, above all, I have carried in my heart their memories and unconditional love. Like grandparents across the country, they taught me to be resilient no matter what life may hand you, to take care of everyone, and to leave no one behind. Now that the First Lady and I are grandparents, we work to do the same. Our grandchildren are blessings—they are the love of our lives and the life of our love.
Across the country, grandparents are not only providing their guidance, but they are also stepping up when their families need them most, especially to care for grandchildren. They help out with everyday tasks for their grandkids—whether it is driving them to school, packing lunches, or babysitting. Over 2.7 million grandparents are primary caregivers, creating a stable and warm home so that their grandkids can thrive. And with hearts that always have more to give, they offer advice and keep family traditions alive.
Just as our grandparents have always taken care of us, my Administration is working to take care of them. That work begins by ensuring they have access to the health care they need. I signed the Inflation Reduction Act to lower costs of medications by giving Medicare the power to negotiate lower prescription drug prices. The Inflation Reduction Act also capped the cost of insulin for people on Medicare at $35 per month, lowering it from as much as $400 per month. In line with our efforts to control costs, beginning in 2025, out-of-pocket prescription drug costs for seniors and people with disabilities on Medicare will be capped at $2,000 per year.
At the same time, my Administration is supporting the grandparents doing the critical work of caring for their grandchildren. At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, my American Rescue Plan delivered $145 million to fund counseling, training, and relief for grandparents and others acting as caregivers. Further, my Administration's National Strategy to Support Family Caregivers includes the unique role of grandparents who are raising grandchildren. To that end, we finalized a rule that ensures kinship foster parents, including grandparents, receive the same resources to care for their grandkids as other foster homes while giving their grandkids a home they know and love. We are also taking action across the Federal Government to support the health, well-being, and financial security of family caregivers and providing more care options for families supporting people with disabilities.
For grandparents who are looking to share their experience and wisdom, the AmeriCorps Seniors Foster Grandparent Program provides opportunities for seniors to mentor young people in their neighborhoods.
On National Grandparents Day, we celebrate the contributions of grandparents across the country, whose love is the glue of so many families. Today, may we reflect on our greatest memories with our grandparents and express our gratitude for the lasting impact they have made on each one of us and the very soul of our Nation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 8, 2024, as National Grandparents Day. I call upon all Americans to celebrate the important role that grandparents play in the lives of their families and the children and grandchildren they love.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixth day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# World Suicide Prevention Day, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
On World Suicide Prevention Day, we honor the memories of all those lost to suicide, hold the loved ones grieving their memories close to our hearts, and recognize the many professionals working to end this public health problem.
Too many Americans have lost their lives to suicide. Last year, nearly 50,000 Americans died by suicide, and in 2022, over 10 million seriously considered suicide. In 2022, suicide was the second leading cause of death for young people aged 10 to 14 and 25 to 34, and the suicide rate for veterans was 50 percent higher than for anyone else. Suicide is also a leading cause of maternal death. Though there is no single cause or solution for suicide, we know that access to treatment and support can save lives. However, getting care in a crisis can be hard to access or afford. In 2021, less than half of all adults with mental illness received the care they needed. And nearly 70 percent of children who seek mental health care cannot find it.
A key part of my Unity Agenda is to connect more Americans to affordable, quality mental health care and strengthen our mental health care system—which will help address many of the risk factors associated with suicide. My Administration issued a rule that requires insurers to cover mental health care just as they do physical health care, and to make changes if required analyses show that health insurers are providing insufficient access to mental health care—an important step in ensuring people can get the mental health care they need. My American Rescue Plan provided over $12 billion to expand mental health and substance use services through States, communities, and schools. And when we passed the most significant gun safety law in nearly 30 years, we expanded the number of Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics paid for under Medicaid, which deliver mental health treatment, including crisis care 24 hours a day to communities across the country. That law also delivered funding to put more psychologists and counselors in schools, and my Administration has made it easier for schools to use Medicaid to deliver mental health services—helping ease the youth mental health crisis and ensuring that our children can go on to live long, healthy lives. Further, I signed into law expansions to counseling, benefits, and mental health resources for law enforcement and first responders who have faced trauma at work. Earlier this year, my Administration released a new National Strategy for Suicide Prevention and Federal Action Plan which includes over 200 actions that will strengthen suicide prevention programs across the Nation, including those designed to reach our most vulnerable.
I have always said that we have a sacred obligation to care for our Nation's veterans and their families—and that means making sure they have access to the care they need to thrive. To help keep that promise, my Administration invested in mental health and suicide prevention efforts for our service members and veterans. We have expanded access to confidential treatment and are working to hire more mental health professionals, removing cost-
sharing for the first three mental health visits, and investing in hiring more veterans to help their peers get the mental health care they need. And we are working to ensure that every veteran has a roof over their head—including by increasing access to permanent supportive housing for veterans and their families.
If you or a loved one are struggling, please know that you are not alone. My Administration launched 988, the National Suicide and Crisis Lifeline to quickly connect people with the support they need. Call or text 988 to reach a trained crisis counselor for free, confidential support right away. We also established the National Maternal Mental Health Hotline for new and expectant mothers. Call 1-833-TLC-MAMA (1-833-852-6262) for help navigating mental health issues like postpartum depression and anxiety before, during, or after pregnancy. For non-crisis support or to find help for mental health and substance use, visit FindSupport.gov or call 1-800-662-HELP (1-800-662-4357).
During World Suicide Prevention Day, we recommit to improving suicide prevention programs and putting affordable, accessible mental health care within reach of communities across our Nation—for all the lives we have lost and all those we can still save.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 10, 2024, as World Suicide Prevention Day. I call upon all Americans, communities, organizations, and levels of government to join me in creating hope through action and committing to preventing suicide across America.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# Patriot Day and National Day of Service and Remembrance, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Today, we honor the brave Americans who met the terror of September 11 with extraordinary acts of courage and sacrifice. In our darkest hour—when terrorists believed they could bring our country to its knees—those Americans proved that our Nation's unbreakable spirit would prevail.
In the moments, days, and years after the attacks on September 11, heroes were forged. Firefighters, police officers, and first responders ran into the inferno of jet fuel and debris at Ground Zero, risking their own lives to save the lives of others. Service members and civilians rushed into the fiery breach at the Pentagon again and again to rescue their colleagues. The patriotic passengers of Flight 93 made the ultimate sacrifice to prevent their
plane from being used to take more innocent souls. And in big cities, rural towns, suburbs, and Tribal communities, hundreds of thousands of American hands went up—ready to serve our Nation in uniform.
We owe these patriots of the 9/11 Generation a debt of gratitude that we can never fully repay. They were deployed to Afghanistan to make sure the United States would not be attacked again. They served in Iraq and other war zones to defend our democracy and deny terrorists safe haven. They followed Osama bin Laden to the ends of the Earth and ultimately sent him to the gates of hell. And 2 years ago, we made sure his deputy met the same fate.
The First Lady and I hold all those whose loved ones gave their last full measure of devotion in this fight close in our hearts. And we will never stop working to fulfill our country's sacred obligation to them and every military and veteran family, caregiver, and survivor: to properly prepare and equip those we send into harm's way and to care for them and their families when they return home—and when they do not.
Over the last 23 years, what was destroyed, we have repaired. What was threatened, we have fortified. What was attacked—the indomitable American spirit—prevailed. That is who we are. That is the soul of our Nation. There is nothing we cannot accomplish when we defend with all our hearts that which makes us unique in the world: our democracy. That is what the heroes and patriots of 9/11 did. And that is what we must all continue to do today.
To observe this day with service, find opportunities to volunteer in your community at americorps.gov/911-day.
By a joint resolution approved December 18, 2001 (Public Law 107-89), the Congress has designated September 11 of each year as “Patriot Day,” and by Public Law 111-13, approved April 21, 2009, the Congress has requested the observance of September 11 as an annually recognized “National Day of Service and Remembrance.”
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim September 11, 2024, as Patriot Day and National Day of Service and Remembrance. I call upon all departments, agencies, and instrumentalities of the United States to display the flag of the United States at half-staff on Patriot Day and National Day of Service and Remembrance in honor of the individuals who lost their lives on September 11, 2001. I invite the Governors of the United States and its Territories and interested organizations and individuals to join in this observance. I call upon the people of the United States to participate in community service in honor of those our Nation lost, to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities, including remembrance services, and to observe a moment of silence beginning at 8:46 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time to honor the innocent victims who perished as a result of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this tenth day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

Proc. 10808

# 30th Anniversary of the Violence Against Women ActBy the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Tomorrow, we celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), which has transformed our Nation's response to sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking while also providing communities with the tools necessary to support survivors and save lives. I was proud to write VAWA and champion it three decades ago, and I am even prouder to honor its lasting legacy today.
Before VAWA, our country did not talk about violence against women as a national epidemic or an issue the Government had to address. As a society, we often overlooked domestic violence—calling it a family matter, not a crime. Too few police officers were trained on how to properly respond to domestic violence, and there were not enough places for survivors to go for the help they needed or the justice they deserved. There was no national hotline, and many survivors' stories went untold.
That is why, as a United States Senator, I worked closely with brave and committed survivors and advocates to write VAWA—and with the incredible efforts of activists and women's rights leaders, we got it passed. Courageous survivors spoke out about the abuse they had endured, bringing this hidden epidemic out of the shadows and changing the way America saw this issue. VAWA was a game changer. We began to increase justice for survivors and accountability for perpetrators. And we finally acknowledged ending gender-based violence as a shared priority for the Nation and turned to developing the coordinated response that survivors need and deserve.
Beginning in 1994, VAWA has delivered critical resources and support to help survivors of gender-based violence. Shelters, rape crisis centers, housing, and legal assistance were made available, and funding was provided to train law enforcement, prosecutors, advocates, and judges to improve our justice system's response to survivors. We also created the first-ever National Domestic Violence Hotline, which has provided millions of people with lifesaving, confidential support and this year answered its seven millionth call.
I have worked across the aisle to reauthorize VAWA four times since its initial signing, each time making this critical law even stronger. We strengthened protections against stalking, dating violence, trafficking, and sexual assault, expanded access to justice for Tribal communities, and improved services for immigrant, older adult, and LGBTQI+ survivors, among other underserved communities. As President, I signed the most recent reauthorization of VAWA in 2022, and secured the highest-ever funding level for VAWA implementation. We provided support for survivors and invested in prevention efforts and educational programs so that we can put a stop to violence and abuse before it occurs. And we established a new Federal civil cause of action for individuals whose intimate visual images are disclosed without their consent.
My Administration has prioritized putting an end to gender-based violence even beyond VAWA. I signed the most significant gun safety law in nearly
three decades, which narrowed the “boyfriend loophole” to help keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers. And I established the first-ever White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention. We put in place new protections to support survivors and address sexual assault and sexual harassment in the workplace and released the first-ever National Plan to End Gender-Based Violence, an all-of-government approach to preventing and addressing all forms of gender-based violence. And through the American Rescue Plan, we have invested $1 billion in supplemental funding for rape crisis centers, community support organizations, and other services for gender-based violence survivors.
We have led historic, bipartisan military justice reforms to ensure that prosecutorial decisions in cases of gender-based violence are fully independent from the chain of command and better protect survivors in our military. My Administration has restored and strengthened vital protections under Title IX to help keep students and employees safe from sexual assault and harassment on campus. And Vice President Kamala Harris and I launched a Federal task force that has taken concrete steps toward prevention, accountability for perpetrators, research, and support for survivors of online harassment and abuse, including launching the first 24/7 national helpline for survivors of image-based abuse.
When I presented VAWA to the Senate all those years ago, I envisioned a world where every woman could live free from fear, free from violence, and free from abuse. We have made tremendous strides toward achieving this vision, but there is still much more to do. On this milestone anniversary, let us recommit to creating a society that is truly safe and where we all agree that even one case of gender-based violence is too many. And let us honor the survivors and advocates, whose powerful voices and tireless dedication have changed our world for the better.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 13, 2024, as the 30th anniversary of the Violence Against Women Act. I call upon each of us to change the culture of violence against women and provide meaningful support to all survivors. Together, we can transform the country and build a Nation where all people live free of violence and abuse.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twelfth day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# National Hispanic Heritage Month, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
During National Hispanic Heritage Month, we honor and celebrate the culture, history, and contributions of the Latino community.
In our country, Latino leaders are striving for the American Dream and helping those around them reach it too. From those who have been here for generations to those who have recently arrived, Latinos have pushed our great American experiment forward. They are the community, faith, and union leaders who advocate and stand up for all of us. They are the first responders, who put themselves in harm's way to keep the rest of us safe. And they represent the best of who we are as a Nation—the teachers and doctors, athletes and artists, business leaders, public servants, and so much more. They embody the possibilities of our Nation and the dreams of those who work every day to build a better future for their children, grandchildren, and beyond. I am proud to work with incredible Latino leaders, who are dedicated to bettering our Nation every day—like Secretary of Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra, Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas, Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona, Administrator of the Small Business Administration Isabel Guzman, Director of the White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs Tom Perez, and White House Director of Political Strategy and Outreach Emmy Ruiz.
My Administration is committed to putting the American Dream within reach of every person, and it is working. We have created nearly 16 million jobs since we took office and have seen record-low unemployment among Latinos, and Latino entrepreneurs have started new businesses at the fastest rate in over 25 years. We have more than doubled Small Business Administration loans to Latino-owned businesses. We have invested a record more than $15 billion in Hispanic-serving colleges and universities, and we approved the cancellation of student debt—a burden that disproportionately falls on Latino borrowers—for almost five million people through various actions. We also cracked down on bias in the home appraisal process so homes owned by Latinos and those in majority Latino neighborhoods can be valued fairly. And we are making health care a right, not a privilege—doubling Latino enrollment in coverage under the Affordable Care Act and giving Medicare the power to negotiate lower prescription drug prices, while capping insulin at $35 per month for people on Medicare, including for the five million Latinos on Medicare. And across the Federal Government, we are implementing my Administration's National HIV/AIDS Strategy, prioritizing the expansion of HIV services to reach all Americans—especially Latino gay men, who now represent the highest incidence of new HIV cases in the country.
At the same time, I am working to build an immigration system that is fair, orderly, and humane. On my first day in office, I sent a comprehensive immigration reform bill to the Congress. It includes more resources for a strong border and expands permanent visas for families and employers. It also includes a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, whose contributions have made this country better and stronger. While the Congress has failed to take up this legislation, my Administration is taking action to protect and support Dreamers and others. We issued a rule that will, for the first time, finally provide Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients with access to health insurance through the Affordable Care Act. Additionally, we proposed a rule that would give Dreamers, among others from underserved backgrounds, the support and resources they need to successfully transition from high school to college—providing access to everything from college campus visits to tutoring and help with financial aid applications. And I am proud that my Administration has reunited nearly 800
families that were shamefully separated at the border under the prior administration. My Administration also implemented a process to help the noncitizen spouses of United States citizens who have been here for 10 years or more, along with their children, to apply for lawful permanent residence without leaving the country. And we have taken steps to help young people who have been educated in the United States, including DACA recipients and other Dreamers, receive work visas more quickly.
In the Oval Office, I keep a bust of Cesar Chavez, one of my heroes, who once said: “Our ambitions must be broad enough to include the aspirations and needs of others, for their sakes and for our own.” Together, I know that we will continue to build a future that generations of Latinos can be proud of—one founded on honesty, respect, and faith and where everyone has an opportunity to pursue their talents and ambitions.
In recognition of the achievements of the Hispanic and Latino community, the Congress, by Public Law 100-402, as amended, has authorized and requested the President to issue annually a proclamation designating September 15 through October 15 as “National Hispanic Heritage Month.”
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 15 through October 15, 2024, as National Hispanic Heritage Month. I call upon all Americans to observe this month with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs that celebrate Hispanic heritage and recognize the impact Hispanic peoples have had on our Nation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirteenth day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# National Farm Safety and Health Week, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
America's farmers, farmworkers, and ranchers work around the clock to nourish our Nation and power our economy, allowing us to feed our communities and compete in markets worldwide. They also steward lands and provide meaningful jobs in our rural and Tribal communities. During National Farm Safety and Health Week, we recognize the incredible contributions of everyone working on farms, and we recommit to improving their safety and well-being.
Our Nation's farms are a source of prosperity, but working on them can be exhausting and hazardous. The agriculture sector is one of America's most dangerous industries. Climate change and intensifying extreme heat puts the lives of agricultural workers at risk and decrease productivity and profits. Uncertainty in the industry heightens stress and takes a toll on our
farmworkers' mental health. And unfortunately, many rural communities lack accessible health care, as nearly 200 rural hospitals have closed in the past 20 years.
I believe health care should be a right, not a privilege. To that end, my Administration is investing in rural health care services, training the next generation of rural health care providers, and expanding mental health resources in rural communities. We established the Rural Emergency Hospital Designation to make it easier for struggling hospitals to stay open and help ensure that rural communities have access to emergency services. With $500 million from my American Rescue Plan and $65 billion from my Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we are making it easier for people in rural areas to access health care, including telehealth services and affordable mental health care. We launched 988—the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline—so that anyone dealing with a crisis can connect to trained counselors by phone, text, or chat. We also finalized a rule that strengthens mental health parity by requiring health insurers to cover mental health care just as they do physical health care. And we added more than 140 Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics across the Nation, which provide mental health and crisis services to anyone in need, regardless of their ability to pay.
I have maintained my commitment to be the most pro-labor and pro-worker President in history by making sure our workers are safe and secure. Under my leadership and the leadership of Vice President Kamala Harris, the Department of Labor proposed the Nation's first-ever Federal safety standard for excessive heat in the workplace, which would require employers to implement rest breaks, provide access to shade and water, and develop a plan to respond to heat illness. The Department of Labor also finalized a Farmworker Protection Rule to strengthen protections for temporary agricultural workers to ensure all farmworkers in the United States are treated fairly and have safe work environments.
My Administration is providing farms with the resources they need to grow and thrive. Through the Farm Labor Stabilization and Protection Pilot Program, the Department of Agriculture awarded $50 million from my American Rescue Plan to agricultural employers, many of which were small and mid-sized farms, helping ensure they can hire and retain the workers they need to be competitive while improving labor standards for workers. We are working to extend crop insurance coverage to give financial security to farmers who practice double cropping. We have made $900 million available to boost fertilizer production for farms, and I signed an Executive Order to increase competition and make sure that family farms are on a level playing field with corporate farms.
During National Farm Safety and Health Week, we honor farmers, farmworkers, and ranchers for putting food on our tables, powering our economy, and supporting our communities. And we recommit to ensuring they have the resources they need to continue this work and live full, healthy lives.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 15 through September 21, 2024, as National Farm Safety and Health Week. I call upon the people of the United States—including America's farmers; ranchers;
and agriculture-related institutions, organizations, and businesses—to reaffirm a dedication to farm safety and health. I also urge all Americans to express appreciation and gratitude to our farmers, farmworkers, and ranchers for their tireless service to our Nation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirteenth day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# National Historically Black Colleges and Universities Week, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
For more than 180 years, Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) have delivered a quality education to Black students across our Nation. Over 100 HBCUs serve as engines of economic opportunity and make America more prosperous and equitable. Although they make up less than 3 percent of all postsecondary institutions in the United States, HBCUs account for 8 percent of Black undergraduate enrollment and 13 percent of all bachelor's degrees earned by Black students. During National Historically Black Colleges and Universities Week, we celebrate the incredible legacy of these institutions, we honor the quality education, economic mobility, and opportunity they bring to so many students—particularly students from low-income backgrounds and those who are the first in their families to go to college—and we recommit to supporting and investing in their success.
HBCUs are centers of academic excellence, shaping the dreamers and doers who push our Nation forward. Within my Administration, I have seen firsthand just how an HBCU education shapes leaders and alumni—including Vice President Kamala Harris and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, Michael Regan. Eighty percent of our Nation's Black judges, 50 percent of all Black lawyers, and nearly 40 percent of Congressional Black Caucus members went to an HCBU. HBCUs produce 40 percent of all Black engineers and 70 percent of Black doctors. Some of our Nation's greatest visionaries, scholars, artists, athletes, and leaders of every sector have credited their success to their time at an HBCU. And HBCUs educate twice as many Pell Grant-eligible students as other institutions.
I have always supported our Nation's HBCUs, which tap into the full talent and diversity of our country. HBCUs are incredible institutions, but they unfairly face historic funding gaps and do not have the same endowments as other universities. My Administration has delivered record investments in HBCUs—totaling more than $16 billion. That funding has helped support students, student-veterans, and staff; improve campus infrastructure;
expand Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) research programs; and so much more. My Administration also secured first-time funding for the Augustus F. Hawkins Centers of Excellence Grant Program, providing more than $23 million in grants to HBCUs and Minority Serving Institutions to prepare our next generation of teachers and increase the diversity of the profession.
Additionally, I re-established the White House Initiative on Advancing Educational Equity, Excellence, and Economic Opportunity through HBCUs to ensure they have greater access to Federal funding opportunities. Furthermore, as Americans, we have to ensure that hate and hate-fueled violence are given no safe harbor in this country. When more than one-third of our country's HBCUs were targeted by dozens of bomb threats in 2022, my Administration worked to quickly expand the accessibility of a broad spectrum of Federal security services, resources, and expertise to support them. We also deployed over $2.4 million in Project School Emergency Response to Violence grants that have helped restore safe learning environments and investments in mental health and well-being for students. I strongly condemn any threats made by domestic extremists on HBCUs, and I will continue to do everything I can to protect all Americans from the threat of violence.
My Administration is also working to make sure college is more affordable for every American. We secured a $900 increase to the maximum Pell Grant award—the largest increase in over a decade—putting funding directly in students' hands. And we are working on relieving the crushing burden of student loan debt. To date, nearly 5 million Americans have received student loan debt relief, totaling almost $170 billion through various actions taken by my Administration. We also fixed the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program (PSLF) so that public servants get the relief they are entitled to under the law. My Administration has already provided relief to 947,000 borrowers through PSLF. Before I took office, only 7,000 public servants had received debt relief through this program. And earlier this year, I announced new plans that would provide debt relief for more than 30 million Americans when combined with everything my Administration has done so far.
This year, as I delivered the commencement address at Morehouse College, I felt honored to stand alongside these incredible students, whose legacies will surely lift our Nation up. These students, like so many others before them, launched their boundless futures at an HBCU. During National Historically Black Colleges and Universities Week, may we celebrate these critical institutions for all the doors of opportunity they open. May we honor their dedication to seeing their students thrive. And may we recommit to supporting HBCUs, which continue to prove that the American Dream is big enough for everyone to succeed.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 15 through September 21, 2024, as National Historically Black Colleges and Universities Week. I call upon educators, students, public officials, professional organizations, corporations, and all Americans to observe this week with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities that acknowledge the
countless contributions these institutions and their alumni have made to our country.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirteenth day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# Constitution Day and Citizenship Day, and Constitution Week, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
It has been said that, when he was leaving the Constitutional Convention, Benjamin Franklin was asked whether the Founding Fathers had given America a monarchy or a republic, and he replied: “A republic, if you can keep it.” The Founders put the power to decide our Nation's future in the hands of “We the People.” On Constitution Day and Citizenship Day, and during Constitution Week, we recommit to preserving our republic, perfecting our Union, and ensuring our democracy survives and thrives.
Our Constitution established that our Nation would be a democracy, meaning the rule of the people—not of monarchs, the monied, or the mighty. It gave us the separation of powers and checks and balances so that we would be a country that respects the institutions that govern a free society. And it remains the bulwark to prevent the abuse of power and ensures that “We the People” move forward together under the law. We are all responsible for maintaining our democracy—not only by adhering to the Constitution but also by our character and the habits of our hearts and minds. All of us must join the march to perfect our Union by protecting and expanding our rights with each successive generation.
I believe America is at an inflection point, one of those rare moments in history when the decisions we make now will determine the fate of our Nation and the world for decades to come. That is why we must continue to protect the rights guaranteed by our Constitution and the values that make our Nation who we are. We must protect the right to vote—it is the threshold of democracy: with it, anything is possible, and without it, nothing is. Vice President Harris and I continue to call on the Congress to pass the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act to expand voting rights and prevent voter suppression. We will continue to work to protect women's reproductive freedoms and their constitutional right to choose. We continue to call on the Congress to restore the protections of
Roe
v.
Wade
in Federal law once and for all. And we will continue to preserve and strengthen our democracy and will never walk away from the values that have made us the greatest Nation in the history of the world: freedom and liberty.
Today, we also celebrate the rights and responsibilities of citizenship. From those who were born in this country to our naturalized citizens, America remains a great country because we are a good people. We are a Nation of promise and possibilities, of dreamers and doers, and of ordinary Americans doing extraordinary things. May we welcome our Nation's newest citizens, whose stories embody the hope of the American Dream and whose contributions strengthen our country.
On Constitution Day and Citizenship Day, and during Constitution Week, we recognize that the power to build a freer, more prosperous, and more just future lies in the hands of the American people. And we recommit to fulfilling the sacred tasks of our time—to ensure democracy prevails and to preserve our constitutional protections for generations to come.
To honor the timeless principles enshrined in our Constitution, the Congress has, by joint resolution of February 29, 1952 (36 U.S.C. 106), designated September 17 as “Constitution Day and Citizenship Day” and authorized the President to issue a proclamation calling on United States officials to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on that day. By joint resolution of August 2, 1956 (36 U.S.C. 108), the Congress further requested that the President proclaim the week beginning September 17 and ending September 23 of each year as “Constitution Week.”
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 17, 2024, as Constitution Day and Citizenship Day, and September 17 through September 23 as Constitution Week. On this day and during this week, we celebrate our Constitution and the rights of citizenship that we enjoy together as the proud people of this Nation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixteenth day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# National Voter Registration Day, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
American democracy begins and ends with the ballot box—putting the right to vote and the right to decide our Nation's future in the hands of “We the People.” Voting defines our threshold of liberty and makes everything possible. On National Voter Registration Day, we recommit to protecting the sacred right to vote, and we encourage every eligible American to register to vote.
Today, there are forces trying to take us back in time. They are trying to suppress voters and subvert elections. They are supporting unlimited dark money and extreme gerrymandering to try to influence the election system
in their favor. We saw it on January 6, 2021, when a violent mob of insurrectionists and election deniers breached the Capitol. It is a solemn reminder that the work to secure our democracy and protect our fundamental rights and freedoms is not over in this country. Each generation must join the work to preserve our democratic values and norms.
That is why, when I came into office, I was determined to secure the right to vote and the right to have every vote counted. I signed an Executive Order that directed the entire Federal Government to work on promoting non-partisan access to voter registration and election information. So far, Federal agencies have worked to make voter registration more accessible for veterans and college students. The Department of Justice has doubled its voting rights enforcement staff. United States Citizenship and Immigration Services has worked to ensure that all newly naturalized citizens understand the privilege of voting and have the opportunity to register. And the Department of the Interior is working to increase Indigenous peoples' access to voter registration. Furthermore, Vice President Kamala Harris declared National Voter Registration Day to be one of three National Days of Action on Voting Rights, calling on all Americans, regardless of political affiliation, to come together to encourage voter registration. This year, one of my guests at the State of the Union was one of the brave Americans who marched in Selma, Alabama, nearly 60 years ago on “Bloody Sunday.” Thanks to these activists who fought tirelessly for the right to vote—from Seneca Falls, New York, to Selma, Alabama—the 19th Amendment was ratified and the Voting Rights Act was signed into law. But to fully secure the right to vote in every State, the Congress must take action and pass the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act.
Today, I am thinking of a quote from Benjamin Franklin. When he was asked if the Founding Fathers had given America a monarchy or a republic, he responded, “A republic, if you can keep it.” On National Voter Registration Day, we are reminded that our republic is in our hands and it is incumbent upon us to maintain it. It is in that spirit that we encourage every eligible American to ensure they are registered to vote. You can verify that your registration is accurate and up to date and offer to help your neighbors do the same. For more information, visit Vote.gov.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 17, 2024, as National Voter Registration Day. I call on all eligible Americans to observe this day by ensuring that they are accurately registered and by committing to cast a ballot in upcoming elections.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixteenth day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# National POW/MIA Recognition Day, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Throughout history, America's service members have risked everything to keep the light of liberty shining bright. Today, more than 81,000 of these brave men and women remain missing and unaccounted for around the world. They will never be forgotten, and their courage, service, and sacrifice will always be cherished by our grateful Nation. On National POW/MIA Recognition Day, we honor all those missing and unaccounted for. We recommit to bringing them home, no matter how long it takes. And we express our ironclad support for their families.
The POW/MIA flag is displayed in its rightful place above the White House—the People's House. The flag serves as a reminder to all Americans that we are the fortunate heirs of the legacy that they—our Nation's unreturned heroes—helped to forge. These service members gave all, risked all, and dared all to protect our freedom. Just as they kept faith in our Nation, we must keep faith with them. My Administration will never forget our obligation to these patriots and their families. We owe them a debt of gratitude we can never fully repay.
For those with family members who are missing and unaccounted for, I know that the not knowing weighs on your hearts, amid the grieving, remembering, and cherishing of your loved ones. My Administration sees you, stands with you, and will never forget our sacred obligation to care for you.
During National POW/MIA Recognition Day, we recognize the absolute bravery of our Nation's service members who are missing and unaccounted for, and we recommit to bringing them home. We offer our gratitude and steadfast support for their families, who have given so much to our Nation. We also honor the service and sacrifice of former prisoners of war. And we remember that the truest testimonial to their sacrifice is doing our part to ensure that our democracy and the soul of our Nation endure.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 20, 2024, as National POW/MIA Recognition Day. Let all who read this know that America remains grateful to our heroes held in the worst imaginable conditions as prisoners of war. Additionally, I encourage my fellow citizens across the Nation to reflect on today and let us not forget those heroes who never returned home from the battlefields around the world or their families who are still waiting for answers. I call upon Federal, State, and local government officials and private organizations to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this nineteenth day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# National Service Dog Day, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
On National Service Dog Day, we recognize the proven benefits that service dogs bring to so many people across our Nation.
Service dogs have long been at people's sides—acting as an important source of comfort and an essential resource to help with everyday life. It was not until 1990, when we passed the Americans with Disabilities Act, that our Nation fully recognized and protected service dogs by law. I am proud to have co-sponsored this landmark legislation years ago, and I am proud of its continued legacy today. Service dogs continue to provide valuable aid and support, improving people's lives—and even sometimes saving them. For people with disabilities and those struggling with their health, service dogs can help them perform everyday tasks, alert them of oncoming medical episodes, or remind them to take medication. For those dealing with post-traumatic stress disorder or anxiety, service dogs can be a source of comfort and care—waking their owner up during nightmares or helping them navigate large crowds.
My Administration has worked to ensure that everyone has access to the health care and support services they need. I signed the Puppies Assisting Wounded Servicemembers for Veterans Therapy Act, which established a pilot program that makes veterans struggling with post-traumatic stress disorder eligible to train service dogs. Additionally, the Department of Veterans Affairs has also provided the Service Dog Veterinary Health Insurance Benefit to over 1,400 veterans, ensuring that veterinary costs for their service dogs are covered. And the Department of Transportation established the first-ever Airline Passengers with Disabilities Bill of Rights, which affirmed the right to travel with a service animal, and proposed a rule to ensure all passengers with disabilities—including those with service animals—can travel safely and with dignity.
Today, may we celebrate service dogs, who offer assistance, comfort, and unconditional love to so many.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 20, 2024, as National Service Dog Day. I call upon the people of the United States to honor the role of service dogs in the lives of people with disabilities and America's veterans with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this nineteenth day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander-Serving Institutions Week, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Our Nation's nearly 200 Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander-Serving Institutions (AANAPISIs) open doors of opportunity for millions of Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander (AA and NHPI) students. AANAPISIs provide a pathway to the middle class and a better life for their students, many of whom often come from low-income neighborhoods and may be the first in their families to attend college. During AANAPISI Week, we celebrate these critical institutions for the resources and support they provide to students, and we recommit to advancing their mission and success.
AANAPISIs play a critical role in the lives of so many of our Nation's AA and NHPI students. In addition to a quality education, these institutions meet AA and NHPI students where they are and foster inclusive learning environments—providing tutoring, career development, counseling, culturally and linguistically responsive services, and more. AANAPISIs confer more than half of all associate degrees and more than a third of baccalaureate degrees that AA and NHPI students earn.
My Administration is committed to strengthening our AANAPISIs so that more AA and NHPI students can reach their full potential. My American Rescue Plan delivered $5 billion to AANAPISIs. The Department of Education has invested in increasing the number of diverse and talented teachers by funding programs at Minority Serving Institutions that serve large percentages of AA and NHPI populations. Across my Administration, Federal agencies are working to expand the capacity of AANAPISIs and strengthen their programs. And I re-established the White House Initiative on Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders and released a National Strategy to Advance Equity, Justice, and Opportunity for AA and NHPI Communities. These actions work to ensure AA and NHPI communities have the resources they need to thrive.
My Administration is also working to make college more affordable for all students. We provided a $900 increase to the maximum Pell Grant award—the largest increase in over a decade, canceled debt for hundreds of thousands of borrowers through the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, and taken steps to help borrowers manage their payments through income-driven repayment. And earlier this year, I laid out my Administration's new plans that would cancel student debt for more than 30 million Americans when combined with everything we have done so far.
I have always believed that the American Dream is big enough for everyone—and every generation has benefited by opening the doors of opportunity a bit wider for those behind them. During AANAPISI Week, may we celebrate the nearly 200 institutions across our Nation that ensure generations of AA and NHPI students can pursue the limits of their talents and ambitions. May we recognize that diversity will always be one of our Nation's greatest strengths. And may we celebrate all our Nation's AA and NHPI students.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 23 through September 29, 2024, as Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander-Serving Institutions Week. I call on public officials, educators, and all the people of the United States to observe this week with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities that acknowledge the many ways these institutions and their graduates contribute to our country.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.
Proclamation 10817 of September 27, 2024
Proc. 10817

# Amending Proclamation 10773By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
On June 3, 2024, I signed Proclamation 10773 (Securing the Border). That proclamation suspended and limited the entry of certain noncitizens into the United States across the southern border during times of high border crossings, and directed the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Attorney General to promptly consider issuing any instructions, orders, or regulations as might be necessary to address the circumstances at the southern border, including any additional limitations and conditions on asylum eligibility that they determined were warranted. Following that direction, the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Attorney General issued an interim final rule (IFR) that established a limitation on asylum eligibility for certain noncitizens who enter the United States across the southern border during times when Proclamation 10773 and the IFR are designed to be in effect, and revised certain procedures applicable to the expedited removal process to more swiftly apply consequences for irregular migration during those times for noncitizens who do not establish a lawful basis to remain.
Those actions have already produced significant results. Since Proclamation 10773 and the IFR went into effect, and as of the end of the last calendar month, the average number of encounters by the United States Border Patrol at our southwest border between ports of entry has decreased by 59 percent compared to the period after the Circumvention of Lawful Pathways rule began to apply on May 12, 2023, and before Proclamation 10773
and the IFR went into effect. July and August 2024 were the lowest 2 months of encounters between ports of entry since September 2020. While Proclamation 10773 and the IFR have been in effect, and for individuals encountered between southern border ports of entry as of the end of the last calendar month, the Department of Homeland Security has removed or returned 70 percent of single adults and family members, including more than 119,000 individuals to more than 140 countries; has more than tripled the percentage of noncitizens processed through expedited removal; and has decreased the percentage of noncitizens encountered at the southwest border who are released by United States Border Patrol pending their removal proceedings by 52 percent.
Following the issuance of the IFR, the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice (Departments) received and reviewed more than 1,000 comments. Based on their review of those comments and their experience in implementing Proclamation 10773 and the IFR, the Departments have identified two issues related to the thresholds for determining when to apply the suspension and limitation on entry in Proclamation 10773 and the measures described in the IFR.
First, having closely monitored the 7-consecutive-calendar-day average of encounters following the issuance of Proclamation 10773 and the IFR, the Departments have assessed that the current threshold for discontinuing the suspension and limitation on entry in Proclamation 10773 and the measures described in the IFR could be reached following a short-term decrease in the number of encounters at the southern border that does not reflect a sustained decrease in the number of such encounters or an end to the border circumstances in which Proclamation 10773 and the IFR are designed to apply. The Departments are currently considering regulatory action to address this issue as it relates to the measures described in the IFR. With respect to Proclamation 10773, to ensure that the threshold to discontinue the suspension and limitation on entry reflects a sustained decrease in encounters, I have now determined that the suspension and limitation on entry in that proclamation should be discontinued only after the Secretary of Homeland Security has made a factual determination that there have been 28 consecutive calendar days in which the 7-consecutive-calendar-day average of encounters is less than 1,500.
Second, while Proclamation 10773 and the IFR excluded encounters of unaccompanied children from non-contiguous countries from the calculation of encounters, the Departments have assessed, based on their experience implementing Proclamation 10773 and the IFR, that this exclusion is unwarranted because processing such noncitizens is particularly resource-intensive for our frontline personnel at the southern border. This experience indicates that excluding these noncitizens from the calculation yields inaccurate estimates of system capacity. Again, the Departments are currently considering regulatory action to address this issue as it relates to the measures described in the IFR. I have now concluded that in order to better achieve Proclamation 10773's goal of enhancing our ability to address historic levels of migration and more efficiently process migrants arriving at the southern border, that proclamation should include unaccompanied children from both non-contiguous and contiguous countries in the calculation of encounters. Consistent with section 3(b)(iii) of Proclamation 10773, any unaccompanied children will remain excepted from the suspension and limitation on entry pursuant to section 1 of Proclamation 10773.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including sections 212(f) and 215(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1182(f) and 1185(a)) and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, hereby find that, absent the measures set forth in Proclamation 10773, as amended by this proclamation, the entry into the United States of persons described in section 1 of Proclamation 10773 under circumstances described in section 2 of Proclamation 10773, as amended by this proclamation, would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and that the entry of such persons should be subject to certain restrictions, limitations, and exceptions. I therefore hereby proclaim the following:
Section 1
.
Amendment to Section 2(a) of Proclamation 10773.
Section 2(a) of Proclamation 10773 is amended to read as follows:
“The Secretary of Homeland Security shall monitor the number of daily encounters and, subject to subsection (b) of this section, the suspension and limitation on entry pursuant to section 1 of this proclamation shall be discontinued at 12:01 a.m. eastern time on the date that is 14 calendar days after the Secretary makes a factual determination that there have been 28 consecutive calendar days of a 7-consecutive-calendar-day average of less than 1,500 encounters, not including encounters described in subsection 4(a)(iii) of this proclamation.”
Sec. 2
.
Revocation of Section 2(c) of Proclamation 10773.
Section 2(c) of Proclamation 10773 is revoked.
Sec. 3
.
Severability.
It is the policy of the United States to enforce this proclamation to the maximum extent possible to advance the interests of the United States. Accordingly, if any provision of this proclamation, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this proclamation and the application of its provisions to any other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.
Sec. 4
.
Effectiveness.
The amendments described in sections 1 and 2 of this proclamation shall be effective if and when there is in effect a final rule promulgated by the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Attorney General that amends the IFR entitled Securing the Border, 89 FR 48,710 (June 7, 2024), consistent with the amendments described in sections 1 and 2 of this proclamation. If, due to court order, the final rule described in the prior sentence cannot be enforced insofar as it makes changes consistent with the amendment described in section 1 of this proclamation, then the amendment described in section 1 of this proclamation will no longer be in effect and section 2(a) of Proclamation 10773 shall continue to apply by its terms. If, due to court order, the final rule described in the first sentence of this section cannot be enforced insofar as it makes changes consistent with the amendment described in section 2 of this proclamation, then the amendment described in section 2 of this proclamation will no longer be in effect and section 2(c) of Proclamation 10773 shall continue to apply by its terms.
Sec. 5
.
General Provisions.
(a) Nothing in this proclamation shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:
(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or
(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.
(b) This proclamation shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
(c) This proclamation is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

# Gold Star Mother's and Family's Day, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
On this solemn day, we honor the memories of the patriots who served our Nation, defended our freedom, and made the ultimate sacrifice for our country. We hold close to our hearts the Gold Star mothers and fathers, wives and husbands, sisters and brothers, daughters and sons, and other loved ones, who grieve their loss and carry on their legacy. And we recommit to fulfilling our sacred obligation to care for all of our Gold Star families.
Each of our service members is a link in the chain of honor that stretches back to the founding days of our Nation. They are bound not just by their bravery but also by their commitment to an idea unlike any other in human history: the idea of the United States of America. Decade after decade, our service members have fought for our freedom and the freedom of others because they knew that freedom has never been guaranteed. And just as our fallen heroes have kept the ultimate faith in our country and our democracy, we must keep faith in them.
To everyone who has loved and lost someone in the service of our country and to everyone with a loved one still missing or unaccounted for, I know how hard these days of remembrance can be. No matter how much time has passed or how much pride you have in their legacy, the grief and the hurt never fully go away. The First Lady and I are keeping all Gold Star families in our prayers. Since I took office, I have signed over 30 bipartisan laws supporting service members and veterans as well as their families, caregivers, and survivors. And I will continue to do everything I can to support our Gold Star families, to whom our Nation owes a debt of gratitude we can never fully repay.
Today, we join Gold Star families in their grief and express our gratitude: gratitude to our fallen heroes, gratitude for the sacrifices of the families left behind, and gratitude to the brave souls who continue to uphold the flame
of liberty all across our country and around the world. Because of them, our country stands today. As we honor Gold Star Mother's and Family's Day, we recommit to making a more perfect Union, for which our fallen heroes lived and died. That is our promise.
The Congress, by Senate Joint Resolution 115 of June 23, 1936 (49 Stat. 1895 as amended), has designated the last Sunday in September as “Gold Star Mother's Day.”
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim Sunday, September 29, 2024, as Gold Star Mother's and Family's Day. I call upon all Government officials to display the flag of the United States over Government buildings on this special day. I also encourage the American people to display the flag and hold appropriate ceremonies as a public expression of our Nation's gratitude and respect for our Gold Star Mothers and Families.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-seventh day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# National Hunting and Fishing Day, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Generations of Americans have enjoyed hunting and fishing—cherished traditions that bring us closer to our Nation's natural wonders and embody America's spirit of resourcefulness and adventure. During National Hunting and Fishing Day, we celebrate our Nation's hunters and anglers, honor their contributions, and continue the conservation work that so many of them have led.
Americans who hunt and fish have immense appreciation for our environment. They know that when we take care of the natural world, we ensure that all generations to come will also have the opportunity to hunt, fish, and enjoy the great outdoors. Passing down this tradition is especially important to rural communities, where hunting and fishing are time-honored pastimes, and to Tribal Nations, where hunting and fishing remain central to their cultures and livelihoods. My Administration set the most ambitious conservation goal ever—committing to conserve at least 30 percent of all our Nation's lands and waters by 2030. That goal is at the heart of my “America the Beautiful” initiative to support locally led, voluntary conservation and restoration efforts across the country. And within our national wildlife refuge system, I approved a 2-million-acre expansion of land available for hunting and fishing. The Department of Agriculture and the Department of the Interior are working with the Hunting and Wildlife Conservation Council to improve hunters' and anglers' access to public lands
and waters. I also launched the Federal Interagency Council on Outdoor Recreation to create more safe, affordable, and equitable opportunities for outdoor recreation, including hunting and fishing. My Inflation Reduction Act made the largest investment ever in addressing the climate crisis, harnessing the power of nature as a climate solution and working to ensure that our fish and wildlife are healthy and abundant for years to come.
During National Hunting and Fishing Day, we celebrate hunting and fishing and the place they hold in our hearts, cultures, and national story. We recommit to protecting these activities, which are important to upholding our sacred trust, treaty, and subsistence responsibilities to Tribal Nations. And we honor all the incredible contributions of the hunters and fishers, land owners, State and territorial officials, Tribal Nations, Indigenous communities, and local leaders working to conserve our lands and waters.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 28, 2024, as National Hunting and Fishing Day. I call upon all Americans to observe this day with appropriate programs and activities.

# National Public Lands Day, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
America's natural wonders are our Nation's heart and soul. Our public lands protect many of these treasures and ensure that generations can enjoy their splendor—from our national parks and monuments to our forests and wildlife refuges. On National Public Lands Day, we honor these irreplaceable lands and waters and recommit to working together to preserve them.
Whether it is the soaring cliffs of Yosemite National Park, the striking geysers of Yellowstone National Park, or the lush hills of the Appalachians in the Monongahela National Forest—our Nation's public lands inspire and unite us through the ages. They hold pieces of our country's history, etched into our lands and waters. Some public lands are considered sacred by Tribal Nations, which have stewarded them since time immemorial. And these lands and waters also carry so much promise: helping protect us against climate change, providing the clean air we breathe and clean water we drink, and sustaining the livelihoods of ranchers, outfitters, guides, and rural and Indigenous communities.
Since the beginning of my Administration, I have taken historic steps to conserve our natural treasures for future generations. That began when I signed an Executive Order that established the most ambitious conservation
goal in the history of our country—committing to conserve at least 30 percent of our Nation's lands and waters by 2030. To that end, my “America the Beautiful” initiative is supporting voluntary, locally led conservation and restoration efforts across the country. I also signed an Executive Order to safeguard and steward our Nation's forests and enlist nature to help address the climate crisis, including through the development of the first National Nature Assessment.
Since I came into office, my Administration has conserved more than 42 million acres of our Nation's lands and waters. I established and expanded eight national monuments—including the stunning Avi Kwa Ame National Monument in Nevada, thought to be one of the most sacred places on Earth by some Tribal Nations. I restored protections for lands and waters across the country that had been rolled back by the previous administration—including the desert buttes of the Bears Ears National Monument and the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, the stunning Tongass National Forest, and the underwater canyons of the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument.
To protect our waters, I took executive action to direct consideration of more than 700,000 square miles of the Pacific Ocean southwest of Hawaii as a new National Marine Sanctuary—which could make this one of the largest protected marine areas on the planet. And I protected the United States Arctic Ocean from new oil and gas leasing. My Administration is also advancing the proposed Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary, which stretches along 116 miles of California coastline.
My Administration has also made historic investments to preserve our Nation's ecosystems and safeguard our communities against the impact of climate change. Our Inflation Reduction Act made the largest investment in history to confront the climate crisis, and together with our Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, these investments will help support conservation and restoration, including $50 billion dedicated to strengthening community and ecosystem resilience to climate change. We have also worked to promote equitable access to outdoor recreation opportunities on public lands and waters through the “America the Beautiful” initiative, launching the Federal Interagency Council on Outdoor Recreation to address common challenges and opportunities in expanding outdoor recreation activities and access to the great outdoors.
I also launched the American Climate Corps to mobilize a new, diverse generation of Americans—putting them to work conserving and restoring our lands and waters, bolstering community resilience, deploying clean energy, implementing energy efficient technologies, and advancing environmental justice. And, upon completing this program, we are working to ensure they have a pathway to getting high-quality, good-paying clean energy and climate resilience jobs in the public and private sectors.
Our Nation's public lands have always been and will always be central to our country's heritage and essential to our identity. On National Public Lands Day, I encourage every American to enjoy the wonder of our public lands. All of our country's national parks, forests, refuges, and grasslands will have a “Fee-Free Day” on September 28—anyone can visit them free of charge. There are several more fee-free days throughout the year, the last of which will occur on Veterans Day, November 11. Whether you go for the incredible vistas, the lush forests, or the rolling grasslands, our public
lands will never fail to inspire awe and connect us to something bigger than ourselves.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 28, 2024, as National Public Lands Day. I invite all Americans to join me in a day of service for our public lands. I also encourage volunteers from across the Nation to celebrate and care for our lands and waters by reforesting the land, maintaining trails, nurturing ecosystems, removing invasive species, and doing other conservation work to serve the lands and waters that support and sustain us.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-seventh day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# National Arts and Humanities Month, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
The arts and humanities bring people together and show us that we have more in common than we have differences—helping us see each other, understand one another, and unite in common cause. Our artists and scholars embody the very spirit of America: the drive to create and connect, the pursuit of excellence, and the boldness to be truthtellers and change seekers. During National Arts and Humanities Month, we celebrate the artists and scholars who lift us up, speak to our souls, and shape who we are as a Nation.
We are a great Nation, largely because of the power of the arts and humanities, which is stamped into the DNA of America. My Administration is committed to continuing the longstanding tradition of supporting the arts and humanities—including promoting freedom of expression as a part of a healthy democracy—and has worked to ensure people across the Nation have access to the connection and economic opportunities they provide. During the COVID-19 pandemic, when local venues like theaters and concert halls were struggling to stay open, we offered a lifeline of over $1 billion in funding. In 2022, I also signed an Executive Order to advance the cultural vitality of our country and ensure that access to the arts and humanities is within reach of every American. That included re-establishing the President's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities (PCAH) and appointing the First Lady as an honorary chair and Lady Gaga and Bruce Cohen as co-chairs. The Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) recently celebrated the 10 recipients of the 2024 National Medal for Museum and Library Service, our Nation's highest honor given to museums and libraries that demonstrate excellence in service to their communities. The National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) also launched ArtsHere, a $10
million grant pilot program expected to announce nearly 100 awards for projects by local arts organizations working in underserved communities. And this year, the NEA—alongside policy experts at the White House, the Second Gentleman, and more—convened artists to demonstrate how the arts and humanities are critical infrastructure to our own well-being and the health of our democracy.
I believe deeply in the power of the arts and humanities to tell the story of our Nation and help guide our path toward a better Union. That is why the First Lady and I have hosted countless events that brought artists and performers here to the White House—from movie screenings and poetry readings to musical performances and a Juneteenth concert on the South Lawn. We have also honored a number of incredible artists and scholars by awarding the National Humanities Medals and National Medals of Arts and by hosting the Kennedy Center Honorees at the White House. These events and honors are a reminder of the value the arts and humanities bring to our lives and our Nation.
Our Administration is working with artists and scholars to ensure that hate has no safe harbor in America. As a part of our United We Stand Summit, the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) launched a joint initiative with the NEA called Connecting Through Culture to leverage the arts and humanities against hate-motivated violence, promote civic engagement, and encourage cross-cultural understanding. Building on the work of United We Stand, the PCAH, NEH, NEA, and IMLS also launched the Artists for Understanding initiative to bring together a diverse community of artists and humanitarians in the fight against hate. And the NEH has worked to support humanities and research programs that capture the good, bad, and truth of our Nation. From helping to document the oral histories of survivors and descendants of the Federal Indian Boarding School era to investing in programs that help protect and preserve America's Black history through Historically Black Colleges and Universities and supporting cultural institutions in the Pacific Islands, we show our commitment to understanding and learning from our past so that we can work together to build a better future.
Our Nation's artists, librarians, scholars, and museum professionals make us feel our humanity, reminding us of all that is possible when we come together. This month, may we celebrate American artists and scholars, who will always hold a special place in the soul of our Nation. And may we recommit to supporting the arts and humanities, which make us a stronger and more prosperous Nation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2024 as National Arts and Humanities Month. I call on the people of the United States to observe this month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and celebrations.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Too many Americans know the pain of losing a mother, sister, wife, daughter, or loved one to breast cancer. During National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, we honor the memories of all those we have lost to this devastating disease. We give strength and support to their families, to their caregivers, to survivors, and to women still undergoing treatment. And we express our gratitude to all the medical professionals and health researchers working tirelessly to end cancer as we know it.
Today, there are more than four million breast cancer survivors in America—and this year alone, hundreds of thousands more will be diagnosed. While scientists have made significant breakthroughs to better prevent, detect, and treat breast cancer, a diagnosis is frightening and overwhelming. Patients and families are often flooded with complex medical information and forced to advocate for themselves to receive basic care. Additionally, some patients are left saddled with exorbitant medical bills while undergoing grueling treatments.
For my family and Vice President Harris' family—along with millions of families across the country—cancer is personal. Ending cancer as we know it has been a top priority for my Administration since day one. The First Lady and I reignited the Cancer Moonshot to cut the cancer death rate by at least 50 percent over the next 25 years and improve the experience of those diagnosed with cancer and their loved ones. I also established the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health, securing $4 billion in bipartisan funding to help the scientists, innovators, and public health professionals who are working around the clock to improve the prevention, detection, and treatment of cancers and other deadly diseases.
My Administration has also worked hard to make cancer treatment more affordable for patients. I strengthened Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act (ACA), expanding health coverage to millions of Americans and saving millions of families $800 per year on their health insurance premiums. My Inflation Reduction Act will cap total out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs at $2,000 per year for seniors and other people on Medicare—including expensive cancer medications, which can cost tens of thousands of dollars.
Moreover, to increase support for patients and their families, we have ensured that people facing cancer can access patient navigation services that are fully paid for through Medicare, Medicaid, and private health insurance. This personalized assistance helps lift the burden of managing the complex medical journey alone from millions of patients.
Furthermore, my Administration is committed to ensuring women have access to screening and early detection services, which are critical in catching breast cancer early and saving lives. Toward that aim, we expanded coverage under the ACA, which requires insurers to pay for recommended cancer screenings—including mammograms—for many more Americans. We expanded access to free breast cancer screenings for any veteran exposed
to burn pits during their military service. And we will continue to forge partnerships with community health centers to help ensure underserved communities have access to early detection and support services.
For more information about breast cancer, go to cancer.gov/types/breast or call 1-800-422-6237 to speak to information specialists at the National Cancer Institute in English and in Spanish. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program also offers breast cancer screenings or diagnostic services to low-income individuals who are uninsured or otherwise qualify for the program—go to cdc.gov/breast-cervical-cancer-screening/ to learn more.
This National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, let us each recommit to doing our part to give more support, hope, and care to patients, families, and survivors of breast cancer. Let us rise above party and politics and unite as Americans to help all of our loved ones struggling with this terrible disease. And let us strengthen our resolve together as a Nation to end cancer as we know it—for all the lives we have lost and all those we can still save.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2024 as National Breast Cancer Awareness Month. I encourage citizens, government agencies, private businesses, nonprofit organizations, and other interested groups to join in activities that will increase awareness of what Americans can do to prevent and control breast cancer and pay tribute to those who have lost their lives to this disease.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# National Clean Energy Action Month, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
When I think of clean energy, I think of good-paying jobs for American workers. Our Nation is leading the fight against the existential threat of climate change all while growing our economy and transitioning this country to a clean, reliable, and affordable energy future. During National Clean Energy Action Month, we recommit to investing in America and American workers as we build a cleaner, more energy secure future.
Since day one of my Administration, in partnership with Vice President Harris, I have been committed to building a clean energy economy that creates good-paying and union jobs for American workers. That is why my Investing in America agenda is making the most significant investment in climate and clean energy in history. That investment has helped America unleash a clean energy manufacturing and deployment boom—attracting more than $426 billion in private sector investment commitments. It has also created more than 330,000 new jobs according to independent estimates. These investments are disproportionately going to places that have been left behind—including historic energy communities that have powered this Nation for generations and to workers who do not have a 4-year college degree.
We are also making investments that help ensure our clean energy future will be built here in America—by American workers. My Inflation Reduction Act is delivering on my commitment to be the most pro-worker, pro-union President in history. For the first time ever, we are attaching strong labor protections and incentives to climate and clean energy tax credits. My Administration finalized a rule through the Inflation Reduction Act incentivizing companies to pay clean energy workers a prevailing wage and employ registered apprentices. These provisions help ensure jobs building wind farms, installing solar panels, and constructing hydrogen and carbon capture facilities will be good-paying and support proven pathways into the clean energy industry that allow workers to earn while they learn. Outside estimates suggest the Inflation Reduction Act could help create as many as 1.5 million jobs over the next decade. And I launched the American Climate Corps to train this next generation of clean energy, conservation, and resilience workers.
My Administration is making significant progress toward our ambitious goals of securing 100 percent clean electricity by 2035 and achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. That is in no small part due to our Inflation Reduction Act's tax credits and rebates, which families can use to install solar panels, buy energy-saving appliances, get heat pumps, and purchase American-made electric cars. Not only will this law help triple wind power generation and increase solar production eight-fold by 2030—tens of billions of dollars will go to the pockets of American families. And through Federal programs like the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, we are lowering Americans' energy bills and making millions of homes safer and more energy efficient.
But there is still so much more to do to ensure that we are leading American industries into the 21st century and tackling climate change. That is why my Administration made the largest investment in America's power grid ever—making it more resilient to severe weather, laying new transmission lines, and upgrading existing infrastructure so clean and affordable energy can reach every corner of the country. At the same time, we are speeding up permitting for clean energy and transmission projects while implementing new emissions standards to reduce pollution from oil and gas producers, power plants, and vehicles—which will save American lives, improve the well-being of our people, and save tens of billions of dollars in healthcare costs.
Across the country, Americans are writing the next chapter in our Nation's clean energy future—they are getting shovels in the ground and working
hard in good-paying jobs all while supporting their families and restoring pride to their communities. During National Clean Energy Action Month, we celebrate all the progress in clean energy, and we recommit to coming together to secure the future of clean energy here at home.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2024 as National Clean Energy Action Month. I call upon all Americans to explore whether new tax credits and rebates can help them lower emissions and save money on energy bills, cars, and home upgrades, and to recognize this month by talking to neighbors, friends, and coworkers about opportunities to address the climate crisis, and working together to mitigate climate change and achieve a healthier environment for all.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# National Cybersecurity Month, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Defending our digital world is essential to ensuring the safety and security of our Nation and the American people. During National Cybersecurity Month, we recommit to protecting our data and technologies from malicious hackers and cyber threats. We encourage all Americans to learn more about cybersecurity. And we promise to ensure that America can realize the positive impacts of our digital future.
My Administration is committed to securing the digital ecosystems that touch nearly every aspect of American life. That is why I released the National Cybersecurity Strategy, which lays out 100 actions the Federal Government, along with our public and private sector partners, is taking to defend our increasingly digital world. This strategy aims to ensure primary responsibility for creating a safe digital future is borne by technology companies and the Federal Government, entities that are most capable and best-positioned to reduce cyber-related risks for all of us. I have signed Executive Orders to secure the digital infrastructure of the Nation's ports, fortify our supply chains, and strengthen our industrial base. Furthermore, my Administration launched the “U.S. Cyber Trust Mark” program, which works with leading product manufacturers and retailers to ensure Americans have the option of choosing safer smart devices. Through executive action, we are also setting a higher standard of security for the software purchased by the Government.
To keep our digital world safe, we are supporting efforts to build a strong cyber workforce that is ready to meet this moment. My Administration is
committed to investing in the next generation of cybersecurity experts and opening up more opportunities for Americans to pursue a cyber-based career. We have invested in infrastructure projects across the country, where America's workers are building semiconductors and making our electric grids more resilient to cyber threats. We also released a National Cyber Workforce and Education Strategy focused on giving more Americans access to the skills and education needed to pursue good-paying jobs in the cyber field. We have made the Federal Government a model for that work by transitioning the hiring process for cyber positions in the Federal Government to be skills-based—focusing on required skills and removing unnecessary degree requirements. We launched the “Service for America” campaign with a recruiting and hiring sprint to connect more people to cyber jobs and fill critical vacancies. And we are working with academia and the public and private sectors to grow the national cyber workforce by providing high-quality training, scholarships, paid internships, and Registered Apprenticeships.
My Administration is ensuring that America leads the world in cybersecurity, and we are working with our international partners to combat cyber threats. We are convening the nearly 70 member countries and international organizations of the International Counter Ransomware Initiative launched by my Administration to address the scourge of ransomware at both an operational and a policy level. We are working closely with allies and partners to bolster our cyber defense so that we can communicate and support one another in response to cyberattacks. And we have established cybersecurity goals that are rooted in protecting our shared democratic values.
During National Cybersecurity Month, we recognize the important role that cybersecurity plays in keeping Americans safe, protecting our institutions, and upholding our democracy. We honor all of the cybersecurity professionals, who are working tirelessly to defend our digital world. And we look forward to all that we will accomplish as we work together to advance cybersecurity.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2024 as National Cybersecurity Month. I call upon the people, businesses, and institutions of the United States to recognize and act on the importance of cybersecurity and to observe National Cybersecurity Month in support of our national security and resilience. I also call upon businesses and institutions to take action to better protect the American people against cyber threats and create new opportunities for American workers to pursue good-paying cyber jobs. Americans can also take immediate action to better protect themselves by turning on multifactor authentication, updating software on computers and devices, using strong passwords, and remaining cautious of clicking on links that look suspicious.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# National Disability Employment Awareness Month, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
America's economy is stronger when every American has an opportunity to thrive and contribute meaningfully. During National Disability Employment Awareness Month, we honor the incredible contributions of disabled Americans to our country and economy. And we recommit to opening the doors of opportunity wider for people with disabilities, making our Nation more equal, accessible, and fair.
Not too long ago, a person with a disability in America could be denied employment because of their disability. They could even be denied access to public spaces and basic needs like service in a restaurant or a grocery store. One of my early acts as a United States Senator was co-sponsoring the Rehabilitation Act. It was the first time in our Nation's history that we declared in law what we knew to be true: that Americans with disabilities deserve dignity, respect, and an equal chance at the American Dream. The Rehabilitation Act is one of the most consequential civil rights laws in our Nation's history, banning discrimination on the basis of disability by any entity the Federal Government funds.
The Rehabilitation Act laid the groundwork for another landmark law: the Americans with Disabilities Act. I was enormously proud to co-sponsor that bill and remain even prouder of its lasting legacy today. For more than 61 million Americans living with a disability, these laws are a source of opportunity, meaningful inclusion, participation, respect, and—as my dad would say—dignity. And in the Obama-Biden Administration, we built on the lasting legacy of these laws by setting hiring goals in Federal contracts for people with disabilities, which we have upheld and continued to pursue in the Biden-Harris Administration.
My Administration is committed to ensuring people with disabilities have access to good jobs. In my first few months in office, I signed an Executive Order establishing a Government-wide commitment to advancing equality and equity in Federal employment, including for people with disabilities. It brought together the Department of Labor, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and the Office of Personnel Management to ensure that Federal workplaces are fully accessible to people with disabilities so that the dignity and rights of disabled Americans are lifted in every policy we pursue. That includes making sure our Nation's largest employer—the Federal Government—is the model for fair, accessible, and decent practices in the workplace. This Executive Order directs agencies to address the challenges faced by job applicants and employees with disabilities. Additionally, the General Services Administration adopted the United States Access Board's new guidelines to ensure people with disabilities have access to the over 300,000 Federal Government buildings. Furthermore, my Administration ended the use of unfair subminimum wages in Federal contracts—no longer will employers be permitted to pay workers with disabilities less than minimum wage through the AbilityOne Federal contracting program. And the Department of Labor has launched a comprehensive review of the subminimum wage program. We are working to increase hiring for people
with disabilities in every sector—from helping State and local governments, businesses, and nonprofits access Federal funds to hire more disabled Americans to appointing people with disabilities to positions in my Administration.
My Administration is also strengthening our Nation's infrastructure and making it more accessible so that people with disabilities have no problems commuting to work or other places. My Bipartisan Infrastructure Law makes the biggest investment ever—$1.75 billion—to expand accessibility in transit and rail stations. It also includes $65 billion to expand access to high-speed internet so more disabled Americans can work, study, and stay connected from home. Further, the Department of Justice finalized standards for State and local governments to make their internet content and mobile apps more accessible so that digital workplaces are accessible to disabled Americans.
During National Disability Employment Awareness Month, we celebrate the talent, impact, and legacy of people with disabilities across our Nation by working to make our country stronger, more prosperous, and more just. And we recommit to ensuring people with disabilities have every opportunity to pursue the American Dream.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2024 as National Disability Employment Awareness Month. I urge all Americans to embrace the talents and skills of workers with disabilities and to promote the right to equal employment opportunity for all.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# National Domestic Violence Awareness and Prevention Month, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Domestic violence affects millions of Americans across our Nation with devastating consequences for survivors, families, and entire communities. Everyone deserves to live free from the fear of violence, especially in their own home. During National Domestic Violence Awareness and Prevention Month, we recommit to extending support and resources to all survivors, continuing to hold perpetrators accountable, and ensuring that our society is truly safe for everyone.
Just last month, we celebrated the 30th anniversary of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), which I wrote and championed as a United States Senator. It is one of the pieces of legislation of which I am most proud.
VAWA established a coordinated, nationwide response to gender-based violence, lifting social and legal burdens off survivors and onto perpetrators, where they belong. It directed critical funding toward increasing resources for survivors, strengthened efforts to prevent and prosecute sexual assault, and funded rape crisis centers and shelters to support survivors. It also created the Nation's first-ever National Domestic Violence Hotline, which has provided millions of Americans with lifesaving support, answering its seven millionth contact this past year.
My Administration recognizes that there is still more work to do. Between 30 and 40 percent of Americans are impacted by sexual abuse, physical violence, or stalking—including online—by an intimate partner throughout their lifetimes. Over the years, I have spoken with countless brave survivors of domestic violence, who have shared the devastating toll this abuse takes on all aspects of their lives. Their stories are also marked by a deep courage and resilience. Above all, they have made clear that even one case of domestic violence is too many and goes against who we are as a Nation.
In 2022, I signed into law the reauthorization of VAWA that included its highest funding level to date, expanding protections to ensure that they reach the most vulnerable communities. These funds will continue to strengthen the public health response for domestic violence survivors and their children, expand access to medical forensic examinations, and increase support for culturally specific resources in marginalized communities. Additionally, Tribal courts now have jurisdiction over non-Native perpetrators of sexual assault, child abuse, stalking, sex trafficking, and assaults on Tribal lands. And we are making sure that VAWA programs are implemented in rural communities across the Nation.
We all have a sacred duty to ensure that no one experiences abuse. That is why my Administration is taking important steps to prevent domestic violence and protect survivors and their families. We released the first-ever National Plan to End Gender-Based Violence, which laid out a Government-wide approach to prevent and address all forms of gender-based violence, including intimate partner violence, sexual violence, and stalking. Knowing that domestic violence and gun violence are deeply interconnected, my Administration established the first-ever White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention, which is overseen by the Vice President, who has spent her career combatting crimes against women and children. And I signed the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act—the most significant gun safety law in decades—which is helping to keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers and felons. Last year, the Department of Justice's Office on Violence Against Women awarded over $600 million in grants to address gender-based violence, and through the American Rescue Plan, we have directed an additional $1 billion in funding for rape crisis centers, culturally specific community support organizations, and other domestic violence and sexual assault services.
We are also taking action to combat the growing threat of cybercrimes and online harassment. We are increasing access to services and support for survivors of technology-facilitated gender-based violence and ensuring that law enforcement is better equipped to prevent, enforce, and prosecute cybercrimes, including technology abuse by an intimate partner. Furthermore, the Vice President and I worked together to create a Federal task
force that helped launch the first 24/7 national helpline for survivors of image-based abuse. We are also directing Federal agencies to address sexual violence and sexual harassment in the workplace and in schools, and I have spearheaded historic military justice reforms to protect survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault, and other forms of gender-based violence in our military.
I remain proud of the progress that has been made in recent decades to combat domestic violence and violence in all forms, but I know that there is more work to be done to ensure that every American is safe. During National Domestic Violence Awareness and Prevention Month and every month, we must lend our unwavering support to survivors and continue to call upon our fellow Americans to treat everyone with dignity and respect. If you or someone you know is in need of support, immediate and confidential help is available 24/7 through the National Domestic Violence Hotline by visiting thehotline.org, calling 1-800-799-7233 (TTY 1-800-787-3224), or texting “START” to 88788.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2024 as National Domestic Violence Awareness and Prevention Month. I call upon our country to change the social norms that tolerate domestic violence, provide meaningful support to survivors, and express gratitude to those working diligently on prevention and response efforts. Together, we can transform the country and build a Nation where all people live free from violence.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# National Youth Justice Action Month, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
America's young people are part of the most gifted and talented generation in our history—and, like anyone, they deserve second chances. During National Youth Justice Action Month, we recommit to ensuring that our communities are safe and supportive so that young people thrive. And we recommit to developing a juvenile justice system that reflects our Nation's most fundamental values of equality, fairness, and opportunity.
Between 2000 and 2022, the number of young people in our juvenile justice system has declined significantly, but young people of color and young people with disabilities are still disproportionally represented. Additionally, young people who enter juvenile justice facilities often lack the support, resources, educational opportunities, and guidance necessary for meaningful rehabilitation and, as a result, are not set up for success once
they leave. The young people in the juvenile justice system often spend years in unsafe environments, without treatment for trauma or mental health conditions.
My Administration remains committed to improving our youth justice system so that young people who are released are set up for success. My Administration has made historic investments in our youth justice system. For youth facing juvenile and criminal justice system involvement, we are investing in evidence-based diversion programs. And we are expanding access to lawyers who will advocate for and advise these youth. For those who are exiting the system, we are investing in programs that help youth find housing, educational opportunities, mentorship, job training, and other services as they return to their communities.
We are also ensuring that young people have good schools to attend, safe communities to live in, and exciting opportunities for their futures. My Administration launched the National Partnership for Student Success, which will bring together 250,000 tutors and mentors for our students. And we secured $1.3 billion to fund afterschool and summer learning programs for K-12 students. To support our Nation's youth we increased investments in Full-Service Community Schools fivefold, including providing $253 million to create over 2,000 new full-service community schools in the country, providing critical supports to serve more than one million students' physical, mental health, and academic needs.
We are also making it easier for youth to receive mental health care. When we passed the Nation's first major gun safety law in nearly three decades, we secured funding to increase the number and diversity of school psychologists and mental health counselors available to our children and made it easier for schools to use Medicaid to deliver these services. We also launched 988, the National Suicide and Crisis Lifeline. By texting or calling 988, young people can connect with trained crisis counselors 24 hours a day, 7 days a week—and for those who need it, the Lifeline now supports unprecedented access to American Sign Language interpreters. And we have invested in building mobile crisis response teams so that people in crisis can be connected with trained mental health professionals right away.
During National Youth Justice Action Month, we recommit to doing all that we can to ensure that all of our young people can lead full lives. We show our gratitude to all those supporting youth, both in and out of the juvenile justice system, as they work to build lives full of purpose and meaning. And we strengthen our resolve to ensure that our juvenile justice system reflects America's promise of liberty and justice for all.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2024 as National Youth Justice Action Month. I call upon all Americans to observe this month by taking action to support our youth and by participating in appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs in their communities.

# National Youth Substance Use Prevention Month, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
America's young people are the future of our Nation. Each of them deserves the opportunity to thrive and reach their full potential. This National Youth Substance Use Prevention Month, we recommit to providing all youth with the resources and support they need to lead healthy lives and achieve their dreams.
Addressing the opioid and overdose epidemic is a key priority of my Unity Agenda. Preventing substance use before it starts is a crucial part of a comprehensive approach to addressing the overdose crisis.
That is why, as President, I am taking bold action to help schools, families, and communities to prevent youth substance use and improve the well-being of our Nation's youth. Through the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, my Administration made the largest investment in youth mental health ever, including $1 billion of funding to train and hire new school based mental health professionals across the country. We are supporting substance use prevention training for school administrators and counselors and improving mental health and substance use screening tools so students can get the health services they need. We have also made it easier for schools to leverage Medicaid to deliver mental health and substance use care to millions of children and youth. And we are engaging youth as partners to develop and strengthen community strategies for youth to better educate and support their peers, working toward our shared goal of getting ahead of substance use before it starts.
Over the past 3 years, we have made historic investments in strengthening local youth prevention and public awareness campaigns across the country. Through our Drug-Free Communities Support Program, we are implementing prevention efforts in all 50 States, significantly reducing youth substance use in these communities. Further, my Administration launched a social media campaign to educate youth on the dangers of fentanyl and the life-saving effects of opioid overdose reversal medications. We also used this prevention content to prepare classroom resources for middle and high school students. Together, we are emboldening our Nation's youth with the knowledge and tools they need to make informed and empowered decisions.
We are also taking aggressive action to reduce the supply of illicit drugs before they hit our streets. Under my leadership, Federal law enforcement is keeping more deadly drugs out of our communities than ever before by stopping illicit fentanyl at ports of entry, prosecuting thousands of drug traffickers, sanctioning individuals and organizations involved in the global
illicit drug trade, and engaging globally to disrupt drug trafficking organizations.
We have made immense progress in preventing the use and misuse of substances and preventing youth from developing substance use disorders. We are mobilizing communities to take action and stay informed, providing historic amounts of funding to prevent substance use and overdose, and focusing on what works—evidence-based policies, strategies, and programs. Together with youth, parents, mentors, and leaders from all sectors of communities around our great Nation, we are working to ensure every young person is nurtured in a safe, supportive, thriving environment. But to improve the lives of youth impacted by substance use and honor all the young lives tragically lost to an overdose, we can and must do more. This month, we recommit to fulfilling our Nation's duty to leave no one behind and extend support to those who need it. America's youth deserve nothing less than our unwavering commitment to their well-being.
If you are struggling with substance use or just need someone to talk to, speak to a loved one or health care provider, contact the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's National Helpline at 1-800-662-HELP or visit FindSupport.gov. If you or someone you love is experiencing a mental health or substance use crisis, you can call or text 988, or visit 988lifeline.org for free, confidential crisis support.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2024 as National Youth Substance Use Prevention Month. Let us all take action to implement practice- and evidence-based prevention strategies and improve the health of our Nation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# National Manufacturing Day, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
American workers and the unions who fight for them represent the best of our country. They help power our economy and strengthen our middle class. On National Manufacturing Day, we celebrate the ingenuity, grit, drive, and determination of the American worker. We thank them for their contributions, and we recommit to investing in their productivity and success.
There have always been competing visions for the future of America. Some envision a future in which the failed trickle-down policies that hurt working families for more than 40 years are continued. When I think about our
future, I see an America where we grow the economy from the middle out and the bottom up—not the top down. I see an America where working people finally have a fair shot. Above all, I see a future that is made right here in America.
That is why my Administration has invested in American manufacturing to restore the backbone of our Nation: the middle class. Together, we are doing what has always worked best in this country—investing in all of America and in all Americans. My Investing in America agenda—including my Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, CHIPS and Science Act, and Inflation Reduction Act—is revitalizing American manufacturing. So far, we have attracted over $910 billion in private sector investment in manufacturing and clean energy nationwide and seen spending on factory construction soar to new records, roughly triple the pre-pandemic average. These investments are helping create hundreds of thousands of jobs—including over 700,000 manufacturing jobs—building new semiconductor fabs, electric vehicle and battery factories, and so much more, here in America. And we are working with employers, unions, community colleges, high schools, and other partners to ensure American workers are trained for the good manufacturing jobs we are generating.
We have also made sure that Federal funds support American manufacturing. “Buy American” has been the law of the land since the 1930s. Past administrations said a lot but did not do a lot. On my watch, Federal projects have been made with American products and built by American workers. I fought for the passage of the “Build America, Buy America Act,” which established domestic content preferences in Federal infrastructure spending, as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. I signed the “Federal Research and Development in Support of Domestic Manufacturing and United States Jobs” Executive Order, directing Federal agencies to prioritize domestic manufacturing when it comes to research, development, innovation, and bringing inventions to market. My Administration also made the strongest changes to Buy American rules in nearly seven decades by increasing the domestic content threshold for Federal procurement from 55 percent to 65 percent in 2024. I also announced new requirements for lumber, glass, fiber optic cables, and other construction materials used in Federal infrastructure projects to be made in America. And we will keep working to ensure that American taxpayer dollars are invested in American workers.
Growing up in Scranton, Pennsylvania, I learned a basic value set—money does not determine your worth, and all anyone wants is a fair shot. When I look at the economy, I see it through the eyes of Scranton. That is why I came into office determined to write a new chapter in our American comeback story—one where we can take pride in knowing that we can still get big things done in this great Nation.
During National Manufacturing Day, may we rededicate ourselves to writing that story by making the phrase “Made in America” not just a slogan but a reality.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 4, 2024, as National Manufacturing Day. I thank our manufacturing workers for all that they do to strengthen our Nation, encourage all Americans to look for ways
to get involved in their communities, and call on everyone to join me in participating in National Manufacturing Day and, most importantly, buying American.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this third day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# Fire Prevention Week, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
In the face of incredibly dangerous fires, Americans have always met the moment—whether it is the first responders rushing in to keep everyone safe or the neighborhoods that come together to rebuild from the rubble. During Fire Prevention Week, we encourage all Americans to learn more about fire safety. We recommit to preventing fires before they occur and supporting families affected by fires. And we extend our gratitude to the firefighters and first responders whose extraordinary bravery saves lives.
As President, I have seen the devastating toll fires take on families across the country. I have met with families who lost their homes and small business owners who lost their livelihoods to fires. I have met with firefighters who saved lives while risking their own—some had fought massive wildfires when they had never been trained for that before. This year, more than 1,400 people, including 43 firefighters, lost their lives to fires. And thousands of acres of land have been burned by wildfires—in total, more acres have been burned than the size of some States.
With climate change, these fires will only get more ferocious, deadly, and costly. But my Administration is doing everything we can to fight the climate crisis and keep people safe. That is why I have made the most significant climate investment anywhere in the world. Through my Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we are investing billions of dollars to strengthen our early wildfire detection programs, prevent and mitigate drought, and—in the event of a wildfire—restore and rehabilitate ecosystems. At the same time, my Inflation Reduction Act is putting us on the path to cut America's carbon emissions in at least half by 2030 with historic investments in green manufacturing, clean energy, and climate-smart agriculture.
My Administration is also committed to ensuring firefighters have the resources and support they need to do their jobs safely and effectively. That is why, in my first months as President, I invested $350 billion from the American Rescue Plan to help States and cities keep first responders, including firefighters, on the job. The law also increased Federal firefighting grants by $300 million, paying for hundreds of emergency response vehicles, thousands of sets of turnout gear, critical cancer research, and more local firefighters in the field. The Department of Labor proposed a rule that would substantially update protections for emergency response workers, including firefighters, for the first time in more than four decades. Further,
I am proud to have increased the Federal firefighter minimum wage to $15 an hour—a first step toward giving firefighters the pay they deserve. And we have launched new programs to recruit, retain, and train Federal firefighters. I also signed the Fire Grants and Safety Act, directing millions of dollars to fire stations and communities across the country so they can prevent fires and mitigate the damage if they do occur.
We are also committed to advancing public safety and uplift Fire Prevention Week's theme of “Smoke alarms: Make them work for you!” Smoke alarms are essential to ensuring you and your family can leave home quickly in the event of a fire. Make sure to install smoke alarms in every bedroom, outside each sleeping area, and on every floor of the house. Once a month, remember to test your smoke alarm by pressing the test button. And replace smoke alarms either every 10 years or if they stop responding when tested.
The First Lady and I remain in awe of the heroism and courage of our firefighters and all the communities who have come together to rebuild in the wake of devastating fires—we truly are a good Nation because we are a good people. During Fire Prevention Week, we honor our first responders and firefighters for keeping us safe. We recommit to supporting all Americans rebuilding their lives after a fire. And we spread awareness about smoke alarms and fire safety.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 6 through October 12, 2024, as Fire Prevention Week. I call on all Americans to participate in this observance with appropriate programs and activities and by renewing their efforts to prevent fires and their tragic consequences.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourth day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# National Community Policing Week, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Every day that our police officers put on that shield and walk out the door, they put their lives at risk to ensure the rest of us are safe. During National Community Policing Week, we honor police officers' service and sacrifice, recommit to supporting them, and reaffirm that community policing practices that advance public trust are the gold standard for law enforcement.
In the first half of this year, according to preliminary data submitted to the FBI, the homicide rate continued to fall at record speed, declining by 22.7 percent, while the violent crime rate fell by 10.3 percent to its lowest level since 1969. These record decreases follow the historic declines in crime in
2023, including the largest-ever decrease in the homicide rate. The decreases are in no small part due to the hard work and courageous efforts of law enforcement across America.
As President, public safety and crime reduction are top priorities for my Administration and me. Since day one, my Administration has worked with law enforcement, mayors, and community leaders to do what we know works to keep people and communities safe. Through my American Rescue Plan, we made the largest Federal investment toward public safety in our Nation's history—delivering more than $15 billion in aid for local and State governments to keep law enforcement on the beat, retain and hire more police officers, pay overtime and bonuses, and expand benefits for disabled first responders. States, counties, and cities have already invested that funding to make their communities safer, and we added billions more in grants through the Department of Justice to help cities invest in law enforcement and community violence interruption programs.
I also know that being in law enforcement today is harder than ever—police are expected to respond to so many challenging situations, from drug overdoses and mental health crises to domestic violence, child abandonment, and more. That is why my Administration has invested in increasing the number of crisis responders who work alongside police officers to respond to non-violent crimes. We have made more investments in recruiting, retaining, and training officers. I have called for funding that would put 100,000 more officers on the street who are trained in community policing. Additionally, we need to invest more in technology and training to solve crimes faster and clear court backlogs, and we need more detectives to solve murders and more deputy United States Marshals to apprehend fugitives.
Police officers deal with unbelievable stress. Every time an officer responds to a call, executes a warrant, or conducts a traffic stop, there is a tremendous risk: the fear of ambush, the anxiety of not knowing what is behind that door, and the trauma of bearing witness to the most horrible tragedies imaginable. That is why I have been laser-focused on providing officers with the mental health and wellness resources they need and deserve. I also signed extended benefits for families of officers who have tragically died by suicide.
Our police officers are dedicated, honorable, and good people—they build trust with the communities they serve because they know that trust is the foundation of public safety. Our communities are safer and stronger when our officers have the resources, training, and tools they need to do their jobs and walk the beat, getting to know the neighborhoods and the people they serve. A lack of trust from the public means less public safety for all of us: crimes do not get reported, witnesses do not come forward and cases do not get solved, victims suffer while perpetrators roam free, and justice goes undelivered.
When communities trust the police, crimes get solved faster. That is why when Republicans blocked the passage of the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act of 2021, a bill that the Vice President coauthored while in the Senate, we took action. I signed a historic Executive Order to set the gold standard for law enforcement. In part, it requires Federal law enforcement agencies to develop best practices that attract, support, and retain officers who are representative of the communities they are sworn to serve. We
have also made historic investments in proven strategies to interrupt and prevent violence in the first place, including using trusted messengers who are trained to disrupt violence. At the same time, I signed the most significant gun safety law in nearly three decades and have taken more executive actions to stop the flow of illegal guns than any other administration in history.
There is more work to be done. My Safer America Plan calls on the Congress to invest $37 billion to support law enforcement and crime prevention. The plan would fund 100,000 additional police officers, invest $5 billion in community violence interventions, and enact commonsense gun safety reforms, such as a universal background check requirement and a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.
There is no greater responsibility than keeping our families, neighborhoods, and Nation safe. During National Community Policing Week, we reaffirm our commitment to choosing progress over politics when it comes to supporting our law enforcement and ensuring the safety of our communities. We honor the heroism, bravery, and sacrifice of our police officers. And may we recommit to upholding one of our Nation's most fundamental values: justice for all.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 6 through October 12, 2024, as National Community Policing Week. I call upon law enforcement agencies, elected officials, and all Americans to observe this week by recognizing ways to improve public safety, build trust, and strengthen community-police relationships.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourth day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# German-American Day, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
In 1683, 13 families left the only home they had ever known to flee religious persecution and start new lives in America, establishing the first German settlement just outside Philadelphia. On German-American Day, we celebrate the history, culture, and countless contributions of our Nation's 40 million German Americans.
The hard work, achievements, and sacrifices of German Americans have shaped the very idea of America. German-American immigrants established some of our Nation's earliest and most extensive newspapers, advancing the role of the free press in America. German-American scholars and writers, scientists and musicians, and leaders in every sector are the source of some of America's best ideas and most exciting possibilities. And today,
German Americans are not only a proud part of our country's character, but they also tie us closer to Germany and its people.
My Administration is committed to growing the friendship, allyship, and partnership between Germany and the United States. This month, I will be traveling to Germany to meet with their leaders and coordinate on shared priorities like securing democracy around the world, countering antisemitism and other forms of hatred, and advancing cooperation on economics, trade, and technology. We will also continue to stand together to support the brave people of Ukraine in their defense against Russian aggression.
Today, may we celebrate the culture and bonds German Americans have built over the hundreds of years they have called this country home. Together, may we recommit to fighting for a better future, full of new possibilities for our Nation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim October 6, 2024, as German-American Day. I urge all Americans to celebrate the rich and varied history of German Americans and remember the many contributions they have made to our Nation.

# Child Health Day, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Our Nation's children deserve every opportunity to reach their biggest dreams—that begins with ensuring our families and children have the resources and support they need to stay healthy and strong. On Child Health Day, we recommit to supporting families as they help their children to lead healthy lives.
When we came into office, Vice President Harris and I promised to give families some well-deserved breathing room so that families could care for their children without worrying about how they were going to pay the bills. That is why my American Rescue Plan expanded the Child Tax Credit, which reduced child poverty by nearly half across the Nation. That law also made our Nation's biggest investment in child care ever, keeping businesses open and hundreds of thousands of child care workers employed to care for children. To lower health insurance costs, I signed the Inflation Reduction Act, saving millions of families $800 per year on their health insurance premiums. And we strengthened the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program to provide home visits from trained professionals, who can offer prenatal care and postpartum support to new mothers and ensure their children's health and well-being needs are met.
We launched the National Maternal Mental Health Hotline at 1-833-TLC-MAMA to help better support pregnant and postpartum moms. We also modernized the Thrifty Food Plan for the first time in nearly five decades so that millions more families can afford nutritious foods. We are working to reduce the amount of sodium in food to help prevent children from experiencing high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke later in life. At the same time, we are working to secure free and healthy school meals for every child—beginning with setting a goal to deliver free school meals to nine million more children by 2032.
My Administration is also working to ensure our youth have access to the mental health care they need, making the largest investment in mental health ever. This includes over $2 billion in funding, including $1 billion through the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, to help schools across the country train and hire new mental health counselors. We made it easier for schools to leverage Medicaid to deliver health care, including mental health care, to millions of children and youth. And we launched 988, the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline, which anyone can call, text, or chat to be connected to a trained crisis counselor, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
Americans deserve to live in a safe community, free from the threat of violence—and when it comes to our Nation's children, one of our most fundamental responsibilities is keeping them safe. In the United States, firearms are the leading cause of death for children. It is unacceptable. Children are exposed to violence and worry about school shootings happening to them, and this exposure and fear can lead to negative consequences for their school life, mental health, and more. That is why I signed the most significant gun safety law in nearly 30 years and have announced dozens of gun safety executive actions, including one that will improve the active shooter drills that nearly all students undergo. I also established the first-ever White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention, overseen by Vice President Harris. We have made significant progress, but we must do more. I continue to call on the Congress to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, require safe storage of firearms, enact universal background checks, and end immunity for gun manufacturers.
Our Administration is also making historic investments to tackle the climate crisis, which is essential to protecting our children's futures. Every child should be able to turn on the faucet at home or school and have access to safe, clean water—that is why, through my Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we are working to replace every lead pipe in America. My Inflation Reduction Act—the most significant investment in climate ever—is investing in air quality sensors so that we prevent communities from experiencing the harmful effects of pollution. And we have recommitted to conserving 30 percent of all our Nation's lands and waters by 2030 so that generations to come may enjoy them.
Our children deserve to grow up in a country that cares about their health, happiness, and opportunities for success. During Child Health Day, may we recommit to supporting our children and families so that they can thrive. And may we continue to build a future where every child can reach their full potential.
The Congress, by a joint resolution approved May 18, 1928, as amended (36 U.S.C. 105), has called for the designation of the first Monday in October as Child Health Day and has requested that the President issue a proclamation in observance of this day.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim Monday, October 7, 2024, as Child Health Day. I call upon families, child health professionals, faith-based and community organizations, and governments to help ensure that America's children stay safe and healthy.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourth day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# Leif Erikson Day, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
On Leif Erikson Day, we celebrate the history and heritage of Nordic communities in the United States, whose contributions and cultures have helped shape our Nation.
Many believe that roughly a millennium ago, Leif Erikson—a Norse explorer—and his crew were the first Europeans to reach the shores of North America. His spirit of adventure, curiosity, and resilience would inspire generations of Danes, Finns, Icelanders, Norwegians, and Swedes to sail across an ocean and begin new lives in America. These immigrants built bustling homes and enriched their communities, supporting and realizing the American Dream. They fought for our freedoms in the military; built new churches, businesses, and schools; and spearheaded social movements. Today, Nordic communities continue to enrich the fabric of the Nation.
Nordic-American communities in the United States are foundational to our partnership and friendship with our Nordic Allies and their people. These nations share our vision for a world based on freedom, security, and opportunities for all. Together, we are working in lockstep to tackle the climate crisis and pioneer the next generation of technology that will power everyone's economies. We are also standing with the brave people of Ukraine as they defend themselves against Russia's brutal assault. I am proud that the United States supported the ratification process for Finland to join NATO, which was the fastest ratification in history. And I was honored to welcome Sweden as NATO's 32nd Ally earlier this year. Together, I know that we will continue to stand for freedom and democracy for generations to come.
Today, may we celebrate the important contributions and vibrant cultures of Nordic Americans to our Nation. And may we continue the work that
so many Nordic communities in this country began: ensuring every American has an opportunity to reach the American Dream.
To honor Leif Erikson, son of Iceland and grandson of Norway, and to celebrate Nordic-American heritage, the Congress, by joint resolution (Public Law 88-566) approved on September 2, 1964, has authorized the President of the United States to proclaim October 9 of each year as “Leif Erikson Day.”
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim October 9, 2024, as Leif Erikson Day. I call upon all Americans to celebrate the contributions of Nordic Americans to our Nation with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs.

# General Pulaski Memorial Day, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Today, we pay tribute to General Casimir Pulaski, a Polish immigrant who served alongside American soldiers in the Revolutionary War and made the ultimate sacrifice for our Nation. And we honor the culture and contributions of all our Nation's Polish Americans who follow his legacy, standing up for the cause of freedom at home and around the world.
General Pulaski dedicated his life to the pursuit of liberty—not just for himself or his country but for all of us. Born and raised in Warsaw, Poland, he fought against the Russian domination of Poland—efforts that ultimately led him to flee his home country. Later in life, when he was offered an opportunity to join another fight for liberty on the other side of the world, he took it—joining our Nation's fight for independence. General Pulaski's service was critical: He led a critical counterattack that helped slow the British, and during the course of the war, it was said that he even saved George Washington's life.
General Pulaski's story and service are just one example of how much Polish Americans have shaped our Nation's history and our future. Our country's Polish-American communities have helped create new possibilities for all of us—leading in every sector, powering our economy, and enriching our culture. They also strengthen our deep alliance and partnership with Poland and its people at a critical time in our history. Since Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine, the people of Poland have courageously stood up for freedom, liberty, and justice, rallying around the Ukrainian people and offering them safety and light in their darkest moments. At the same time, Poland has donated tanks, artillery, and aircraft to support Ukraine's self-defense all while becoming an important hub for aid from key partners.
No one knows better than the people of Poland that, in moments of great upheaval and uncertainty, what you stand for is important and who you stand with makes all the difference. Today, we celebrate General Casimir Pulaski, who decided to stand with our Nation to fight for our freedoms. And we honor all the Polish Americans, who continue to push our Nation forward and fight for a future based on our most fundamental values: dignity, liberty, and opportunity.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 11, 2024, as General Pulaski Memorial Day. I encourage all Americans to commemorate this occasion with appropriate programs and activities paying tribute to General Casimir Pulaski, honoring all those who champion freedom around the world, and celebrating the vast contributions of the Polish American communities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this tenth day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# International Day of the Girl, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Girls have the power to shake and shape our world. They will grow up to be doctors, CEOs, artists, entrepreneurs, tradeswomen, service members, scientists, or anything they put their minds to—leading our Nation to a bigger and brighter future. During International Day of the Girl, we honor the lives and contributions of girls worldwide, celebrate their limitless potential, and recommit to opening doors of opportunity so girls everywhere can realize their dreams.
Girls play an invaluable role in the success of our communities. When young women and girls are afforded the same opportunities as young men and boys, we are all better off. Economies grow, education rates and health outcomes improve, and political instability and violence decline. Yet, throughout the world, girls continue to face persecution, violence, and intimidation, and they are barred from fully participating in their communities—socially, educationally, economically, and politically.
That is why my Administration has taken steps to provide girls with the support they need to thrive, beginning in their homes and classrooms. My American Rescue Plan expanded the Child Tax Credit, which reduced child poverty to a historic low. The American Rescue Plan was also the largest one-time education investment ever in our Nation's history, bringing more teachers, counselors, social workers, after-school and summer programs, and tutoring to public schools across the country. My Administration continues to call on the Congress to restore the expanded Child Tax
Credit, guarantee affordable high quality child care from birth to kindergarten for 16 million children, and make universal, free preschool available to every four-year-old in America. These actions would lift girls across the country out of poverty and ensure they enter the classroom ready and excited to learn.
In addition, my Administration made it easier for schools to leverage Medicaid to deliver mental health services to their students. We invested over $1.5 billion to strengthen the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline, invest in school-based mental health services, and launched the National Mental Health Strategy, with ongoing investments to strengthen the mental health workforce, ensure mental health parity, and connect Americans to care. We remain dedicated to using every tool in our toolbox to empower girls both in and out of the classroom.
We also remain committed to ensuring that girls can live free from violence, fear, and abuse. Last month, we marked the 30th anniversary of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), a bill I authored more than three decades ago. Since then, every time we have reauthorized this law, we have strengthened it. For example, we broadened the law's protections to better address dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking. We expanded services for our Nation's most vulnerable populations and invested in prevention programs for young people. We provided more than $690 million in grants to over 40 VAWA-funded programs in States and Tribal communities nationwide. Through VAWA and other laws like the Victims of Crime Act and the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act, we are working every day to empower girls and end gender-based violence.
Furthermore, we are aggressively combating the harmful effects that social media can have on our children. My White House Task Force to Address Online Harassment and Abuse worked directly with parents and teens to develop ways for children to stay safe online and prevent the misuse of technology that harms girls. We are also tackling the next frontier of gender-based violence and abuse: deepfake images and videos generated by artificial intelligence. My Administration also restored and strengthened vital protections under Title IX to help keep students and employees safe from sexual assault and harassment on campus.
My Administration continues to stand with women and girls who are facing threats to their basic human rights in far too many conflicts around the world. We continue to condemn sexual violence committed by Russia's forces against women and girls in Ukraine, and we condemn the terrorist group Hamas' appalling, despicable acts of rape, mutilation, and other forms of sexual violence in Israel on October 7, 2023, and against hostages in captivity. In 2022, I signed a historic Presidential Memorandum to promote justice and accountability for acts of conflict-related sexual violence, and I have since announced dedicated sanctions and new initiatives to hold perpetrators accountable and support survivors. During this year's NATO Summit, we revised the Women, Peace, and Security Policy to address emerging security threats that put girls at risk, including the climate crisis and conflict-related sexual violence. And we are committed to eliminating child, early, and forced marriage and ending female genital mutilation and cutting, which have lifelong consequences on the health and well-being of victims, families, and communities.
Guided by the belief that our Nation and our world are at their best when there are endless possibilities for all women and girls, my Administration is devoted to helping girls reach their full potential. At the first Summit for Democracy, we established the Advancing Women's and Girls' Civic and Political Leadership Initiative to build and sustain girls' participation in political and civic engagement. And this year, my Administration launched Women Leading Effective and Accountable Democracy in collaboration with international allies to advance women and girls' leadership in democratic, peace, and security processes. And, thanks to the leadership of Vice President Harris, our Administration has galvanized more than $2.9 billion in investments to advance the economic status of women around the world, helping ensure girls will play a meaningful role in the industries of the future.
When First Lady Jill Biden spoke at the White House's first-ever celebration of Girls Leading Change last fall, she reminded the world about the power of girls. She said, “I hope you leave here knowing that your boldness is beautiful, that you belong in all places of power, that your future can be anything you want it to be, and that you will never be in this alone.” On this International Day of the Girl and every day, let us each commit to doing our part to create a brighter future worthy of the talents, aspirations, and dreams of all our girls. Because when girls do well, we all do well.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 11, 2024, as International Day of the Girl. I call upon the people of the United States to observe this day with programs, ceremonies, and policies that advance equity and opportunity for girls everywhere.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this tenth day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# National School Lunch Week, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
America's children deserve every opportunity to live fulfilling and healthy lives, and nutritious meals are key components in building those lives. During National School Lunch Week, we reaffirm that the health and well-being of our Nation's children are a national priority. We recommit to doing everything we can to end child hunger. And we celebrate school nutrition professionals, who do the critical work of planning, preparing, and serving nutritious school meals to more than 30 million students each day.
Healthy school lunches benefit our Nation's students and their families. Fueled by a good lunch, students can better focus in the classroom and be set up for success throughout the rest of their day. Free and reduced-price
school meals provide families with some breathing room. And for families that live in areas where there are no grocery stores with healthy food options nearby, school meals can be a lifeline—offering children reliable, nutritious meals.
My Administration is committed to putting a healthy school lunch within reach of all our Nation's children, no matter their family's income. That is why we are giving more schools the option to make free school meals available to every student, and we published a final rule updating nutrition standards for school meals to improve children's health. For the first time since 1975, we modernized the Thrifty Food Plan, making a healthy diet more affordable for the millions of families with Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits. These actions are a part of our national strategy to end hunger and reduce diet-related diseases by 2030. That plan includes the goal of expanding access to healthy, free school meals to nine million more kids—working toward a future where every kid has access to one. We also hosted the first White House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health in over 50 years. Since then, we have galvanized over $10 billion in external commitments dedicated to ending hunger and reducing diet-related diseases in children and families across the country. Furthermore, we are giving schools the resources they need to purchase food from local farmers and ranchers and cook meals from scratch—giving kids healthier options and powering our rural economy.
My Administration is taking steps to ensure our Nation's children and families do not go hungry and can afford healthy food. This year my Administration launched SUN Bucks—also referred to as Summer Electronic Benefits Transfer—to provide families with money to buy groceries when school is out, reaching an estimated 21 million children. My American Rescue Plan expanded the Child Tax Credit, slashing child poverty by nearly 50 percent and helping keep food on the table for millions of families during the pandemic. I continue to call on the Congress to restore the enhanced Child Tax Credit to ensure families have the money they need to feed and care for their kids.
During National School Lunch Week, we recognize how important school lunches are to kids and families alike and recommit to expanding access to healthy, free school meals to support the health of the next generation. And we thank all the school staff, school nutrition professionals, educators, and school leaders, whose tireless work nourishes the future leaders of our Nation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 13 through October 19, 2024, as National School Lunch Week. I call upon all Americans to recognize and commemorate all those who operate the National School Lunch Program with activities that raise awareness of the steadfast efforts in support of the health and well-being of our Nation's children.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eleventh day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

Proc. 10838

# Columbus Day, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Today, we celebrate the proud heritage of Italian Americans in our Nation, whose contributions and character have shaped our country's soul.
I believe we are the only Nation in the world with a heart and soul that draws from old and new. For some Italian-American families, the stories they share about their ancestors' lives in this country stretch back generations. They are stories about immigrants who left everything behind to sail across an ocean and chase the American Dream for the hope of a brighter future. They are stories about ancestors who helped build this country and found America's middle class—and their traditions and recipes still bring joy to their families today. They are stories of Italian-American artists, laborers, lawmakers, and leaders who never gave up on the idea of America. And for many Italian Americans, the story of Christopher Columbus' voyage crossing the Atlantic from the Spanish port of Palos de la Frontera on behalf of Queen Isabella I and King Ferdinand II remains a source of pride. But no matter if their families arrived here centuries ago or only recently, Italian Americans' courage, strength, and character are woven into the rich tapestry of our country.
For many Italian Americans, the lives of their ancestors in this country were not always easy. In addition to the challenges of starting life in a new land, they also faced discrimination. Columbus Day was founded by President Benjamin Harrison in 1892 in response to the horrific, xenophobic attack that took the lives of 11 Italian Americans the year before. In the face of hate, Italian Americans persisted—advancing our Nation and challenging us to live up to our highest values.
My Administration also recognizes that Italian Americans are a source of strength in our country's unshakeable alliance, strategic partnership, and deep friendship with Italy. The ties between our countries are founded on our shared values and principles: democracy, freedom, and respect for human rights. Both of our nations take pride in standing with the brave people of Ukraine as they defend themselves against Russia's illegal aggression.
Today, may we honor the history and heritage of Italian Americans and all that they have done to help realize the full promise of America for generations.
In commemoration of Christopher Columbus' historic voyage 532 years ago, the Congress, by joint resolution of April 30, 1934, and modified in 1968 (36 U.S.C. 107), as amended, has requested the President proclaim the second Monday of October of each year as “Columbus Day.”
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim October 14, 2024, as Columbus Day. I direct that the flag of the United States be displayed on all public buildings on the appointed day in honor of our diverse history and all who have contributed to shaping this Nation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eleventh day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.
Proclamation 10839 of October 11, 2024
Proc. 10839

# Indigenous Peoples' Day, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
On Indigenous Peoples' Day, we honor Indigenous peoples' strength, courage, and resilience. We celebrate the vast contributions of Indigenous communities to the world. And we recommit to respecting Tribal sovereignty and self-determination and working to usher in a new era of our Nation-to-Nation relationships.
The history of America's Indigenous peoples is marked by perseverance, survival, and a deep commitment to and pride in their heritage, right to self-governance, and ways of life. Since time immemorial, Indigenous peoples have built and sustained powerful Tribal Nations, cultivated rich cultures, and established vibrant communities. And their discoveries and knowledge still benefit us today. But because of our Nation's failed policies of the past, generations of Native peoples have faced cruelty, violence, and intimidation. They were forced to leave their homelands, prohibited from speaking their own languages and practicing their sacred traditions, and forced into assimilation. Indigenous lives were lost, livelihoods were ripped away, and communities were fundamentally altered. Despite the trauma and turmoil, Indigenous peoples have persisted and survived. Their stories are testaments to the bravery and resolve of generations to preserve their heritage, cultures, and identities for those to come after them.
Today, Indigenous peoples lead in every way, share their histories, and strengthen their communities. They are also stewarding lands and waters, growing our shared prosperity, and celebrating the good of our Nation while pushing us to tell the full truth of our history. Indigenous peoples have long served in the United States military, fighting for democracy. And Indigenous communities continue to be an integral part of the fabric of the United States, contributing so much to our shared prosperity.
I remain committed to writing a new and better chapter in our history. To make this new era of self-determination a reality, we must honor the solemn promises the United States made to fulfill our trust and treaty obligations to Tribal Nations and work together to rebuild Tribal economies and institutions.
From day one, I have worked to include Indigenous voices at the table in all we do. I have appointed Native Americans to lead across the Federal Government, including the Secretary of the Interior, Deb Haaland—America's first Native American Cabinet secretary—and so many others serving in key roles in my Administration. I was proud to re-establish the White
House Council on Native American Affairs to help coordinate policy. Together, we have taken historic steps to improve the consultation process between Federal agencies and Tribal Nations.
I also believe that Tribal Nations know best what is right for their communities, and they do better when they make their own decisions. That is why I signed an Executive Order to respect the Nation-to-Nation relationship by ensuring Federal agencies respect the autonomy of tribes, cutting red tape so Tribal leaders can deliver for their communities. At the same time, we are strengthening the Buy Indian Act so that Federal agencies get more goods and services from Native-owned businesses. These initiatives will help grow Tribal economies while respecting Tribal sovereignty and Tribal Nations' right to build a future on their own terms.
Since I came into office, the Federal Government has made record investments in Tribal Nations. My American Rescue Plan—the largest direct Federal investment in Tribal Nations ever—helped provide COVID-19 vaccinations to Tribal communities and got our economy going again. My Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is the single biggest investment in Tribal roads, bridges, water, high-speed internet, electricity, irrigation, environmental cleanup, and more. My Inflation Reduction Act is the biggest investment in fighting climate change ever, anywhere in the history of the world. It is helping Tribal communities lead in the transition to clean energy and mitigate the impact of droughts, wildfires, and rising sea levels that threaten Native lives and precious homelands. My Administration has also provided increased resources to fight the opioid epidemic and expand access to crisis care in Tribal communities. Given that Native American women are two times more likely to die of pregnancy-related causes than White women, my Administration has taken significant steps to improve maternal health. And my Administration also secured the first-ever advance funding for the Indian Health Service so hospitals can plan ahead, order supplies, and hire doctors.
When my Administration reauthorized the Violence Against Women Act in 2022, we included historic provisions to reaffirm Tribal sovereignty and expand Tribal jurisdiction in cases where outside perpetrators harm members of their Nation. And recognizing the ties of Indigenous peoples across North America, I supported a Trilateral Working Group with Canada and Mexico to ensure Indigenous women and girls in all three countries can live free from violence.
My Administration is also preserving important ancestral Tribal lands and waters. I have protected and conserved more than 42 million acres of our Nation's lands and waters. I established, expanded, or restored 11 national monuments—including Bears Ears National Monument, Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, Avi Kwa Ame National Monument, Baaj Nwaavjo I'tah Kukveni-Ancestral Footprints of the Grand Canyon National Monument, Berryessa Snow Mountain National Monument, and others containing sites considered sacred to Tribal Nations. We are advancing the proposed Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary, which stretches along 116 miles of California coastline and has been home to coastal, ocean-going Tribal Nations and Indigenous peoples for tens of thousands of years. My Administration has also signed over 190 co-stewardship or co-management agreements with Tribes, and we are working to sign more.
On Indigenous Peoples' Day, we recognize that it is hard work to heal the wrongs of the past and to change course and move forward, but together, nothing is beyond our capacity. May we take pride in the progress we have made to establish a new era of Tribal sovereignty and Indigenous self-determination—one grounded in dignity, respect, and friendship.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 14, 2024, as Indigenous Peoples' Day. I call upon the people of the United States to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities. I also direct that the flag of the United States be displayed on all public buildings on the appointed day in honor of our diverse history and the Indigenous peoples who contribute to shaping this Nation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eleventh day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# Blind Americans Equality Day, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
This Blind Americans Equality Day, we honor the immense contributions of blind and low vision Americans, who help power our economy and push our Nation forward. And we recommit to ensuring every blind and low vision person in this country has a fair shot at the American Dream.
Throughout my decades in public service, I have strived to build an America that works for all Americans. It is why I was proud to co-sponsor the landmark Americans with Disabilities Act—a civil rights law that banned discrimination against people with disabilities in many areas of public life. I remain proud of its lasting legacy today. However, there is still more to do to ensure that blind and low vision Americans have the resources and opportunities they need to thrive. From transportation to online job applications, public services are too often designed in ways that are inaccessible for people with disabilities. And less than half of blind or low vision Americans are employed.
My Administration is committed to ensuring blind and low vision Americans have equal opportunities. To that end, I signed an Executive Order to prioritize diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in the Federal Government and to identify the barriers faced by job applicants and employees with disabilities. We are also requiring Federal agencies to prioritize website accessibility so the Government can truly deliver for all Americans. These are important steps toward making the Federal Government the gold standard for fair, accessible, and decent practices in the workplace. Furthermore, my Administration is ensuring that blind and low vision Americans hired by the Federal Government are paid a fair wage. That is why
we ended the use of unfair sub-minimum wages in Federal contracts. At the same time, we are working to increase hiring for people with disabilities in every sector by helping governments, businesses, and nonprofits access Federal funds to hire more disabled Americans.
I am also working to make public spaces more accessible for blind and low vision Americans. Through my Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we are investing $1.75 billion—the largest amount ever—in making transit and rail stations more accessible. The General Services Administration also adopted the United States Access Board's new guidelines to ensure people with disabilities have access to the over 300,000 Federal Government buildings. And the National Institutes of Health designated people with disabilities as a population with health disparities, opening up new research opportunities that will focus on health issues and unmet needs for blind and low vision Americans.
This Blind Americans Equality Day, may we recommit to advancing accessibility and opportunities for blind and low vision Americans, who do so much for our Nation and deserve every opportunity to thrive.
By joint resolution approved on October 6, 1964 (Public Law 88-628, as amended), the Congress authorized October 15 of each year as “White Cane Safety Day,” which is recognized today as “Blind Americans Equality Day,” to honor the contributions of blind and low vision Americans.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 15, 2024, as Blind Americans Equality Day. I call upon all the people of the United States—including all government officials, educators, and volunteers—to mark this day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eleventh day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# Minority Enterprise Development Week, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Our Nation's minority-owned businesses are the glue of our communities and the engines of our economies. Investing in them is key to growing our economy from the middle out and bottom up, not the top down. When minority-owned businesses do well, everyone does well. More people get jobs, first-time business owners build generational wealth, our economy grows, and more Americans feel a sense of pride and hope in all that is possible in our Nation. This Minority Enterprise Development Week, may we celebrate the talent and ingenuity of the innovators and entrepreneurs who run
our Nation's minority-owned businesses. And may we recommit to ensuring that minority-owned businesses have access to the resources they need to thrive.
Minority-owned businesses add incredible value to our economy, generating nearly $2 trillion in revenue each year. These businesses not only provide the goods and services we need but are also sources of hope—helping people realize their American Dream, building generational wealth, and uplifting their families and communities. That is why my Administration is ensuring that minority-owned businesses have access to capital and can grow. The Small Business Administration (SBA) is lending tens of billions of dollars to small businesses that would otherwise struggle to access capital. For example, since 2020, the rate of SBA-backed loans increased by about 40 percent for Asian American-owned businesses, tripled for Black-owned businesses, and more than doubled for Latino-owned businesses. Further, my American Rescue Plan helped minority-owned small businesses keep their doors open during the COVID-19 pandemic and represents the largest-ever dedicated Federal investment to connect minority-owned small businesses to support. That law invested $10 billion to launch and expand programs that provide critical access to capital for small businesses. The American Rescue Plan also invested $500 million to fund over 100 awards for organizations working to connect entrepreneurs to resources to help their small businesses recover and thrive through initiatives like the SBA's Community Navigators Program, the Department of the Treasury's Small Business Opportunity Program, and the Minority Business Development Agency's Capital Readiness Program.
My Administration has also been working to ensure that minority-owned businesses get a fair shot at success. That is why I signed an Executive Order that would increase the share of total Federal contracts going to disadvantaged businesses from 10 percent to 15 percent by 2025—and in the last 3 years, we have spent over $208 billion on small disadvantaged businesses. My Bipartisan Infrastructure Law expanded and made permanent the Minority Business Development Agency, ensuring that minority-owned businesses have access to the resources and support they need to thrive. And with my Inflation Reduction Act and CHIPS and Science Act, we are working to make sure that minority-owned businesses are benefiting from the billions of dollars we are investing in America's infrastructure, manufacturing, and clean energy industries here at home. In addition, Vice President Harris launched the Economic Opportunity Coalition in 2022 to provide tens of billions of dollars in investments to underserved communities.
Since Vice President Harris and I entered office, our Administration has created 16 million jobs, and American entrepreneurs have filed nearly 20 million new business applications. Wages are growing faster than prices. Unemployment remains low. Black- and Latino-owned businesses are being created faster today than they have been in years and Federal contracts with Native American-owned companies increased by over $8 billion from 2020 to 2023. I also take pride in my Administration's investments in Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Hispanic-Serving Institutions, Tribal Colleges and Universities, and Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander-Serving Institutions—all of which are helping launch the next generation of innovators, entrepreneurs, and business owners. These investments will ensure that their graduates will have every opportunity to lead the industries of the future and build generational wealth.
Across America—from small towns to big cities—we are seeing thousands of stories of revival, renewal, optimism, and pride. And each new business that is created is an act of hope, not just for the business owner but for the entire community. During Minority Enterprise Development Week, may we celebrate all the minority-owned businesses making our economy stronger, our Nation more competitive, and our communities more hopeful. And may we recommit to supporting their success and longevity.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 20 through October 26, 2024, as Minority Enterprise Development Week. I call upon the people of the United States to acknowledge and celebrate the achievements and contributions of minority business owners and enterprises and commit to promoting systemic economic equality.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighteenth day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# National Character Counts Week, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
In the Oval Office, I sit surrounded by portraits of exceptional American Presidents and busts of inspiring American leaders. They remind me each and every day that we are a Nation of dreamers and doers, of promise and possibilities, and of ordinary Americans doing extraordinary things. Above all, we are a Nation of good people, who show our kindness and character through small acts every single day. This National Character Counts Week, we celebrate the core values of decency, honesty, dignity, and equality that have long defined the character of America.
Our Nation is strong, and our future is bright—in large part because of the upstanding character that resides within all Americans. I have witnessed it up close in educators like the First Lady, who inspire our Nation's youth to reach for every possibility; mothers, fathers, and parental figures who raise their children with care, courage, and grit; first responders, who run toward danger to protect others; union workers, who are building America; and brave service members, who stand on the frontlines of freedom to defend our democracy. Across the country, American workers are writing the greatest comeback story we have ever known—restoring pride in our hometowns, pride in America, and pride in knowing we can get big things done when we work together.
Since I came into office, my Administration has taken large strides toward building an America that lives up to those values. The American Rescue Plan helped keep child care programs open, families in their homes, and
small businesses on their feet. We set a record for Federal contract spending on small businesses. Our historic investments across the clean energy economy are helping to combat climate change and create good-paying jobs. Through the American Rescue Plan and Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, we have made significant investments in reducing crime, preventing gun violence, and saving lives, and last year, we saw one of the lowest rates of violent crime in more than 50 years. We are also ensuring that America is a Nation where everyone is respected and where we give hate no safe harbor. That is why I signed the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, making it easier to report hate crimes, and hosted the United We Stand Summit to counter the corrosive effects of hate-fueled violence. My Administration continues to work to counter antisemitism, Islamophobia, and hate in all its forms and ensure that everyone is treated with dignity and respect.
Under my Unity Agenda, we are tackling the opioid epidemic and mental health crisis, holding Big Tech accountable, supporting our veterans and their families, and ending cancer as we know it. We are investing more than $1 billion to help schools across the country train and hire new mental health counselors through the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, we have granted new disability benefits to over one million veterans and their families under the PACT Act, and we launched the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health to fast-track progress on how we prevent, detect, and treat cancer and other diseases.
My father taught me that our character is not measured by how many times or how hard we get knocked down but by how quickly we get back up. Even in the face of challenges ahead and obstacles in our way, Americans always get back up. It is what drives our great country forward and what makes our Nation strong. This week and every week, let us recommit to upholding our most essential values and remember that the sacred task of perfecting our Union is not just about any one of us but about “We the People.”
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 20 through October 26, 2024, as National Character Counts Week. Now and throughout the year, I encourage all Americans to engage in efforts that honor and express the best attributes of our character, extend a hand of fellowship to their neighbors, and unite in service to their communities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighteenth day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# National Forest Products Week, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Our forests are central to our country's heritage, history, and economy. Forests support livelihoods across Tribal Nations, rural towns, and big cities—from foresters and loggers to mill workers and carpenters—while also sustaining the health of our environment and our communities. During National Forest Products Week, we recognize that conserving our bountiful forests is critical to sustaining our economy and ensuring that Americans can enjoy the wonder of our forests for generations to come.
As a Nation, we rely on our forests for so much—from cleaning the air we breathe and the water we drink to providing the lumber and paper we use every day. But the existential threat of climate change endangers our forests, putting those jobs, livelihoods, and critical products at risk. After decades of fire suppression and ignoring climate change, wildfire seasons have become wildfire years, burning down communities, destroying forest ecosystems, and upending people's lives.
My first year in office, I launched the “America the Beautiful” initiative to conserve at least 30 percent of all our Nation's lands and waters by 2030 through local, voluntary efforts across the country while empowering foresters and farmers to advance sustainable practices to keep working lands productive. These efforts will help strengthen our economy and pass on a healthier planet to our children and grandchildren.
When I came into office, I was determined to conserve our forests while protecting the people who rely on them for jobs. My Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is creating jobs managing our forests, restoring ecosystems, and preventing catastrophic fires. It is investing in the removal of overgrown vegetation near homes and power lines, preparing evacuation routes in areas at risk of wildfires, removing invasive plant species from forests that can cause fire to spread, and planting native tree species that are more resilient to the changing climate. And my Inflation Reduction Act made the largest climate investment ever, putting people to work planting trees, sustainably managing our forests, and working on fire prevention. Together, these actions are producing new jobs that help us care for our forests and keep all of us safe from wildfires.
At the same time, my Administration is working to support the American workers and rural communities producing our forest products. We have awarded millions of dollars in grants to American businesses that support forest conservation, expand the sustainable use of American wood products, and find innovative ways to use our wood waste materials, including to build strong and sustainable buildings. I also take pride in having raised the Federal firefighter minimum wage to $15 per hour—an important first step in ensuring the people who run into flames to keep all of us safe are paid what they deserve.
Conserving our forests is good for our economy, the planet, and the soul of our Nation. This week, may we recommit to responsibly stewarding our
forests and the abundant resources they provide so that we may all enjoy their benefits and beauty for years to come.
To recognize the importance of the many products generated by our Nation's forests, the Congress, by Public Law 86-753 (36 U.S.C. 123), as amended, has designated the week beginning on the third Sunday in October of each year as “National Forest Products Week” and has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this week.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 20 through October 26, 2024, as National Forest Products Week. I call upon the people of the United States to join me in this observance and in recognizing all Americans who are responsible for the stewardship of our Nation's beautiful forested landscapes.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighteenth day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# United Nations Day, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Nearly 80 years ago, our forebearers gathered for the first United Nations General Assembly. With the horrors of World War II weighing on their hearts and the hopes of humanity resting on their shoulders, they opened the General Assembly by declaring, “The whole world now waits upon our decisions . . . looking to us to show ourselves capable of mastering our problems.” Today, we reflect on the history of this storied institution. And together, we recommit to sustaining and strengthening it to master the challenges of our time.
Under my Administration, the United States has been a leader at the United Nations—rallying global action to advance democratic values, safeguard human rights, and address the issues our world faces. That includes standing against Russia's brutal aggression against Ukraine and Hamas' despicable terrorist attack on Israel. At the United Nations, we have been working to secure a ceasefire in Gaza, with the release of hostages, and we have been pushing to expand humanitarian access and assistance. The United States has also played a key role in helping bring security to the people of Haiti and addressing the conflict and dire humanitarian situation in Sudan, where millions are displaced and facing famine.
But we know people need more than the absence of war. They need the chance to live with dignity. They need to be protected from the ravages of climate change, hunger, and disease. That is why my Administration has
invested over $150 billion to accelerate progress on the Sustainable Development Goals, including ending poverty, eliminating hunger, promoting health and well-being, and promoting gender equality. We also forged a historic consensus on the first-ever General Assembly Resolution on Artificial Intelligence to help people everywhere seize the potential—and minimize the risks—of this technology.
As we look ahead, countries need to work together to continue reforming the United Nations to be more effective. The United States will keep pushing for a stronger, more inclusive United Nations, including a reformed and expanded United Nations Security Council. And the Security Council, like the United Nations itself, needs to focus on making peace, brokering deals to end wars and suffering, stopping the spread of the most dangerous weapons, and stabilizing troubled regions.
Finally, the United Nations' work is carried out by brave and committed United Nations humanitarian workers, development professionals, peacekeepers, and members of special political missions. And every day, they risk their own lives to save the lives of others, undertaking often dangerous work. Like nations around the world, the United States honors their sacrifices and those of their families.
Today and every day, let us remember that the forces holding us together are stronger than those pulling us apart. Let us continue to work together to unleash the power of humanity and give people the opportunity to live freely, think freely, breathe freely, and love freely. And in the face of difficult challenges, let us prove that we are capable of building a better world together.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 24, 2024, as United Nations Day. I urge the governors of the United States and its territories, and the officials of all other areas under the flag of the United States, to observe United Nations Day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-third day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# National First Responders Day, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
On National First Responders Day, we recognize and celebrate all the brave first responders across our country who risk their lives to keep the rest of us safe.
Our first responders represent the best of who we are as a people. They are the police officers and sheriff's deputies who answer our calls, ready to help, no matter the situation. They are the firefighters running toward the flames to protect our communities. They are emergency medical technicians, paramedics, 911 dispatchers, 988 crisis responders, and all the medical professionals providing emergency care, who sacrifice so much to be there for us when a crisis hits. Our first responders are everyday heroes, and we are so grateful for their service. In the wake of Hurricane Milton and Hurricane Helene, we witnessed the courage and bravery of our first responders firsthand and just how much they sacrifice to keep the rest of us safe, including the brave search and rescue teams who have saved thousands of lives in the aftermath of the storms.
My Administration is committed to supporting our first responders and ensuring they have access to the resources they need to thrive. During the COVID-19 pandemic, I signed the American Rescue Plan to keep first responders on the job, which provided billions of dollars to help cities, States, and Tribal Nations retain and hire more law enforcement officers, firefighters, and emergency health providers and pay their bonuses and overtime. I also signed the Protecting America's First Responders Act, which expanded death, disability, and education benefits for first responders killed or permanently disabled in the line of duty and their families. My Administration is also making sure that firefighters are getting the health care they need by launching the National Firefighter Registry for Cancer—our Nation's largest effort to reduce the risk of cancer among firefighters—providing access to job-related disability benefits for firefighters diagnosed with certain kinds of cancer or lung disease, and protecting firefighters from toxic PFAS chemicals in their gear and equipment.
My Administration is working to make our communities safer and more resilient while keeping our first responders safe. I signed the most significant gun safety law in nearly 30 years while also strengthening background checks for gun purchasers and cracking down on illegal gun sales and ghost guns. And my Investing in America agenda included funding to make our communities more resilient to natural disasters.
This month, Vice President Harris and I visited North Carolina and Florida in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton. Lives were lost. Entire neighborhoods had been turned into debris. Portions of entire cities were underwater. But our first responders stepped up in this time of need, picking up the pieces and acting as a source of strength for everyone else. Today, may we honor the critical role first responders play in our lives—showing up in our darkest times to provide hope, light, and care.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 28, 2024, as National First Responders Day. I call upon all the people of the United States to observe this day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities to honor our brave first responders and to pay tribute to those who have lost their lives in the line of duty.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fifth day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience Month, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
From the energy that powers our homes to the networks that connect us and the systems that protect our health and safety, our critical infrastructure keeps our economy thriving and our communities secure. This Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience Month, we recommit to strengthening our country's critical infrastructure and building an America that is safe and secure for generations to come.
This year, I signed a National Security Memorandum to secure and enhance the resilience of United States critical infrastructure—updating the policy for the first time in a decade. This represents the launch of a new era in protecting our infrastructure against all threats and hazards by safeguarding our strong and innovative economy and enhancing our collective resilience to disasters before they happen. But there is more to do. Climate change is making natural disasters more frequent, ferocious, and costly—endangering our supply chains, creating more instability for our communities, and straining the critical infrastructure Americans depend on for their livelihoods. And we need to stay vigilant against adversaries that seek to maliciously target our critical infrastructure, including through cyberattacks.
To meet this moment, my Administration made a once-in-a-generation investment in our Nation's infrastructure—creating an opportunity to build in resilience to all hazards upfront and by design. Through my American Rescue Plan, Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, Inflation Reduction Act, and CHIPS and Science Act, we are investing billions of dollars to secure and bolster our infrastructure. That includes improving our electric grid so that people can maintain power in any situation, elevating roads and bridges over possible flood zones, funding community resilience programs, and more. These investments have not only helped to protect Americans—they have benefited our economy, creating jobs and new possibilities for our communities. At the NATO summit this year, I announced an arrangement with Canada and Finland to collaborate on the production of polar icebreakers. The partnership will advance United States economic and national security interests by strengthening our shipbuilding and industrial capacity while simultaneously opening up new trade routes and pushing back against foreign aggression and bolstering our international alliances. This year, I also announced a United States Port Security Initiative to reverse our dependence on foreign manufactured port equipment.
Ensuring our Nation is resilient in the face of threats also means working with other nations around the globe to build better, stronger, and more sustainable infrastructure. At the G7 Summit in June, I was proud to announce
the historic progress we have made with our Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment. This initiative will strengthen United States national and economic security for Americans at home and enable sustainable economic growth for partner countries. To date, we have mobilized $60 billion to create high-quality global infrastructure. That comes on top of our work with the European Union and African heads of state to develop the Lobito Corridor as well as our work with the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Zambia to expand regional and global trade markets through the Port of Lobito in Angola. We continue to pursue opportunities to expand our investments across Africa and around the world, including the Indo-Pacific, Central Asia, the Middle East, and the Western Hemisphere. Investments like these create more shared opportunities, prosperity, and security for everyone.
Across the Nation, America is writing the greatest comeback story we have ever known—people are putting shovels in the ground, founding new businesses, and creating hope for entire communities. It is more important now than ever before that we remain vigilant against any threats that seek to undermine our collective security and prosperity.
During Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience Month, we recommit to safeguarding and strengthening our Nation's critical infrastructure to save lives and allow our Nation to continue doing what it does best: creating new possibilities.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2024 as Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience Month. I call upon the people of the United States to recognize the importance of protecting our Nation's infrastructure and to observe this month with appropriate measures to enhance our national security and resilience.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# National Adoption Month, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Every child deserves to know the unconditional love of a permanent home. During National Adoption Month, we honor all the wonderful families that grow through adoption, we remind our foster youth and adoptees that we are right by their side, and we rededicate ourselves to ensuring that every child has the opportunity to reach their full potential.
More than 100,000 children are in our Nation's foster care system awaiting the adoption that could offer them familial love, a lasting home, and a stable foundation for them to grow. That is why I have called on the Congress to make the adoption tax credit fully refundable, lowering the cost of adoption and giving families and legal guardians some breathing room. I have also called on the Congress to provide housing vouchers to all 20,000 youth exiting foster care annually—a key step in helping them secure stable housing during this difficult transition. To further support kinship caregivers, the Department of Health and Human Services issued a final rule last year that requires States to provide them with the same level of financial support that other foster parents receive. My Administration is also working to eliminate barriers LGBTQI+ families face in the adoption process and ensure LGBTQI+ foster youth grow up in safe and loving environments. And through the expanded Military Parental Leave Program, we are giving service members more time to spend with their families after a child is born, adopted, or placed in their homes for long-term foster care.
My Administration also remains committed to supporting youth who are aging out of foster care. Since the beginning of my Administration, the Department of Housing and Urban Development has awarded over $60 million to provide over 4,000 vouchers to foster youth, helping them secure housing as they leave the foster care system. And my Administration is working to ensure these youth can keep their SNAP benefits without work reporting requirements, easing a difficult transition period. We have also been working to help foster youth stay in school and graduate, make the successful transition to postsecondary education, train for jobs, pay their bills, and get their lives off to a solid start.
During National Adoption Month, we celebrate the love shared by adoptive families and professionals across our country. And we honor the millions of adoptive and kinship families who have welcomed new family members into their loving homes.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2024 as National Adoption Month. I encourage all Americans to honor this month by helping the children and youth in their communities secure their forever homes and find the love and connection that they need to thrive.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# National Alzheimer's Disease Awareness Month, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Too many Americans know the pain of losing a loved one to Alzheimer's—a leading cause of death in older adults. During National Alzheimer's Disease Awareness Month, we honor the courage and resilience of all those facing this devastating disease. We recommit to supporting every caregiver who pours their heart into helping people with Alzheimer's face this disease with dignity. And we strengthen our resolve to do everything we can to prevent, treat, and eliminate Alzheimer's as we know it.
Currently, over six million Americans have Alzheimer's disease, which robs people of their memories, clarity, and identity—taking a difficult emotional, financial, and physical toll on people facing the disease and the loved ones standing by their side. Alzheimer's also disproportionately impacts African Americans and Latino Americans, who are more likely to develop dementias than people of any other race or ethnicity. People with Down syndrome also have a higher risk of developing Alzheimer's.
My Administration has taken steps to drive new breakthroughs toward preventing, detecting, and treating Alzheimer's. I secured $4 billion for the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health, directing funding to researchers and innovators who are pioneering new techniques and technologies to transform the lives of people with Alzheimer's and improve human health outcomes. I was also proud to sign the reauthorization of the National Alzheimer's Project Act and the Alzheimer's Accountability and Investment Act, ensuring the Federal Government is doubling down on our commitment to address Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. The National Institutes of Health is funding new clinical trials that are doing cutting-edge work to improve the lives of people with Alzheimer's—from pursuing new drugs that could prevent and treat dementia to improving cognition and memory for those who have it.
My Administration is committed to supporting the caregivers who care for people with Alzheimer's. I signed the Executive Order on Increasing Access to High-Quality Care and Supporting Caregivers—the most comprehensive set of executive actions any President has ever taken to improve care for hardworking families while supporting care workers and family caregivers. In response, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) launched the GUIDE Model, which offers a package of respite services, caregiver support and education, and care management and coordination for people living with Alzheimer's and related dementias. CMS is also continuing to increase access to cognitive care assessments so more people with Alzheimer's get the resources and care they need. And the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is working to increase access to early detection, prevention, and treatment of dementias like Alzheimer's.
During National Alzheimer's Disease Awareness Month, we recommit to improving the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease. We honor all the lives we have lost and all those we can still save. And we uplift the spirit of hope that countless medical professionals, researchers, and caregivers working to help people with Alzheimer's carry each day.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2024 as National Alzheimer's Disease Awareness Month. I call on the people of the United States of America to honor and support those living with Alzheimer's and the many people who continue extraordinary and tireless efforts to combat this disorder and care for those affected by it. I encourage all Americans to visit Alzheimers.gov for evidence-based resources and information.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# National Diabetes Month, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Over 38 million Americans, or 1 in every 10 people, have diabetes. During National Diabetes Month, we raise awareness about this chronic condition and promote the strategies that can prevent and manage it. We recommit to making treatment more affordable and accessible. And we strengthen our resolve to find cures.
Diabetes takes a physical and financial toll on Americans nationwide, and many Americans must decide between paying for treatments and putting food on the table. Insulin—a life-saving drug for some people with diabetes—can cost Americans upwards of $300, even though it costs drug companies as little as $10 per vial to make. Some Americans end up rationing their medication, which can have serious effects on their health and well-being. While Big Pharma makes record profits, Americans pay exorbitant prices—higher than anywhere else in the world. It is unacceptable. No one should have to lie awake at night wondering if they can afford their medical bills or their insulin prescription.
Since I came into office, I have worked to ensure that health care is a right in this country, not a privilege—and that meant lowering the cost of insulin. That is why my Administration took on Big Pharma and won. I signed the Inflation Reduction Act, which capped the cost of insulin at $35 for people on Medicare. And the largest manufacturer of insulin in the United States answered my call to lower the cost to $35 per month for everyone. My Inflation Reduction Act also empowered Medicare to negotiate lower drug prices, lowering the costs of medications used to treat common diseases, including drugs that treat diabetes. Further, that law requires drug companies that raise prices faster than inflation to pay Medicare back the difference, saving seniors up to $618 per dose of medication. Moreover, beginning in 2025, the Inflation Reduction Act will cap total out-of-pocket drug costs at $2,000 per year for people on Medicare. There is still more
to do, but this will help ensure Americans—including those with diabetes—have the dignity, security, and peace of mind they deserve.
My Administration is also working to drive new breakthroughs in preventing, detecting, and treating diabetes while ensuring that Americans have the resources they need to lead healthy lifestyles. I secured $4 billion for the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health to make strides in transforming the prevention, detection, and treatment of deadly diseases like diabetes. We have seen enormous research advances in recent years to develop promising new diabetes drugs, including the first cell therapy for adults with Type 1 diabetes and the first new oral medication for children with Type 2 diabetes in decades. At the same time, we recognize that the impact of Type 2 diabetes can be greatly decreased through improvements in nutrition and physical activity. My Administration announced new standards for school meals to improve their nutritional value and give schools the option to require locally produced, unprocessed menu ingredients. We also held the first White House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health in over 50 years, bringing together advocates, health care providers, food companies, and officials from every level of government. As a part of that conference, we launched the White House Challenge to End Hunger and Build Healthy Communities. In total, we have secured more than $10 billion in bold, new commitments from the public and private sectors to end hunger and reduce diet-related diseases like diabetes.
My Administration also recognizes that tens of millions of Americans have prediabetes and are at risk of developing Type 2 diabetes within 5 years. Diabetes increases one's risk of heart attack, cancer, stroke, blindness, kidney failure, and the loss of toes, feet, or legs. Many of these cases are preventable, and the risk factors are often related to poor nutrition and inadequate physical activity. To learn more about the risks and how to address prediabetes and help prevent Type 2 diabetes, visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Diabetes Prevention Program: cdc.gov/diabetes-prevention.
During National Diabetes Month, we celebrate the resilience and courage of all those affected by diabetes. We thank the dedicated medical professionals, loved ones, and advocates who support this community. And we recommit to working around the clock to improve care for those affected and get us closer to finding cures.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2024 as National Diabetes Month. I call upon all Americans, school systems, government agencies, nonprofit organizations, health care providers, research institutions, and other interested groups to join in activities that raise diabetes awareness and help prevent, treat, and manage this disease.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# National Entrepreneurship Month, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Entrepreneurs embody the essence of America—their ideas and energy have always kept our country on the cutting edge, and their determination and drive uplift communities, create millions of jobs, and keep our Nation moving forward. This month, we celebrate their unstoppable spirit.
Supporting entrepreneurs, especially small business owners, has always been key in growing our economy from the middle out and bottom up, giving everyone a fair shot to get ahead. Many entrepreneurs are at the heart and soul of their communities, running the mom-and-pop shops that are the glue of our neighborhoods. But when Vice President Harris and I took office, hundreds of thousands of small businesses had been forced to close down due to the pandemic, and millions more were hanging by a thread. Not only were entrepreneurs' livelihoods on the line but also their life's savings and hopes of growing wealth for the next generation.
That is why Vice President Harris and I were committed to investing in America's entrepreneurs and innovators. My American Rescue Plan provided billions of dollars in capital and support to small businesses. My CHIPS and Science Act is investing more into research and manufacturing than ever before, building the high-tech industries of the future and the small-business supply chains to support them right here at home while helping them expand their businesses in high-growth, high-wage industries. And my Inflation Reduction Act is incentivizing manufacturers to help tackle the climate crisis using American suppliers while cutting down on entrepreneurs' overhead costs like health insurance and energy bills.
The Biden-Harris Administration is also committed to ensuring every small business and entrepreneur has a fair shot. This year, the Small Business Administration (SBA) provided a record $56 billion through more than 100,000 small business financings—the most in more than 15 years and a 50 percent increase over 2020. The Federal Government has invested tens of billions of dollars into small disadvantaged businesses. The SBA is lending tens of billions of dollars to small businesses that would otherwise struggle to access capital. Since 2020, the number of SBA-backed loans doubled for women-owned businesses, tripled for Black-owned businesses, more than doubled for Latino-owned businesses, and increased by about 70 percent for Asian American-owned businesses. And my Bipartisan Infrastructure Law also made the Minority Business Development Agency permanent to help close the gap for these and other entrepreneurs from underserved and underrepresented communities too long left behind.
Today, entrepreneurs across the country have filed nearly 20 million new business applications since Vice President Harris and I took office—each an act of hope and confidence in our economy. A record number of those businesses are being opened by Black, Latino, and women entrepreneurs. And 16 million new jobs have been created.
I have often said that America can be defined in one word: possibilities. That is what entrepreneurship is all about. During National Entrepreneurship Month, we honor every entrepreneur with a vision for something better and the grit to make it real, growing our economy and creating new possibilities for everyone.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2024 as National Entrepreneurship Month. I call upon all Americans to commemorate this month with appropriate programs and activities and to celebrate November 19, 2024, as National Entrepreneurs' Day.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# National Family Caregivers Month, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Family caregivers are the backbone of our Nation, making tremendous sacrifices to be there for the people who need and cherish them most. This month, we honor their selfless love and courage, and we recommit to getting them the support they deserve. They should know their country has their backs.
For far too long, the cost of care in this country has been too high. Today, millions of Americans are part of the so-called sandwich generation, caring for both young kids and aging parents at the same time. Too many families struggle to afford help, spending their own retirement savings to pay for the care of their loved ones or quitting their own jobs to stay home and provide it themselves. Most often, it is women who bear the brunt of care work. And the pay for professional care workers is far too low.
In the United States of America, no one should have to choose between caring for a parent who raised them, a child who depends on them, and a paycheck that they need. That is why I signed the American Rescue Plan, which made the biggest investment in child care ever. It delivered historic support to over 225,000 child care programs serving as many as 10 million children across the country, helping keep their doors open for millions of working families who rely on them. It expanded the Child Tax Credit, which helped cut the child poverty rate nearly in half. Overall, my Administration increased funding for child care by nearly 50 percent while helping States expand and strengthen programs that enable low-income families afford child care as well. We also required companies seeking significant Federal funding from our CHIPS and Science Act to submit a plan on how they will help employees access affordable child care.
We have finalized new rules that strengthen staffing standards in nursing homes to ensure residents can age with dignity. We have made sure that home care workers get a bigger share of Medicaid payments so more Americans can keep living in their own communities and homes. And we have worked to increase Medicare resources to promote equitable access to care and caregiver training.
But we have to do more to ease the load on America's 50 million unpaid family caregivers, who too often still shoulder the burden of care all alone. Through the American Rescue Plan, we devoted $145 million to the National Family Caregiver Support Program, which delivers counseling, training, and short-term relief to family caregivers and other informal care providers. Furthermore, my Administration released the first-ever National Strategy to Support Family Caregivers, which includes new initiatives that directly support family caregivers and strengthen existing programs. And I signed a historic Executive Order, representing the most comprehensive set of administrative actions ever to increase access to high-quality child care and long-term care and support for caregivers, including military and veteran caregivers. The Executive Order is working to make sure caregivers get the support they deserve while building the supply of high-quality care so families have options. My Administration is continuing to work toward lowering the cost of care across the country and providing stronger paid family and medical leave.
How we treat our young children, aging parents, and loved ones and how we value those who care for them are fundamental to who we are as a Nation. During National Family Caregivers Month, we pledge to get every family caregiver in this country the same kind of relief, respect, and support that they give so selflessly to others.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2024 as National Family Caregivers Month. I encourage all Americans to reach out to those who provide care for our Nation's family members, friends, and neighbors in need to recognize, honor, and thank them.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# National Lung Cancer Awareness Month, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Too many Americans know the pain of losing a loved one to lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer death in the United States. During National Lung Cancer Awareness Month, we honor all those living with lung cancer
and their loved ones. We thank the researchers searching for answers and the medical professionals who are working tirelessly to care for those with lung cancer, and we recommit to ending cancer as we know it.
Although scientists have made incredible breakthroughs that have improved prevention, detection, and treatment for cancer and saved lives, a lung cancer diagnosis can be terrifying. This year, nearly 250,000 Americans will be diagnosed with the disease. Treatment can be grueling. Medical bills can cause concerns for the whole family. And the flood of medical information directed toward patients and their caretakers can be overwhelming. Too often, people feel lost and left behind, especially those who are disproportionately impacted by lung cancer—such as Black men, rural residents, and women under 50 years old.
Cancer is personal to many families, including mine, so I made fighting cancer a top priority in my Administration. The First Lady and I began by reigniting the Biden Cancer Moonshot, aiming to cut the cancer death rate by at least 50 percent over the next 25 years. I also secured $4 billion in bipartisan funding and established the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health to support scientists, innovators, and public health professionals in driving innovation to prevent, detect, and treat cancer and other life-threatening diseases.
My Administration is also working around the clock to make cancer treatments more affordable and the treatment process more manageable for families. We have saved millions of families $800 per year on their health insurance premiums by strengthening Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act. Through my Inflation Reduction Act, we are capping total out-of-pocket prescription drug costs for Medicare beneficiaries at $2,000 per year, including for cancer drugs, which can cost many times that. And for the first time ever, families fighting cancer can access patient navigation services that are fully paid for through Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurance—helping guide families through the diagnosis and treatment process and offering them much-needed support.
My Administration is also committed to preventing cancer by tackling another driver of cancer deaths in this country: smoking. To ensure that Americans who want to quit have the support they need, the Department of Health and Human Services created a Framework to Support and Accelerate Smoking Cessation, setting goals and strategies to help our communities reduce smoking. And the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention launched a $15 million program that will help increase awareness about smoking and options for services to help people quit. For anyone looking to quit smoking, you can find resources at BeTobaccoFree.gov or smokefree.gov or by calling 877-44U-QUIT.
My Administration is expanding early detection and screening services because an early diagnosis of lung cancer can save lives. Together, Federal agencies, community health centers, and other partners are providing early detection knowledge and support services to underserved communities. I encourage all Americans to talk to their doctors about lung cancer symptoms.
During National Lung Cancer Awareness Month, we strengthen our commitment to standing by all those facing lung cancer and their families, and
we ensure they have access to the care they need. We also rededicate ourselves to spreading awareness about lung cancer and working to end cancer as we know it, in order to save more lives.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2024 as National Lung Cancer Awareness Month. I call upon the people of the United States to speak with their doctors and health care providers to learn more about lung cancer. I encourage citizens, government agencies, private businesses, nonprofit organizations, the media, and other interested groups to increase awareness about what Americans can do to prevent, detect, and treat lung cancer.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# National Native American Heritage Month, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
During National Native American Heritage Month, we honor the history, rich cultures, and vast contributions of Native peoples. We celebrate the hundreds of Tribal Nations that are ushering in a new era in our Nation-to-Nation relationships. And we recommit to respecting Tribal sovereignty and self-determination and working in partnership with Tribal Nations to bring new prosperity and security to Native peoples.
Indigenous peoples' history in the United States is defined by strength, survival, and a deep commitment to and pride in their heritage, right to self-governance, and ways of life. Native peoples have built and sustained powerful Tribal Nations, and the knowledge they developed still benefits us today. However, our Nation's failed policies of the past subjected generations of Native peoples to cruelty, violence, and intimidation. The forced removal of Native peoples from their homes and ancestral homelands; attempts to assimilate entire generations; and stripping of Indigenous peoples of their identities, cultures, and traditions are some of the darkest chapters of our Nation's history. The trauma and turmoil fundamentally altered their communities. As the first President to visit Indian Country in 10 years, I delivered a national apology for the unspeakable harms caused to Native peoples at Federal Indian Boarding Schools.
Indigenous peoples have persisted and survived—a testament to their resilience and resolve. Today, Native communities are leading the way forward and continuing to strengthen the fabric of the United States. They have long served in the United States military and currently serve in the highest levels of government—including the Secretary of the Interior, Deb Haaland,
America's first Native American Cabinet secretary. In every field and sector, Native peoples are pushing for progress and contributing to our shared prosperity.
Since I came into office, the Federal Government has made record investments in Tribal Nations. Federal contracts with Native American-owned companies increased by over $8 billion from 2020 to 2023. My American Rescue Plan made the largest direct Federal investment in Tribal Nations ever, helping vaccinate Tribal communities during the COVID-19 pandemic and keeping the economy going. My Bipartisan Infrastructure Law made the single biggest investment in Tribal roads, bridges, water, high-speed internet, electricity, irrigation, environmental cleanup, and so much more. My Inflation Reduction Act made the biggest investment in fighting climate change ever—including funding to help Tribal communities lead in the just transition to clean energy and ease the impact of droughts, wildfires, and rising sea levels, which threaten Native lives and precious homelands.
My Administration is also working to ensure that Native communities are safe and secure and have the resources they need to thrive. I signed an Executive Order that improves the Federal response to the epidemic of missing and murdered Indigenous peoples. When we reauthorized the Violence Against Women Act in 2022, we included historic provisions to reaffirm Tribal sovereignty and expand Tribal jurisdiction in cases where outside perpetrators harm members of their Nation. And for the first time ever, my Administration also secured advance funding for the Indian Health Service so hospitals can plan ahead, order supplies, and hire doctors. We have provided historic funding to Tribal communities to help fight the behavioral health crisis and taken significant steps to improve maternal health for Native American women, who are twice as likely to die from pregnancy-related complications as white women.
I have always believed that we must know the good, the bad, and the truth of who we are as a Nation—we must acknowledge our history so that we can begin to remember and heal. That is why I became the first President to issue a formal apology for the Federal Indian Boarding School era, one of the most horrific chapters in our Nation's history. For 150 years, the Federal Government mandated the removal of Native children from their families and Tribes—and as a result, generations of Native children had their childhoods stolen and whole Tribal cultures were erased. I am proud to formally end the silence surrounding this shameful era and I remain proud that my Administration defended the Indian Child Welfare Act in court, ensuring that our Nation respects Tribal sovereignty and protects Native children by helping Native families stay together and grow up with their languages and cultures. And we are working to support Native American families and communities as they heal from the Federal Indian Boarding School era through the Department of the Interior's Road to Healing initiative and by supporting Native language preservation and public safety initiatives.
My Administration has also worked with Tribal Nations to preserve, protect, and steward important ancestral Tribal lands and waters. Through more than 200 co-stewardship and co-management agreements signed under my leadership, we are working side by side with Tribes to make decisions about how to manage the lands that are most precious to them. And
to date, I have protected and conserved more than 45 million acres of our Nation's lands and waters. That includes the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary, vast offshore waters off California's coast and the first sanctuary to be proposed by Indigenous communities. I have also established, expanded, and restored 11 national monuments, many containing sites considered sacred to Tribal Nations—from Bears Ears National Monument, Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, and Avi Kwa Ame National Monument to Baaj Nwaavjo I'tah Kukveni-Ancestral Footprints of the Grand Canyon National Monument, Berryessa Snow Mountain National Monument, and others.
During National Native American Heritage Month, we honor the heritage and contributions of Native peoples, and we work tirelessly to build a future grounded in dignity, respect, and partnership. We remain committed to working with Native communities to write a new and better chapter in American history for Tribal Nations—one that honors the solemn promise the United States made to Tribal Nations, fulfills our Federal trust and treaty obligations, and works together to rebuild Tribal economies and institutions.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2024 as National Native American Heritage Month. I urge all Americans, as well as their elected representatives at the Federal, State, and local levels, to observe this month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities. Also, I urge all Americans to celebrate November 29, 2024, as Native American Heritage Day.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# National Veterans and Military Families Month, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Each veteran and military family represents a link in a chain of honor that stretches back to our founding days, unwavering in their devotion to their loved ones who served in uniform. This month, we honor all of our military and veteran families. They too serve and sacrifice to answer our Nation's call to duty. We owe them a debt of gratitude we can never fully repay.
I often say that, as a Nation, we have many obligations, but only one is truly sacred: to prepare and equip those we send into harm's way and to care for them and their families when they come home.
We are continually working to make sure that our Nation's veterans and service members have access to the benefits and care they deserve. I have signed more than 34 bipartisan bills to better support our service members, veterans and their families, caregivers, and survivors. One of those bills, the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act, was the most significant expansion of benefits and services for toxic-exposed veterans and survivors in nearly 30 years. To date, more than 1.1 million veterans and over 11,000 survivors are now receiving new service-connected disability benefits, and over 796,000 veterans have newly enrolled in Veterans Affairs health care since the law was enacted. This law is helping families who lost loved ones to toxic illness gain access to critical resources and services, including monthly benefits, educational assistance, home loans, and more. Actions outlined in our national strategy to prevent military and veteran suicide are tackling the root causes of the military and veteran suicide crisis, including by better supporting families through the Governor's Challenge to Prevent Suicide Among Service Members, Veterans, and their Families. And we are making progress in eliminating homelessness and improving financial security for veteran and military families. Too often, veteran and military families become the targets of bad actors and scam artists. My Administration's Veteran Service Member Family Fraud Evasion initiative is providing easy, one stop access to resources to report fraud and get help from the Federal Government to combat scams. Additionally, I signed an Executive Order that implemented historic, bipartisan military justice reforms to transform how the military handles sexual assault and domestic violence cases. And I directed the Department of Defense to review pay and benefits for our service members—an important step toward ensuring their compensation reflects their service and sacrifice.
Military-connected families sacrifice for our country, answering the call to duty over and over again. Many military and veteran spouses, caregivers, and survivors struggle to achieve their desired career goals due to unique challenges military-connected families face. This is why I signed an Executive Order that takes the most comprehensive set of administrative actions in history to support the economic security of military families and veterans' spouses, caregivers, and survivors. I encouraged Federal agencies to do more to retain military spouses through flexible policies, ensuring they have access to stable jobs throughout their careers. Last year, I signed an Executive Order that directed more than 50 actions to improve the care economy, which included critical actions to better support military and veteran caregivers and expand access to military child care. These orders build on the efforts taken by my Administration to improve the quality of life for military families, including initiatives to ease military moves, afford housing, and find child care. Joining Forces, the First Lady's initiative, is working to better support military and veteran families—doing everything from making school transitions easier for military children to expanding economic opportunities for military spouses and caregivers.
This is personal for my family and for me. We know the pride of seeing your child wear the uniform of the United States. We know the pain of long deployments far from home. We know what it is like to pray for the safe return of someone you love. This month, may we show our immense gratitude for our military and veteran families, whose courage and dedication represent the best of who we are as a Nation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2024 as National Veterans and Military Families Month. I call upon the people of the United States to honor veterans and military families with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

Proc. 10855

# Veterans Day, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Today, we honor generations of America's veterans—patriots who have stood on the frontlines of freedom and kept the light of liberty shining bright around the world. Just as they have kept the ultimate faith in our Nation, we must keep ultimate faith in them.
Each one of our Nation's veterans is a link in a chain of honor that stretches back to our founding days—bound by a sacred oath to support and defend the United States of America. Throughout history, whenever and wherever the forces of darkness have sought to extinguish the flame of freedom, America's veterans have been fighting to keep it burning bright. I remember so clearly the pride the First Lady and I felt in our son Beau during his service in Iraq. He—like all our veterans from Belleau Wood, Baghdad, and Gettysburg to Guadalcanal, Korea, and Kandahar and beyond—lived, served, and sacrificed by a creed of duty. We owe them a debt of gratitude we can never fully repay, not just for fighting for our democracy, but for giving back to our communities and inspiring the next generation to serve, even after they hang up their uniforms.
As a Nation, we have one truly sacred obligation: to prepare and equip those we send into harm's way and to care for them and their families when they return home. Since I came into office, I have signed more than 34 bipartisan laws to support our veterans and their families, caregivers, and survivors. That includes the landmark Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act, which enacted the most significant expansion of benefits and services for veterans exposed to toxins in more than 30 years. Today, more than 1.1 million veterans and 11,000 survivors of deceased veterans are now receiving new service-connected disability benefits, and over 5.8 million veterans have been screened for toxic exposure—a critical step to ensuring they get access to the care they need. And as of last March, any exposed veteran who served during any conflict outlined in the PACT Act will be able to
enroll in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care. My Administration is ensuring that women veterans enrolled in the Department of Veterans Affairs health care have equitable access to benefits and health services. My Administration has worked to reduce barriers and reach out to veterans to make sure they can access their earned benefits. As a result, the VA is delivering more benefits to more veterans than ever before. In 2024, the VA processed more claims than ever and is providing record level health care services. We have taken steps to eliminate barriers and disparities for all veterans, including people of color, LGBTQI+ people, and women. We have made progress in addressing veteran homelessness, and we are working to end the silent scourge of suicide by addressing financial and legal risk factors, promoting secure storage of firearms, and expanding access to mental health services. Last year, the VA housed nearly 48,000 veterans, expanded access to health care and legal assistance for homeless veterans, and helped more than 158,000 veterans and their families keep their homes. And we are committed to assisting the roughly 200,000 service members who transition from the military each year with finding good-paying jobs, including by connecting them to Registered Apprenticeship programs. My Administration has also prioritized supporting veteran entrepreneurship. This year, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses secured almost $32 billion in Federal contracts, nearly $4 billion more than in the prior year.
While our veterans are the steel spine of this Nation, their families are the courageous heart—they also serve and sacrifice so much for our country. Last year, I signed an Executive Order calling for the most comprehensive set of administrative actions in our Nation's history to support the economic security of military and veteran spouses, caregivers, and survivors. The Executive Order increases training and employment opportunities for military spouses in the workforce and encourages Federal agencies to do more to retain military and veteran spouses through flexible policies. Additionally, through the First Lady's Joining Forces initiative, my Administration is working to better support military and veteran families on everything from making school transitions easier for military children to expanding economic opportunities and improving well-being for military spouses, caregivers, and survivors.
Earlier this year, I had the opportunity to visit Normandy to mark the 80th anniversary of D-Day alongside so many World War II veterans. Their service and sacrifice helped free the world from tyranny. We learned then what we still know now: Democracy is never guaranteed. Every generation must preserve it, defend it, and fight for it. Today, we honor all our veterans, who have preserved, defended, and fought for our democracy. They prove that we are a Nation that can meet darkness with light again and again, no matter how high the cost or how heavy the burden. May we all strive to be worthy of their sacrifices for us, doing our part to keep the light of liberty burning bright for generations to come.
In respect and recognition of the contributions our veterans and their families, caregivers, and survivors have made to the cause of peace and freedom around the world, the Congress has provided (5 U.S.C. 6103(a)) that November 11 of each year shall be set aside as a legal public holiday to honor our Nation's veterans.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim November 11, 2024, as Veterans Day. I encourage all Americans to recognize the valor, courage, and sacrifice of these patriots through appropriate ceremonies and private prayers and by observing two minutes of silence for our Nation's veterans. I also call upon Federal, State, and local officials to display the flag of the United States of America and to participate in patriotic activities in their communities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixth day of November, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

Proc. 10856

# World Freedom Day, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Today marks 35 years since the Berlin Wall came down. Its fall was one of the greatest advances in human dignity in my lifetime. As we celebrate this anniversary, may we all remember that what brought the Berlin Wall down and lifted the Iron Curtain is what keeps the flame of liberty shining bright around the world: the determination of free people everywhere who never fail to stand up for their freedoms and their democracy.
I still remember when, as a young Senator, I visited West Berlin and saw what it meant to live in a divided city, country, and continent. Then, in 1989, along with millions of people around the world, I watched the 70,000 brave souls gathered in Leipzig, Germany, crying out for freedom. After the wall came down, some feared the reunification of Germany would revive old hatreds and rivalries, but leaders of America and Germany dreamed together of a much better future. The achievement of a Germany whole and free lives on, exceeding everyone's expectations, and the dream of Europe whole and free remains the work of our time. My Administration is committed to pushing back against Putin's vicious attack on Ukraine. It is another battle in the long struggle for freedom and against aggression and tyranny.
Together with our partners and allies, the United States is continuing to fight for the freedom and rights of people around the world. We are working to build a future where women and girls share equal rights and opportunities in their communities; where Indigenous groups, people with disabilities, and racial, ethnic, and religious minorities live free from discrimination; and where LGBTQI+ people can live lives free from fear and hate. And we must all stay committed to supporting democracy around the world—and at home. I call on the American people to stand up in defense of our democracy because every generation must do the work of defending, protecting, and safeguarding it.
The future will be won by those who unleash the full potential of their people to breathe and think freely, innovate and educate daringly, and live
and love openly and without fear. That is the soul of democracy—and I have seen it all around the world, from the brave men and women who brought down the Berlin Wall to the people who are fighting in every region for freedom, justice, and dignity. Today, may we strengthen our commitment to our democracy and to one another, knowing that the darkness that drives autocracy is no match for the flame of liberty that lights the souls of free people everywhere.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 9, 2024, as World Freedom Day. I call upon the people of the United States of America to remember the hope symbolized by the fall of the Berlin Wall and reaffirm our dedication to freedom and democracy.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of November, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

Proc. 10857

# To Facilitate Positive Adjustment to Competition From Imports of Fine Denier Polyester Staple FiberBy the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
1. On August 26, 2024, the United States International Trade Commission (USITC) transmitted to the President a report (USITC Report) on its investigation under section 202 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the “Trade Act”) (19 U.S.C. 2252), with respect to imports of fine denier polyester staple fiber (fine denier PSF). The product subject to the USITC's investigation and determination excluded certain fine denier PSF described in the USITC's Notice of Institution, 89
FR
18435 (March 13, 2024), and listed in subdivision (c)(ii) of Note 32 in the Annex to this proclamation.
2. The USITC reached an affirmative determination under section 202(b) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2252(b)) that fine denier PSF is being imported into the United States in such increased quantities as to be a substantial cause of serious injury to the domestic industry producing an article like or directly competitive with the imported article.
3. Pursuant to section 301(a) of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement Implementation Act (the “USMCA Implementation Act”) (19 U.S.C. 4551(a)), the USITC made findings as to whether imports of Canada and Mexico, considered individually, account for a substantial share of total imports and contribute importantly to the serious injury caused by imports. The USITC made negative findings of substantial share and contribution to injury with respect to imports of fine denier PSF from Canada and Mexico, considered individually.
4. Pursuant to statutes implementing certain free trade agreements to which the United States is a party, the USITC further found that imports of fine denier PSF that are a product of Australia, each Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement country (
i.e.,
Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua) (CAFTA-DR countries), Colombia, Jordan, the Republic of Korea, Panama, Peru, and Singapore, individually, are not a substantial cause of serious injury or threat thereof.
5. Furthermore, pursuant to section 403 of the Trade and Tariff Act of 1984 (Public Law 98-573, 98 Stat. 2948, 3016 (1984)) (19 U.S.C. 2112 note), the USITC found that the serious injury substantially caused by imports to the domestic industry producing a like or directly competitive article does not result from the reduction or elimination of any duty provided for under the United States-Israel Free Trade Agreement. The USITC also found, pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 2703(e), that the serious injury substantially caused by imports to the domestic industry producing a like or directly competitive article does not result from duty-free treatment provided for under the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (CBERA) provisions of the Caribbean Basin Initiative trade program or the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program.
6. The USITC Commissioners transmitted to the President their individual recommendations that each of them considered would address the serious injury to the domestic industry and be most effective in facilitating the efforts of the domestic industry to make a positive adjustment to import competition.
7. On September 10, 2024, the United States Trade Representative (USTR) requested additional information from the USITC under section 203(a)(5) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253(a)(5)). On October 10, 2024, the USITC provided a response that identified unforeseen developments that led to the importation of fine denier PSF into the United States in such increased quantities as to be a substantial cause of serious injury (USITC Supplemental Report). The USITC Supplemental Report also reported, inter alia, that increased imports of fine denier PSF products of all countries other than Australia, Canada, the CAFTA-DR countries, Colombia, Israel, Jordan, the Republic of Korea, Mexico, Panama, Peru, and Singapore are a substantial cause of serious injury to the domestic industry.
8. Pursuant to section 203 of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253), and after taking into account the considerations specified in section 203(a)(2) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253(a)(2)), the USITC Report, and the USITC Supplemental Report, I have determined to implement action of a type described in section 203(a)(3) (19 U.S.C. 2253(a)(3)) (safeguard measure), with regard to the following fine denier PSF: fine denier PSF, not carded or combed, measuring less than 3.3 decitex (3 denier) in diameter, whether coated or uncoated. Fine denier PSF is classifiable in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) in subheading 5503.20.00 and described in statistical reporting number 5503.20.0025 or 9813.00.0520.
9. Pursuant to section 203 of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253), the action I have determined to take shall be a safeguard measure in the form of a quantitative restriction on imports of fine denier PSF described in paragraph 8 of this proclamation, admitted temporarily free of duty under bond
and entered under subheading 5503.20.00 and described in statistical reporting number 5503.20.0025 or 9813.00.0520, imposed for a period of 4 years, with annual reductions in the within-quota quantities in the second, third, and fourth years. Admission of certain imported articles free of duty under bond is commonly known as a Temporary Importation under Bond (TIB). TIB entries are subject to the conditions appearing in Chapter 98, Subchapter XIII, of the HTS (19 U.S.C. 1202) as well as regulations promulgated by U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Department of the Treasury.
10. The quantitative restriction of TIB entries described in paragraph 9 of this proclamation shall be allocated among all countries except those countries the products of which are excluded from such quantitative restriction, pursuant to paragraphs 13 through 16 of this proclamation.
11. This safeguard measure shall apply to imports of all countries, except as provided in paragraphs 13 through 16 of this proclamation.
12. I have found, pursuant to section 203(e)(4) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253(e)(4)), that the most recent 3 years that are representative of imports of fine denier PSF and for which data are available are 2018 through 2020, because that period covers the 3 most recent years before the surge in imports, particularly under TIB entry, from 2021 to 2023. Setting a quantitative restriction of zero pounds for the first year of this action is consistent with this representative period because the USITC Report indicates that there were no imports of fine denier PSF under TIB entry during 2018 through 2020.
13. This safeguard measure shall not apply to imports of any product described in paragraph 8 of this proclamation of a developing country, as listed in subdivision (b)(iii) of Note 32 in the Annex to this proclamation, as long as such a country's share of total imports of the product, based on imports during a recent representative period, does not exceed 3 percent, provided that imports that are the product of all such countries with less than 3 percent import share collectively account for not more than 9 percent of total imports of the product. If I determine that a surge in imports of a product described in paragraph 8 of this proclamation of a developing country that is a World Trade Organization (WTO) Member results in imports of that product from that developing country exceeding either of the thresholds described in this paragraph, I may modify this action to apply to such product of such country.
14. Pursuant to section 302(a) of the USMCA Implementation Act (19 U.S.C. 4552(a)), I have determined after considering the USITC Report and the USITC Supplemental Report that imports of fine denier PSF that are the product of Canada and Mexico, considered individually, do not account for a substantial share of total imports and do not contribute importantly to the serious injury found by the USITC. Accordingly, pursuant to section 302(b) of the USMCA Implementation Act (19 U.S.C. 4552(b)), I have excluded fine denier PSF that is the product of Canada or Mexico from the action I am taking under section 203 of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253).
15. After considering the USITC Report and the USITC Supplemental Report, I have also made the following determinations with regard to fine denier PSF that is the product of the following trading partners:
(a) I have determined that imports of fine denier PSF that are the product of Australia are not a substantial cause of the serious injury found by the USITC, and I have therefore determined to exclude such imports that are the product of Australia from the action I am taking under section 203 of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253), pursuant to section 331(b) of the United States-Australia Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (Public Law 108-286, 118 Stat. 919, 949 (2004)) (19 U.S.C. 3805 note);
(b) In light of the USITC's finding that imports of fine denier PSF that are the product of each CAFTA-DR country individually are not a substantial cause of serious injury or threat thereof, I have determined to exclude such imports that are the product of each of the CAFTA-DR countries from the action I am taking under section 203 of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253), pursuant to section 331(b) of the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (the “CAFTA-DR Act”) (Public Law 109-53, 119 Stat. 462, 495 (2005)) (19 U.S.C. 4101(b));
(c) In light of the USITC's finding that imports of fine denier PSF that are the product of Colombia are not a substantial cause of serious injury or threat thereof, I have determined to exclude such imports that are the product of Colombia from the action I am taking under section 203 of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253), pursuant to section 331(b) of the United States-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement Implementation Act (Public Law 112-42, 125 Stat. 462, 493-94 (2011)) (19 U.S.C. 3805 note);
(d) In light of the USITC's finding that the serious injury substantially caused by imports to the domestic industry producing a like or directly competitive article does not result from the reduction or elimination of any duty provided for under the United States-Israel Free Trade Agreement, I have determined, as part of the action I am taking under section 203 of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253), not to suspend the reduction or elimination of any duty on imports of fine denier PSF that are the product of Israel, pursuant to section 403 of the Trade and Tariff Act of 1984 (19 U.S.C. 2112 note);
(e) In light of the USITC's finding that imports of fine denier PSF that are the product of Panama are not a substantial cause of serious injury or threat thereof, I have determined to exclude such imports that are the product of Panama from the action I am taking under section 203 of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253), pursuant to section 331(b) of the United States-Panama Trade Promotion Agreement Implementation Act (Public Law 112-43, 125 Stat. 497, 529 (2011)) (19 U.S.C. 3805 note);
(f) In light of the USITC's finding that imports of fine denier PSF that are the product of Peru are not a substantial cause of serious injury or threat thereof, I have determined to exclude such imports that are the product of Peru from the action I am taking under section 203 of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2553), pursuant to section 331(b) of the United States-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement Implementation Act (Public Law 110-138, 121 Stat. 1455, 1486 (2007)) (19 U.S.C. 3805 note);
(g) I have determined that imports of fine denier PSF that are the product of Singapore are not a substantial cause of the serious injury found by the USITC, and I have therefore determined to exclude such imports that are the product of Singapore from the action I am taking under section 203 of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253), pursuant to section 331(b) of the United
States-Singapore Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (Public Law 108-78, 117 Stat. 948, 970 (2003)) (19 U.S.C. 3805 note); and
(h) In light of the USITC's finding that the serious injury substantially caused by imports to the domestic industry producing a like or directly competitive article does not result from duty-free treatment provided for under the CBERA provisions of the Caribbean Basin Initiative trade program, I have determined, as part of the action I am taking under section 203 of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253), not to suspend duty-free treatment pursuant to subsection 1 of 19 U.S.C. 2703(e), with respect to imports of fine denier PSF that are the product of any CBERA beneficiary country or territory.
16. Although the USITC found that imports of fine denier PSF that are a product of the Republic of Korea are not a substantial cause of serious injury or threat thereof, I have determined to include imports of fine denier PSF that are the product of the Republic of Korea in the action I am taking under section 203 of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253). Specifically, consistent with the recommendations of certain USITC Commissioners, I have found that excluding imports of the Republic of Korea from the quantitative restriction could significantly undermine this action.
17. While the USITC recommended excluding Jordan from this action under the United States-Jordan Free Trade Area Implementation Act (Public Law 107-43, 115 Stat. 243 (2001)) (19 U.S.C. 2112 note), I have instead determined to exclude such imports that are the product of Jordan as imports of a developing country from the action I am taking, pursuant to paragraph 13 of this proclamation.
18. While the USITC Commissioners recommended that I impose a tariff-rate quota on fine denier PSF imports, I have determined not to do so. The USITC Report indicates that TIB entries of fine denier PSF contributed significantly to the serious injury to the domestic industry. In addition, such TIB entries are undermining the effectiveness of existing trade actions on fine denier PSF. Therefore, I have decided to tailor this safeguard remedy to TIB entries of fine denier PSF. Furthermore, I have determined not to impose a tariff-rate quota on imports of fine denier PSF in the interest of balancing the competing interests of domestic fine denier PSF manufacturers and the impact of the safeguard remedy on downstream United States producers, including manufacturers of textiles, defense products, and consumer products, that rely on fine denier PSF.
19. Pursuant to section 203(a)(1)(A) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253(a)(1)(A)), I have determined that this safeguard measure will facilitate efforts by the domestic industry to make a positive adjustment to import competition and provide greater economic and social benefits than costs. If I determine that further action is appropriate and feasible to facilitate efforts by the domestic industry to make a positive adjustment to import competition and provide greater economic and social benefits than costs, or if I determine that the conditions under section 204(b)(1) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2254(b)(1)) are met, I shall reduce, modify, or terminate the action established in this proclamation accordingly. In addition, if I determine within 30 days of the date of this proclamation, as a result of consultations between the United States and other WTO Members pursuant to Article 12.3 of the WTO Agreement on Safeguards, that it is necessary to reduce, modify, or terminate the safeguard measure, I shall proclaim the
corresponding reduction, modification, or termination of the safeguard measure within 40 days of the date of this proclamation.
20.

# America Recycles Day, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
On America Recycles Day, we recognize the important role recycling plays in helping secure a more sustainable and prosperous future for generations to come. We show our gratitude for all the people who work hard to make sure we limit our waste and responsibly steward our national resources. And we recommit to building a Nation where we address the existential risk of climate change and where everyone can enjoy the benefits of a greener world.
Producing and processing the materials we use every day cause more than a third of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to the threat of climate change. The health and well-being of too many people suffer due to the damaging effects of pollution and the toxins released when waste is landfilled, dumped, or incinerated. That is why it is so important to reduce waste and recycle. When we reduce waste, we conserve the energy and natural resources needed to make these materials. And when we recycle, we give these materials another life—reducing the need for more production. But recycling is still too difficult. Too many Americans are unsure of where and which materials can be recycled. And when materials do end up in recycling, municipalities struggle to find markets for them.
To make recycling easier and more efficient, my Bipartisan Infrastructure Law made the largest investment in recycling in nearly three decades. It has launched hundreds of new projects that are helping to support manufacturing, improve waste management, advance environmental justice, and educate people about recycling. My Administration also released the first comprehensive, Government-wide strategy to limit the harms of plastic pollution at production, processing, use, and disposal, and we announced a goal to end the use of single-use plastics in the Federal Government by 2035. We also crafted the first-ever National Strategy for Reducing Food Loss and Waste and Recycling Organics to coordinate agencies in recycling organic materials like food waste while cutting costs for families. At the same time, we have been pursuing the initiatives outlined in our National Recycling Strategy to improve our recycling and waste management systems, working to find ways to better collect recyclable products, reach markets for these materials, and develop new technologies that will protect public health and the environment. All this contributes to my Administration's ambitious work to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050—to that end, my Inflation Reduction Act made the largest investment in climate action in history.
We have made important progress toward building an economy that values recycling, but there is still more to do. Each of us can play a role in protecting our natural environment and addressing the existential risk of climate change by recycling—remember to dispose of waste in the proper bins whenever possible, reuse containers, compost food, and use products made with recycled materials. I call on manufacturers and corporations to ensure their products and materials are reusable and recyclable when possible and
limit the use of non-recyclable packaging. On America Recycles Day, may we recommit to building a better, healthier future through recycling.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 15, 2024, as America Recycles Day. I call upon the people of the United States of America to observe this day with appropriate programs and activities, and I encourage all Americans to continue their environmental efforts by recycling throughout the year.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of November, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# American Education Week, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
During American Education Week, we celebrate the power and promise of our Nation's public education system, which has empowered so many students to realize their full potential regardless of their zip code. We show gratitude for educators and staff, who ensure that our schools are filled with hope and possibilities. And we recommit to ensuring each student, educator, and school has the resources and opportunities they need to thrive.
America's public education system helps define who we are: a Nation of possibilities, where everyone gets a fair shot to pursue their talents and ambitions. Some of our Nation's greatest scholars and scientists, artists and humanitarians, and dreamers and doers got their start at a public school. Many have further honed their skills in our colleges, universities, Registered Apprenticeships, and career and technical education programs. An education gives you something no one can take away—that is why we must remain committed to supporting our schools, which open the doors of opportunity wider for everyone.
I am proud that my Administration secured a historic $130 billion in funding for our Nation's K-12 schools through my American Rescue Plan. That law put more teachers in classrooms and put more counselors, social workers, and other supportive staff in our schools. It also invested in high-quality tutoring and made historic expansions in summer and after-school programs while upgrading the physical school buildings, including making aging buildings more secure and improving air quality.
My Administration also remains committed to ensuring students have the resources they need to succeed. My American Rescue Plan led to our country's biggest-ever investment in mental health and substance use programs,
providing critical funding to increase the number of mental health providers in our schools. Furthermore, my Bipartisan Safer Communities Act—the first major Federal gun safety legislation passed in nearly 30 years—made important steps toward ending the threat of gun violence, which brings terror to far too many schools. The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act also included $2 billion in funding to create safe, inclusive learning environments for all students and to train and hire more mental health professionals for schools. My Administration also made it easier for schools to bill Medicaid so that they could deliver critical health services, including mental health services to students. And through my national strategy to end hunger and reduce diet-related diseases in America by 2030, we are working toward a future where every kid has access to free, healthy school meals.
Setting students up for success also means improving our Nation's early childhood education. Children who go to preschool are nearly 50 percent more likely to finish high school and go on to earn a 2- or 4-year degree no matter their background. My Administration has fought to make preschool universal for every 3- and 4-year-old in America.
To support our Nation's higher education system, my Administration secured nearly $40 billion for colleges and universities through my American Rescue Plan. That includes billions of dollars in funding for Minority-Serving Institutions and Historically Black Colleges and Universities. I have always believed that higher education should be a pathway to the middle class—but we have to make it more affordable. That is why my Administration provided the largest increases to the maximum Pell Grant award in over a decade, making college more affordable for over six million students. We also canceled student loan debt for over one million public service workers, including teachers, by fixing the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) Program. Before I took office, only 7,000 public service workers had ever received the forgiveness they were entitled to through PSLF. In total, we have approved debt cancellation for nearly five million Americans across all our various debt relief actions, including fixing Income-Driven Repayment so borrowers get the relief they earned and holding the colleges that take advantage of students and families accountable.
Everyone deserves a fair shot at the American Dream, so my Administration has invested more in Registered Apprenticeships and career and technical training programs than any other administration in history, empowering workers to earn while they learn and opening up new pathways to secure good-paying jobs. We are also working to expand Registered Apprenticeships for educators and increase access to high-quality teacher preparation programs, including by making them more affordable.
During American Education Week, we show our gratitude to the educators and school staff across our Nation, who are the kite strings that keep our national ambitions aloft. And together, we will work to ensure our Nation's students have every opportunity to succeed.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 17 through November 23, 2024, as American Education Week. I call upon all Americans to mark this week with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities honoring those who devote their talents and energies to helping our
children reach their full potential and to building school communities where all students feel they belong.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of November, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# National Apprenticeship Week, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
America's workers are the best in the world—and that is in no small part due to our exceptional Registered Apprenticeship programs. During National Apprenticeship Week, we recommit to supporting these programs, which put so many Americans on a path to securing good-paying jobs and helping build the industries of the future.
I have often said that the middle class built America and unions built the middle class, and Registered Apprenticeship programs—including the hundreds of union-run programs—have produced some of our Nation's most skilled workers for generations. Registered Apprenticeships empower workers to hone their skills or gain new ones by allowing them to earn while they learn and connecting them to good-paying jobs. These apprenticeships have given so many of our workers the opportunity to work with dignity and care for their families all while training our workforce to build the industries of our future, like clean energy or cybersecurity.
My Administration made the largest Federal investment in our Nation's history in Registered Apprenticeships. Since taking office, we have invested more than $730 million to expand Registered Apprenticeships, leading to the hiring of more than one million apprentices across the country. More than $80 billion has been committed from my American Rescue Plan to strengthen and expand the workforce, including to expand Registered Apprenticeship and pre-apprenticeship programs. We are also creating opportunities for apprentices through our Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and our Inflation Reduction Act, which provides strong incentives for employers to hire Registered Apprentices in their clean energy projects.
Further, my Administration is making sure that Registered Apprentices are helping build the industries of the future and fulfill needs in critical industries. Our Advanced Manufacturing Sprint and Investing in America Workforce Hubs launched intensive drives to build a diverse, skilled pipeline of workers for advanced manufacturing jobs, including union jobs—many of which do not require a 4-year college degree. To do that, we have been bringing together unions, local governments, employers, training providers, K-12 schools, community colleges, and other stakeholders to train and connect workers to jobs in high-demand sectors. For teachers, my Administration has helped expand teacher Registered Apprenticeship programs to 46
States, to help train the next generation of educators. For construction workers, the Department of Labor's Scaling Apprenticeship Readiness Across the Building Trades Initiative is enrolling thousands of Americans to help rebuild our Nation's roads, bridges, and highways. For truck drivers, we held a 90-Day Trucking Apprenticeship Challenge, which helped get more drivers on the road. And for cybersecurity professionals, we completed a 120-Day Cybersecurity Apprenticeship Sprint, which has helped thousands get hired in industries that protect Americans from cyberthreats.
My Administration is also ensuring our Registered Apprentices reflect the diversity of America. Our Apprenticeship Ambassador Initiative is working with more than 200 organizations committed to hiring 10,000 new apprentices and recruiting people from historically underrepresented communities for apprenticeship programs. And through the Department of Labor's Women in Apprenticeship and Nontraditional Occupations grant program, we are continuing to invest in women in the skilled trades, who are too often underrepresented. Thanks to these efforts, the number of women in apprenticeships will soon surpass 100,000 for the first time ever.
Supporting Registered Apprenticeships is about doing what our Nation does best—investing in America and America's workers. This week, we celebrate apprentices nationwide, whose hard work has contributed so much to our Nation's economy and prosperity. May we continue to support these programs, which have created endless possibilities for Americans.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 17 through November 23, 2024, as National Apprenticeship Week. I urge the Congress, State and local governments, educational institutions, industry and labor leaders, apprentices, and all Americans to support Registered Apprenticeship programs in the United States of America and to raise awareness of their importance in building a diverse and robust workforce to strengthen our national economy.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of November, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# International Conservation Day, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Today, I am proud to become the first sitting American President to visit the Amazon and to proclaim the first International Conservation Day, reflecting all that is at stake in the fight against climate change and honoring the power and promise of conservation work. On International Conservation Day, we recommit to working with partners across our Nation and around the world to safeguard our natural treasures.
When we work together to defend our lands and waters, everyone benefits. That is because conservation is about more than protecting our world's beautiful natural wonders—it is about protecting the livelihoods of the people who depend on them; preserving our diverse habitats and the wildlife that lives within them; increasing resiliency throughout our lands, seascapes, and riverscapes; and ensuring our lands and waters can be enjoyed by all.
That is why my Administration has delivered on the most ambitious land and water conservation agenda in American history—leading by the power of our example. When I first came into office, I issued an Executive Order that established the United States' first-ever conservation goal—aiming to protect at least 30 percent of our Nation's lands and waters by 2030. My America the Beautiful initiative has advanced that work by supporting voluntary, locally led conservation and restoration. These efforts have not only helped local communities, Tribes, farmers, ranchers, foresters, and fishers to address the climate crisis and protect lands and waters. They have also created jobs, strengthened the economy, and expanded access to the outdoors across our country. I also signed an Executive Order to safeguard and steward our Nation's forests and make our ecosystems more resilient in the fight against climate change. And we launched the America the Beautiful Freshwater Challenge to protect, restore, and reconnect 8 million acres of wetlands and 100,000 miles of our Nation's rivers and streams to safeguard clean water for all.
I am also proud that my Administration made the largest investment in history to confront the climate crisis through my Inflation Reduction Act and has conserved more than 45 million acres of our Nation's lands and waters. We have established, expanded, and restored 11 national monuments and protected the United States Arctic Ocean from new oil and gas leasing. And together with my Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we have invested in restoration and conservation, including $50 billion to strengthen community and ecosystem resilience to climate change. Further, I launched the American Climate Corps to mobilize a new, diverse generation of Americans in conserving and restoring our lands and waters, bolstering community resilience, deploying clean energy, and advancing environmental justice—all while creating good jobs.
Around the world, my Administration has made extraordinary progress in advancing conservation. We moved to rejoin the Paris Agreement on day one of my Administration, and we put our country in a position to cut emissions in half by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050. In 2021, at the United Nations Climate Change Conference COP26 in Glasgow, we released the Plan to Conserve Global Forests—a first-of-its-kind national strategy to preserve global ecosystems that serve as vital carbon sinks. We also joined other nations in pledging to end deforestation by 2030, backed by the biggest ever commitment of public funds for forest conservation and a plan to make 75 percent of forest commodity supply chains sustainable. In 2022, we helped rally countries around the world to commit to conserve at least 30 percent of lands and waters by 2030, mirroring the goal we had set at home. We also joined other countries at the United Nations to sign the High Seas Treaty, committing to working together to establish marine protected areas on the high seas—a critical step to conserve ocean biodiversity and reach the global community's goal to conserve or protect at least 30 percent of the ocean by 2030.
My Administration has also delivered record climate financing to support developing countries' efforts to preserve and protect these vital ecosystems that serve as critical carbon sinks, accelerate the clean energy transition, and bolster their resilience to climate change. In 2021, I pledged that our Nation would deliver $11 billion per year in climate financing by 2024. I am proud that we not only kept that promise, but surpassed it. This includes fulfilling my pledge to invest over $3 billion per year to help vulnerable countries around the world mitigate and adapt to climate change as part of my Emergency Plan for Adaptation and Resilience. I am also proud that—with our recent $50 million investment—my Administration has provided over $100 million to the Amazon Fund. At the same time, our Development Finance Corporation (DFC) has helped mobilize over $1 billion in investment to support the restoration of degraded lands in Brazil, Uruguay, and Chile, helping create a market that values keeping this vital ecosystem alive and thriving.
There is still so much to do to ensure that we protect our world's most precious ecosystems and natural treasures. That is why the DFC is investing in one of the largest reforestation projects in the world, beginning with the Brazilian Amazon. I am proud that my Administration is working with over a dozen international partners to launch the Brazil Restoration and Bioeconomy Finance Coalition to mobilize at least $10 billion for land restoration and bioeconomy-related projects by 2030. And I am proud to support President Lula of Brazil's bold vision of creating the Tropical Forest Forever Facility, a path-breaking new initiative that would incentivize countries to protect their tropical forests while supporting the local and Indigenous communities stewarding these forests and ensuring these vital ecosystems continue to thrive.
It has been said that the Amazon rainforest is the lungs of the world. Forests like these, that stretch across the Americas, Africa, and Asia—including the Amazon, Tongass, Congo, and Sundaland—represent our heart and soul. Now more than ever, we must recommit to the urgent work of addressing climate change—together, we can ensure that these treasures will be enjoyed for generations to come.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 17, 2024, as International Conservation Day.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventeenth day of November, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# National Child's Day, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
This generation's young people are some of the most gifted, educated, and talented our Nation has ever known. They are the kite strings that keep our national ambitions aloft. On National Child's Day, we recommit to building a future worthy of their highest aspirations.
So many of our Nation's children begin building their futures at our public schools—that is why I am proud that my Administration secured a historic $130 billion in funding for our Nation's K-12 schools through my American Rescue Plan. That law put more teachers in classrooms and more counselors, social workers, and other support staff in our schools. It also invested in high-quality tutoring and made historic expansions in summer and afterschool programs. My Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is expanding access to high-speed internet so students can access it regardless of their zip code. And my Administration has worked to advance a pathway to provide free, healthy school meals for all children as a part of our national strategy to end hunger and reduce diet-related diseases in America by 2030.
My Administration has also worked hard to give families some well-deserved breathing room so that they can care for their children without worrying about how they are going to pay the bills. My American Rescue Plan expanded the Child Tax Credit, which helped reduce child poverty by nearly half across the Nation. That law also made our Nation's biggest investment in child care ever, helping hundreds of thousands of child care providers keep their doors open and continue providing care. I signed the Inflation Reduction Act, saving millions of families $800 per year on their health insurance premiums. My Administration also raised pay for early childhood educators across the country participating in the Head Start program. And my Administration modernized the Thrifty Food Plan for the first time in nearly five decades so that millions more families receiving Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits can afford nutritious foods.
Securing the health and safety of children has always been a priority for my Administration. I signed the most significant gun safety law in nearly 30 years, working towards a future where no student or child has to live in fear of gun violence. That law also made the largest investment in youth mental health ever to help schools across the country train and hire new mental health counselors. At the same time, we made it easier for schools to leverage Medicaid to deliver health care. And we are working to support LGBTQI+ children and families by protecting their access to health care and preventing harmful practices, including the use of so-called conversion therapy.
My Administration has also been dedicated to addressing the existential threat of climate change—a critical task to secure our children's futures. My Inflation Reduction Act made the most significant investment in climate ever, which includes funding to get communities cleaner air and drinking water, and protect them from the harmful effects of pollution. My Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is working to replace every lead pipe in America,
so that every family can turn on the faucet and drink clean, safe water. And my Administration has conserved more than 45 million acres of our Nation's lands and waters in an effort to ensure they can be enjoyed for generations to come.
On National Child's Day, we recommit to ensuring that every child in America has the opportunity to pursue the limits of their talents and ambitions, and we uplift them as the leaders and doers of the future.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 20, 2024, as National Child's Day. I call upon all government officials, educators, volunteers, and all the people of the United States of America to observe this day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this nineteenth day of November, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# National Rural Health Day, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
In America, health care should be a right, not a privilege—no matter a person's zip code. On National Rural Health Day, we show gratitude to all the health professionals providing incredible care to the more than 60 million people who live in rural America. And we recommit to ensuring that rural communities have access to affordable, quality health care.
Too many people living in rural communities worry about whether they can access and afford health care when they need it. Rural Americans often have fewer health care providers within reach, although they are more likely to be older and have disabilities. Since 2010, over 150 rural hospitals have closed down or stopped providing in-patient care, putting a strain on local economies and leaving families without a reliable source of health care.
I came into office determined to invest in rural America—and that includes investing in rural hospitals and health care. My American Rescue Plan delivered $8.5 billion to rural healthcare providers. This funding was essential during the pandemic, helping to keep hospitals and clinics operational when they were most needed. My Administration also launched a Rural Emergency Hospital designation to provide a new option to some struggling hospitals, and the Department of Health and Human Services has provided tens of millions of dollars to expand health services and provide assistance to hospitals facing financial distress. We made historic investments of over $4 billion that can be used to deliver telehealth to increase access to health care services in rural and remote areas. The Department of Health and
Human Services also updated regulations under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act to reduce discrimination in health care against people with disabilities, including those living in rural communities.
Investing in the future of rural health care also means training the next generation of providers. That is why the Rural Emergency Hospital funds also provide funds to train health care professionals to serve rural communities, addressing both current and future needs. Programs like the National Health Service Corps support more than 3,700 rural behavioral health clinicians with scholarships and loan repayment to meet the growing needs of these communities. My Administration also launched new programs to support the training of more nurse midwives and more nurse practitioners with a focus on maternal health in underserved and rural areas. And our investments in the Delta region support community-based organizations as they expand access to and coordinate health services in rural communities in the South.
My Administration has also worked to lower the cost of health care for every American. We expanded coverage under the Affordable Care Act, reducing health insurance premiums and saving millions of families an average of $800 per year. My Inflation Reduction Act finally beat Big Pharma, empowering Medicare to negotiate lower drug prices for the first time in American history. Medicare can now negotiate prices with major manufacturers that treat everything from blood clots to cancer. It also capped the cost of insulin at $35 per month for people with Medicare. At the same time, we are requiring drug companies to reimburse Medicare if they raise prices higher than the rate of inflation—saving seniors up to $618 on medication.
My Administration has also been working to tackle the health challenges impacting rural communities—from improving maternal health care to addressing the mental health crisis and beating the opioid epidemic. We released a Blueprint for Addressing the Maternal Health Crisis.
We have expanded evidence-based home visiting services and programs like Healthy Start, which support families across the country, including in rural areas. We have invested $535 million in rural areas to expand programs that provide prevention, treatment, and recovery services for mental health and substance use disorders. Under our leadership, opioid overdose deaths are decreasing for the first time in years. We have provided tens of millions of dollars through the Department of Agriculture's Farm and Ranch Stress Assistance Network to connect vulnerable agricultural producers and their families with increased access to supportive services where they live and work. And we released a national strategy to end hunger and reduce diet-related diseases by 2030, which includes a pathway to providing free, healthy school meals for all children.
Through the Biden Cancer Moonshot, we have also been working hard to prevent cancer in rural communities, detect it early so it may be easier to treat, and connect people with world-class care, no matter where they live. Tobacco is still the number one preventable cause of cancer in this country and we have expanded efforts to help people in rural America quit smoking—so they may never face a cancer diagnosis in the first place. We have increased access to cancer screenings, making them free and widely available to virtually everyone in our Nation. And we have linked cancer
screening in rural areas with treatment from centers with expertise, making sure high-quality care is accessible to all.
Across the country, American communities are writing the greatest comeback story our Nation has ever known—creating and pursuing opportunities in their hometowns and putting shovels in the ground while restoring pride in their communities, in America, and in one another. We must continue expanding access to affordable health care for every American. On National Rural Health Day, we recommit to ensuring every rural American has the resources they need to stay healthy, care for their well-being, and thrive.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 21, 2024, as National Rural Health Day. I call upon the people of the United States to reaffirm our dedication to the health and well-being of rural America.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of November, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# National Family Week, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
My Dad taught me that family is the beginning, the middle, and the end. It is everything. During National Family Week, we celebrate the love shared by millions of American families, and we recommit to uplifting them, so that more families can build their American Dream together.
Since I came into office, I have been determined to give hardworking families a little more breathing room and a fair shot at achieving their dreams. That work began with building an economy that would strengthen our middle class. My American Rescue Plan kept millions of families afloat during the pandemic, ensuring they could stay in their homes and put food on their tables. It also delivered the largest-ever Child Tax Credit, which helped tens of millions of working families with the costs of raising children and cut child poverty nearly in half. My Bipartisan Infrastructure Law created jobs rebuilding our Nation's infrastructure—from strengthening our roads, bridges, and ports to removing lead pipes from our homes and expanding access to high-speed internet. My CHIPS and Science Act is revitalizing American manufacturing, and, throughout my Administration, we have created over 1.6 million manufacturing and construction jobs. And my Inflation Reduction Act made healthcare more affordable for families, saving millions of them an average of $800 per year on their health insurance premiums. It will also cap the cost of out-of-pocket prescription drug costs at $2,000 per year for seniors on Medicare, easing their cost of care. And
through my PACT Act, we are helping veterans exposed to toxic materials get the benefits they and their families deserve. And today, incomes are up almost $4,000, after adjusting for inflation, ensuring families have the breathing room they deserve.
My Administration has also been working to ensure families have the support they need to thrive while keeping them safe. I signed the Respect for Marriage Act, protecting the right to marriage for same-sex and interracial couples. I signed an Executive Order that directed the most comprehensive actions of any administration in history to make high-quality child care and long-term care more accessible and support caregivers. I took a slate of historic actions to prevent children from being placed into foster care and separated from their families without adequate justification. And I signed the most comprehensive gun reform bill in nearly three decades to end the scourge of gun violence ripping apart our families and deliver historic funding to address the youth mental health crisis.
During National Family Week, may we hold our loved ones close, both the family that have been there since the beginning and the family we have made along the way. And may we continue to fight for families—the heart and soul of our Nation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 24 through November 30, 2024, as National Family Week. I invite States, communities, and individuals to join together in observing this week with appropriate ceremonies and activities to honor our Nation's families.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-second day of November, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# Thanksgiving Day, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
This Thanksgiving, as families, friends, and loved ones gather in gratitude, may we all celebrate the many blessings of our great Nation.
Thanksgiving is at the heart of America's spirit of gratitude—of finding light in times of both joy and strife. The Pilgrims celebrated the first Thanksgiving to honor a successful harvest, made possible by the generosity and kindness of the Wampanoag people. On the way to Valley Forge, as General George Washington and his troops continued the fierce struggle for our Nation's independence, they found a moment for Thanksgiving. And amid the fight to preserve our Union during the Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln established Thanksgiving as a national holiday,
finding gratitude in the courage of the American people who sacrifice so much for our country.
We are a good Nation because we are a good people. The First Lady and I remain inspired by the everyday Americans who lift this country up and push us forward. Today, so many are among their family and friends, celebrating the love that binds them and creating new traditions that will carry on for generations. To anyone with an empty seat at the dinner table, grieving the loss of a loved one, the First Lady and I hold you in our hearts and prayers.
America is a Nation of promise and possibilities—and that is because, every day, ordinary Americans are doing extraordinary things. Our service members and veterans have given all, risked all, and dared all to keep our Nation free. Our first responders, firefighters, and police officers risk their lives every day to keep the rest of us safe. I can see the best of America in them and in our workers and union leaders, public servants and teachers, doctors and scientists, and all who give their heart and soul to ensuring people are treated with dignity and respect. And I find hope in our Nation's families, who sacrifice so much to achieve the American Dream and build a future worthy of our highest aspirations.
This Thanksgiving—the last one I will declare as President—I express my gratitude to the American people. Serving as President has been the honor of a lifetime. America is the greatest country on Earth, and there is so much to be grateful for. May we celebrate all that unites us—because there is nothing beyond our capacity if we do it together.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim Thursday, November 28, 2024, as a National Day of Thanksgiving. I encourage the people of the United States of America to join together and give thanks for the friends, neighbors, family members, and communities who have supported each other over the past year in a reflection of goodwill and unity.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-seventh day of November, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# National Impaired Driving Prevention Month, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Too many families know the pain of losing a loved one to a drunk or drug-impaired driving accident. Each year, more than 10,000 Americans lose their lives in these preventable tragedies. During National Impaired Driving Prevention Month, we remind everyone that they can save lives by driving
only when sober, calling for a ride, planning ahead, and making sure friends and loved ones do the same.
In 2022, over 13,000 people were killed in drunk-driving accidents. Still, millions of people drive under the influence each year, not only putting themselves in harm's way but also endangering passengers, pedestrians, and first responders. Even just one drink or one pill can ruin lives.
My Administration is committed to preventing accidents and impaired driving. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has raised awareness about its risks and consequences through media campaigns, including “If You Feel Different, You Drive Different”; “Drive Sober or Get Pulled Over”; and “Buzzed Driving is Drunk Driving.” Furthermore, since the beginning of my Administration, we have dedicated over $100 billion to disrupt the flow of illicit drugs and expand access to the prevention and treatment of substance use disorder.
Reducing fatalities and injuries in impaired driving accidents also means improving the safety of our Nation's vehicles. That is why my Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests in technologies that can detect and prevent impaired driving and requiring new passenger cars to include collision warnings and automatic braking to prevent accidents. The Department of Transportation also released a National Roadway Safety Strategy to eliminate traffic deaths and make crashes less destructive.
This holiday season, let us recommit to doing right by our neighbors, friends, and families by driving sober. For those planning on drinking, arrange a sober ride home beforehand—ride-sharing apps are a convenient way to get home safely. If you have had alcohol or used substances, do not get behind the wheel—one accident can cost someone their life. If you are responsible for driving yourself or others, stay sober, buckle up, put the phone away, and drive the speed limit. And if you witness a friend, loved one, colleague, or anyone putting themselves or others in danger, lend a hand to keep them safe. You could save a life.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim December 2024 as National Impaired Driving Prevention Month. I urge all Americans to make responsible decisions and take appropriate measures to prevent impaired driving.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of November, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# World AIDS Day, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Our Nation has made enormous strides toward preventing, diagnosing, and treating HIV—a terrible disease that has stolen the precious lives of over 40 million people since the epidemic began in 1981. Despite our progress, over 39 million people worldwide continue to live with it, including over 1 million people in the United States. On World AIDS Day, we honor the memory of all those we tragically lost to HIV around the world. We stand in solidarity with all those who are courageously facing the disease today. And we renew our commitment to accelerating efforts to finally end the HIV/AIDS epidemic.
My Administration has made historic progress toward addressing this fight. In my first year in office, I reestablished the White House Office of National AIDS Policy and launched a new National HIV/AIDS Strategy, to put us on the path to end this epidemic by 2030. To that end, the Health Resources and Services Administration committed nearly $10 billion in funding through the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program to ensure that low-income individuals in America with HIV can receive the medication and quality care they need. The Department of Health and Human Services is also working to guarantee that Americans have access to HIV interventions like pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and self-tests to prevent HIV. And the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has ensured that PrEP medications—including long-term injectable options—and critical support services like counseling and screenings for HIV and hepatitis B are free for people with Medicare. Furthermore, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention invested $10 million in a pilot program that covers the cost of PrEP to five health departments across the Nation—an important step toward ensuring everyone has access to this vital medication. Additionally, my Administration's investments in the Ending the HIV Epidemic in the United States initiative, which reaches over 50 jurisdictions, has helped decrease HIV incidence by 21 percent in the past year in those areas.
At the same time, my Administration is working to fight the stigma surrounding HIV and to ensure that people with HIV do not face bias or discrimination—which too often stops people from getting life-saving care. I am proud that last year my Administration ended the shameful practice of banning gay and bisexual men from donating blood. We also released updates to the Rehabilitation Act that strengthen civil rights protections in medical settings for people with HIV. And I join advocates around the country in sharing the message of U=U, which stands for undetectable equals untransmittable, and makes clear that a person living with HIV who is on treatment and maintains an undetectable viral load has zero risk of transmitting HIV. We are committed to ensuring people understand the latest science about HIV transmission, testing, prevention, and care. And we are calling on States and community leaders to repeal or reform outdated HIV criminalization laws, so people are not wrongfully punished for exposing others to HIV without the intent to cause harm.
Globally, my Administration is working with international partners to lead the global fight to end HIV/AIDS as a public health threat by 2030, including through the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and our investments in the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. PEPFAR has saved more than 25 million lives in 55 countries by working to prevent HIV infections and expand access to HIV treatment and care services. In 2023, my Administration worked with the Congress to reauthorize PEPFAR for the fourth time ensuring that America continues to help build a future where HIV infections are prevented and every person has access to the treatment they need. This year, we also celebrate the 10th anniversary of the DREAMS (Determined, Resilient, Empowered, AIDS-Free, Mentored, and Safe) partnership, which has worked to lower HIV infections in adolescent girls and young women around the world.
This year, on World AIDS Day, the AIDS Quilt which was first displayed on the National Mall in 1987, will be publicly displayed at the White House for the first time in our Nation's history. The Quilt is a memorial for all those we have lost to AIDS and AIDS-related illnesses.
We also express our gratitude to the activists, scientists, doctors, and caregivers who have worked tirelessly to advance our Nation's progress in the fight against this epidemic. And we recommit as a Nation to shining a light on the struggle, strength, and resilience of people affected by HIV. Together, let this World AIDS Day be a moment of unity that rallies the country to give all those affected the care, hope, and support they deserve.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim December 1, 2024, as World AIDS Day. I urge the Governors of the United States and its Commonwealths and Territories, the appropriate officials of all units of government, and the American people to join the HIV community in activities to remember those who have lost their lives to AIDS and to provide support, dignity, and compassion to people with HIV.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of November, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# International Day of Persons With Disabilities, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
The over one billion disabled people around the world have made incredible contributions—propelling us all forward in the pursuit of progress. This International Day of Persons with Disabilities, we recommit to ensuring that people with disabilities are treated with dignity and respect and have every opportunity to reach their full potential.
I remain proud that one of my earliest acts as a United States Senator was co-sponsoring the Rehabilitation Act, banning discrimination on the basis of disability by any entity funded by the Federal Government. And later, I co-sponsored the Americans with Disabilities Act, which banned discrimination against disabled people in workplaces, schools, public transit, and more—finally making a commitment to build an America for all Americans. Together, these laws declared what we have always known to be true: that Americans with disabilities deserve dignity, respect, and an equal chance at the American Dream.
Over 180 nations have passed similar laws in the years since, codifying their commitment to equal justice and opportunities for people with disabilities. Still, these laws have not brought an end to the work we need to do. Around the world, people with disabilities are subject to shameful discrimination, harassment, exploitation, abuse, and violence. And too often, they struggle to get by—whether it is finding an accommodating job, enjoying public spaces, receiving quality education, or getting to and from school or work.
That is why my Administration has worked to uplift people with disabilities in everything we do. My American Rescue Plan provided $37 billion to strengthen home-based services so that more people with disabilities have the option to live independently at home. My Bipartisan Infrastructure Law makes historic investments in making transit, rail, and airports more accessible, so that people with disabilities can commute and travel with dignity. The Department of Justice issued a rule that ensures State and local governments make their web content and mobile apps more accessible to Americans with disabilities so they can more easily access local government services, emergency services, voting information, and publicly funded education. And today, the Department of Labor announced a proposed rule that would gradually phase out certificates that permit employers to pay workers with disabilities less than the full minimum wage.
My Administration has also worked with partners around the world to secure the rights of people with disabilities. I released the first-ever Memorandum on Advancing Worker Empowerment, Rights, and High Labor Standards Globally, which is working to ensure that people with disabilities are represented in our work to promote labor rights. And I re-established the role of Special Advisor on International Disability Rights at the Department of State to ensure our foreign policy reflects our commitment to this community. In October, my Administration participated in the first-ever G7 Ministerial on Inclusion and Disability, joining leaders around the world to advance disability rights. Together with leaders from Central Asia, I launched a joint disability rights initiative to help make education and infrastructure more accessible. And as a co-chair of the Global Action on Disability Network, the United States is continuing to advocate for disability rights on the world stage.
Today, I am thinking of a quote from disability rights activist Judy Heumann, who once wrote: “Change never happens at the pace we think it should. It happens over years of people joining together, strategizing, sharing, and pulling all the levers they possibly can.” On International Day of Persons with Disabilities, we show our gratitude for all the leaders and
activists who have advocated and worked to make real our Nation's founding promise—that every American has a right to be recognized and respected for who they are. And we recommit to building a world where we support disability pride and give everyone an equitable chance at achieving their highest aspirations.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim December 3, 2024, as International Day of Persons with Disabilities. I call on all Americans to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this third day of December, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
On National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day, we honor the 2,403 service members and civilians who were killed on that tragic December morning 83 years ago. And we recognize the absolute courage of the service members who, in the wake of this painful and unprovoked attack, stood up to defend democracy and stand up to fascism abroad in World War II.
As we reflect on the honors and triumphs of the Greatest Generation, we must remember that they risked all, dared all, and gave all not for a person or a place—but for the idea of America. They recognized that freedom is never guaranteed: Every generation has had to earn and defend it in the battle between autocracy and democracy. This service and sacrifice helped deliver a world grounded in peace and security. And together, these brave women and men proved that no force—not destruction, death, or the darkness of hate—is a match for the flame of liberty that ignites the hearts of free people everywhere.
Today, we must be keepers of their mission and bearers of the flame of freedom they kept burning bright. That begins by honoring our sacred obligation to care for our service members and veterans and their families, caregivers, and survivors—especially our World War II veterans whose actions ensured that democracy endured. That is why my Administration began enrolling all World War II veterans, regardless of length of service or financial status, in Veterans Affairs health care services. And we also expanded access to benefits for those who participated in testing and clean-up activities related to World War II weapons programs, helping address radiation related illnesses for veterans and civilians.
During National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day, may we remember the brave patriots whose lives were cut short on this day 83 years ago. May
we honor all the service members who gave their last full measure of devotion to defend democracy in the years that followed. And may we all recommit to fulfilling the future they fought for—one grounded in freedom, democracy, equality, and opportunity for all.
The Congress, by Public Law 103-308, as amended, has designated December 7 of each year as “National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day.” Today, let us commemorate the patriots who perished and who were wounded on December 7, 1941, and continue to fulfill our sacred obligation to care for our service members; our veterans; and their families, caregivers, and survivors.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim December 7, 2024, as National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day. I encourage all Americans to reflect on the courage shown by our brave service members that day and remember their sacrifices. I ask us all to give sincere thanks and appreciation to the survivors of that unthinkable day. I urge all Federal agencies, interested organizations, groups, and individuals to fly the flag of the United States at half-staff on December 7, 2024, in honor of those American patriots who died as a result of their service at Pearl Harbor.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixth day of December, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# Establishment of the Carlisle Federal Indian Boarding School National MonumentBy the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
For a century and a half spanning the early 19th and mid-20th centuries, the Federal Government removed American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian children (Native children) from their families, Tribes, and homelands, often by force or coercion, and transported them to institutions across the United States. These institutions collectively became known as the “Federal Indian boarding school system.” The Federal Government's goal was to assimilate Native children by stripping them of their languages, religions, and cultures. To that end, the children taken to these institutions were often separated from their families for years, and many never returned to their homes. The schools often used physical abuse, compulsory labor, and corporal punishment to achieve their assimilative ends. Many Native children were subjected to sexual abuse at the schools. School staff cut their hair, made them give up their traditional clothes and names, provided them with inadequate medical services, and deprived them of essential nutrition. According to available records, nearly 1,000 Native youths died in schools across the system, but the actual number of lives lost is likely much higher. Many children attempted to flee from schools in the system;
while some managed to escape, those who did not often faced severe discipline. For the survivors of the schools, and for the families and Tribes whose children were taken from them, the trauma and violence inflicted by the Federal Indian boarding school system have had profound effects across multiple generations, and those impacts continue today.
The Federal Government's attempt to control and assimilate Native children into Anglo-European culture, society, and religion through the Federal Indian boarding school system was part of a broader effort to destroy American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian political, social, and cultural structures; stifle opposition and resistance in those communities; and appropriate Tribal lands, waters, and resources. This effort was carried out through policies implemented at Federal Indian boarding schools and actions taken by multiple executive departments and agencies across the administrations of 34 Presidents—from Thomas Jefferson through Lyndon B. Johnson—using today's equivalent of at least $23 billion in Federal appropriations.
Despite this system and other destructive Federal policies, Indian Tribes (Tribes, or Tribal Nations), including Alaska Native Villages, and the Native Hawaiian Community retained their identities and cultures and rebuilt their political and community institutions, including by taking over and transforming some of the Federal Indian boarding schools that once caused widespread and enduring pain.
Founded in 1879, the Carlisle Indian Industrial School (Carlisle School) in Pennsylvania was the first Federal off-reservation boarding school for Native children. By the time it ceased operations in 1918, the Carlisle School had subjected 7,800 Indian children from more than 140 Tribes to its coercive form of education. Some children were as young as 5 years old when they arrived. The Federal Indian boarding school system, which continued through the 1960s following practices first used at the Carlisle School, inflicted a legacy of individual, collective, and multi-generational trauma on Tribes and the Native Hawaiian Community.
The former campus of the Carlisle School is located within the boundaries of what is now the United States Army's Carlisle Barracks (Carlisle Barracks), one of the Nation's oldest military installations. The Continental Congress first used the property as a center for artillery and ordnance supplies for the Continental Army under General George Washington. In 1863, during the Civil War, Confederate troops torched buildings on the campus, which functioned at the time as a central supply center for the Union Army. The Federal Government rebuilt the barracks between 1863 and 1864 in the original footprint and style.
The Carlisle School campus was designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1961 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1966. The 24 historic structures associated with the Carlisle School include residential, vocational, and athletic buildings that evoke the Federal Indian boarding school era. Prominent among these are the historic School Road Gateposts. Constructed by the labor of children and youths at the Carlisle School, these gateposts were the first structures that some children taken to Carlisle would have seen as they walked along the pathway and entered the campus. The gateposts still stand today as a marker of the removal and separation of children from their families, Tribes, and homelands.
The concept of using the education of Native children and separation from their families and Tribes as weapons of control and religious conversion echoes back centuries to early colonial times in the 1600s. In 1819, the Congress laid the groundwork for a general system of Indian education by enacting the Civilization Fund Act (3 Stat. 516). The Act authorized the President to provide for “[e]mployment of instructors for Indians,” including “for teaching their children in reading, writing, and arithmetic,” and provided an annual appropriation of funds for that purpose. Over the ensuing five decades, these funds were distributed to various entities (particularly missionary organizations) and individuals “prominent in the effort to `civilize' the Indians.” At least 59 religious institutions and organizations received Federal Government funding to operate or support schools in the Federal Indian boarding school system.
The more immediate origins of the philosophy of the Federal Indian boarding school system trace to an organized “experiment of enforced civilization” in 1875. At that time, President Ulysses S. Grant's War Department, acting on directions from the Congress, selected Tribal members labeled as “hostiles” or “ringleaders” to be taken prisoner and transported by train from the West to Fort Marion, Florida. The United States Army targeted and arrested 72 members from a range of Tribes. The War Department then issued Special Orders detailing 1st Lieutenant Richard Henry Pratt of the 10th Cavalry to accompany the prisoners—a group of men, women, and children—on their trip and remain in charge of them upon arrival.
Pratt oversaw all aspects of the Fort Marion incarceration and treatment of the prisoners: cutting off their hair, clothing them in military uniforms, running military drills, selling their crafts and drawings, teaching them English, and assigning prisoners to work as laborers. During a speech delivered in 1892 to the National Conference of Charities and Corrections in Denver, Colorado, Pratt expressed his infamous approach to assimilation: “[T]hat all the Indian there is in the race should be dead. Kill the Indian in him and save the man.” This soon became the blueprint and philosophy for how children would be treated at Federal Indian boarding schools.
In 1882, the Congress authorized the Secretary of War to set aside any vacant posts or barracks for industrial training for Indian youth and to detail Army officers for Indian education under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior. Three years earlier, in August 1879, the Secretary of War had approved the first such transfer, of the vacant Carlisle Barracks in Pennsylvania, to the Secretary of the Interior to be used as a school for Native children. On October 6, 1879, 83 American Indian and Alaska Native children—24 girls and 59 boys—arrived at the newly founded Carlisle School. The Congress subsequently passed a law that paid a salary to Pratt, whom the Secretary of War had placed in charge of the Carlisle School at the request of the Secretary of the Interior. For almost 40 years, the Department of the Interior operated the Carlisle School as an Indian Industrial School, melding the approach of incarceration with assimilative education policies.
When children arrived at the Carlisle School, they were immersed in the practices of so-called “civilized” life—a term frequently used to describe the goal of the Federal Indian boarding schools in Federal Government reports. Their hair was cut and their clothing was replaced with military uniforms for boys and Victorian dresses for girls. One of the children brought to the Carlisle School in its opening year, Luther Standing Bear—a child
of the Oglala Lakota Chief Standing Bear—later recounted his experience: “Now, after having my hair cut . . . I felt that I was no more Indian but would be an imitation of a white man.” Zitkala-Sa, a Dakota woman from the Yankton Sioux Reservation, recalled the confusion and fear she felt on her first day as a child at Carlisle, during which school officials dragged her from her hiding place under a bed, tied her to a chair, and forcibly cut her thick braids: “Then I lost my spirit. . . . In my anguish I moaned for my mother, but no one came to comfort me . . . for now I was only one of many little animals driven by a herder.”
All children at the Carlisle School experienced a regimented daily schedule starting at 6:00 a.m. and concluding with Taps and room inspection at 9:00 p.m. Sunday school, chapel services, Catholic instruction, and Bible study classes were required. Carlisle School instructors also imposed strict rules about teaching English and prohibited the children from speaking their native languages—a rule that was often enforced with corporal punishment.
“Vocational” or “industrial” training in the form of compulsory labor was a central component of the Carlisle School throughout its operation. Boys were assigned mechanics, blacksmithing, tin-smithing, wagon-making, carpentering, tailoring, shoemaking, harness-making, baking, painting, printing, and farming. Girls were assigned cooking, laundry, and housekeeping. In what became known as the “outing system”—an arrangement intended to “impart[ ] the lesson of Americanism”—Carlisle School administrators regularly sent children and youths to spend a portion of each year living with and working for white families. School administrators then deposited the children's compensation “to their credit” with the school.
Carlisle School leaders also used the children's labor to perform maintenance, construction, and operations work on the campus. Several buildings—including a large brick printing office, a gymnasium, a hospital, doctor's quarters, a model home, a laundry building, the Leupp Indian Art Studio, and a warehouse—were primarily constructed by the youths of the Carlisle School.
The Carlisle School's start as a Federal Indian boarding school coincided with the rise of American football. Although students also participated in other athletics, the Carlisle School used the football team as a means to earn publicity and garner support for the boarding school approach to assimilation. In 1899, the Carlisle School hired a well-known football coach, Glenn “Pop” Warner, and in the ensuing years the Carlisle football team boasted an impressive win-loss record, including victories over colleges such as Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania. Newspapers published articles with sensational stories and photographs of the Carlisle School games, spotlighting Carlisle student athletes Dennison Wheelock, Gus Welch, and Jim Thorpe. For a small number of players, like Thorpe, football provided access to higher educational opportunities and athletic success. But for most players, the Carlisle football team did not lead to additional opportunities.
Indeed, for the student body more generally, the athletic program amounted to another form of exploitation by the school. To fund the gymnasium, the Carlisle School took purported donations from the children's Individual Indian Money Accounts, which were trust accounts created and managed by the Federal Government. The school also used sales of items made by children and gate receipts from athletic events held on the Carlisle School's
fields and cinder track for its own uses. A congressional investigation in 1914 received testimony that Warner used the Carlisle football game proceeds for his personal gain.
Conditions at the Carlisle School—located in a remote area over a thousand miles away from many children's homes—were unfamiliar and harsh. Children lived in close quarters and were exposed to diseases they had not encountered previously. More than 180 children died while attending the Carlisle School; many of them are buried in marked gravesites at the Carlisle Barracks Main Post Cemetery.
The Carlisle School's tenure as a Federal Indian boarding school ended in 1918, at the end of World War I, when the War Department took back control of the post and opened a hospital to care for wounded soldiers. At that time, 279 children left the Carlisle School and were transferred to other Federal Indian boarding schools.
The Carlisle School's legacy extends far beyond its almost 40 years of operation. The Carlisle School became a model replicated in more than 417 federally supported Indian boarding schools in 37 States and then-territories over the course of the next century. In addition, some Indian boarding schools were operated by religious institutions and organizations that did not receive Federal Government support. Across the Federal Indian boarding school system, the Federal Government's policies of cultural disruption and assimilation resulted in a collective loss of language, religion, and identity, and inflicted intergenerational trauma that persists today and remains a painful but important part of our Nation's story.
Many Tribal leaders resisted the Federal Indian boarding school system and took steps to try to protect Native children and reunite families. After the United States military entered Third Mesa of Hopi in 1890 and took 104 children from their families into the Federal Indian boarding school system, Hopi leaders refused to send additional Hopi children to the school. In response, in November 1894, the Federal Government arrested 19 Hopi leaders and held them as prisoners for nearly a year at Alcatraz Island in California, a former United States military installation. The names of these Hopi leaders were: Heevi'ima, Polingyawma, Masatiwa, Qotsventiwa, Piphongva, Lomahongewma, Lomayestiwa, Yukiwma, Tuvehoyiwma, Patu-pha, Qotsyawma, Sikyakeptiwa, Talagayniwa, Talasyawma, Nasingayniwa, Lomayawma, Tawalestiwa, Aqawsi, and Qoiwiso.
On May 23, 1881, Chief Spotted Tail and parents from the Rosebud Sioux Tribe requested that the Federal Government return the human remains of Rosebud Sioux Tribe children buried at the Carlisle School to their Indian Reservation in South Dakota. On July 14, 2021—over 140 years later—the Army transferred the human remains of nine children to the Rosebud Sioux Tribe to return them to their homelands. The names of these nine children were: Dennis Strikes First (Blue Tomahawk); Rose Long Face (Little Hawk); Lucy Take The Tail (Pretty Eagle); Warren Painter (Bear Paints Dirt); Ernest Knocks Off (White Thunder); Maud Little Girl (Swift Bear); Alvan, aka Roaster, Kills Seven Horses, One That Kills Seven Horses; Friend Hollow Horn Bear; and Dora Her Pipe (Brave Bull). The Army is currently implementing its Carlisle Barracks Disinterment Program, which, consistent with Army regulations and policy, promotes engagement with the Tribes and
families of the children who died at the Carlisle School to return their remains to their ancestral homelands. This program has successfully disinterred and returned the remains of 41 children to their families.
Many buildings that made up or are connected to the original Carlisle School campus remain. Twenty-four historic structures associated with the Carlisle School have been preserved by the Army and stand today within the National Historic Landmark district at Carlisle Barracks. In addition to those structures mentioned above, the site also includes living quarters, the Superintendent's residence, the “Pop” Warner House, Washington Hall, the Hessian Powder Magazine (built in 1777 and known since 1870 as a guard house), and athletic fields that parallel the original Carlisle School track. The four School Road Gateposts, when constructed in 1910, marked the main entrance to the boarding school campus.
Designating the former campus of the Carlisle School, with boundaries consistent with the National Historic Landmark, as a national monument will help ensure this shameful chapter of American history is never forgotten or repeated. Establishing a national monument at the historic Carlisle School and acknowledging the Federal Government's policies aimed at destroying Tribal and Indigenous political structures, cultures, and traditions—including through the Federal Indian boarding school system—takes a step toward redress and national healing in the arc of the survival, resilience, and triumph of Indian Tribes (including Alaska Native Villages) and the Native Hawaiian Community.
WHEREAS, section 320301 of title 54, United States Code (the “Antiquities Act”), authorizes the President, in the President's discretion, to declare by public proclamation historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic or scientific interest that are situated upon the lands owned or controlled by the Federal Government to be national monuments, and to reserve as a part thereof parcels of land, the limits of which shall be confined to the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected; and
WHEREAS, the Department of the Interior, at the direction of the Secretary of the Interior, who is herself a descendant of survivors of the Federal Indian boarding school system, established the Federal Indian Boarding School Initiative, which has helped bring to light the extensive breadth and depth of the role the Federal Government played in creating the Federal Indian boarding school system; and
WHEREAS, I issued a long-overdue Presidential apology to Tribal Nations and Native people on behalf of the Federal Government acknowledging the lasting harms caused by the Federal Indian boarding school policy and recognizing the need to learn from this history and advance the goal of healing; and
WHEREAS, the Carlisle School was the Nation's first off-reservation Federal Indian boarding school, provided a template for institutions across the Nation and internationally for its assimilation practices, and today remains one of the Nation's best-preserved examples of the Federal Indian boarding school era; and
WHEREAS, the Department of the Army (Army) has taken steps to preserve part of the Carlisle School campus and the historic objects it contains, ensuring that its history can be told; and
WHEREAS, the historic buildings and pathways that are part of the Carlisle School campus—where thousands of Native children lived, and in some cases died, far from their families, Tribes, and homelands; were compelled to participate in school activities designed to separate them from their cultures and identities; and performed compulsory manual labor—are important historic objects that reflect and embody the Carlisle School's years of operation and the similar practices of other institutions in the Federal Indian boarding school system; and
WHEREAS, the School Road Gateposts are a nationally significant passageway and an historic object on the site through which Native children walked after being removed from their homes and families during the Federal Indian boarding school era, and are contributing features of the Carlisle Indian Industrial School National Historic Landmark first designated by the Secretary of the Interior in 1961 and updated in 1985; and
WHEREAS, designation of the monument will further the efforts of the United States to aid in recovery, reconciliation, and healing for Indian Tribes, the Native Hawaiian Community, and survivors and their descendants affected by the Federal Indian boarding school system, while honoring and mourning the lives of Native children lost and celebrating those who persisted; and
WHEREAS, I find that all the objects identified above, and objects of the type identified above within the area described herein, are objects of historic interest in need of protection under section 320301 of title 54, United States Code, regardless of whether they are expressly identified as objects of historic interest in the text of this proclamation; and
WHEREAS, I find that the boundaries of the monument reserved by this proclamation represent the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects of historic interest identified above, as required by the Antiquities Act; and
WHEREAS, it is in the public interest to preserve and protect the objects of historic interest associated with the Carlisle School and its prominent role in the story of Federal Indian boarding schools instituted under the United States policy of forced assimilation of Native children;
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by section 320301 of title 54, United States Code, hereby proclaim the objects identified above that are situated upon lands and interests in lands owned or controlled by the Federal Government to be part of the Carlisle Federal Indian Boarding School National Monument (monument) and, for the purpose of protecting those objects, reserve as part thereof all lands and interests in lands that are owned or controlled by the Government of the United States within the boundaries described on the accompanying map, which is attached to and forms a part of this proclamation. The reserved Federal lands and interests in lands within the monument's boundaries consist of approximately 24.5 acres, which are coextensive with the boundaries of the Carlisle Indian Industrial School National Historic Landmark and lie within the approximately 520-acre boundary of Carlisle Barracks. The boundaries described on the accompanying map are confined to the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected.
All Federal lands and interests in lands within the boundaries of the monument are hereby appropriated and withdrawn from all forms of entry, location, selection, sale, or other disposition under the public land laws or laws applicable to the Army, including withdrawal from location, entry, and patent under the mining laws, and from disposition under all laws relating to mineral, solar, and geothermal leasing. The establishment of the monument is subject to valid existing rights.
The Secretary of the Army is hereby directed to transfer to the National Park Service (NPS) administrative jurisdiction over the approximately 258 square feet (0.006 acres) identified by the Army as the School Road Gateposts. In furtherance of the Antiquities Act and pursuant to their respective legal authorities, the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of the Army shall manage the monument through the NPS and the Army, respectively. The management of the monument shall be conducted in a cooperative manner, in accordance with the terms, conditions, and direction provided by this proclamation, and consistent with an agreement between the NPS and the Army that details their respective duties and responsibilities for management of the monument.
Following transfer of administrative jurisdiction over the School Road Gateposts, the NPS shall administer that portion of the monument, and the Army shall continue to administer the remaining portion of the monument. The NPS shall be responsible for interpretation of and education regarding the entirety of the monument in consultation with the Army.
Within 3 years of the date of this proclamation, or as soon as practicable to incorporate Tribal views, knowledge, and expertise, as appropriate, for the purpose of preserving, interpreting, and enhancing the public understanding and appreciation of the monument, the NPS, in consultation with the Army, shall prepare a management plan for the monument. The management plan shall ensure the monument fulfills the following purposes for the benefit of present and future generations: (1) to preserve the historic resources within the boundaries of the monument; (2) to interpret the story of the Carlisle School and its significance to the history of the Federal Indian boarding school system; and (3) to commemorate the efforts and resilience of Tribal Nations and Indigenous Peoples, including survivors of the Carlisle School and others affected by Federal Indian boarding schools, who are working to advance healing and reconciliation, to recover Native languages and cultures, and to chart a vibrant future for all Native children.
In recognition of the centrality of Tribal participation to tell this story, to inform interpretation of the objects that are part of the monument, and to enhance public understanding and appreciation of the monument, the Secretary of the Interior, through the NPS and in coordination with the Army, shall meaningfully engage Tribal Nations and the Native Hawaiian Community in the development of the management plan and ongoing management of the monument. The Secretary of the Interior, through the NPS, shall also take steps to ensure that management decisions affecting the monument incorporate Tribal expertise and Indigenous Knowledge in an appropriate manner consistent with Tribal Nations' concerns for protecting Indigenous Knowledge and expertise. The Secretary of the Interior, through the NPS, shall enter into an agreement with interested federally recognized Indian Tribes to set forth terms, pursuant to applicable laws, regulations, and policies, for co-stewardship of the monument. The Secretary of the Interior,
through the NPS, shall also provide for consultation with any federally recognized Indian Tribe with historical connections to any part of the Federal Indian boarding school system regarding the interpretation of that system's history at the monument.
As the Federal Indian boarding school system affected nearly every Indian Tribe (including Alaska Native Villages) and the Native Hawaiian Community, and in view of the wide array of resulting experiences and perspectives, the Secretary of the Interior, through the NPS, is also directed, as appropriate, to use applicable authorities to seek to enter into agreements with other entities to address common interests related to the interpretation of and education regarding the monument, and care and preservation of historic objects therein. These entities may include Dickinson College; the Cumberland County Historical Society; Phoenix Indian School; Haskell Indian Nations University; Stewart Indian School Cultural Center and Museum; Sheldon Jackson Museum; Fort Apache Heritage Foundation, Inc.; Kamehameha Schools; and existing National Park System units with resources related to the Federal Indian boarding school system.
Nothing in this proclamation shall affect or diminish the Army's authority to administer Carlisle Barracks, including the Army's ability to execute its mission at Carlisle Barracks, or the Army's obligations to comply with environmental protection and historic preservation laws or engage in appropriate Tribal consultation. Further, nothing in this proclamation shall limit the Army's ability to control public access to Carlisle Barracks or take all necessary measures to ensure emergency preparedness, safety, and security.
Nothing in this proclamation shall be deemed to revoke any existing withdrawal, reservation, or appropriation; however, the monument shall be the dominant reservation.
Warning is hereby given to all unauthorized persons not to appropriate, injure, destroy, or remove any feature of the monument and not to locate or settle upon any of the lands thereof.
If any provision of this proclamation, including application to a particular parcel of land, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this proclamation and its application to other parcels of land shall not be affected thereby.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day of December, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# Human Rights Day and Human Rights Week, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
On Human Rights Day and during Human Rights Week, we recommit to upholding the equal and inalienable rights of all people.
America was founded on an idea—that every person is created equal and deserves to be treated equally throughout their lives. And 76 years ago today, after the wreckage of 2 world wars and the Holocaust, the United States joined countries around the globe to enshrine this idea into a Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We also helped establish the United Nations, upholding the inherent dignity of every person on the world stage and establishing a rules-based international order. Today, our country continues to stand with our partners and allies to defend human rights and fundamental freedoms around the world—from combatting threats to silence and intimidate human rights defenders like journalists to championing democracy, fair elections, and the universal human rights to freedoms of association, peaceful assembly, religion, and expression. When crises erupt, we protect civilians from mass atrocities, promote accountability for those responsible for human rights violations and abuses, seek to free political prisoners, and create space for civilian dialogue. This year, we also recognize another landmark achievement in the global fight for human rights with the 40th anniversary of the adoption of the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. And we continue to stand with free people everywhere who are bravely fighting for justice and defending life and liberty at home and around the world.
My Administration has been committed to protecting the dignity and rights of people here at home and around the globe. We established the White House Gender Policy Council to advance the rights and opportunities of women and girls across domestic and foreign policy—from preventing and responding to gender-based violence to promoting participation in peace and security efforts. We rejoined the United Nations Human Rights Council to highlight and address pressing human rights concerns. From the beginning of my Administration, we have worked to protect the rights of LGBTQI+ people, working toward a future where no one is targeted or persecuted because of who they are. We are working to ensure all people are treated equally and have equal access to opportunities, no matter who they are or where they come from. We have made progress in bringing new investments to communities that have too often been left behind and in expanding accessibility for people with disabilities. And we have worked to advance technology in support of democracy and internet freedom, while leading important efforts to stop the expansion and misuse of commercial spyware, which has enabled human rights abuses around the world.
I have made the preservation of democracy—the best tool for protecting human rights—the central cause of my Presidency. That is why we convened the Summit for Democracy to strengthen democratic institutions, root out corruption, promote gender equality and human rights, and reject
political violence. There will always be forces that pull the world apart: aggression, extremism, chaos, cynicism, and a desire to retreat from the world and go it alone. The task of our time is to ensure that the forces holding us together are stronger than those that are pulling us apart. Together, we can make sure our shared values and determination withstand any challenge.
Today and this week, may we reaffirm our commitment to standing up for human rights at home and around the world. The future will be won by those who unleash the full potential of their people to live with dignity, prosper, think freely, innovate, and exist and love openly without fear. Together, nothing is beyond our capacity.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim December 10, 2024, as Human Rights Day and the week beginning December 10, 2024, as Human Rights Week. I call upon the people of the United States to mark these observances with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day of December, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.
Proclamation 10872 of December 13, 2024
Proc. 10872

# Bill of Rights Day, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
America is the only country in the world founded on an idea: that we are all created equal and deserve to be treated equally throughout our lives. Two hundred and thirty-three years ago today, that idea was at the heart of our Nation's Bill of Rights, launching the greatest self-government experiment in the history of the world and endowing all of us with fundamental rights and liberties. Today, we recommit to safeguarding those first 10 freedoms guaranteed by the Bill of Rights and all the progress we have made to protect Americans since.
The freedoms guaranteed to us in the Bill of Rights help define the soul of our Nation. The first 10 Amendments to the United States Constitution include the freedoms of religion, speech, press, assembly, and privacy, which form our Nation's north star. And the 17 additional Amendments that came later helped our Nation realize its promise of liberty and justice for all—from abolishing our Nation's original sin of slavery to giving women the right to vote.
But freedom is never guaranteed—every generation has had to defend and fight for it. In recent years, long-established civil rights principles and protections have been undermined and challenged. The Supreme Court gutted
the Voting Rights Act in 2013, opening the floodgates to a new wave of restrictive voting laws that States across the country have passed. Anti-LGBTQI+ rights bills have emboldened discrimination against Americans for who they are and whom they love. And in 2022, the Court overruled
Roe
v.
Wade
and took away the constitutional right to choose, which had been the law of the land for nearly 50 years.
As President, I made it my mission to protect our democracy and the freedoms it guarantees. When the Supreme Court overturned
Roe
v.
Wade
, I took executive action to protect women's access to reproductive health care. To protect the will of the people, right to vote, and have that vote counted—which is the threshold of democracy and liberty—I signed the Electoral Count Reform Act to ensure the peaceful transfer of power. And to protect the civil rights and liberties of LGBTQI+ Americans, I signed the landmark Respect for Marriage Act, upholding the rights of same-sex and interracial couples. But there is still more to do to ensure that our Nation respects the civil rights and liberties of all Americans. I continue to call on the Congress to restore the protections of
Roe
v.
Wade
in Federal law and pass the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act.
On Bill of Rights Day, we recommit to protecting and expanding Americans’ civil rights and liberties. We must continue fighting for progress and following our Nation's north star, securing dignity and respect for all Americans. And we must continue to strengthen the guardrails of our democracy, ensuring that our Nation and all the freedoms it guarantees will be enjoyed for generations to come. I know we can do it—because together, nothing is beyond our capacity.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim December 15, 2024, as Bill of Rights Day. I call upon the people of the United States to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirteenth day of December, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.
Proclamation 10873 of December 16, 2024
Proc. 10873

# Establishment of the Frances Perkins National MonumentBy the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Few Americans have had deeper influence in shaping labor and social policy in the United States than Frances Perkins. Perkins became the first woman to serve as a Cabinet Secretary when President Franklin Delano Roosevelt appointed her as the Secretary of Labor in 1933. During the subsequent 12 years, Secretary Perkins played a pivotal role in constructing
the New Deal and helping to guide the country out of the Great Depression by designing and leading the implementation of sweeping labor and economic reforms that have made life better for generations of Americans. The longest serving Secretary of Labor in United States history, Secretary Perkins was the architect of many programs and standards—including a minimum wage, overtime pay, unemployment insurance, and prohibitions on child labor—that have endured as the backbone of Federal support for workers and families and continue to benefit millions of Americans today. Secretary Perkins chaired President Roosevelt's effort to investigate the benefits of social insurance and then worked to achieve passage of the Social Security Act, which became one of the most successful programs in the United States to prevent poverty among older adults. When the United States and other nations initially failed to face the horrors of the Holocaust, Secretary Perkins demonstrated leadership on behalf of immigrants and refugees by actively working to bring Jewish children and adults from Europe to the United States to ensure their safety.
The Perkins Homestead in Newcastle, Maine, played a pivotal role in Frances Perkins' life and supported her work to deliver lasting protection and benefits to American workers and families. The rural setting of the Perkins Homestead on the Damariscotta River was the place she felt most at home. She spent her childhood summers there and returned frequently for respite throughout her career. Continuously owned by her family for over 260 years, the Perkins Homestead remains much as it was during Secretary Perkins' lifetime, including the buildings, structures, gardens, and paths where she spent substantial time throughout her life. The core area contains historic structures including a brick house, an attached barn, a gravel driveway, a garden, and portions of a stone wall. The surrounding landscape of the Perkins Homestead contains additional portions of the stone wall, an ice pond, walking trails, a family cemetery, foundations of the 18th and 19th century Perkins Homestead buildings, and remnants of a pre-Revolutionary era garrison. Visitors to the Perkins Homestead today can wander through these places where Perkins returned time and again during her Government service. They can view the stone wall where she sat listening to the radio on September 1, 1939, when it was reported that the Germans invaded Poland, prompting her to rush back to Washington, DC, to assist the President. Preserving the core area of the Perkins Homestead and its associated historic objects will ensure that current and future generations have the opportunity to learn about Secretary Perkins' foundational contributions to the Nation's social and labor policy through the place that helped shape her as a person and support her throughout her extraordinary career.
Frances Perkins was born in Boston as Fannie Coralie Perkins in 1880. At the age of 25, she changed her name to Frances Perkins, which she used for the rest of her life, even after marriage. She graduated in 1902 from Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts, where she credited a class trip to a nearby mill with inspiring her early interest in improving working conditions for women and children.
After college, Frances Perkins worked with social service organizations in Chicago and Philadelphia, including settlement houses for poor and unemployed people and an organization to support and protect immigrant and Black women and girls from labor and sexual exploitation they faced upon
arrival in these cities looking for work. These experiences deepened her resolve to help reduce poverty and support the working poor.
In 1911, while employed at the New York City Consumers' League, Frances Perkins heard the sirens of fire engines racing to put out flames that had engulfed the nearby Triangle Shirtwaist Factory. Running to the site of the fire, she witnessed the horrific scene of workers, mostly young women, jumping to their deaths after being locked in the factory. In total, 146 people died in the fire—including many immigrant workers. Perkins later cited that tragic day as the impetus for policies that would become central to the New Deal.
Perkins' subsequent work at the New York Factory Investigating Commission, where she investigated and advocated for worker health and safety reforms, led to 33 new State laws that improved worker safety, workplace sanitation, and working conditions; provided workers' compensation; and placed limits on child labor. These were some of the first workplace health and safety standards in the Nation, and they became models that other States and the Federal Government adopted.
In 1919, Perkins was named to the New York State Industrial Commission, making her the first woman appointed to serve in a New York State government administration. In 1929, newly elected Governor Franklin Delano Roosevelt asked Perkins to become the State's Industrial Commissioner and oversee the labor department. As the United States careened toward the Great Depression, Perkins used her position to shine a national spotlight on rising unemployment while also helping workers in New York and elsewhere by connecting them to jobs through a State employment service and inviting surrounding States to participate in an unemployment insurance system. Her early warnings regarding the depth of the Nation's economic problems and her work to develop solutions established Perkins as a national leader in the 20th century employment and labor reform movements.
When President Roosevelt formally asked Perkins to join his Cabinet as Secretary of Labor, she responded by saying that if she accepted the position, she intended to execute an ambitious plan of action that included establishing maximum hours and minimum wages, ending child labor, developing unemployment relief through public works, providing unemployment insurance, and creating an old-age pension and a national health insurance program. After detailing her plan, she asked if President Roosevelt was sure he wanted this list of policies put in place, explaining that, “you won't want me for Secretary of Labor if you don't want those things done.” President Roosevelt responded that he would back her; he had promised the American people that he would improve their lives, and he intended to keep his promise.
At a time when few women were in leadership positions and just 13 years after the 19th Amendment granted women the right to vote, Frances Perkins became Secretary of Labor. During an unprecedented 12 years in the position—from 1933 to 1945—Secretary Perkins achieved hard-fought social and economic reforms, often over vocal opposition and personal attacks from critics. She summarized her work in a five-page letter to President Roosevelt, describing the reforms as “a turning point in our national life—a turning from careless neglect of human values and toward an order
. . . of mutual and practical benevolence within a free competitive industrial economy.” The list of accomplishments detailed in her letter encompasses many programs and laws that continue to undergird the Nation's economy and social safety net, including establishing Social Security and contributing to the development of the Fair Labor Standards Act and the Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act. She also helped create millions of jobs across the country through the novel Civilian Conservation Corps and Public Works Administration.
As Secretary of Labor, Perkins often supported the rights of workers to organize unions and to negotiate with employers through collective action, laying the foundation for the rebirth of American labor—including through helping write recovery legislation that provided a right to collective bargaining and laid the groundwork for the National Labor Relations Act of 1935 (also known as the Wagner Act). She used her post not only to advance labor protections in national policy, but also to call personally for workers' fair treatment and access to the halls of power. She persuaded President Roosevelt not to deploy Federal troops to quell the 1934 San Francisco General Strike, and instead encouraged the parties to settle their differences, which was accomplished within a week, and she frequently advised President Roosevelt to help resolve contentious strikes for the benefit of workers.
At the close of her time at the Department of Labor, Perkins had accomplished nearly all of the items in the ambitious plan she laid out for President Roosevelt when he asked her to serve, but she lamented the one exception: health care benefits for American workers. Historians have also noted that, because of deep racial inequities and injustices of the time—including segregation—the benefits of the New Deal were not available to all Americans initially.
When her time as Secretary of Labor concluded, Perkins continued in public service as President Harry Truman's appointee to the United States Civil Service Commission, a post she held from 1945 until 1953. She then became a lecturer at the New York State School of Industrial and Labor Relations at Cornell University, a role she held until her death in 1965.
When Secretary Perkins died, the Secretary of Labor at the time, W. Willard Wirtz, recognized her legacy as central to the New Deal, stating that “every man and woman in America who works at a living wage, under safe conditions, for reasonable hours, or who is protected by unemployment insurance or social security is her debtor.” The final resting place of Secretary Perkins is near her daughter, husband, sister, parents, and grandparents in the Glidden Cemetery, located a half mile north of the Perkins Homestead in Newcastle, Maine.
Throughout Perkins' life and career, the Perkins Homestead served as a place of rejuvenation and reflection, including during her time as Secretary of Labor. Throughout her working life, she continued the family tradition of summer visits to Maine, often living there with her daughter from August into September. Perkins and her sister became joint owners of the property in 1927 and it stayed within the family until 2020. Perkins wrote about how the woods surrounding the brick house and the shoreline at the Perkins Homestead's edge restored and comforted her, and how the brick house provided a place for her to relax and to recover from her work as Secretary of Labor.
The Perkins Homestead, originally over 200 acres, was settled by Perkins' great-great grandfather in the early 1700s. A mid-18th century garrison existed on the property that was in use for 3 years during the French and Indian War.
The core area, on the west end of the Perkins Homestead, has a brick house built by the Perkins family in 1837 along with a connected barn. The two-story home is constructed of bricks manufactured on site at the family brickyard. The east end of the Perkins Homestead borders the Damariscotta River and has a family cemetery, foundations of the 18th and 19th century Perkins Homestead buildings, the remains of the brick kilns, wharves, and a clay pit from the 19th century brickyard, as well as the remains of the garrison. Agricultural fields, pastures, woodland, and planted trees connect the two sides of the Perkins Homestead.
The National Park Service first documented the Perkins Homestead through the Historic American Buildings Survey in 1960, while Secretary Perkins still occupied the home. In 2009, the National Park Service listed the Brick House Historic District on the National Register of Historic Places; the Brick House Historic District included the brick house, adjacent structures, and the wooded and agricultural lands extending to the shoreline of the Damariscotta River. In 2014, the Secretary of the Interior designated this same 57 acres as the Perkins Homestead National Historic Landmark, recognizing the property's historic importance and nationally significant association with Frances Perkins.
The Perkins Homestead contains several objects that reflect Secretary Perkins' lifelong commitment to supporting and protecting American workers. Hanging above a doorway in the brick house is a custom “No Smoking” sign that reflects the lasting influence the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire had on Perkins. It reads: “Please Do Not SMOKE In Any Part of This Building. DANGEROUS. F. Perkins.” The brick house also includes Secretary Perkins' Award for Distinguished Service, which the Department of Labor presented to her on March 4, 1963, on the occasion of the Department's 50th anniversary. The Award citation reads: “For her courage in entering an arena previously considered a masculine domain; for her strength in guiding the Department through a dozen years of domestic stress and international travail; for her spirit in waging the good fight for good objectives; and finally, for herself.”
Conserving the Perkins Homestead will ensure that the family home and surrounding landscape that were a constant source of support for Secretary Perkins will remain protected and accessible in perpetuity for the benefit of all people to learn about her life, her unparalleled contributions to labor and social policy that would eventually benefit generations of Americans, and core principles at the heart of the New Deal that she championed: economic security and dignity for workers.

# Wright Brothers Day, 2024By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
On Wright Brothers Day, we celebrate the bold vision, steadfast determination, and transformative innovation of Orville and Wilbur Wright. Their aircraft, which completed the first sustained, controlled, and powered flight 121 years ago, forever altered the course of human history and took our Nation to new heights.
The Wright brothers embody the best of America's grit, heart, and unstoppable spirit of ingenuity. Before they took to the skies that fateful December day, the Wright brothers had spent years conducting arduous research, redesigns, and dangerous trials. They were driven by the belief that what so many had written off as impossible could actually be done—that sustained, controlled, and powered flight was possible. And on the sand dunes of Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, on December 17, 1903, they were proven right—their aircraft, the Wright Flyer, took flight for 12 seconds. In less than a minute, that one feat altered our understanding of technological possibilities and human potential forever, laying the foundation for putting a man on the moon; breaking the sound barrier; and beginning a new, deeper exploration of our universe.
My Administration has been committed to building on their legacy of innovation and advancement. We have made improvements to modern air travel—from making airports more accessible through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to making air travel safer. And we have harnessed the spirit of American ingenuity in everything we do, like tackling the climate crisis, working toward ending cancer as we know it, and ensuring that the technologies of the future will benefit Americans for generations to come.
On Wright Brothers Day, we honor two visionary men from Dayton, Ohio, who chose to look to the sky with not just wonder but with an ambition to take Americans where no one had gone before. Because of their work, generations of visionary scientists, engineers, and dreamers and doers have followed in their footsteps, believing that, here in America, we do big things and nothing is beyond our capacity.
The Congress, by a joint resolution approved December 17, 1963, as amended (77 Stat. 402; 36 U.S.C. 143), has designated December 17 of each year as “Wright Brothers Day” and has authorized and requested the President to issue annually a proclamation inviting the people of the United States to observe that day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim December 17, 2024, as Wright Brothers Day.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixteenth day of December, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# To Implement the United States-Israel Agreement on Trade in Agricultural Products and for Other PurposesBy the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
1. On April 22, 1985, the United States and Israel entered into the Agreement on the Establishment of a Free Trade Area between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of Israel (USIFTA), which the Congress approved in section 3 of the United States-Israel Free Trade Area Implementation Act of 1985 (the “USIFTA Implementation Act”) (Public Law 99-47, 99 Stat. 82 (19 U.S.C. 2112 note)). Section 4(b) of the USIFTA Implementation Act provides that, whenever the President determines that it is necessary to maintain the general level of reciprocal and mutually advantageous concessions with respect to Israel provided for by the USIFTA, the President may proclaim such withdrawal, suspension, modification, or continuance of any duty, or such continuance of existing duty-free or excise treatment, or such additional duties, as the President determines to be required or appropriate to carry out the USIFTA. In order to maintain the general level of reciprocal and mutually advantageous concessions with respect to agricultural trade with Israel, on July 27, 2004, the United States entered into an agreement with Israel concerning certain aspects of trade in agricultural products during the period January 1, 2004, through December 31, 2008 (United States-Israel Agreement Concerning Certain Aspects of Trade in Agricultural Products (the “2004 Agreement”)).
2. In Proclamation 7826 of October 4, 2004, the President determined, pursuant to section 4(b) of the USIFTA Implementation Act and consistent with the 2004 Agreement, that, in order to maintain the general level of reciprocal and mutually advantageous concessions with respect to Israel provided for by the USIFTA, it was necessary to provide duty-free access into the United States through December 31, 2008, for specified quantities of certain agricultural products of Israel. Each year from 2008 through 2023, the United States and Israel entered into agreements to extend the period that the 2004 Agreement was in force for 1-year periods to allow additional time for the two governments to conclude an agreement to replace the 2004 Agreement. To carry out the extension agreements, the President in Proclamations 8334 of December 31, 2008; 8467 of December 23, 2009; 8618 of December 21, 2010; 8770 of December 29, 2011; 8921 of December 20, 2012; 9072 of December 23, 2013; 9223 of December 23, 2014; 9383 of December 21, 2015; 9555 of December 15, 2016; 9687 of December 22, 2017; 9834 of December 21, 2018; 9974 of December 26, 2019; 10128 of December 22, 2020; 10326 of December 23, 2021; 10509 of December 23, 2022; and 10692 of December 29, 2023, modified the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) to provide duty-free access into the United States for specified quantities of certain agricultural products of Israel, each time for an additional 1-year period. On October 31, 2024, the United States entered into an agreement with Israel to extend the period that the 2004 Agreement is in force through December 31, 2025, and to allow for further negotiations on an agreement to replace the 2004 Agreement. Pursuant to section 4(b) of the USIFTA Implementation Act, I have determined that it
is necessary, in order to maintain the general level of reciprocal and mutually advantageous concessions with respect to Israel provided for by the USIFTA, to provide duty-free access into the United States through the close of December 31, 2025, for specified quantities of certain agricultural products of Israel, as provided in Annex I of this proclamation.
3. Proclamation 10053 of June 29, 2020, implemented the Agreement between the United States of America, the United Mexican States, and Canada (USMCA) with respect to the United States and, pursuant to section 103 of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement Implementation Act (the “USMCA Implementation Act”) (Public Law 116-113, 134 Stat. 11, 15-17 (19 U.S.C. 4513)), incorporated in the HTS the tariff modifications and rules of origin necessary or appropriate to carry out the USMCA.
4. In order to provide generally for the preferential tariff treatment being accorded under the USMCA, to set forth rules for determining whether goods imported into the customs territory of the United States are eligible for preferential tariff treatment under the USMCA, to provide tariff-rate quotas with respect to certain originating goods of Canada, and to provide certain other treatment to originating goods for purposes of the USMCA, Proclamation 10053 modified the HTS as set forth in Annex I of Publication 5060 of the United States International Trade Commission (the “Commission”), entitled “Modifications to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States to Implement the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement” (Publication 5060), including by adding general note 11. Proclamation 10053 further modified the HTS to reflect the termination of tariff treatment under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), as set forth in Annex III of Publication 5060, including by deleting general note 12.
5. In order to implement the initial stage of duty reduction provided for in the USMCA, to provide for future staged reductions in duties for originating goods provided for in the USMCA, and to provide tariff-rate quotas with respect to certain goods provided for in the USMCA, Proclamation 10053 modified the HTS as set forth in Annex II of Publication 5060.
6. A technical error was made in the modifications to U.S. note 3(d) to subchapter II of chapter 98 of the HTS, and certain references to general note 12 were inadvertently not modified. I have determined that additional modifications to the HTS are necessary or appropriate to provide for the intended tariff treatment under the USMCA, including certain technical or conforming changes within the tariff schedule.
7. Proclamation 7987 of February 28, 2006, implemented the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA) with respect to the United States and, pursuant to section 201 of the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (the “DR-CAFTA Act”) (Public Law 109-53, 119 Stat. 462, 467 (19 U.S.C. 4001 note)), incorporated in the HTS the tariff modifications and rules of origin necessary or appropriate to carry out certain provisions of the DR-CAFTA.
8. A rule of origin under the DR-CAFTA, found in general note 29 to the HTS, contains a reference to general note 12. Proclamation 10053 deleted general note 12 but omitted a conforming change to the reference in general note 29. I have determined that an additional modification to the HTS is necessary or appropriate to reflect this conforming change.
9. Section 602 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (Public Law 116-260, 134 Stat. 1182, 2152-54), made technical corrections to other laws, including replacing certain references to the NAFTA with references to the USMCA in sections 112 and 113(b) of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (the “AGOA”) (title I of Public Law 106-200, 114 Stat. 251, 258-265 (19 U.S.C. 3721, 3722(b))), as amended by the Africa Investment Incentive Act of 2006 (title VI of Public Law 109-432, 120 Stat. 2922, 3190-94), and in sections 212(a), 213(b), and 213A(b) of the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (the “CBERA”) (title II of Public Law 98-67, 97 Stat. 369, 384-85, 388 (19 U.S.C. 2702(a)(1), 2703(b), 2703a(b))), as amended by the United States-Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act (title II of Public Law 106-200, 114 Stat. 251, 275-288), the Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity through Partnership Encouragement Act of 2006 (title V of Public Law 109-432, 109 Stat. 2922, 3181-87), and the Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity through Partnership Encouragement Act of 2008 (subtitle D of Public Law 110-234, 122 Stat. 923, 1527-47).
10. I have determined that additional modifications to the HTS are necessary or appropriate to provide for the intended tariff treatment under the AGOA and the CBERA, including certain technical or conforming changes within the tariff schedule.
11. Section 104(c) of the Trade Preferences Extension Act of 2015 (the “TPEA”) (Public Law 114-27, 129 Stat. 362, 365 (19 U.S.C. 2466a note)) authorizes the President to proclaim modifications that may be necessary to add the special tariff treatment symbol “D” in the “Special” subcolumn of the HTS for each article classified under a heading or subheading with the special tariff treatment symbol “A” or “A*” in the “Special” subcolumn of the HTS. Pursuant to section 104(c) of the TPEA, Proclamation 9466 of June 30, 2016, modified the HTS to add the special tariff treatment symbol “D” in the HTS as set forth in Annex III of that proclamation.
12. The modifications to the HTS authorized in Proclamation 9466 included certain technical errors. I have determined that additional modifications to the HTS are necessary or appropriate to provide for the intended tariff treatment under the AGOA, as authorized by section 104(c) of the TPEA, including certain technical or conforming changes within the tariff schedule.
13. Proclamation 6763 of December 23, 1994, implemented, with respect to the United States, the trade agreements resulting from the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations, including Schedule XX-United States of America, annexed to the Marrakesh Protocol to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (Schedule XX), that were entered into pursuant to sections 1102(a) and (e) of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 (the “1988 Act”) (Public Law 100-418, 102 Stat. 1107, 1126 (19 U.S.C. 2902(a) and (e))), as amended by Public Law 103-49, 107 Stat. 239, and approved in section 101(a) of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (the “URAA”) (Public Law 103-465, 108 Stat. 4809, 4814-15 (19 U.S.C. 3511(a))).
14. Pursuant to the authority provided in section 111 of the URAA (19 U.S.C. 3521) and sections 1102(a) and (e) of the 1988 Act (19 U.S.C. 2902(a) and (e)), Proclamation 6763 included the staged reductions in rates of duty that the President determined to be necessary or appropriate to carry out the terms of Schedule XX.
15. Section 1205(a) of the 1988 Act (102 Stat. 1150 (19 U.S.C. 3005(a))) directs the Commission to keep the HTS under continuous review and to periodically recommend to the President such modifications to the HTS as the Commission considers necessary or appropriate to accomplish the purposes set forth in that subsection.
16. Pursuant to sections 1205(c) and (d) of the 1988 Act (102 Stat. 1150-51 (19 U.S.C. 3005(c) and (d))), in 2010, 2015, and 2021, the Commission recommended modifications to the HTS to conform the HTS to amendments made to the International Convention on the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System and the Protocol thereto (the “Convention”).
17. Section 1206(a) of the 1988 Act (102 Stat. 1151 (19 U.S.C. 3006(a))) authorizes the President to proclaim modifications to the HTS based on the recommendations of the Commission under section 1205 of the 1988 Act if the President determines that the modifications are in conformity with United States obligations under the Convention and do not run counter to the national economic interest of the United States.
18. Proclamation 8771 of December 29, 2011, Proclamation 9549 of December 1, 2016, and Proclamation 10326 of December 23, 2021, modified the HTS pursuant to section 1206 of the 1988 Act to conform the HTS to the amendments to the Convention. However, the HTS modifications authorized in Proclamation 8771, Proclamation 9549, and Proclamation 10326 each included certain technical errors.
19. Proclamation 8771 incorrectly modified the column 2 rate of duty for subheadings 0401.40.25 and 0401.50.25, and the “General” subcolumn rate of duty for column 1 and the column 2 rate of duty for subheading 6505.00.01. I have determined that additional modifications to the HTS are necessary or appropriate to provide for the intended tariff treatment.
20. Proclamation 9549 and Proclamation 10326 each created certain new subheadings with the special tariff treatment symbol “A” or “A*” in the “Special” subcolumn of the HTS, but omitted the special tariff treatment symbol “D”. I have determined that additional modifications to the HTS are necessary or appropriate to provide for the intended tariff treatment under the AGOA, including certain technical or conforming changes within the tariff schedule.
21. Proclamation 10326 also included technical errors with respect to other subheadings. I have determined that additional modifications to the HTS are necessary or appropriate to provide for the intended tariff treatment, including the tariff treatment previously proclaimed in Proclamation 6763.
22. In Proclamation 9705 of March 8, 2018, pursuant to section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended (the “Trade Expansion Act”) (Public Law 87-794, 76 Stat. 872, 877 (19 U.S.C. 1862)), the President concurred with the finding of the Secretary of Commerce that steel articles, as defined in clause 1 of Proclamation 9705 (as amended by clause 8 of Proclamation 9711 of March 22, 2018), are being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States, and decided to adjust the imports of steel articles by imposing a 25 percent ad valorem tariff on such
articles imported from all countries except Canada and Mexico. Proclamation 9740 of April 30, 2018, and Proclamation 9759 of May 31, 2018, modified the HTS to provide quotas with respect to steel articles imported from certain countries. Proclamation 10328 of December 27, 2021, Proclamation 10356 of March 31, 2022, Proclamation 10406 of May 31, 2022, and Proclamation 10691 of December 28, 2023, modified the HTS to provide tariff-rate quotas with respect to steel articles imported from certain countries.
23. On July 1, 2024, the Commission, in cooperation with the interagency Committee for Statistical Annotation of Tariff Schedules, implemented certain changes in 10-digit statistical reporting categories of the HTS under section 484(f) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (ch. 497, 46 Stat. 590, 723 (19 U.S.C. 1484(f))), as amended by section 637 of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (Public Law 103-182, 107 Stat. 2057, 2202). I have determined that certain conforming amendments to the HTS are necessary in order to ensure the maintenance of duty rates, quotas, and tariff-rate quotas for steel articles under tariff categories that were modified.
24. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the “Trade Act”) (Public Law 93-618, 88 Stat. 1978, 2073 (19 U.S.C. 2483)), authorizes the President to embody in the HTS the substance of the relevant provisions of that Act, and of other acts affecting import treatment, and actions taken thereunder, including the removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including but not limited to section 4(b) of the USIFTA Implementation Act, section 104(c) of the TPEA, section 1206(a) of the 1988 Act, section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act, and section 604 of the Trade Act, do proclaim that:
(1) In order to implement tariff commitments under the 2004 Agreement through December 31, 2025, the HTS is modified as set forth in Annex I of this proclamation.
(2) The modifications and technical rectifications to the HTS made by Annex I of this proclamation shall enter into effect on the applicable dates set forth in Annex I of this proclamation.
(3) In order to make the modifications and technical rectifications to the HTS described in paragraphs 3 through 24 of this proclamation, the HTS is modified as set forth in Annex II of this proclamation. These modifications and technical rectifications shall enter into effect on the applicable dates set forth in Annex II of this proclamation.
(4) Any provisions of previous proclamations and Executive Orders that are inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation are superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of December, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

# Announcing the Death of James Earl Carter, Jr.By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
TO THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES:
It is my solemn duty to announce officially the death of James Earl Carter, Jr., the thirty-ninth President of the United States, on December 29, 2024.
President Carter was a man of character, courage, and compassion, whose lifetime of service defined him as one of the most influential statesmen in our history. He embodied the very best of America: A humble servant of God and the people. A heroic champion of global peace and human rights, and an honorable leader whose moral clarity and hopeful vision lifted our Nation and changed our world.
The son of a farmer and a nurse, President Carter's remarkable career in public service began in 1943 as a cadet at the United States Naval Academy. He later served in both the Atlantic and Pacific fleets before becoming a decorated lieutenant and being selected to join the elite nuclear submarine program.
After his father died, he shifted from active duty to the Navy Reserve and returned home to Plains, Georgia, to help manage his family's peanut farm. He worked hard stewarding the land while leading his community as a church deacon, Sunday school teacher, and board member of a hospital and library. His deep faith inspired a passion for public service that led him to be elected State Senator, Georgia's 76th Governor, and ultimately President of the United States.
As President, he understood that Government must be as good as its people—and his faith in the people was boundless just as his belief in America was limitless and his hope for our common future was perennial.
With President Carter's leadership, the modern Department of Education and the Department of Energy were created. He championed conservation, and his commitment to a more just world was at the heart of his foreign policy, leading on nuclear nonproliferation, signing the Panama Canal treaties, and mediating the historic 1978 Camp David Accords. His partnership with Vice President Walter Mondale is one that future administrations strived to achieve.
Following his Presidency, President Carter advanced an agenda that elevated the least among us. Guided by an unwavering belief in the power of human goodness and the God-given dignity of every human being, he worked tirelessly around the globe to broker peace; eradicate disease; house the homeless; and protect human rights, freedom, and democracy.
Through his extraordinary moral leadership, President Carter lived a noble life full of meaning and purpose. And as a trusted spiritual leader, he shepherded people through seasons of pain and joy, inspiring them through the power of his example and healing them through the power of his guidance.
As we mourn the loss of President Carter, we hold the memory of his beloved Rosalynn, his wife of over 77 years, close in our hearts. Exemplifying
hope, warmth, and service, she and her husband inspired the Nation. The love Rosalynn and President Carter shared is the definition of partnership, and their devotion to public service is the definition of patriotism.
May President Carter's memory continue to be a light pointing us forward. May we continue to be guided by his spirit in our Nation and in our world.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, in honor and tribute to the memory of President James Earl Carter, Jr., and as an expression of public sorrow, do hereby direct that the flag of the United States be displayed at half-staff at the White House and on all public buildings and grounds, at all military posts and naval stations, and on all naval vessels of the Federal Government in the District of Columbia and throughout the United States and its Territories and possessions for a period of 30 days from the day of his death. I also direct that, for the same length of time, the representatives of the United States in foreign countries shall make similar arrangements for the display of the flag at half-staff over their embassies, legations, consular offices, and other facilities abroad, including all military facilities and naval vessels and stations.
I hereby order that suitable honors be rendered by units of the Armed Forces under orders of the Secretary of Defense.
I do further appoint January 9, 2025, as a National Day of Mourning throughout the United States. I call on the American people to assemble on that day in their respective places of worship, there to pay homage to the memory of President James Earl Carter, Jr. I invite the people of the world who share our grief to join us in this solemn observance.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of December, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

Proc. 10877

# National Human Trafficking Prevention Month, 2025By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Across the world, more than 27 million people, including thousands here at home, are subjected to the shameful, abhorrent abuse of human trafficking and forced labor. Human trafficking targets the most vulnerable in society and exploits them—denying their human rights, freedom, and dignity. It is a stain on our collective conscience and an affront to basic human dignity. During National Human Trafficking Prevention Month, we recommit to working to end human trafficking in America and around the globe.
Any form of trafficking in people—from forced labor to sex trafficking—must not be tolerated, in the United States or anywhere around the world.
That is why in 2021, I signed an updated National Action Plan (NAP) to Combat Human Trafficking, detailing my Administration's focus on prosecuting perpetrators, protecting survivors, and partnering with governments and organizations around the globe to end this scourge. The NAP also recognizes that human traffickers target people considered vulnerable in society—people from racial and ethnic minorities, women and girls, LGBTQI+ individuals, and others from marginalized backgrounds.
Here at home, we have worked to crack down on human trafficking and combat gender-based violence in America. I remain proud that I first wrote the Violence Against Women Act as a United States Senator and I have worked to strengthen it ever since. That is why when I reauthorized it in 2022, I expanded Tribal court jurisdiction to prosecute non-Native sex traffickers. Furthermore, through my American Rescue Plan, my Administration delivered tens of thousands of housing vouchers to ensure people fleeing human trafficking or other violence have a safe home to go to. At the same time, we have been committed to working with survivors to support their path to recovery and healing, and improving our approach to preventing, identifying, and prosecuting these crimes. We have also taken steps to prevent trafficking in the United States by strengthening protections for vulnerable workers, including issuing new rules to improve worker protections and strengthen program integrity in temporary visa programs and releasing an updated version of the Department of State's Wilberforce “Know Your Rights” pamphlet.
Around the world, we are also working with governments and organizations to put a stop to human trafficking. I signed the bipartisan Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act in 2021 and, from the moment the law took effect in 2022, Federal agencies have been working to ensure that no American imports are produced using forced labor. I signed the first-ever Presidential Memorandum to prioritize strong labor standards in our Nation's foreign policy as we work to build a world where our economic system gives predatory traffickers no safe harbor. In the 2024 Trafficking in Persons Report, the Department of State measured progress in 188 countries, including the United States, by deploying powerful technology tools to combat this scourge, and sanctioned over 240 individuals and entities for serious human rights abuses under the Global Magnitsky Sanctions Program.
During National Human Trafficking Prevention Month, I encourage Americans to learn the signs of human trafficking and share the National Human Trafficking Hotline (888-373-7888), where one can report a tip or ask for help. Together, we can create a world where every person is treated with dignity and respect, lives free from fear, and can lead a life full of freedom and liberty.
