(3) Any exemption claimed hereunder shall cease to be effective upon any change which would cause the commodity pool operator of an exempt pool to be ineligible for the relief claimed with respect to such pool or which would cause a commodity trading advisor to be ineligible for the relief claimed. The pool operator or trading advisor must promptly file a notice advising the National Futures Association of such change.
(4)(i) Any exemption from the requirements of § 4.21, § 4.22, § 4.23, § 4.24, § 4.25 or § 4.26 claimed hereunder with respect to a pool shall not affect the obligation of the commodity pool operator to comply with all other applicable provisions of part 4, the Act and the Commission's rules and regulations, with respect to the pool and any other pool the pool operator operates or intends to operate.

(ii) The failure to comply was insignificant with respect to the exempt pool as a whole or to the particular exempt account; and

(7)(i) Eligibility for exemption under paragraph (a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(3) or (a)(4) of this section is subject to the person furnishing in written communication physically delivered or delivered through electronic transmission to each prospective participant in the pool:

(a)(1) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, each commodity pool operator registered or required to be registered under the Act must deliver or cause to be delivered to a prospective participant in a pool that it operates or intends to operate a Disclosure Document for the pool prepared in accordance with §§ 4.24 and 4.25 by no later than the time it delivers to the prospective participant a subscription agreement for the pool;
Provided,
That any information distributed in advance
of the delivery of the Disclosure Document to a prospective participant is consistent with or amended by the information contained in the Disclosure Document and with the obligations of the commodity pool operator under the Act, the Commission's regulations issued thereunder, and the laws of any other applicable federal or state authority;
Provided, further,
That in the event such previously distributed information is amended by the Disclosure Document in any material respect, the prospective participant must be in receipt of the Disclosure Document at least 48 hours prior to its subscription being accepted by the pool operator.
(2) For the purpose of the Disclosure Document delivery requirement in this part, including any offering memorandum delivered pursuant to § 4.7(b)(2)(i) or § 4.12(b)(2)(i), the term “prospective pool participant” does not include a commodity pool operated by a pool operator that is the same as, or that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, the pool operator of the offered pool.

§ 4.22
Reporting to pool participants.
(a) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(4) or (a)(6) of this section, each commodity pool operator registered or required to be registered under the Act must periodically distribute to each participant in each pool that it operates, within 30 calendar days after the last date of the reporting period prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section, an Account Statement, which shall be presented in the form of a Statement of Operations and a Statement of Changes in Net Assets, for the prescribed period. These financial statements must be presented and computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied. The Account Statement must be signed in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section.
(1) The portion of the Account Statement which must be presented in the form of a Statement of Operations must separately itemize the following information:
(i) The total amount of realized net gain or loss on commodity interest positions liquidated during the reporting period;
(ii) The change in unrealized net gain or loss on commodity interest positions during the reporting period;
(iii) The total amount of net gain or loss from all other transactions in which the pool engaged during the reporting period, including interest and dividends earned on funds not paid as premiums or used to margin the pool's commodity interest positions;
(iv) The total amount of all management fees during the reporting period;
(v) The total amount of all advisory fees during the reporting period;
(vi) The total amount of all brokerage commissions during the reporting period;
(vii) The total amount of other fees for commodity interest and other investment transactions during the reporting period; and

(2) The portion of the Account Statement that must be presented in the form of a Statement of Changes in Net Assets must separately itemize the following information:
(i) The net asset value of the pool as of the beginning of the reporting period;
(ii) The total amount of additions to the pool, whether voluntary or involuntary, made during the reporting period;
(iii) The total amount of withdrawals from and redemption of participation units in the pool, whether voluntary or involuntary, for the reporting period;
(iv) The total net income or loss of the pool during the reporting period;
(v) The net asset value of the pool as of the end of the reporting period; and
(vi)(A) The net asset value per outstanding participation unit in the pool as of the end of the reporting period, or
(B) The total value of the participant's interest or share in the pool as of the end of the reporting period.
(3) The Account Statement must also disclose any material business dealings between the pool, the pool's operator,
commodity trading advisor, futures commission merchant, retail foreign exchange dealer, swap dealer, or the principals thereof that previously have not been disclosed in the pool's Disclosure Document or any amendment thereto, other Account Statements or Annual Reports.
(4) For the purpose of the Account Statement delivery requirement in this part, including any Account Statement distributed pursuant to § 4.7(b)(3) or § 4.12(b)(2)(ii), the term “participant” does not include a commodity pool operated by a pool operator that is the same as, or that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, the pool operator of a pool in which the commodity pool has invested.
(5) Where the pool is comprised of more than one ownership class or series, information for the series or class on which the account statement is reporting should be presented in addition to the information presented for the pool as a whole; except that, for a pool that is a series fund structured with a limitation on liability among the different series, the account statement is not required to include consolidated information for all series.
(6) A commodity pool operator of a pool that meets the conditions specified in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section and has filed notice pursuant to paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section may elect to follow the same accounting treatment with respect to the computation and presentation of the account statement.
(b) The Account Statement must be distributed at least monthly in the case of pools with net assets of more than $500,000 at the beginning of the pool's fiscal year, and otherwise at least quarterly;
Provided, however,
That an Account Statement for the last reporting period of the pool's fiscal year need not be distributed if the Annual Report required by paragraph (c) of this section is sent to pool participants within 45 calendar days after the end of the fiscal year. The requirement to distribute an Account Statement shall commence as of the date the pool is formed as specified in paragraph (g)(1) of this section.
(c) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(7) or (c)(8) of this section, each commodity pool operator registered or required to be registered under the Act must distribute an Annual Report to each participant in each pool that it operates, and must electronically submit a copy of the Report and key financial balances from the Report to the National Futures Association pursuant to the electronic filing procedures of the National Futures Association, within 90 calendar days after the end of the pool's fiscal year or the permanent cessation of trading, whichever is earlier;
Provided, however,
that if during any calendar year the commodity pool operator did not operate a commodity pool, the pool operator must so notify the National Futures Association within 30 calendar days after the end of such calendar year. The Annual Report must be affirmed pursuant to paragraph (h) of this section and must contain the following:
(1) The net asset value of the pool as of the end of each of the pool's two preceding fiscal years.
(2)(i) The net asset value per outstanding participation unit in the pool as of the end of each of the pool's two preceding fiscal years, or
(ii) The total value of the participant's interest or share in the pool as of the end of each of the pool's two preceding fiscal years.
(3) A Statement of Financial Condition as of the close of the pool's fiscal year and preceding fiscal year.
(4) Statements of Operations, and Changes in Net Assets, for the period between—
(i) The later of:
(A) The date of the most recent Statement of Financial Condition delivered to the National Futures Association pursuant to this paragraph (c); or
(B) The date of the formation of the pool; and
(ii) The close of the pool's fiscal year, together with Statements of Operations, and Changes in Net Assets for the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year.
(5) Appropriate footnote disclosure and such further material information as may be necessary to make the required statements not misleading. For a pool that invests in other funds, this information must include, but is not
limited to, separately disclosing the amounts of income, management and incentive fees associated with each investment in an investee fund that exceeds five percent of the pool's net assets. The management and incentive fees associated with an investment in an investee fund that is less than five percent of the pool's net assets may be combined and reported in the aggregate with the income, management and incentive fees of other investee funds that, individually, represent an investment of less than five percent of the pool's net assets. If the commodity pool operator is not able to obtain the specific amounts of management and incentive fees charged by an investee fund, the commodity pool operator must disclose the percentage amounts and computational basis for each such fee and include a statement that the CPO is not able to obtain the specific fee amounts for this fund;
(6) Where the pool is comprised of more than one ownership class or series, information for the series or class on which the financial statements are reporting should be presented in addition to the information presented for the pool as a whole; except that, for a pool that is a series fund structured with a limitation on liability among the different series, the financial statements are not required to include consolidated information for all series.
(7) For a pool that has ceased operation prior to, or as of, the end of the fiscal year, the commodity pool operator may provide the following, within 90 days of the permanent cessation of trading, in lieu of the annual report that would otherwise be required by this paragraph (c) or § 4.7(b)(4):
(i) Statements of Operations and Changes in Net Assets for the period between—
(A) The later of:
(
1
) The date of the most recent Statement of Financial Condition filed with the National Futures Association pursuant to this paragraph (c); or
(
2
) The date of the formation of the pool; and
(B) The close of the pool's fiscal year or the date of the cessation of trading, whichever is earlier; and
(ii)(A) An explanation of the winding down of the pool's operations and written disclosure that all interests in, and assets of, the pool have been redeemed, distributed or transferred on behalf of the participants;
(B) If all funds have not been distributed or transferred to participants by the time that the final report is issued, disclosure of the value of assets remaining to be distributed and an approximate timeframe of when the distribution will occur. If the commodity pool operator does not distribute the remaining pool assets within the timeframe specified, the commodity pool operator must provide written notice to each participant and to the National Futures Association that the distribution of the remaining assets of the pool has not been completed, the value of assets remaining to be distributed, and a time frame of when the final distribution will occur.
(C) If the commodity pool operator will not be able to liquidate the pool's assets in sufficient time to prepare, file and distribute the final annual report for the pool within 90 days of the permanent cessation of trading, the commodity pool operator must provide written notice to each participant and to National Futures Association disclosing:
(
1
) The value of investments remaining to be liquidated, the timeframe within which liquidation is expected to occur, any impediments to liquidation, and the nature and amount of any fees and expenses that will be charged to the pool prior to the final distribution of the pool's funds;
(
2
) Which financial reports the commodity pool operator will continue to provide to pool participants from the time that trading ceased until the final annual report is distributed, and the frequency with which such reports will be provided, pursuant to the pool's operative documents; and
(
3
) The timeframe within which the commodity pool operator will provide the final report.
(iii) A report filed pursuant to paragraph (c)(7) of this section that would otherwise be required by paragraph (c) of this section is not required to be audited in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section if the commodity pool operator:
(A) Obtains a written waiver of their right to receive an audited Annual Report from each participant other than the pool operator, the pool's commodity trading advisor, any person controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the pool operator or trading advisor, and any principal of the foregoing; and
(B) At the time of filing the Annual Report with the National Futures Association, certifies that it has received a written waiver from each participant from whom it is required to obtain a waiver to qualify for the relief available under this paragraph (c)(7). The commodity pool operator must maintain the waivers in accordance with § 4.23 and must make the waivers available to the Commission or National Futures Association upon request. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section, the relief made available by this paragraph (c)(7)(iii) will not be available where the commodity pool operator has not previously distributed an audited Annual Report to pool participants and submitted an audited Annual Report to the National Futures Association.
(8) For the purpose of the Annual Report distribution requirement in this part, including any annual report distributed pursuant to § 4.7(b)(4) or § 4.12(b)(2)(iii), the term “participant” does not include a commodity pool operated by a pool operator that is the same as, or that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, the pool operator of a pool in which the commodity pool has invested;
Provided,
That the Annual Report of such investing pool contains financial statements that include such information as the Commission may specify concerning the operations of the pool in which the commodity pool has invested.
(d)(1) Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (d)(2) and (g)(2) of this section, the financial statements in the Annual Report required by this section or by § 4.7(b)(4) must be presented and computed in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied and must be audited by an independent public accountant;
Provided, however,
and subject to the exception in paragraph (c)(7)(iii)(B) of this section, that the requirement that the Annual Report be audited by an independent public accountant does not apply for any fiscal year during which the only participants in the pool are one or more of the pool operator, the pool's commodity trading advisor, any person controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the pool operator or trading advisor, and any principal of the foregoing; and
Provided further,
that the commodity pool operator obtains a written waiver from each such pool participant of their right to receive an audited Annual Report for such fiscal year, maintains such waivers in accordance with § 4.23, and makes such waivers available to the Commission or National Futures Association upon request. The requirements of § 1.16(g) of this chapter shall apply with respect to the engagement of such independent public accountants, except that any related notifications to be made may be made solely to the National Futures Association, and the certification must be in accordance with § 1.16 of this chapter, except that the following requirements of § 1.16 shall not apply:
(i) The audit objectives of § 1.16(d)(1) concerning the periodic computation of minimum capital and property in segregation;
(ii) All other references in § 1.16 to the segregation requirements; and
(iii) Section 1.16(c)(5), (d)(2), (e)(2), and (f).
(2)(i) Where a pool is organized in a jurisdiction other than the United States, the financial statements in the Annual Report required by this section or by § 4.7(b)(4) may be presented and computed in accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles, standards or practices followed in such other jurisdiction;
Provided,
That:
(A) The other jurisdiction follows accounting principles, standards or practices set forth in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section and the Annual Report presents and computes the financial statements of the pool in accordance with the applicable accounting principles, standards or practices followed by such other jurisdiction;
(B) The Annual Report includes a condensed schedule of investments, or,
if required by the applicable accounting principles, standards or practices followed by such other jurisdiction, a full schedule of investments;
(C) The Annual Report reports special allocations of ownership equity in accordance with paragraph (e)(2) of this section;
(D) The Disclosure Document or offering memorandum for the pool identifies the accounting principles, standards or practices of the other jurisdiction pursuant to which the Annual Report presents and computes the financial statements of the pool; and
(E) Where the accounting principles, standards or practices of the other jurisdiction require consolidated financial statements for the pool, such as a feeder fund consolidating with its master fund, all applicable disclosures required by United States generally accepted accounting principles for the feeder fund must be presented with the reporting pool's consolidated financial statements.
(ii) For purposes of paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, the following alternative accounting principles, standards or practices may be employed in the preparation and computation of the financial statements in the Annual Report of the commodity pool;
Provided,
That any such alternative accounting principles, standards or practices so employed are those followed by the jurisdiction other than the United States in which the commodity pool is organized:
(A) International Financial Reporting Standards;
(B) Generally Accepted Accounting Practice in the United Kingdom;
(C) New Irish Generally Accepted Accounting Practice;
(D) Luxembourg Generally Accepted Accounting Principles; or
(E) Canadian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.
(iii) To claim the relief available under this paragraph (d)(2), a commodity pool operator must file a notice with the National Futures Association within 90 calendar days after the end of the pool's first fiscal year.
(A) The notice must contain: The name, main business address, main telephone number and National Futures Association registration identification number of the commodity pool operator; the name and identification number of the commodity pool for which the pool operator is claiming relief; and the alternative accounting principles, standards or practices pursuant to which the financial statements in the Annual Report will be presented and computed;
(B) The notice must include a representation that the commodity pool operator complies with each of the conditions specified in paragraphs (d)(2)(i)(A) through (D) of this section and, if applicable, paragraph (d)(2)(i)(E) of this section; and
(C) The notice must be signed by the commodity pool operator in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section.
(e)(1) The Statement of Operations required by this section must itemize brokerage commissions, management fees, advisory fees, incentive fees, interest income and expense, total realized net gain or loss from commodity interest trading, and change in unrealized net gain or loss on commodity interest positions during the pool's fiscal year. Gains and losses on commodity interests need not be itemized by commodity or by specific delivery or expiration date.
(2)(i) Any share of a pool's profits or transfer of a pool's equity which exceeds the general partner's or any other class's share of profits computed on the general partner's or other class's pro rata capital contribution are “special allocations.” Special allocations of partnership equity or other interests must be recognized in the pool's Statement of Operations in the same period as the net income, interest income, or other basis of computation of the special allocation is recognized. Special allocations must be recognized and classified either as an expense of the pool or, if not recognized as an expense of the pool, presented in the Statement of Operations as a separate, itemized allocation of the pool's net income to arrive at net income available for pro rata distribution to all partners.
(ii) Special allocations of ownership interest also must be reported separately in the Statement of Partners'
Equity, in addition to the pro-rata allocations of net income, as to each class of ownership interest.
(3) Realized gains or losses on regulated commodities transactions presented in the Statement of Operations of a commodity pool may be combined with realized gains or losses from trading in non-commodity interest transactions, provided that the gains or losses to be combined are part of a related trading strategy. Unrealized gains or losses on open regulated commodity positions presented in the Statement of Operations of a commodity pool may be combined with unrealized gains or losses from open positions in non-commodity positions, provided that the gains or losses to be combined are part of a related trading strategy.
(f)(1)(i) In the event the commodity pool operator finds that it cannot distribute the Annual Report for a pool that it operates within the time specified in paragraph (c) of this section without substantial undue hardship, it may file with the National Futures Association an application for extension of time to a specified date not more than 90 calendar days after the date as of which the Annual Report was to have been distributed. The application must be made by the pool operator and must:
(A) State the name of the pool for which the application is being made;
(B) State the reasons for the requested extension;
(C) Indicate that the inability to make a timely filing is due to circumstances beyond the control of the pool operator, if such is the case, and describe briefly the nature of such circumstances;
(D) Contain an undertaking to file the Annual Report on or before the date specified in the application; and
(E) Be filed with the National Futures Association prior to the date on which the Annual Report is due.
(ii) The application must be accompanied by a letter from the independent public accountant answering the following questions:
(A) What specifically are the reasons for the extension request?
(B) Do you have any indication from the part of your audit completed to date that would lead you to believe that the commodity pool operator was or is not meeting the recordkeeping requirements of this part 4 or was or is not complying with the § 4.20(c) prohibition on commingling of property of any pool with the property of any other person?
(iii) Within ten calendar days after receipt of an application for an extension of time, the National Futures Association shall:
(A) Notify the commodity pool operator of the grant or denial of the requested extension, or
(B) Indicate to the pool operator that additional time is required to analyze the request, in which case the amount of time needed will be specified.
(2) In the event a commodity pool operator finds that it cannot obtain information necessary to prepare annual financial statements for a pool that it operates within the time specified in paragraph (c) of this section or § 4.7(b)(4)(i), as a result of the pool investing in another collective investment vehicle, it may claim an extension of time under the following conditions:
(i) The commodity pool operator must, within 90 calendar days of the end of the pool's fiscal year, file a notice with the National Futures Association, except as provided in paragraph (f)(2)(v) of this section.
(ii) The notice must contain the name, main business address, main telephone number and the National Futures Association registration identification number of the commodity pool operator, and name and the identification number of the commodity pool.
(iii) The notice must state the date by which the Annual Report will be distributed and filed (the “Extended Date”), which must be no more than 180 calendar days after the end of the pool's fiscal year. The Annual Report must be distributed and filed by the Extended Date.
(iv) The notice must include representations by the commodity pool operator that:
(A) The pool for which the Annual Report is being prepared has investments in one or more collective investment vehicles (the “Investments”);
(B) For all reports prepared under paragraph (c) of this section and for reports prepared under § 4.7(b)(4)(i) that are audited by an independent public accountant, the commodity pool operator has been informed by the independent public accountant engaged to audit the commodity pool's financial statements that specified information required to complete the pool's Annual Report is necessary in order for the accountant to render an opinion on the commodity pool's financial statements. The notice must include the name, main business address, main telephone number, and contact person of the accountant; and
(C) The information specified by the accountant cannot be obtained in sufficient time for the Annual Report to be prepared, audited, and distributed before the Extended Date.
(v) For each fiscal year following the filing of the notice described in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section, for a particular pool, it shall be presumed that the particular pool continues to invest in another collective investment vehicle and the commodity pool operator may claim the extension of time;
Provided, however,
that if the particular pool is no longer investing in another collective investment vehicle, then the commodity pool operator must file electronically with the National Futures Association an Annual Report within 90 days after the pool's fiscal year-end accompanied by a notice indicating the change in the pool's status.
(vi) Any notice or statement filed pursuant to this paragraph (f)(2) must be signed by the commodity pool operator in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section.
(g)(1) A commodity pool operator may initially elect any fiscal year for a pool, but the first fiscal year may not end more than one year after the pool's formation. For purposes of this section, a pool shall be deemed to be formed as of the date the pool operator first receives funds, securities or other property for the purchase of an interest in the pool.
(2)(i) If a commodity pool operator elects a fiscal year other than the calendar year, it must give written notice of the election to all participants and must file the notice with the National Futures Association within 90 calendar days after the date of the pool's formation. If this notice is not given, the pool operator will be deemed to have elected the calendar year as the pool's fiscal year.
(ii) For purposes of this paragraph (g)(2), the time period from the date on which the commodity pool operator first receives funds, securities or other property from a participant in the pool that is not a person listed in paragraphs (g)(2)(ii)(A)(
1
) through (g)(2)(ii)(A)(
5
) of this section to the end of the pool's first fiscal year is the stub period of the pool. Where the stub period is four months or less, the first Annual Report for the pool may be unaudited;
Provided, however,
That:
(A) Throughout the stub period, the pool had no more than fifteen participants and no more than $3,000,000 in aggregate gross capital contributions. For the purpose of satisfying these criteria, the commodity pool operator may exclude the following persons and their contributions:

(
5
) An entity that is wholly-owned by one or more participants specified in paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(A)(
1

3
) or (
4
) of this section; and
(B) The next Annual Report for the pool is audited and covers the stub period plus the pool's first 12-month fiscal year.
(C) To claim the relief available under paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section, a commodity pool operator must:
(
1
) Prior to the date upon which it is required to distribute and submit an audited Annual Report for the pool's
first fiscal year, obtain a written waiver of the pool participant's right to receive an audited Annual Report for the pool's first fiscal year from each participant other than a participant who is the pool operator, the pool's commodity trading advisor, any person controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the pool operator or trading advisor, or any principal of the foregoing. The waiver may be included in the subscription agreement for the pool or other agreement with the participant;
Provided, however,

The waiver must be in a form substantially as follows: “[Name of participant], a participant in [Name of pool], voluntarily waives the right under CFTC Regulation 4.22(d) to receive an audited Annual Report for the fiscal year ended [end date of the pool's first fiscal year] and will accept in lieu thereof an unaudited Annual Report covering [the stub period] and an audited Annual Report covering [the start date of the stub period] through [the end date of the pool's first twelve-month fiscal year].”; and
(
2
) On or before the date upon which it is required to distribute and submit the Annual Report for the pool's first fiscal year, file a notice with the National Futures Association, along with a certification that it has received the required written waiver from each participant who is not the pool operator, the pool's commodity trading advisor, any person controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the pool operator or trading advisor, or any principal of the foregoing, and who has been a participant in the pool for its first fiscal year.
(
i
) The notice must contain: The name, main business address, main telephone number and National Futures Association registration identification number of the commodity pool operator; the name and identification number of the commodity pool for which the pool operator is claiming relief; and the beginning and end dates of the stub period of the pool;

) The notice must include a representation that the commodity pool operator meets the criteria of paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(A) of this section and that it will comply with the condition of paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(B) of this section; and
(
iii
) The notice must be signed by the commodity pool operator in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section.
(D)(
1
) Each unaudited Annual Report for which the relief available under paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section has been claimed must prominently disclose on the cover page thereof: “Pursuant to an exemption from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, this unaudited Annual Report covers the period from [beginning date of the stub period of the pool] to the end of the pool's first fiscal year, a period of [number] months.”

(E) The commodity pool operator must maintain in accordance with § 4.23 of this chapter each waiver it has obtained to claim the relief available under paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section.
(3) The commodity pool operator must continue to use the elected fiscal year for the pool unless it provides written notice of any proposed change to all participants and files such notice with the National Futures Association at least 90 days before the change and the National Futures Association does not disapprove the change within 30 days after the filing of the notice.
(h)(1) Each Account Statement and Annual Report, including an Account Statement or Annual Report provided pursuant to § 4.7(b) or 4.12(b), must contain an oath or affirmation that, to the best of the knowledge and belief of the individual making the oath or affirmation, the information contained in the document is accurate and complete;
Provided, however,
That it shall be unlawful for the individual to make such oath or affirmation if the individual knows or should know that any of the
information in the document is not accurate and complete.
(2) Each oath or affirmation must be made by a representative duly authorized to bind the pool operator, and
(i) for the copy of a commodity pool's Annual Report submitted to the National Futures Association, such representative shall satisfy the required oath or affirmation through compliance with the National Futures Association's electronic filing procedures, and
(ii) for a commodity pool Account Statement or Annual Report distributed to participants, a facsimile of the manually signed oath or affirmation of such representative may be used so long as the manually signed original is retained in accordance with § 4.23.
(3) For each manually signed oath or affirmation, there must be typed beneath the signed oath or affirmation:
(i) The name of the individual signing the document;
(ii) The capacity in which he is signing;
(iii) The name of the commodity pool operator for whom he is signing; and
(iv) The name of the commodity pool for which the document is being distributed.
(i) The Account Statement or Annual Report may be distributed to a pool participant by means of electronic media if the participant so consents;
Provided,
That prior to the transmission of any Account Statement or Annual Report by means of electronic media, a commodity pool operator must disclose to the participant that it intends to distribute electronically the Account Statement or Annual Report or both documents, as the case may be, absent objection from the participant, which objection, if any, the participant must make no later than 10 business days following its receipt of the disclosure.

Risk Disclosure Statement.
(1) The following Risk Disclosure Statement must be prominently displayed immediately following any disclosures required to appear on the cover page of the Disclosure Document as provided by the Commission, by any applicable federal or state securities laws and regulations or by any applicable laws of non-United States jurisdictions.

# RISK DISCLOSURE STATEMENT
YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER WHETHER YOUR FINANCIAL CONDITION PERMITS YOU TO PARTICIPATE IN A COMMODITY POOL. IN SO DOING, YOU SHOULD BE AWARE THAT COMMODITY INTEREST TRADING CAN QUICKLY LEAD TO LARGE LOSSES AS WELL AS GAINS. SUCH TRADING LOSSES CAN SHARPLY REDUCE THE NET ASSET VALUE OF THE POOL AND CONSEQUENTLY THE VALUE OF YOUR INTEREST IN THE POOL. IN ADDITION, RESTRICTIONS ON REDEMPTIONS MAY AFFECT YOUR ABILITY TO WITHDRAW YOUR PARTICIPATION IN THE POOL. IN ADDITION, RESTRICTIONS ON REDEMPTIONS MAY AFFECT YOUR ABILITY TO WITHDRAW YOUR PARTICIPATION IN THE POOL.
FURTHER, COMMODITY POOLS MAY BE SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL CHARGES FOR MANAGEMENT, AND ADVISORY AND BROKERAGE FEES. IT MAY BE NECESSARY FOR THOSE POOLS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THESE CHARGES TO MAKE SUBSTANTIAL TRADING PROFITS TO AVOID DEPLETION OR EXHAUSTION OF THEIR ASSETS. THIS DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT CONTAINS A COMPLETE DESCRIPTION OF EACH EXPENSE TO BE CHARGED THIS POOL AT PAGE (insert page number) AND A STATEMENT OF THE PERCENTAGE RETURN NECESSARY TO BREAK EVEN, THAT IS, TO RECOVER THE AMOUNT OF YOUR INITIAL INVESTMENT, AT PAGE (insert page number).
THIS BRIEF STATEMENT CANNOT DISCLOSE ALL THE RISKS AND OTHER FACTORS NECESSARY TO EVALUATE YOUR PARTICIPATION IN THIS COMMODITY POOL. THEREFORE, BEFORE YOU DECIDE TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS COMMODITY POOL, YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY STUDY THIS DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT, INCLUDING A DESCRIPTION OF THE PRINCIPAL RISK FACTORS OF THIS INVESTMENT, AT PAGE (insert page number).
(2) If the pool may trade foreign futures or options contracts, the Risk Disclosure Statement must further state:
YOU SHOULD ALSO BE AWARE THAT THIS COMMODITY POOL MAY TRADE FOREIGN FUTURES OR OPTIONS CONTRACTS. TRANSACTIONS ON MARKETS LOCATED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING MARKETS FORMALLY LINKED TO A UNITED STATES MARKET, MAY BE SUBJECT TO REGULATIONS WHICH OFFER DIFFERENT OR DIMINISHED PROTECTION TO THE POOL AND ITS PARTICIPANTS. FURTHER, UNITED STATES REGULATORY AUTHORITIES MAY BE UNABLE TO COMPEL THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE RULES OF REGULATORY AUTHORITIES OR MARKETS IN NON-UNITED STATES JURISDICTIONS WHERE TRANSACTIONS FOR THE POOL MAY BE EFFECTED.
(3) If the potential liability of a participant in the pool is greater than the amount of the participant's contribution for the purchase of an interest in the pool and the profits earned thereon, whether distributed or not, the commodity pool operator must make the following additional statement in the Risk Disclosure Statement, to be prominently disclosed as the last paragraph thereof:
ALSO, BEFORE YOU DECIDE TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS POOL, YOU SHOULD
NOTE THAT YOUR POTENTIAL LIABILITY AS A PARTICIPANT IN THIS POOL FOR TRADING LOSSES AND OTHER EXPENSES OF THE POOL IS NOT LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT OF YOUR CONTRIBUTION FOR THE PURCHASE OF AN INTEREST IN THE POOL AND ANY PROFITS EARNED THEREON. A COMPLETE DESCRIPTION OF THE LIABILITY OF A PARTICIPANT IN THIS POOL IS EXPLAINED MORE FULLY IN THIS DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT.
(4) If the pool may engage in retail Forex transactions, the Risk Disclosure Statement must further state:
YOU SHOULD ALSO BE AWARE THAT THIS COMMODITY POOL MAY ENGAGE IN OFF-EXCHANGE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRADING. SUCH TRADING IS NOT CONDUCTED IN THE INTERBANK MARKET. THE FUNDS THAT THE POOL USES FOR OFF-EXCHANGE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRADING WILL NOT RECEIVE THE SAME PROTECTIONS AS FUNDS USED TO MARGIN OR GUARANTEE EXCHANGE-TRADED FUTURES AND OPTION CONTRACTS. IF THE POOL DEPOSITS SUCH FUNDS WITH A COUNTERPARTY AND THAT COUNTERPARTY BECOMES INSOLVENT, THE POOL'S CLAIM FOR AMOUNTS DEPOSITED OR PROFITS EARNED ON TRANSACTIONS WITH THE COUNTERPARTY MAY NOT BE TREATED AS A COMMODITY CUSTOMER CLAIM FOR PURPOSES OF SUBCHAPTER IV OF CHAPTER 7 OF THE BANKRUPTCY CODE AND THE REGULATIONS THEREUNDER. THE POOL MAY BE A GENERAL CREDITOR AND ITS CLAIM MAY BE PAID, ALONG WITH THE CLAIMS OF OTHER GENERAL CREDITORS, FROM ANY MONIES STILL AVAILABLE AFTER PRIORITY CLAIMS ARE PAID. EVEN POOL FUNDS THAT THE COUNTERPARTY KEEPS SEPARATE FROM ITS OWN FUNDS MAY NOT BE SAFE FROM THE CLAIMS OF PRIORITY AND OTHER GENERAL CREDITORS.
(5) If the pool may engage in swaps, the Risk Disclosure Statement must further state:
SWAPS TRANSACTIONS, LIKE OTHER FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS, INVOLVE A VARIETY OF SIGNIFICANT RISKS. THE SPECIFIC RISKS PRESENTED BY A PARTICULAR SWAP TRANSACTION NECESSARILY DEPEND UPON THE TERMS OF THE TRANSACTION AND YOUR CIRCUMSTANCES. IN GENERAL, HOWEVER, ALL SWAPS TRANSACTIONS INVOLVE SOME COMBINATION OF MARKET RISK, CREDIT RISK, COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK, FUNDING RISK, LIQUIDITY RISK, AND OPERATIONAL RISK.
HIGHLY CUSTOMIZED SWAPS TRANSACTIONS IN PARTICULAR MAY INCREASE LIQUIDITY RISK, WHICH MAY RESULT IN A SUSPENSION OF REDEMPTIONS. HIGHLY LEVERAGED TRANSACTIONS MAY EXPERIENCE SUBSTANTIAL GAINS OR LOSSES IN VALUE AS A RESULT OF RELATIVELY SMALL CHANGES IN THE VALUE OR LEVEL OF AN UNDERLYING OR RELATED MARKET FACTOR.
IN EVALUATING THE RISKS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH A PARTICULAR SWAP TRANSACTION, IT IS IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER THAT A SWAP TRANSACTION MAY BE MODIFIED OR TERMINATED ONLY BY MUTUAL CONSENT OF THE ORIGINAL PARTIES AND SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON INDIVIDUALLY NEGOTIATED TERMS. THEREFORE, IT MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE FOR THE COMMODITY POOL OPERATOR TO MODIFY, TERMINATE, OR OFFSET THE POOL'S OBLIGATIONS OR THE POOL'S EXPOSURE TO THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH A TRANSACTION PRIOR TO ITS SCHEDULED TERMINATION DATE.

§ 4.34
General disclosures required.
Except as otherwise provided herein, a Disclosure Document must include the following information.
(a)
Cautionary Statement.
The following Cautionary Statement must be prominently displayed on the cover page of the Disclosure Document:
THE COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION HAS NOT PASSED UPON THE MERITS OF PARTICIPATING IN THIS TRADING PROGRAM NOR HAS THE COMMISSION PASSED ON THE ADEQUACY OR ACCURACY OF THIS DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT.
(b)
Risk Disclosure Statement.
(1) The following Risk Disclosure Statement must be prominently displayed immediately following any disclosures required to appear on the cover page of the Disclosure Document as provided by the Commission, by any applicable federal or state securities laws and regulations or by any applicable laws of non-United States jurisdictions:

# RISK DISCLOSURE STATEMENT
THE RISK OF LOSS IN TRADING COMMODITY INTERESTS CAN BE SUBSTANTIAL. YOU SHOULD THEREFORE CAREFULLY CONSIDER WHETHER SUCH TRADING IS SUITABLE FOR YOU IN LIGHT OF YOUR FINANCIAL CONDITION. IN CONSIDERING WHETHER TO TRADE OR TO AUTHORIZE SOMEONE ELSE TO TRADE FOR YOU, YOU SHOULD BE AWARE OF THE FOLLOWING:
IF YOU PURCHASE A COMMODITY OPTION YOU MAY SUSTAIN A TOTAL LOSS OF THE PREMIUM AND OF ALL TRANSACTION COSTS.
IF YOU PURCHASE OR SELL A COMMODITY FUTURES CONTRACT OR SELL A COMMODITY OPTION OR ENGAGE IN OFF-EXCHANGE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRADING YOU MAY SUSTAIN A TOTAL LOSS
OF THE INITIAL MARGIN FUNDS OR SECURITY DEPOSIT AND ANY ADDITIONAL FUNDS THAT YOU DEPOSIT WITH YOUR BROKER TO ESTABLISH OR MAINTAIN YOUR POSITION. IF THE MARKET MOVES AGAINST YOUR POSITION, YOU MAY BE CALLED UPON BY YOUR BROKER TO DEPOSIT A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL MARGIN FUNDS, ON SHORT NOTICE, IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN YOUR POSITION. IF YOU DO NOT PROVIDE THE REQUESTED FUNDS WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED TIME, YOUR POSITION MAY BE LIQUIDATED AT A LOSS, AND YOU WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY RESULTING DEFICIT IN YOUR ACCOUNT.
UNDER CERTAIN MARKET CONDITIONS, YOU MAY FIND IT DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE TO LIQUIDATE A POSITION. THIS CAN OCCUR, FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN THE MARKET MAKES A “LIMIT MOVE.”
THE PLACEMENT OF CONTINGENT ORDERS BY YOU OR YOUR TRADING ADVISOR, SUCH AS A “STOP-LOSS” OR “STOP-LIMIT” ORDER, WILL NOT NECESSARILY LIMIT YOUR LOSSES TO THE INTENDED AMOUNTS, SINCE MARKET CONDITIONS MAY MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO EXECUTE SUCH ORDERS.
A “SPREAD” POSITION MAY NOT BE LESS RISKY THAN A SIMPLE “LONG” OR “SHORT” POSITION.
THE HIGH DEGREE OF LEVERAGE THAT IS OFTEN OBTAINABLE IN COMMODITY INTEREST TRADING CAN WORK AGAINST YOU AS WELL AS FOR YOU. THE USE OF LEVERAGE CAN LEAD TO LARGE LOSSES AS WELL AS GAINS.
IN SOME CASES, MANAGED COMMODITY ACCOUNTS ARE SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL CHARGES FOR MANAGEMENT AND ADVISORY FEES. IT MAY BE NECESSARY FOR THOSE ACCOUNTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THESE CHARGES TO MAKE SUBSTANTIAL TRADING PROFITS TO AVOID DEPLETION OR EXHAUSTION OF THEIR ASSETS. THIS DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT CONTAINS, AT PAGE (insert page number), A COMPLETE DESCRIPTION OF EACH FEE TO BE CHARGED TO YOUR ACCOUNT BY THE COMMODITY TRADING ADVISOR.
THIS BRIEF STATEMENT CANNOT DISCLOSE ALL THE RISKS AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT ASPECTS OF THE COMMODITY INTEREST MARKETS. YOU SHOULD THEREFORE CAREFULLY STUDY THIS DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT AND COMMODITY INTEREST TRADING BEFORE YOU TRADE, INCLUDING THE DESCRIPTION OF THE PRINCIPAL RISK FACTORS OF THIS INVESTMENT, AT PAGE (insert page number).
(2)(i) If the commodity trading advisor may trade foreign futures or options contracts pursuant to the offered trading program, the Risk Disclosure Statement must further state the following:
YOU SHOULD ALSO BE AWARE THAT THIS COMMODITY TRADING ADVISOR MAY ENGAGE IN TRADING FOREIGN FUTURES OR OPTIONS CONTRACTS. TRANSACTIONS ON MARKETS LOCATED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING MARKETS FORMALLY LINKED TO A UNITED STATES MARKET MAY BE SUBJECT TO REGULATIONS WHICH OFFER DIFFERENT OR DIMINISHED PROTECTION. FURTHER, UNITED STATES REGULATORY AUTHORITIES MAY BE UNABLE TO COMPEL THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE RULES OF REGULATORY AUTHORITIES OR MARKETS IN NON-UNITED STATES JURISDICTIONS WHERE YOUR TRANSACTIONS MAY BE EFFECTED. BEFORE YOU TRADE YOU SHOULD INQUIRE ABOUT ANY RULES RELEVANT TO YOUR PARTICULAR CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS AND ASK THE FIRM WITH WHICH YOU INTEND TO TRADE FOR DETAILS ABOUT THE TYPES OF REDRESS AVAILABLE IN BOTH YOUR LOCAL AND OTHER RELEVANT JURISDICTIONS.
(ii) If the commodity trading advisor may engage in retail forex transactions pursuant to the offered trading program, the Risk Disclosure Statement must further state the following:
YOU SHOULD ALSO BE AWARE THAT THIS COMMODITY TRADING ADVISOR MAY ENGAGE IN OFF-EXCHANGE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRADING. SUCH TRADING IS NOT CONDUCTED IN THE INTERBANK MARKET. THE FUNDS DEPOSITED WITH A COUNTERPARTY FOR SUCH TRANSACTIONS WILL NOT RECEIVE THE SAME PROTECTIONS AS FUNDS USED TO MARGIN OR GUARANTEE EXCHANGE-TRADED FUTURES AND OPTION CONTRACTS. IF THE COUNTERPARTY BECOMES INSOLVENT AND YOU HAVE A CLAIM FOR AMOUNTS DEPOSITED OR PROFITS EARNED ON TRANSACTIONS WITH THE COUNTERPARTY, YOUR CLAIM MAY NOT BE TREATED AS A COMMODITY CUSTOMER CLAIM FOR PURPOSES OF SUBCHAPTER IV OF CHAPTER 7 OF THE BANKRUPTCY CODE AND REGULATIONS THEREUNDER. YOU MAY BE A GENERAL CREDITOR AND YOUR CLAIM MAY BE PAID, ALONG WITH THE CLAIMS OF OTHER GENERAL CREDITORS, FROM ANY MONIES STILL AVAILABLE AFTER PRIORITY CLAIMS ARE PAID. EVEN FUNDS THAT THE COUNTERPARTY KEEPS SEPARATE FROM ITS OWN FUNDS MAY NOT BE SAFE FROM THE CLAIMS OF PRIORITY AND OTHER GENERAL CREDITORS.
FURTHER, YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY REVIEW THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE RISK DISCLOSURE STATEMENT OF THE FUTURES COMMISSION MERCHANT OR RETAIL FOREIGN EXCHANGE DEALER THAT YOU SELECT TO CARRY YOUR ACCOUNT.
(3) If the commodity trading advisor is not also a registered futures commission merchant or a registered retail foreign exchange dealer, the trading advisor must make the additional following statement in the Risk Disclosure Statement, to be included as the last paragraph thereof:
THIS COMMODITY TRADING ADVISOR IS PROHIBITED BY LAW FROM ACCEPTING FUNDS IN THE TRADING ADVISOR'S NAME FROM A CLIENT FOR TRADING COMMODITY INTERESTS. YOU MUST PLACE ALL FUNDS FOR TRADING IN THIS TRADING PROGRAM DIRECTLY WITH A FUTURES COMMISSION MERCHANT OR RETAIL FOREIGN EXCHANGE DEALER, AS APPLICABLE.
(4) If the commodity trading advisor may engage in swaps, the Risk Disclosure Statement must further state:
SWAPS TRANSACTIONS, LIKE OTHER FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS, INVOLVE A VARIETY OF SIGNIFICANT RISKS. THE SPECIFIC RISKS PRESENTED BY A PARTICULAR SWAP TRANSACTION NECESSARILY DEPEND UPON THE TERMS OF THE TRANSACTION AND YOUR CIRCUMSTANCES. IN GENERAL, HOWEVER, ALL SWAPS TRANSACTIONS INVOLVE SOME COMBINATION OF MARKET RISK, CREDIT RISK, FUNDING RISK, AND OPERATIONAL RISK.
HIGHLY CUSTOMIZED SWAPS TRANSACTIONS IN PARTICULAR MAY INCREASE LIQUIDITY RISK, WHICH MAY RESULT IN YOUR ABILITY TO WITHDRAW YOUR FUNDS BEING LIMITED. HIGHLY LEVERAGED TRANSACTIONS MAY EXPERIENCE SUBSTANTIAL GAINS OR LOSSES IN VALUE AS A RESULT OF RELATIVELY SMALL CHANGES IN THE VALUE OR LEVEL OF AN UNDERLYING OR RELATED MARKET FACTOR.
IN EVALUATING THE RISKS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH A PARTICULAR SWAP TRANSACTION, IT IS IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER THAT A SWAP TRANSACTION MAY BE MODIFIED OR TERMINATED ONLY BY MUTUAL CONSENT OF THE ORIGINAL PARTIES AND SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON INDIVIDUALLY NEGOTIATED TERMS. THEREFORE, IT MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE TO MODIFY, TERMINATE, OR OFFSET YOUR OBLIGATIONS OR YOUR EXPOSURE TO THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH A TRANSACTION PRIOR TO ITS SCHEDULED TERMINATION DATE.

(2) Involves any transaction, practice or course of business which operates as a fraud or deceit upon any participant or client or any prospective participant or client; or

Simulated or hypothetical trading programs in general are also subject to the fact that they are designed with the benefit of hindsight. No representation is being made that any account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to these being shown.” ; or
(ii) A statement prescribed pursuant to rules promulgated by a registered futures association pursuant to section 17(j) of the Act.

# Appendix B to Part 4—Adjustments for Additions and Withdrawals in the Computation of Rate of Return
This appendix provides guidance concerning alternate methods by which commodity pool operators and commodity trading advisors may calculate the rate of return information required by Rules 4.25(a)(7)(i)(F) and 4.35(a)(6)(i)(F). The methods described herein are illustrative of calculation methods the Commission has reviewed and determined may be appropriate to address potential material distortions in the computation of rate of return due to additions and withdrawals that occur during a performance reporting period. A commodity pool operator or commodity trading advisor may present to the Commission proposals regarding any alternative method of addressing the effect of additions and withdrawals on the rate of return computation, including documentation supporting the rationale for use of that alternate method.

# 1. Compounded Rate of Return Method
Rate of return for a period may be calculated by computing the net performance divided by the beginning net asset value for each trading day in the period and compounding each daily rate of return to determine the rate of return for the period. If daily compounding is not practicable, the rate of return may be compounded on the basis of each sub-period within which an addition or withdrawal occurs during a month. For example:
Account value
Change in value
Start of month
$10,000
+10% ($1,000 profit).
End of 1st acct. period
11,000
$4,000 addition.
Start of 2nd acct. period
15,000
−20% ($3,000 loss).
End of 2nd acct. period
12,000
$2,000 withdrawal.
Start of 3rd acct. period
10,000
+25% ($2,500 profit).
End of month
12,500
Compounded ROR = [(1 + .1)(1 − .2)(1 + .25)] − 1 = 10%.

# 2. Time-weighted method
Time-weighting allows for adjustment to the denominator of the rate of return calculation for additions and withdrawals, weighted for the amount of time such funds were available during the period. Several methods exist for time-weighting, all of which will have the same arithmetic result. These methods include: dividing the net performance by the average weighted account sizes for the month; dividing the net performance by the arithmetic mean of the account sizes for each trading day during the period; and taking the number of days funds were available for trading divided by the total number of days in the period.

# RISK DISCLOSURE STATEMENT
OFF-EXCHANGE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS INVOLVE THE LEVERAGED TRADING OF CONTRACTS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCY CONDUCTED WITH A FUTURES COMMISSION MERCHANT OR A RETAIL FOREIGN EXCHANGE DEALER AS YOUR
COUNTERPARTY. BECAUSE OF THE LEVERAGE AND THE OTHER RISKS DISCLOSED HERE, YOU CAN RAPIDLY LOSE ALL OF THE FUNDS YOU DEPOSIT FOR SUCH TRADING AND YOU MAY LOSE MORE THAN YOU DEPOSIT.
YOU SHOULD BE AWARE OF AND CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING POINTS BEFORE DETERMINING WHETHER SUCH TRADING IS APPROPRIATE FOR YOU.
(1) TRADING IS NOT ON A REGULATED MARKET OR EXCHANGE—YOUR DEALER IS YOUR TRADING PARTNER WHICH IS A DIRECT CONFLICT OF INTEREST. BEFORE YOU ENGAGE IN ANY RETAIL FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRADING, YOU SHOULD CONFIRM THE REGISTRATION STATUS OF YOUR COUNTERPARTY.
The off-exchange foreign currency trading you are entering into is not conducted on an interbank market, nor is it conducted on a futures exchange subject to regulation as a designated contract market by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The foreign currency trades you transact are trades with the futures commission merchant or retail foreign exchange dealer as your counterparty. WHEN YOU SELL, THE DEALER IS THE BUYER. WHEN YOU BUY, THE DEALER IS THE SELLER. As a result, when you lose money trading, your dealer is making money on such trades, in addition to any fees, commissions, or spreads the dealer may charge.
(2) AN ELECTRONIC TRADING PLATFORM FOR RETAIL FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS IS NOT AN EXCHANGE. IT IS AN ELECTRONIC CONNECTION FOR ACCESSING YOUR DEALER. THE TERMS OF AVAILABILITY OF SUCH A PLATFORM ARE GOVERNED ONLY BY YOUR CONTRACT WITH YOUR DEALER.
Any trading platform that you may use to enter off-exchange foreign currency transactions is only connected to your futures commission merchant or retail foreign exchange dealer. You are accessing that trading platform only to transact with your dealer. You are not trading with any other entities or customers of the dealer by accessing such platform. The availability and operation of any such platform, including the consequences of the unavailability of the trading platform for any reason, is governed only by the terms of your account agreement with the dealer.
(3) YOUR DEPOSITS WITH THE DEALER HAVE NO REGULATORY PROTECTIONS.
All of your rights associated with your retail forex trading, including the manner and denomination of any payments made to you, are governed by the contract terms established in your account agreement with the futures commission merchant or retail foreign exchange dealer. Funds deposited by you with a futures commission merchant or retail foreign exchange dealer for trading off-exchange foreign currency transactions are not subject to the customer funds protections provided to customers trading on a contract market that is designated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Your dealer may commingle your funds with its own operating funds or use them for other purposes. In the event your dealer becomes bankrupt, any funds the dealer is holding for you in addition to any amounts owed to you resulting from trading, whether or not any assets are maintained in separate deposit accounts by the dealer, may be treated as an unsecured creditor's claim.
(4) YOU ARE LIMITED TO YOUR DEALER TO OFFSET OR LIQUIDATE ANY TRADING POSITIONS SINCE THE TRANSACTIONS ARE NOT MADE ON AN EXCHANGE OR MARKET, AND YOUR DEALER MAY SET ITS OWN PRICES.
Your ability to close your transactions or offset positions is limited to what your dealer will offer to you, as there is no other market for these transactions. Your dealer may offer any prices it wishes, and it may offer prices derived from outside sources or not in its discretion. Your dealer may establish its prices by offering spreads from third party prices, but it is under no obligation to do so or to continue to do so. Your dealer may offer different prices to different customers at any point in time on its own terms. The terms of your account agreement alone govern the obligations your dealer has to you to offer prices and offer offset or liquidating transactions in your account and make any payments to you. The prices offered by your dealer may or may not reflect prices available elsewhere at any exchange, interbank, or other market for foreign currency.
(5) PAID SOLICITORS MAY HAVE UNDISCLOSED CONFLICTS
The futures commission merchant or retail foreign exchange dealer may compensate introducing brokers for introducing your account in ways which are not disclosed to you. Such paid solicitors are not required to have, and may not have, any special expertise in trading, and may have conflicts of interest based on the method by which they are compensated. Solicitors working on behalf of futures commission merchants and retail foreign exchange dealers are required to register. You should confirm that they are, in fact registered. You should thoroughly investigate the manner in which all such solicitors are compensated and be very cautious in granting any person or entity authority to trade on your behalf. You should always consider obtaining dated written confirmation of any information you are relying on from your dealer or a solicitor in making any trading or account decisions.
FINALLY, YOU SHOULD THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATE ANY STATEMENTS BY
ANY DEALERS OR SALES REPRESENTATIVES WHICH MINIMIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF, OR CONTRADICT, ANY OF THE TERMS OF THIS RISK DISCLOSURE. SUCH STATEMENTS MAY INDICATE POTENTIAL SALES FRAUD.
THIS BRIEF STATEMENT CANNOT, OF COURSE, DISCLOSE ALL THE RISKS AND OTHER ASPECTS OF TRADING OFF-EXCHANGE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS WITH A FUTURES COMMISSION MERCHANT OR RETAIL FOREIGN EXCHANGE DEALER.
I hereby acknowledge that I have received and understood this risk disclosure statement.
Date
Signature of Customer
(c) The acknowledgment required by paragraph (a) of this section must be retained by the retail foreign exchange dealer, futures commission merchant or introducing broker in accordance with § 1.31 of this chapter.
(d) This section does not relieve a retail foreign exchange dealer, futures commission merchant or introducing broker from any other disclosure obligation it may have under applicable law.
(e)(1) Immediately following the language set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, the statement required by paragraph (a) of this section shall include, for each of the most recent four calendar quarters during which the counterparty maintained retail forex customer accounts:
(i) The total number of non discretionary retail forex customer accounts maintained by the retail foreign exchange dealer or futures commission merchant;
(ii) The percentage of such accounts that were profitable during the quarter; and
(iii) The percentage of such accounts that were not profitable during the quarter.
(2) Identification of retail forex customer accounts for the purpose of this disclosure and the calculation in determining whether each such account was profitable or not profitable must be made in accordance with § 5.18(i) of this part. Such statement of profitable trades shall include the following legend: PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS. Each retail foreign exchange dealer or futures commission merchant shall provide, upon request, to any retail forex customer or prospective retail forex customer the total number of non discretionary retail forex accounts maintained by such foreign exchange dealer or futures commission merchant, the percentage of such accounts that were profitable and the percentage of such accounts that were not profitable, calculated in accordance with § 5.18(i) of this part, for each calendar quarter during the most recent five year period during which such retail foreign exchange dealer or futures commission merchant maintained non discretionary retail forex customer accounts.

Maintenance of minimum financial requirements by retail foreign exchange dealers and futures commission merchants offering or engaging in retail forex transactions.
(a) Each futures commission merchant offering or engaging in retail forex transactions or who files an application for registration as a futures commission merchant that will offer or engage in retail forex transactions and each person registered as a retail foreign exchange dealer or who files an application for registration as a retail foreign exchange dealer, who knows or should have known that its adjusted net capital at any time is less than the minimum required by § 5.7 of this part or by the capital rule of a registered futures association of which it is a member, must:
(1) Give telephonic notice, to be confirmed in writing by facsimile notice, that the applicant's or registrant's adjusted net capital is less than that required by § 5.7 of this part. The notice must be given immediately after the applicant or registrant knows or should know that its adjusted net capital is less than that required by any of the aforesaid rules to which the applicant or registrant is subject; and
(2) Provide together with such notice documentation in such form as necessary to adequately reflect the applicant's or registrant's capital condition
as of any date such person's adjusted net capital is less than the minimum required. The applicant or registrant must provide similar documentation for other days as the Commission may request.
(b) Each applicant or registrant, who knows or should have known that its adjusted net capital at any time is less than the greatest of:
(1) $22,000,000;
(2) 110 percent of the amount required by § 5.7(a)(1)(i)(B) of this part; or
(3) 110 percent of the amount of adjusted net capital required by a registered futures association of which the futures commission merchant or retail foreign exchange dealer is a member, must file written notice to that effect within 24 hours of such event.

(d) Whenever any applicant or registrant discovers or is notified by an independent public accountant, pursuant to § 1.16(e)(2) of this chapter, of the existence of any material inadequacy, as specified in § 1.16(d)(2) of this chapter, such applicant or registrant must give facsimile notice of such material inadequacy within 24 hours, and within 48 hours after giving such notice file a written report stating what steps have been and are being taken to correct the material inadequacy.
(e) Whenever any self-regulatory organization learns that a member registrant has failed to file a notice or written report as required by § 5.6 of this part, that self-regulatory organization must immediately report this failure by telephone, confirmed in writing immediately by facsimile notice, as provided in paragraph (h) of this section.
(f) A retail foreign exchange dealer or a futures commission merchant offering or engaging in retail forex transactions shall provide written notice of a substantial reduction in capital as compared to that last reported in a financial report filed with the Commission pursuant to § 5.12 of this part. This notice shall be provided as follows:
(1) If any event or series of events, including any withdrawal, advance, loan or loss cause, on a net basis, a reduction in net capital of 20 percent or more, notice must be provided within two business days of the event or series of events causing the reduction; and
(2) If the equity capital of the retail foreign exchange dealer or futures commission merchant offering or engaging in retail forex transactions or the equity capital of a subsidiary or affiliate of the retail foreign exchange dealer or futures commission merchant offering or engaging in retail forex transactions consolidated pursuant to § 1.17(f) of this chapter would be withdrawn by action of a stockholder or a partner or a limited liability company member or by redemption or repurchase of shares of stock by any of the consolidated entities or through the payment of dividends or any similar distribution, or an unsecured advance or loan would be made to a stockholder, partner, sole proprietor, limited liability company member, employee or affiliate, such that the withdrawal, advance or loan would cause, on a net basis, a reduction in excess adjusted net capital of 30 percent or more, notice must be provided at least two business days prior to the withdrawal, advance or loan that would cause the reduction: Provided, however, That the provisions of paragraphs (f)(1) and (f)(2) of this section do not apply to any retail foreign exchange transaction in the ordinary course of business between a retail foreign exchange dealer and any affiliate where the retail foreign exchange dealer makes payment to or on behalf of such affiliate for such transaction and then receives payment from such affiliate for such transaction within two business days from the date of the transaction.
(3) Upon receipt of such notice from a futures commission merchant offering or engaging in retail forex transactions or a retail foreign exchange dealer, the Market Participants Division or the Director's designee may require that
the futures commission merchant offering or engaging in retail forex transactions or retail foreign exchange dealer provide or cause a Material Affiliated Person (as that term is defined in § 5.10(a)(2) of this part) to provide, within three business days from the date of the request or such shorter period as the Director or designee may specify, such other information as the Director or designee determines to be necessary based upon market conditions, reports provided by the retail foreign exchange dealer or futures commission merchant offering or engaging in retail forex transactions, or other available information.
(g) Whenever a person registered as a futures commission merchant offering or engaging in retail forex transactions or a retail foreign exchange dealer knows or should know that the total amount of its retail forex obligation exceeds the amount of the aggregate retail forex assets the registrant maintains in accordance with the provisions of § 5.8 of this chapter, the registrant must report such deficiency immediately by telephone notice, confirmed immediately in writing by facsimile notice.
(h) Every notice and written report required to be given or filed with the Commission by this section by an applicant must be filed with the regional office of the Commission with jurisdiction over the state in which the applicant's principal place of business is located, and with the National Futures Association. Every notice and written report required to be given or filed with the Commission by this section by a registrant or self-regulatory organization must be filed with the regional office of the Commission with jurisdiction over the state in which the registrant's principal place of business is located, and with the registrant's designated self-regulatory organization. In addition, every notice and written report required to be given by this section must also be filed with the Chief Accountant of the Market Participants Division at the Commission's Washington, DC headquarters.
(i) In lieu of filing paper copies with the Commission, all filings or other notices prepared by a futures commission merchant or retail foreign exchange dealer pursuant to this section may be submitted to the Commission in electronic form using a form of user authentication assigned in accordance with procedures established by or approved by the Commission, and otherwise in accordance with instructions issued by or approved by the Commission, if the futures commission merchant, retail foreign exchange dealer or a designated self-regulatory organization has provided the Commission with the means necessary to read and to process the information contained in such report. Any such electronic submission must clearly indicate the registrant or applicant on whose behalf such filing is made and the use of such user authentication in submitting such filing will constitute and become a substitute for the manual signature of the authorized signer.

purpose of applying this section, “applicant” or “registrant” shall include retail foreign exchange dealers and futures commission merchants offering or engaging in retail forex transactions and applicants therefore.
(2) No person applying for registration as a retail foreign exchange dealer or a futures commission merchant that will engage in retail forex transactions shall be so registered unless such person affirmatively demonstrates to the satisfaction of a registered futures association that it complies with the financial requirements of this section.
(3) Each registrant must be in compliance with this section at all times and must be able to demonstrate such compliance to the satisfaction of the Commission or the registrant's designated self-regulatory organization.
(4) A registrant who is not in compliance with this section, or is unable to demonstrate such compliance as required by paragraph (a)(3) of this section, shall, as directed by and under the supervision of the Commission or the registrant's designated self-regulatory organization, either liquidate or transfer all retail forex accounts (including the novation of retail forex contracts) and refund or transfer all funds associated with such retail forex accounts and immediately cease offering or engaging in retail forex transactions until such time as the firm is able to demonstrate to the Commission or the registrant's designated self-regulatory organization such compliance:
Provided, however,
That if such registrant immediately demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Commission or the registrant's designated self-regulatory organization the ability to achieve compliance, the Commission or the registrant's designated self-regulatory organization may in its discretion allow such registrant up to a maximum of 10 business days, or such additional time as determined by the Commission, in which to achieve compliance without having to liquidate positions or transfer accounts and cease doing business as required above. Nothing in this paragraph (a)(4) shall be construed as preventing the Commission or the registrant's designated self-regulatory organization from taking action against a registrant for non-compliance with any of the provisions of this section.
(b) For the purposes of this section:
(1) Where the applicant or registrant has an asset or liability which is defined in Securities Exchange Act Rule 15c3-1 (§ 240.15c3-1 of this title) the inclusion or exclusion of all or part of such asset or liability for the computation of adjusted net capital shall be in accordance with § 240.15c3-1 of this title, unless specifically stated otherwise in this section or in § 1.17 of this chapter.
(2) The adjusted net capital of an applicant or registrant for the purpose of this section shall be determined by the application of § 1.17 pursuant to paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, with the following additions:
(i) All positions in retail forex accounts and other financial positions and instruments of the applicant or registrant must be marked to market and adjusted daily by referencing to current market prices or rates of exchange.
(ii) Current assets must exclude any retail forex account which liquidates to a deficit or contains a debit ledger balance only and is not secured in accordance with § 1.17(c)(3).
(iii) Current assets must exclude any unsecured receivable accrued from any over-the-counter transaction in foreign currency, options on foreign currency or options on contracts for the purchase or sale of foreign currency, or arising from the deposit of collateral or compensating balances with respect to such transactions, unless such unsecured receivable is from a person who is an eligible contract participant that also is:
(A) A bank or trust company regulated by a United States banking regulator;
(B) A broker-dealer registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission and a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority;
(C) A futures commission merchant registered with the Commission and a member of the National Futures Association;
(D) A retail foreign exchange dealer registered with the Commission and a member of the National Futures Association;
(E) An entity regulated as a foreign equivalent of any of the persons listed in paragraphs (b)(2)(iii)(A) through (D) of this section, if such person is regulated in a money center country as defined in § 1.49 of this chapter and recognized by the futures commission merchant's or retail foreign exchange dealer's designated self-regulatory organization as a foreign equivalent;
(F) Any other entity approved by the futures commission merchant's or retail foreign exchange dealer's designated self-regulatory organization.
(iv) The value attributed to any retail forex transaction that is an option shall be the difference between the option's exercise value or striking value and the market value of the underlying. In the case of a call, if the market value of the underlying is less than the exercise value or striking value of such call, it shall be given no value; and, in the case of a put, if the market value of the underlying is more than the exercise value or striking value of the put, it shall be given no value.
(v)(A) In computing adjusted net capital, the capital deductions set forth in § 1.17(c)(5)(ii) of this chapter shall apply to retail forex transactions other than options. The capital deductions which apply are six percent for net positions in Euros, British pounds, Canadian dollars, Japanese yen, or Swiss francs and 20 percent for net positions in all other foreign currencies,
Provided, however,
That there shall be no capital deductions for retail forex transactions covered (as defined in § 1.17(j) of this chapter) by the applicant or registrant by open futures contracts to the extent such futures contracts are not otherwise designated as cover for any other net capital purposes. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2)(v)(A), such retail forex transactions shall be treated as if they were inventory and cover were therefore applicable. A retail foreign exchange dealer or futures commission merchant may not use an affiliate (unless approved by the firm's designated self-regulatory organization) or any person that is considered unregulated under the rules of the firm's designated self-regulatory organization to cover its currency positions for purposes of this section.
(B) In computing adjusted net capital, the capital deductions set forth in § 1.17(c)(5)(vi) of this chapter shall apply to all retail forex transactions that are options.
(C) For the purpose of applying capital deductions on open proprietary futures positions under § 1.17(c)(5)(x) of this chapter, net or individual positions in retail forex transactions shall not constitute cover under § 1.17(j) for the purpose of applying such charges.
(c) An applicant or registrant must prepare, and keep current, ledgers or other similar records which show or summarize, with appropriate references to supporting documents, each transaction affecting the applicant's or registrant's asset, liability, income, expense and capital accounts, and in which (except as otherwise permitted in writing by the Commission) all the applicant's or registrant's asset, liability and capital accounts are classified into the account classification subdivisions specified on Form 1-FR-FCM. Each applicant or registrant shall prepare and keep current such records.
(d) An applicant or registrant must make and keep as a record in accordance with § 5.14 of this part formal computations of its adjusted net capital and of its minimum financial requirements pursuant to this section as of the close of business each month and on other such dates called for by the Commission, the National Futures Association, or another self-regulatory organization of which the firm is a member. Such computations must be completed and made available for inspection by any representative of the Commission, the National Futures Association, a self-regulatory organization of which the firm is a member, or the United States Department of Justice commencing the first month-end after the date the application for registration is filed.

(e) In computing its adjusted net capital pursuant to § 5.7 of this part, a retail foreign exchange dealer or futures commission merchant may not include aggregate retail forex assets as current assets or otherwise record any property received from retail forex customers as an asset without recording a corresponding liability to the retail forex customers.
§ 5.9
Security deposits for retail forex transactions.
(a) Each futures commission merchant engaging, or offering to engage, in retail forex transactions and each retail foreign exchange dealer must collect from each retail forex customer a minimum security deposit for each retail forex transaction equal to the applicable percentage as set by the registered futures association of which they are a member;

(d) A major currency pair security deposit percentage is only applicable when both sides of a retail over-the-counter foreign exchange transaction involve major currencies.
(e) Any registered futures association whose members serve as counterparties to retail forex transaction shall designate which currencies are “major currencies”, and shall review, no less frequently than annually, major currency designations and security deposit
requirements, and shall adjust the designations and requirements as necessary.

(e)
Certification.
Copies of the notice and the submission of any additional information provided pursuant to this section must be certified as true and correct by a duly authorized officer, agent or employee of the exchange.

(4) The person against whom the action is taken has consented to the penalty to be imposed and to the timing of its effectiveness.
(b)
Notice of early effective date.

§ 9.22
Appeal brief.
(a)
Time to file.

The petition for stay must be accompanied by the notice of appeal.
(2) Within ten days after a notice of summary action has been delivered in accordance with § 9.12(b) to a person who is the subject of a summary action permitted by part 37, appendix B, Core Principle 2, paragraph (a)(14) of this chapter or part 38, appendix B, Core Principle 13, paragraph (a)(7) of this chapter (emergency disciplinary actions), that person may petition the Commission to stay the effectiveness of the summary action pending completion of the exchange proceeding.

(b)
Contents of petition for stay.
A petition filed under this section must state the reasons that the stay is requested and the facts relied upon, as specified in § 9.20. Averments of the petition must be supported by affidavits, other sworn statements or copies thereof, or a stipulation as to those facts which are not in dispute. Based upon the petition, the Commission, in its discretion, may order a stay of the disciplinary action or access denial action.
(c)
Response to petition.
The exchange may serve and file a written response to any petition for a stay within five days after service of the petition.
(d)
Standards for granting petition for stay.
The Commission will promptly determine whether to grant or deny a
petition for stay and may act upon a petition at any time, without waiting for a response thereto. In determining whether to grant or deny the petition for stay, the Commission will consider, among other things, whether the petitioner has established:
(1) Petitioner's likelihood of success on the merits; and
(2) That denial of the stay would cause irreparable harm to the petitioner; and
(3) That granting the stay would not endanger orderly trading or otherwise cause substantial harm to the exchange or market participants; and
(4) That granting the stay would not be contrary to the Act, and the rules, regulations and orders of the Commission thereunder or otherwise contrary to the public interest.
(e)
Ex parte stays.
The Commission may act upon a petition for stay, without waiting for the exchange's response thereto only where petitioner:
(1) Expressly requests an
ex parte
stay;
(2) Files a proof of service; and
(3) Clearly establishes by affidavit that immediate and irreparable injury, loss or damage will result to the petitioner before the exchange can be heard in opposition.
Any order granting a stay prior to the filing of the exchange's reply will expire by its terms within such time after service of the Commission's ruling on the petition, not to exceed ten days, as the Commission fixes, unless within the time so fixed the order, for good cause shown, is extended for a like period or unless the exchange consents that it may be extended for a longer period. In any case, the exchange may move for dissolution or modification of the stay, and the Commission will proceed to determine such motion as expeditiously as the ends of justice require.
[52 FR 25366, July 7, 1987, as amended at 52 FR 27286, July 20, 1987; 83 FR 1548, Jan. 12, 2018]
§ 9.25

[52 FR 25366, July 7, 1987, as amended at 59 FR 5701, Feb. 8, 1994]

§§ 9.27-9.29
[Reserved]

# Subpart D—Commission Review of Disciplinary, Access Denial or Other Adverse Action
§ 9.30
Scope of review.
On review, the Commission may, in its discretion, consider
sua sponte
any issues arising from the record before it and may base its determination thereon, or limit the issues to those presented in the statement of issues in the briefs, treating those issues not raised as waived. If the Commission determines to consider any issue not raised by the parties, it may issue an order that notifies the parties of such determination and provides an opportunity for the parties to address any issue considered
sua sponte
by the Commission.
§ 9.31
Commission review of disciplinary or access denial action on its own motion.
(a)
Request for additional information.
Where a person disciplined or denied access has not appealed the exchange decision to the Commission, upon review of the notice specified in § 9.11, the Division of Market Oversight or the Market Participants Division may request that the exchange file with the Division the record of the exchange proceeding, or designated portions of the record, a brief statement of the evidence and testimony adduced to support the exchange's findings that a rule or rules of the exchange were violated and such recordings, transcripts and other documents applicable to the particular exchange proceeding as the Division may specify. The exchange must promptly advise the person who is the subject of the disciplinary or access denial action of the Division's request. Within thirty days after service of the Division's request, the exchange must file the information requested with the Division in the manner requested by the Division and, upon request, deliver that information to the person who is the subject of the disciplinary or access denial action. Delivery to the person who is the subject of the disciplinary or access denial action must be in the manner prescribed by § 9.11(c). A person subject to the disciplinary action or access denial action requesting a copy of the information furnished to the Division must, if the exchange rules so provide, agree to pay the exchange reasonable fees for printing the copy.
(b)
Review on motion of the Commission.
The Commission may institute review of an exchange disciplinary or access denial action on its own motion. Other than in extraordinary circumstances, such review will be initiated within 180 days after the NFA has received the notice of exchange action provided for in § 9.11. If the Commission should institute review on its own motion, it will issue an order permitting the person who is the subject of the disciplinary or access denial action an opportunity to file an appropriate submission, and the exchange an opportunity to file a reply thereto.
[83 FR 1548, Jan. 12, 2018, as amended at 89 FR 71807, Sept. 4, 2024]
§ 9.32
Oral argument.
(a)
On motion of Commission.
On its own motion, the Commission may, in its discretion, hear oral argument by the parties any time before the decision of the Commission is filed with the Proceedings Clerk.
(b)
On request of party.
Any party may file with the Proceedings Clerk a request in writing for the opportunity to present oral argument before the Commission, which the Commission may, in its discretion, grant or deny. A request under this paragraph must be filed concurrently with the party's brief.
(c)
Reporting and transcription.
Oral argument before the Commission will be recorded and transcribed unless the Commission directs otherwise. In the event the Commission affords the parties the opportunity to present oral argument before the Commission, the oral argument will proceed in accordance with the provisions of § 10.103 (b) and (d) of this chapter.
§ 9.33
Final decision by the Commission.
(a)
Opinion and order.
Upon review, the Commission may affirm, modify, set aside, or remand for further proceedings, in whole or in part, the decision of the exchange. The Commission's decision will be contained in its
opinion and order which will be based upon the record before it, including the record of the exchange proceeding, and any oral argument made in accordance with § 9.32. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the opinion and order will constitute the final decision of the Commission, effective upon service on the parties. In the event the Commission is equally divided as to its decision, the Commission will affirm without opinion the decision of the exchange, which will constitute the Commission's final decision.
(b)
Order of summary affirmance.
If the Commission finds that the result reached in the decision of the exchange is substantially correct and that none of the arguments on appeal made by the appellant raise important questions of law or policy, the Commission may, by appropriate order, summarily affirm the decision of the exchange without opinion, which will constitute the Commission's final decision. Unless the Commission expressly indicates otherwise in its order, an order of summary affirmance does not reflect a Commission determination to adopt the exchange final decision, including any rationale contained therein, as its opinion and order, and neither the exchange's final decision nor the Commission's order of summary affirmance will serve as a Commission precedent in other proceedings.
(c)
Standards of review.
In reviewing an exchange disciplinary, access denial or other adverse action, the Commission will consider whether:
(1) The exchange disciplinary, access denial or other adverse action was taken in accordance with the rules of the exchange;
(2) Fundamental fairness was observed in the conduct of the proceeding resulting in the disciplinary, access denial or other adverse action;
(3)(i) In the case of a disciplinary action, the record contains substantial evidence of a violation of the rules of the exchange, or (ii) in the case of an access denial or other adverse action, the record contains substantial evidence supporting the exchange action; and
(4) The disciplinary, access denial or other adverse action otherwise accords with the Act and the rules, regulations and orders of the Commission thereunder.

No person shall be admitted as a party to a proceeding by intervention unless the Administrative Law Judge is satisfied that (1) a substantial interest of the person seeking to intervene may be adversely affected by the matter to be considered in the proceeding; (2) that his intervention will not materially prejudice the rights of any party, through delay or otherwise; (3) that his participation as a party will otherwise be consistent with the public interest; and (4) that leave to be heard pursuant to § 10.34 would be inadequate for the protection of his interests. The burden shall be upon the petitioner to satisfy the Administrative Law Judge on these issues.
(d)
Rights of intervenor.
A person who has been granted leave to intervene shall from that time forward have all the rights and responsibilities of a party to the proceeding.
§ 10.34
Limited participation.
(a)
Petitions for leave to be heard.
Any person may, in the discretion of the Administrative Law Judge, be given leave to be heard in any proceeding as to any matter affecting his interests. Petitions for leave to be heard shall be in writing, shall set forth (1) the nature and extent of the applicant's interest in the proceeding; (2) the issues on which he wishes to participate; and (3) in what manner he wishes to participate. The Administrative Law Judge may direct any person requesting leave to be heard to submit himself to examination as to his interest in the proceeding.
(b)
Rights of a participant.
Leave to be heard pursuant to § 10.34(a) may include such rights of a party as the Administrative Law Judge may deem appropriate, except that oral argument before the Commission may be permitted only by the Commission.
§ 10.35
Permission to state views.
Any person may, in the discretion of the Administrative Law Judge be permitted to file a memorandum or make an oral statement of his views, and the Administrative Law Judge may, in his
discretion, accept for the record written communications received from any person.

Commission review of rulings.
Interlocutory review by the Commission of a ruling as to matters within the scope of § 10.33, § 10.34 or § 10.35 may be sought in accordance with the procedures set forth in § 10.101 of these rules without certification by the Administrative Law Judge.

(3) The foregoing procedures shall not be deemed applicable to rebuttal evidence submitted by any party at the hearing.
(4) In any action where a party fails to comply with the requirements of this paragraph (a), the Administrative Law Judge may make such orders in regard to the failure as are just, taking into account all of the relevant facts and circumstances of the failure to comply.
(b)
Investigatory materials—
(1)
In general.
Unless otherwise ordered by the Commission or the Administrative Law Judge, the Division of Enforcement shall make available for inspection and copying by the respondents, prior to the scheduled hearing date, any of the following documents that were obtained by the Division prior to the institution of proceedings in connection with the investigation that led to the complaint and notice of hearing:

(v) Information obtained from a domestic or foreign governmental entity or from a foreign futures authority that either is not relevant to the resolution of the proceeding or was provided on condition that the information not be disclosed or that it only be disclosed by the Commission or a representative of the Commission as evidence in an enforcement or other proceeding.
(3) Nothing in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section shall limit the ability of the Division of Enforcement to withhold documents or other information on the grounds of privilege, the work product doctrine or other protection from disclosure under applicable law. When the investigation by the Division of Enforcement that led to the pending proceeding encompasses transactions, conduct or persons other than those involved in the proceeding, the requirements of (b)(1) of this section shall apply only to the particular transaction, conduct and persons involved in the proceeding.
(4)
Index of withheld documents.
When documents are made available for inspection and copying pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the Division of Enforcement shall furnish the respondents with an index of all documents that are withheld pursuant to paragraphs (b)(2) or (b)(3) of this section, except for any documents that are being withheld because they disclose information obtained from a domestic or foreign governmental entity or from a foreign futures authority on condition that the information not be disclosed or that it only be disclosed by the Commission or a representative of the Commission as evidence in an enforcement or other proceeding, in which case the Division shall inform the other parties of the fact that such documents are being withheld at the time it furnishes its index under this paragraph, but no further disclosures regarding those documents shall be required. This index shall describe the nature of the withheld documents in a manner that, to the extent practicable without revealing any information that itself is privileged or protected from disclosure by law or these rules, will enable the other parties to assess the applicability of the privilege or protection claimed.
(5)
Arrangements for inspection and copying.
Upon request by the respondents, all documents subject to inspection and copying pursuant to this paragraph (b) shall be made available to the respondents at the Commission office nearest the location where the respondents or their counsel live or work. Otherwise, the documents shall be made available at the Commission office where they are ordinarily maintained or at any other location agreed upon by the parties in writing. Upon payment of the appropriate fees set forth in appendix B to part 145 of this chapter, any respondent may obtain a photocopy of any document made available for inspection. Without the prior written consent of the Division of Enforcement, no respondent shall have the right to take custody of any documents that are made available for inspection and copying, or to remove them from Commission premises.
(6)
Failure to make documents available.
In the event that the Division of Enforcement fails to make available documents subject to inspection and copying pursuant to this paragraph (b), no rehearing or reconsideration of a matter already heard or decided shall be required, unless the respondent demonstrates prejudice caused by the failure to make the documents available.
(7)
Requests for confidential treatment; protective orders.
If a person has requested confidential treatment of information submitted by him or her, either pursuant to rules adopted by the Commission under the Freedom of Information Act (part 145 of this chapter) or under the Commission's Rules Relating to Investigations (part 11 of this chapter), the Division of Enforcement shall notify him or her, if possible, that the information is to be disclosed to parties to the proceeding and he or she may apply to the Administrative Law Judge for an order protecting the information from disclosure, consideration of which shall be governed by § 10.68(c)(2).
(c)
Witness statements
—(1)
In general.
Each party to an adjudicatory proceeding shall make available to the other parties any statement of any person whom the party calls, or expects to call, as a witness that relates to the anticipated testimony of the witness and is in the party's possession. Such statements shall include the following:
(i) Transcripts of investigative, deposition, trial or similar testimony given by the witness,
(ii) Written statements signed by the witness, and
(iii) Substantially verbatim notes of interviews with the witness, and all exhibits to such transcripts, statements and notes. For purposes of this paragraph (c), “substantially verbatim notes” means notes that fairly record the exact words of the witness, subject to minor, inconsequential deviations. Such statements shall include memoranda and other writings authored by the witness that contain information relating to his anticipated testimony. The Division of Enforcement shall produce witness statements pursuant to this paragraph prior to the scheduled hearing date, at a time to be designated by the Administrative Law Judge. Respondents shall produce witness statements pursuant to this paragraph at the close of the Division's case in chief during the hearing. If necessary, the Administrative Law Judge shall, upon request, grant the Division a continuance of the hearing in order to review and analyze any witness statements produced by the respondents.
(2) Nothing in paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall limit the ability of a party to withhold documents or other information on the grounds of privilege, the work product doctrine or other protection from disclosure under applicable law.
(3)
Index of withheld documents.
When a party makes witness statements available pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section, he or she shall furnish each of the other parties with an index of all documents that the party is withholding on the grounds of privilege or work product. This index shall describe the nature of the withheld documents in a manner that, to the extent practicable without revealing information that itself is privileged or protected from disclosure by law or these rules, will enable the other parties to assess the applicability of the privilege or protection claimed.
(4)
Failure to produce witness statements.
In the event that a party fails to
make available witness statements subject to production pursuant to this section, no rehearing or reconsideration of a matter already heard or decided shall be required, unless another party demonstrates prejudice caused by the failure to make the witness statements available.
(d)
Modification of production requirements.
The Administrative Law Judge shall modify any of the requirements of paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section that any party can show is unduly burdensome or is otherwise inappropriate under all the circumstances.
(e)
Admissions
—(1)
Request for admissions.
Any party may serve upon any other party, with a copy to the Proceedings Clerk, a written request for admission of the truth of any facts relevant to the pending proceeding set forth in the request. Each matter of which an admission is requested shall be separately set forth. Unless prior written approval is obtained from the Administrative Law Judge, the number of requests shall not exceed 50 in number including all discrete parts and subparts.
(2)
Response.
A matter shall be considered to be admitted unless, within 15 days after service of the request, or within such other time as the Administrative Law Judge may allow, the party upon whom the request is directed serves upon the requesting party a sworn written answer or objection to the matter. If objection is made, the reasons therefor shall be stated. The response shall specifically deny the matter or set forth in detail the reasons why the answering party cannot truthfully admit or deny the matter. A denial shall fairly meet the substance of the requested admission and when good faith requires that a party qualify his answer and deny only a part of the matter, he shall specify so much of it as is true and qualify or deny the remainder. An answering party may not give a lack of information or knowledge as a reason for failure to admit or deny unless he states that he has made reasonable inquiry and that the information known or reasonably available to him is insufficient to enable him to admit or deny. A party who considers that a matter of which an admission has been requested presents a genuine issue for trial may not, on that ground alone, object to the request; he may deny the matter or set forth reasons why he cannot admit or deny it.
(3)
Determining sufficiency of answers or objections.
The party who has requested the admissions may move to determine the sufficiency of the answers or objections. Unless the objecting party sustains his burden of showing that the objection is justified, the Administrative Law Judge shall order that an answer be served. If the Administrative Law Judge determines that an answer does not comply with the requirements of this rule, he may order either that the matter is admitted or that an amended answer be served.
(4)
Effect of admission.
Any matter admitted under this rule is conclusively established and may be used at a hearing as against the party who made the admission. However, the Administrative Law Judge may permit withdrawal or amendment when the presentation on the merits of the proceeding will be served thereby and the party who obtains the admission fails to satisfy the Administrative Law Judge that withdrawal or amendment will prejudice him in maintaining his action or defense on the merits.
(f)
Objections to authenticity or admissibility of documents
—(1)
Identification of documents.
The Administrative Law Judge, acting on his or her own initiative or upon motion by any party, may direct each party to serve upon the other parties, with a copy to the Proceedings Clerk, a list identifying the documents that it intends to introduce at the hearing and requesting the other parties to file and serve a response disclosing any objection, together with the factual or legal grounds therefor, to the authenticity or admissibility of each document identified on the list. A copy of each document identified on the list shall be served with the request, unless the party being served already has the document in his possession or has reasonably ready access to it.
(2)
Objections to authenticity or admissibility.
Within 20 days after service or at such other time as may be designated by the Administrative Law Judge, each party upon whom the list
described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section was served shall file a response disclosing any objection, together with the factual or legal grounds therefor, to the authenticity or admissibility of each document identified on the list. Except for relevance, waste of time or needless presentation of cumulative evidence, all objections not raised may be deemed waived.
(3)
Rulings on objections.
In his or her discretion, the Administrative Law Judge may treat as a motion in limine any list served by a party pursuant to paragraph (f)(1) of this section, where any other party has filed a response objecting to the authenticity or the admissibility on any item listed. In that event, after affording the parties an opportunity to file briefs containing arguments on the motion to the degree necessary for a decision, the ALJ may rule on any objection to the authenticity or admissibility of any document identified on the list in advance of trial, to the extent appropriate.
[41 FR 2511, Jan. 16, 1976, as amended at 60 FR 54802, Oct. 26, 1995; 63 FR 55792, Oct. 19, 1998; 63 FR 68829, Dec. 14, 1998]
§ 10.43
Stipulations.
The parties may by stipulation in writing at any stage of the proceeding, or orally made at hearing, agree upon any pertinent facts in the proceeding. It is desirable that the facts be thus agreed upon so far as and whenever practicable. Stipulations may be received in evidence at a hearing and when received in evidence shall be binding on the parties thereto.
§ 10.44
Depositions and interrogatories.
(a)
When permitted.
If it appears that:
(1) A prospective witness will be unable to attend or testify at a hearing on the basis of age, illness, infirmity, imprisonment or on the basis that he is or will be outside of the United States at the time of the hearing (unless it appears that the absence of the witness was procured by the party seeking to take the deposition),
(2) His testimony is material,
(3) It is necessary to take his deposition in the interest of Justice, the Administrative Law Judge may by order direct that his deposition be taken either orally or in the form of written interrogatories, and may issue a subpoena to compel the attendance of the witness for deposition.
(b)
Application for deposition.
Any party desiring to take the deposition of a witness shall make application in writing to the Administrative Law Judge for an order to take deposition. In addition to the showing required in § 10.44(a), the application shall include:
(1) The name and post office address of the witness;
(2) The specific matters concerning which the witness is expected to testify and their relevance;
(3) The reasons why the deposition should be taken, supported by affidavits and a physician's certificate, where appropriate;
(4) The time when, the place where, and the name and address of the person before whom the deposition is to be taken;
(5) A specification of the documents and materials which the deponent is requested to produce;
(6) Application for any subpoenas.
(c)
Service and reply.
A copy of the application to take deposition shall be served upon every other party to the proceeding and upon the person sought to be deposed. Any party or the deponent may serve and file an opposition to the application within seven days after the application is filed.
(d)
Time when, place where, and officer before whom deposition is taken—
(1)
Where the deposition is taken.
Unless otherwise ordered or agreed to by stipulation, depositions shall be taken in the city or municipality where the deponent is located.
(2)
Officer before whom taken.
(i) Within the United States or a territory of the United States, depositions shall be taken before an officer authorized to administer oaths by the laws of the United States or of the place where the examination is held.
(ii) Within a foreign country, depositions may be taken before an officer or person designated by the Administrative Law Judge or agreed upon by the parties by a stipulation in writing to be filed with the Proceedings Clerk.
(e)
Procedures for taking oral depositions.
(1) Oral examination and crossexamination of witnesses shall be
conducted in a manner similar to that permitted at a formal hearing. All questions and testimony shall be recorded verbatim, except to the extent that all parties present or represented may agree that a matter shall be off the record.
(2) All objections made at the time of the examination to the qualifications of the officer taking the deposition, or to the manner of taking it, or to the evidence presented, or to the conduct of any party, or any other objection to the proceeding shall be noted by the officer upon the deposition, and shall subsequently be determined by the Administrative Law Judge. Evidence objected to shall be taken subject to the objections. However, the parties may stipulate that, except as to objections to the form of questions, all objections to the matters testified to in a deposition are preserved for the hearing, whether or not raised at the time of deposition.
(3) During the taking of a deposition a party or deponent may request and obtain an adjournment to permit an application to be made to the Administrative Law Judge for an order suspending the deposition on grounds of bad faith in the conduct of the examination, annoyance, embarrassment, oppression of a deponent or party, or improper questions. An attorney who requests and obtains an adjournment for this purpose but fails, without good cause, promptly to apply for relief to the Administrative Law Judge may be found guilty of contemptuous conduct in accordance with § 10.11(b) of these rules.
(f)
Procedures for use of interrogatories.
(1) If depositions are to be taken and submitted on written interrogatories, the interrogatories shall be filed in triplicate with the application for deposition and served on the parties. Within ten days after service, any party may file, in triplicate, with the Proceedings Clerk, his objections, if any, to such interrogatories and may file such cross-interrogatories as he desires to submit. Other parties shall have ten days to file their objections to cross-interrogatories. Objections shall be settled by the Administrative Law Judge.
(2) When a deposition is taken upon written interrogatories and cross-interrogatories, no party shall be present or represented and no person other than the witness, a stenographic reporter, and the officer shall be present. The officer shall propound the interrogatories and cross-interrogatories to the witness, and the interrogatories and responses thereto shall be transcribed and reduced to writing.
(g)
Use of depositions at hearing.
(1) Any part or all of a deposition, to the extent admissible under rules of evidence applied as though the witness were then present and testifying at the hearing, may be used against any party who had reasonable notice of the taking of the deposition, if the Administrative Law Judge finds that:
(i) The witness is dead;
(ii) The witness is unable to attend or testify because of age, illness, infirmity, or imprisonment;
(iii) The witness is out of the United States at the time of the hearing, unless it appears that the absence of the witness was procured by the party offering the deposition.
(2) If only part of a deposition is offered in evidence by a party, an adverse party may require him to introduce any other part which ought in fairness to be considered with the part introduced, and any party may introduce any other parts.
(3) Objection may be made at a hearing to receiving in evidence any deposition or part thereof for any reason which would require the exclusion of the evidence if the witness were then present and testifying.

(b)
Effect of failure to appear.
(1) If any party to the proceeding, after filing an answer fails to appear at the hearing or any part thereof, he shall to that extent be deemed to have waived the right to an oral hearing in the proceeding. In the event that a party appears at the hearing and no party appears for the opposing side, the party who is present may present his evidence, in whole or in part, in the form of affidavits or by oral testimony, before the Administrative Law Judge.
(2) A failure to appear at a hearing shall not constitute a waiver of a party's right to propose findings of fact based on the record in the proceeding, to propose conclusions of law or to submit briefs, in the manner provided in § 10.82, if the non-appearing party submits prior to the scheduled hearing or within three days thereafter, a notice of appearance indicating his intent to continue to participate in the proceeding. Otherwise, his failure to appear will constitute a default, and a default order may be sought in accordance with procedures set forth in § 10.93 of these rules.
§ 10.63
Consolidation; separate hearings.
(a)
Consolidation.
Two or more proceedings involving a common question of law or fact may be joined for hearing of any or all the matters in issue or may be consolidated by order of the Administrative Law Judge. The Administrative Law Judge may make such rulings concerning the conduct of such proceedings as may tend to avoid unnecessary costs or delay.
(b)
Separate Hearings.
The Administrative Law Judge, for the convenience of the parties, to avoid prejudice, or to expedite final resolution of the issues, may order a separate hearing of any claim or issue, or grant a separate hearing to any respondent.
§ 10.64
Public hearings.
All hearings shall be public, except that upon application of a respondent or affected witness the Administrative Law Judge may direct that specific documents or testimony be received and retained non-publicly in order to prevent unwarranted disclosure of trade secrets or sensitive commercial or financial information or an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.
§ 10.65
Record of hearing.
(a)
Reporting and transcription.
Hearings for the purpose of taking evidence shall be recorded and transcribed in written form under the supervision of the Administrative Law Judge by a reporter employed by the Commission for that purpose.

Copies of transcripts, except those portions granted non-public treatment, shall be available from the reporter at rates not to exceed the maximum rates fixed by the contract between the Commission and the reporter.
(b)
Corrections.
Any party may submit a timely request to the Administrative Law Judge to correct the transcript. Corrections may be submitted to the Administrative Law Judge by stipulation of the parties, or by motion by any party, and upon notice to all parties to the proceeding, the Administrative Law Judge may specify corrections of the transcript. A copy of such specification shall be furnished to all parties and made a part of the record. Corrections shall be made by the official reporter, who shall furnish substitute pages of the transcript, under the usual certificate of the reporter, for insertion in the official record. The original uncorrected pages shall be retained in the files of the Proceedings Clerk.

Rights of parties.
Every party shall be entitled to due notice of hearings, the right to be represented by counsel, and the right to cross-examine witnesses, present oral and documentary evidence, submit rebuttal evidence, raise objections, make arguments and move for appropriate relief. Nothing in this paragraph limits the authority of the Commission or the Administrative Law Judge to exercise authority under other provisions of the Commission's rules, to enforce the requirement that evidence presented be relevant to the proceeding or to limit cross-examination to the subject matter of the direct examination and matters affecting the credibility of the witness.
(c)
Examination of witnesses.
All witnesses at a hearing for the purpose of taking evidence shall testify under oath or affirmation, which shall be administered by the Administrative Law Judge. A witness may be cross-examined by each adverse party and, in the discretion of the Administrative Law Judge, may be cross-examined, without regard to the scope of direct examination, as to any matter which is relevant to the issues in the proceeding.
(d)
Expert witnesses.
The Administrative Law Judge, at his discretion, may order that direct testimony of expert witnesses be made by verified written statement rather than presented orally at the hearing. Any expert witness whose testimony is presented in this manner shall be available for oral cross-examination, and may be examined orally upon re-direct following cross-examination.
(e)
Exhibits.
The original of each exhibit introduced in evidence or marked for identification shall be filed and retained in the docket of the proceeding, unless the Administrative Law Judge permits the substitution of copies for the original documents. A copy of each exhibit introduced by a party or marked for identification at his request shall be supplied by him to the Administrative Law Judge and to each other party to the proceeding.
[41 FR 2511, Jan. 16, 1976, as amended at 63 FR 55793, Oct. 19, 1998; 63 FR 68829, Dec. 14, 1998]

Admissibility.
Relevant, material and reliable evidence shall be admitted. Irrelevant, immaterial, unreliable and unduly repetitious evidence shall be excluded.

Official notice.
(1) Official notice may be taken of
(i) Any material fact which might be judicially noticed by a district court of the United States; or
(ii) Any matter in the public official records of the Commission.
(2) If official notice is requested or taken of a material fact, any party, upon timely request, shall be afforded an opportunity to establish the contrary.
(c)
Objections.
A party shall timely and briefly state the grounds relied upon for any objection made to the introduction of evidence. If a party has had no opportunity to object to a ruling at the time it is made, he shall not thereafter be prejudiced by the absence of an objection.
(d)
Exceptions.
Formal exception to an adverse ruling is not required. It shall be sufficient that a party, at the time the ruling is sought or entered, makes known to the Administrative Law Judge the action he wishes the Administrative Law Judge to take or his objection to the action being taken and his grounds therefor.
(e)
Excluded evidence.
When an objection to a question propounded to a witness is sustained, the examining attorney may make a specific offer of what he expects to prove by the answer of the witness, or the Administrative Law Judge may, in his discretion, receive the evidence in full. Rejected exhibits, adequately marked for identification, shall be retained in the record so as to be available for consideration by any reviewing authority.
(f)
Affidavits.
Affidavits may be admitted by the Administrative Law Judge only if the evidence is otherwise admissible and the parties agree that affidavits may be used.
(g)
Official government records.
An official government record or any entry therein, when admissible for any purpose, may be evidenced by an official
publication thereof or by a copy attested by the officer having legal custody of the record or by his deputy, accompanied by a certificate that such officer has custody. If the office in which the record is kept is within the United States the certificate may be made by a judge of a court of record in the district or political subdivision in which the record is kept, authenticated by the seal of his office. If the office in which the record is kept is in a foreign state or country, the certificate may be made by any officer in the Foreign Service of the United States stationed in the foreign state or country in which the record is kept and authenticated by the seal of his office. A written statement signed by an officer having custody of an official record or by his deputy, that after diligent search, no record or entry dealing with a specific matter is found to exist, accompanied by a certificate as provided above, is admissible as evidence that the records of his office contain no such record or entry.
(h)
Entries in the regular course of business.
Any writing or record, whether in the form of an entry in a book or otherwise, made as a memorandum or record of any act, transaction, occurrence, or event, will be admissible as evidence thereof if it shall appear that it was made in the regular course of business by a person who had a duty to report or record it.
§ 10.68
Subpoenas.
(a)
Application for and issuance of subpoenas
—(1)
Application for and issuance of subpoena ad testificandum.
Any party may apply to the Administrative Law Judge for the issuance of a subpoena requiring a person to appear and testify (subpoena ad testificandum) at the hearing. All requests for the issuance of a subpoena ad testificandum shall be submitted in duplicate and in writing and shall be served upon all other parties to the proceeding, unless the request is made on the record at the hearing or the requesting party can demonstrate why, in the interest of fairness or justice, the requirement of a written submission or service on one or more of the other parties is not appropriate. A subpoena ad testificandum shall be issued upon a showing by the requesting party of the general relevance of the testimony being sought and the tender of an original and two copies of the subpoena being requested, except in those situations described in paragraph (b) of this section, where additional requirements are set forth.
(2)
Application for subpoena duces tecum.
An application for a subpoena requiring a person to produce specified documentary or tangible evidence (subpoena duces tecum) at any designated time or place may be made by any party to the Administrative Law Judge. All requests for the issuance of a subpoena duces tecum shall be submitted in duplicate and in writing and shall be served upon all other parties to the proceeding, unless the request is made on the record at the hearing or the requesting party can demonstrate why, in the interest of fairness or justice, the requirement of a written submission or service on one or more of the other parties is not appropriate. Except in those situations described in paragraph (b) of this section, where additional requirements are set forth, each application for the issuance of a subpoena duces tecum shall contain a statement or showing of general relevance and reasonable scope of the evidence being sought and be accompanied by an original and two copies of the subpoena being requested, which shall describe the documentary or tangible evidence to be subpoenaed with as much particularity as is feasible.
(3)
Standards for issuance of subpoena duces tecum.
The Administrative Law Judge considering any application for a subpoena duces tecum shall issue the subpoena requested if he is satisfied the application complies with this section and the request is not unreasonable, oppressive, excessive in scope or unduly burdensome. No attempt shall be made to determine the admissibility of evidence in passing upon an application for a subpoena duces tecum and no detailed or burdensome showing shall be required as a condition to the issuance of any subpoena.
(4)
Denial of application.
In the event the Administrative Law Judge determines that a requested subpoena or any of its terms are unreasonable, oppressive, excessive in scope, or unduly burdensome, he may refuse to issue the
subpoena, or may issue it only upon such conditions as he determines fairness requires.
(b)
Special requirements relating to application for and issuance of subpoenas for commission records and for the appearance of commission employees or employees of other agencies
—(1)
Form.
An application for the issuance of subpoena shall be made in the form of a written motion served upon all other parties, if the subpoena would require
(i) The production of documents, papers, books, physical exhibits, or other material in the records of the Commission;
(ii) The appearance of a Commissioner or an official or employee of the Commission;
(iii) The appearance of a Commissioner or an official or employee of any other state or federal agency in his official capacity.
(2)
Content.
The motion shall specifically describe the material to be produced, the information to be disclosed, or the testimony to be elicited from the witness, and shall show
(i) The relevance of the material, information, or testimony to the matters at issue in the proceeding;
(ii) The reasonableness of the scope of the proposed subpoena; and
(iii) That such material, information, or testimony is not available from other sources.
(3)
Rulings.
The motion shall be decided by the Administrative Law Judge and shall provide such terms or conditions for the production of the material, the disclosure of the information or the appearance of the witness as may appear necessary and appropriate for the protection of the public interest.
(4)
Commission review of rulings.
Interlocutory review by the Commission of a ruling made under this section may be sought in accordance with the procedures set forth in § 10.101 without certification by the Administrative Law Judge.
(c)
Motions to quash subpoenas; protective orders
—(1)
Application.
Within 10 days after a subpoena has been served or at any time prior to the return date thereof, a motion to quash or modify the subpoena or for a protective order limiting the use or disclosure of any information, documents or testimony covered by the subpoena may be filed with the Administrative Law Judge who issued it. At the same time, a copy of the motion shall be served on the party who requested the subpoena and all other parties to the proceeding. The motion shall include a brief statement setting forth the basis for the requested relief. If the Administrative Law Judge to whom the motion has been directed has not acted upon the motion by the return date, the subpoena shall be stayed pending his or her final action.
(2)
Disposition.
After due notice to the person upon whose request the subpoena was issued, and after opportunity for response by that person, the Administrative Law Judge may (i) quash or modify the subpoena, or (ii) condition denial of the application to quash or modify the subpoena upon just and reasonable terms, including, in the case of a subpoena duces tecum, a requirement that the person in whose behalf the subpoena was issued shall advance the reasonable cost of producing documentary or other tangible evidence. The Administrative Law Judge may issue a protective order sought under paragraph (c)(1) of this section or under any other section of these rules upon a showing of good cause. In considering whether good cause exists to issue a protective order, the Administrative Law Judge shall weigh the harm resulting from disclosure against the benefits of disclosure. Good cause shall only be established upon a showing that the person seeking the protective order will suffer a clearly defined and serious injury if the order is not issued, provided, however, that any such injury shall be balanced against the public's right of access to judicial records. No protective order shall be granted that will prevent the Division of Enforcement or any respondent from adequate presenting its case.
(d)
Attendance and mileage fees.
Persons summoned to testify either by deposition or at a hearing under requirement of subpoena are entitled to the same fees and mileage as are paid to witnesses in the courts of the United States. Fees and mileage are paid by
the party at whose instance the persons are called.
(e)
Service of subpoenas
—(1)
How effected.
Service of a subpoena upon a party shall be made in accordance with § 10.12(a) of these rules except that only one copy of a subpoena need be served.

(i) Handing them to a registered agent for service, or to any officer, director, or agent in charge of any office of such person;
(ii) Mailing them by registered or certified mail to any such representative at his last known address; or
(iii) Any other method whereby actual notice is given to any such representative and the fees and mileage are timely made available.
(f)
Enforcement of subpoenas.
Upon failure of any person to comply with a subpoena issued at the request of a party, that party may petition the Commission in its discretion to institute an action in an appropriate U.S. District Court for enforcement of that subpoena. When instituting an action to enforce a subpoena requested by the Division of Enforcement, the Commission, in its discretion, may delegate to the Director of the Division or any Commission employee designated by the Director and acting under his or her direction, or to any other employee of the Commission, authority to serve as the Commission's counsel in such subpoena enforcement action.

(f)
Review of ruling; appeal.

The appeal shall be initiated by serving and filing with the Proceedings Clerk a notice of appeal within 15 days after service of the initial decision or other order terminating the proceeding; where service of the initial decision or other order terminating the proceeding is effected by mail or commercial carrier, the time within which the party served may file a notice of appeal shall be increased by 3 days.
(2)
Cross appeals.
If a timely notice of appeal is filed by one party, any other party may file a notice of appeal within 15 days after service of the first notice or within 15 days after service of the initial decision or other order terminating the proceeding, whichever is later.
(3)
Confirmation of filing.
The Proceedings Clerk shall confirm the filing of a notice of appeal by mailing a copy thereof to each other party.
(b)
Briefs: Time for filing.
The appeal shall be perfected through the filing of an appeal brief.
(1)
Appeal brief.
The appeal brief shall be filed within 30 days after filing of the notice of appeal.
(2)
Answering brief.
Within 30 days after service of the appeal brief upon any other party that party may file an answering brief.

Reply brief.
Within 14 days after service of an answering brief, the party that filed the first brief may file a reply brief.
(4) No further briefs shall be permitted, unless so ordered by the Commission on its own motion.
(5)
Cross appeals.
In the event that any party files a notice of cross appeal pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the Commission shall, to the extent practicable, adjust the briefing schedule and any page limitations otherwise applicable under this section so as to accommodate consolidated briefing by the parties.
If the appeal brief is not filed within the time specified the opposing party may move for dismissal of the appeal.
(c)
Briefs.
An original of all briefs submitted under this section shall be filed with the Proceedings Clerk.
(d)
Briefs: Content and form.
(1) The appeal brief should include, in the order indicated:
(i) A statement of the issues presented for review.
(ii) A statement of the case. The statement shall first indicate briefly the nature of the case. There shall follow a statement of the facts relevant to the issues presented for review, with appropriate references to the record.
(iii) An argument. The argument may be preceded by a summary. The argument shall contain the contentions of the party to the appeal with respect to the issues presented, and the reasons therefor, and citations to supporting authorities, statutes and parts of the record.
(iv) A conclusion stating the precise relief sought.
(2) The answering brief generally shall follow the same style as prescribed for the appeal brief but may omit a statement of the issues or of the case if the party does not dispute the issues and statement of the case contained in the appeal brief. Any reply brief shall be confined to matters raised in the answering brief and shall be limited to 15 pages in length.
(3) Any matter not briefed shall be deemed waived, and may not be argued before the Commission.
(e)
Appendix to briefs—
(1)
Designation of contents of appendix.
At the time an appellant serves and files its appeal brief, it shall also serve and file a designation of those specific parts of the record to which it wishes to direct the particular attention of the Commission and that it wishes to have included in the appendix, including, but not necessarily limited to, particular pages of the transcript and portions of exhibits filed in the proceeding. The designation shall be set forth in a document wholly separate and apart from the brief, shall enumerate those specific parts of the record that the appellant wishes to have included in the appendix and shall not incorporate by reference citations to the record contained in its brief or in any other document. If an appellee deems it necessary to direct
the particular attention of the Commission to specific parts of the record not designated by any appellant, it shall serve and file with its answering brief a designation of additional portions of the record for inclusion in the appendix. Any reply brief filed by the appellant may, if necessary, supplement the appellant's previous designation. In designating parts of the record for inclusion in the appendix, the principal parts of the record relied upon should be designated, but the parties shall have regard to the fact that the entire record is always available to the Commission for reference and examinations and shall not engage in unnecessary designation. The fact that a part of the record is not included in an appendix shall not prevent any party or the Commission from relying thereon.
(2)
Preparation of the appendix.
Within 15 days after the last answering brief or reply brief of a party was due to be filed, the Office of Proceedings shall prepare an appendix to the briefs which will contain a list of the relevant docket entries filed in the proceedings before the Administrative Law Judge, the initial decision and order of the Administrative Law Judge, the pleadings filed on behalf of the parties who are participating in the appeal and such other parts of the record designated by the parties to the appeal in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraph (e)(1) of this section. The Proceedings Clerk shall cause one copy of the appendix to be served on each of the parties to the appeal and shall cause ten copies of the appendix to be placed in the docket of the proceeding for the use of the Commission.
(3)
Objections to appendix.
Any party who believes that an error or omission has been made in the preparation of the appendix or that the appendix is misleading, prejudicial or otherwise inadequate may on that basis file a motion with the Commission to amend or supplement the appendix within 30 days of the date of the mailing of the appendix.
The Commission has determined that once an appeal goes to the Commission, it is in a better position than the Chief Administrative Law Judge to review motions objecting to the appendix or seeking to supplement the appendix. Consequently, upon the adoption of this amendment, the Commission and not the Chief Administrative Law Judge will consider any objection to the appendix pursuant to paragraph (e)(3) of this section. As provided by the amendment, a motion raising objections to the appendix must be filed within 30 days after the date of the mailing of the appendix.
(f)
Effect of failure to file an appeal.
Timely appeal to the Commission for review of an initial decision is mandatory as a prerequisite to seeking judicial review of a final decision entered pursuant to these Rules of Practice.

Any petition filed under this section must be confined to new questions raised by the opinion or order and concerning which the petitioner had no opportunity to argue before the Commission. The filing of a petition for reconsideration shall not operate to stay the effective date of the Commission's order.
(b)
Stay pending judicial appeal—
(1)
Application for stay.
Within 15 days after service of a Commission opinion and order imposing upon any party any of the sanctions listed in §§ 10.1(a) through 10.1(e), that party may file an application with the Commission requesting that the effective date of the order be stayed pending judicial review.

verified statements made under penalty of perjury in accordance with the provisions of 28 U.S.C. 1746.
(2)
Standards for issuance of stay.
The Commission may grant an application for a stay pending judicial appeal upon a showing that:
(i) The applicant is likely to succeed on the merits of his appeal;
(ii) Denial of the stay would cause irreparable harm to the applicant; and
(iii) Neither the public interest nor the interest of any other party will be adversely affected if the stay is granted.
(3)
Civil monetary penalties and restitution.
Notwithstanding the requirements set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the Commission shall grant any application to stay the imposition of a civil monetary penalty or an order to pay a specific sum as restitution if the applicant has filed with the Proceedings Clerk a surety bond guaranteeing full payment of the penalty or restitution plus interest in the event that the Commission's opinion and order is sustained or the applicant's appeal is not perfected or is dismissed for any reason and the Commission has determined that neither the public interest nor the interest of any other party will be affected by granting the application.

Acceptance of offer by the Commission.
The Commission will accept an offer of settlement only by issuing its opinion and order based on the offer. Upon issuance of the opinion and order, the proceeding shall be terminated as to the respondent involved and so noted on the docket by the Proceedings Clerk.
(e)
Rejection of offer of settlement; effect of rejection.
When the Commission rejects an offer of settlement, the party making the offer shall be notified of the Commission's action and the offer of settlement shall be deemed withdrawn.

(iii) Where, in his judgment, a ministerial act necessary to the proper conduct of the proceeding has not been performed;
(3) Deny applications for interlocutory Commission review of a ruling of the Administrative Law Judge in cases in which the Administrative Law Judge has not certified the ruling to the Commission in the manner prescribed by § 10.101(a) of the rules; and the ruling does not concern the disqualification of, or a motion to disqualify, an Administrative Law Judge; and the ruling does not concern the suspension of, or failure to suspend, an attorney from participation in a particular proceeding, or the denial of intervention or limited participation;

# Subpart I—Restitution Orders

# Source:
63 FR 55795, Oct. 19, 1998, unless otherwise noted.
§ 10.110
Basis for issuance of restitution orders.
(a)
Appropriateness of restitution as a remedy.
In any proceeding in which an order requiring restitution may be entered, the Administrative Law Judge shall, as part of his or her initial decision, determine whether restitution is appropriate. In deciding whether restitution is appropriate, the Administrative Law Judge, in his or her discretion, may consider the degree of complexity likely to be involved in establishing claims, the likelihood that claimants can obtain compensation through their own efforts, the ability of the respondent to pay claimants damages that his or her violations have caused, the availability of resources to administer restitution and any other matters that justice may require.
(b)
Restitution order.
If the Administrative Law Judge determines that restitution is an appropriate remedy in a proceeding, he or she shall issue an order specifying the following:
(1) All violations that form the basis for restitution;
(2) The particular persons, or class or classes of persons, who suffered damages proximately caused by each such violation;
(3) The method of calculating the amount of damages to be paid as restitution; and
(4) If then determinable, the amount of restitution the respondent shall be required to pay.
§ 10.111
Recommendation of procedure for implementing restitution.
Except as provided by § 10.114, after such time as any order requiring restitution becomes effective (
i.e.,
becomes final and is not stayed), the Division of Enforcement shall petition the Commission for an order directing the Division to recommend to the Commission or, in the Commission's discretion, the Administrative Law Judge a procedure for implementing restitution. Each party that has been ordered to pay restitution shall be afforded an opportunity to review the Division of Enforcement's recommendations and be heard.
§ 10.112
Administration of restitution.
Based on the recommendations submitted pursuant to § 10.111, the Commission or the Administrative Law Judge, as applicable, shall establish in writing a procedure for identifying and notifying individual persons who may be entitled to restitution, receiving and evaluating claims, obtaining funds to be paid as restitution from the party and distributing such funds to qualified claimants. As necessary or appropriate, the Commission or the Administrative Law Judge may appoint any person, including an employee of the Commission, to administer, or assist in administering, such restitution procedure. Unless otherwise ordered by the Commission, all costs incurred in administering an order of restitution shall be paid from the restitution funds obtained from the party who was so sanctioned; provided, however, that if the
administrator is a Commission employee, no fee shall be charged for his or her services or for services performed by any other Commission employee working under his or her direction.
§ 10.113
Right to challenge distribution of funds to customers.
Any order of an Administrative Law Judge directing or authorizing the distribution of funds paid as restitution to individual customers shall be considered a final order for appeal purposes to be subject to Commission review pursuant to § 10.102.
§ 10.114
Acceleration of establishment of restitution procedure.
The procedures provided for by §§ 10.111 through 10.113 may be initiated prior to the issuance of the initial decision of the Administrative Law Judge and may be combined with the hearing in the proceeding, either upon motion by the Division of Enforcement or if the Administrative Law Judge, acting on his own initiative or upon motion by a respondent, concludes that the presentation, consideration and resolution of the issues relating to the restitution procedure will not materially delay the conclusion of the hearing or the issuance of the initial decision.
Pt. 10, App. A

# Appendix A to Part 10—Commission Policy Relating to the Acceptance of Settlements in Administrative and Civil Proceedings
It is the policy of the Commission not to accept any offer of settlement submitted by any respondent or defendant in an administrative or civil proceeding, if the settling respondent or defendant wishes to continue to deny the allegations of the complaint or the findings of fact or conclusions of law to be made in the settlement order entered by the Commission or a court. In accepting a settlement and entering an order finding violations of the Act and/or regulations promulgated under the Act, the Commission makes uncontested findings of fact and conclusions of law. Similarly, in settling a civil proceeding with a defendant the Commission invites the federal court to make conclusions of law and, in some instances, findings of fact. The Commission does not believe it would be appropriate for it to be making or inviting a court to make such uncontested findings of violations if the party against whom the findings and conclusions are to be entered is continuing to deny the alleged misconduct.
The refusal of a settling respondent or defendant to admit the allegations in a Commission-instituted complaint or the findings of fact or conclusions of law in the settlement order entered by the Commission or a court shall be treated as a denial, unless the party states that he or she neither admits nor denies the allegations or the findings and conclusions. In that event, the proposed offer of settlement, consent or consent order must include a provision stating that, by neither admitting nor denying the allegations, findings or conclusions, the settling respondent or defendant agrees that neither he or she nor any of his or her agents or employees under his authority or control shall take any action or make any public statement denying, directly or indirectly, any allegation in the complaint or findings or conclusions in the order, or creating, or tending to create, the impression that the complaint or the order is without a factual basis; provided, however, that nothing in this provision shall affect the settling respondent's or defendant's—
i. Testimonial obligation, or
ii. Right to take legal positions in other proceedings to which the Commission is not a party.

[63 FR 5233, Feb. 2, 1998]
§ 11.2
Authority to conduct investigations.
(a) The Director of the Division of Enforcement and members of the Commission staff acting pursuant to his authority and under his direction may conduct such investigations as he deems appropriate to determine whether any persons have violated, are violating, or are about to violate the provisions of the Commodity Exchange Act, as amended, or the rules, regulations or orders adopted by the Commission pursuant to that Act, or, in accordance with the provisions of section 12(f) of the Act, whether any persons have violated, are violating or are about to violate the laws, rules or regulations relating to futures or options matters administered or enforced by a foreign futures authority, or whether an applicant for registration or designation meets the requisite statutory criteria. For this purpose, the Director may obtain evidence through voluntary statements and submissions, through exercise of inspection powers over boards of trade, reporting traders, and persons required by law to register with the Commission, or when authorized by order of the Commission, through the issuance of subpoenas. The Director shall report to the Commission the results of his investigations and recommend to the Commission such enforcement action as he deems appropriate.

§ 11.3
Confidentiality of investigations.
All information and documents obtained during the course of an investigation, whether or not obtained pursuant to subpoena, and all investigative proceedings shall be treated as non-public by the Commission and its staff except to the extent that (a) the Commission directs or authorizes the public disclosure of the investigation; (b) the information or documents are made a matter of public record during the course of an adjudicatory proceeding; or (c) disclosure is required by the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, and the rules adopted by the Commission thereunder, 17 CFR part 145. Procedures by which persons submitting information to the Commission during the course of an investigation may specifically seek confidential treatment of information for purposes of Freedom of Information Act disclosure are set forth in 17 CFR 145.9. A request for confidential treatment of information for purposes of the Freedom of Information Act shall not, however, prevent disclosure for law enforcement
purposes or when disclosure is otherwise found appropriate in the public interest and permitted by law.
§ 11.4
Subpoenas.
(a)
Issuance of subpoenas.
The Commission or any member of the Commission or of its staff who, by order of the Commission, has been authorized to issue subpoenas in the course of a particular investigation may issue a subpoena directing the person named therein to appear before a designated person at a specified time and place to testify or to produce documentary evidence, or both, relating to any matter under investigation.
(b)
Authorization to issue subpoenas.
An order of the Commission authorizing one or more members of the Commission or of its staff to issue subpoenas in the course of a particular investigation shall include:
(1) A general description of the scope of the investigation;
(2) The authority under which the investigation is being conducted; and
(3) A designation of the members of the Commission or of its staff authorized by the Commission to issue subpoenas.
(c)
Service.
Service of subpoenas issued for investigative purposes shall be effected in the following manner:
(1)
Service upon a natural person.
Delivery of a copy of a subpoena to a natural person may be effected by
(i) Handing it to the person;
(ii) Leaving it at his office with the person in charge thereof or, if there is no one in charge, by leaving it in a conspicuous place therein;
(iii) Leaving it at his dwelling place or usual place of abode with some person of suitable age and discretion then residing therein;
(iv) Mailing it by registered or certified mail to him at his last known address; or
(v) Any other method whereby actual notice is given to him.
(2)

(d)
Witness fees and mileage.
Witnesses appearing pursuant to subpoena shall be paid the same fees and mileage that are paid to witnesses in the courts of the United States.
(e) Pursuant to the authority granted under Sections 2(a)(11) and 8a(5) of the Act, the Commission hereby delegates to the Director of the Division of Enforcement, with the concurrence of the General Counsel or General Counsel's delegee, and until such time as the Commission orders otherwise, the authority to invoke, in case of contumacy by, or refusal to obey a subpoena issued to, any person, the aid of any court of the United States within the jurisdiction in which the investigation or proceeding is conducted, or where such person resides or transacts business, in requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of books, papers, correspondence, memoranda and other records pursuant to subpoenas issued in accordance with section 6(c) of the Act for the purpose of securing effective enforcement of the provisions of this Act, for the purpose of any investigation or proceeding under this Act, and for the purpose of any action taken under section 12(f) of the Act.
(f) Notwithstanding the delegation of authority to the Director set forth in paragraph (e) of this section, in any case in which the Director believes it appropriate the matter may be submitted to the Commission for its consideration. Nothing in this section shall prohibit the Commission from exercising the authority delegated in paragraph (e) of this section.
[41 FR 29799, July 19, 1976, as amended at 67 FR 37322, May 29, 2002]
§ 11.5
Transcripts.
Transcripts of testimony taken in the course of an investigative proceeding shall be recorded solely by an official reporter or other person or by other means authorized by the Commission or by a member of the Commission or its staff conducting the investigation for the Commission.
§ 11.6
Oath; false statements.
(a)
Oath.
At the discretion of the member of the Commission or staff member conducting the investigation, testimony of a witness may be taken under oath.
(b)
Penalties for false statements and other false information.
Any person making false statements under oath during the course of a Commission investigation is subject to the criminal penalties for perjury in 18 U.S.C. 1621. Any person who knowingly and willfully makes false or fraudulent statements, whether under oath or otherwise, or who falsifies, conceals or covers up a material fact, or submits any false writing or document, knowing it to contain false, fictitious or fraudulent information, is subject to the criminal penalties set forth in 18 U.S.C. 1001.
§ 11.7
Rights of witnesses.
(a)
Orders authorizing issuance of subpoenas.
Any person upon whom a subpoena has been served compelling him to furnish documentary evidence or testimony in an investigation shall, upon his request, be permitted to examine a copy of the Commission's order pursuant to which the subpoena has been issued. However, a copy of the order shall not be furnished for his retention except with the express approval of either the Director, a Deputy Director, the Principal Deputy Director, the Chief Counsel, an Associate Director, or a Deputy Regional Counsel of the Division of Enforcement; approval shall not be given unless it has been shown by the person seeking to retain a copy that his retention of a copy would be consistent both with the protection of privacy of persons involved in the investigation and with the unimpeded conduct of the investigation.
(b)
Copies of testimony or data.
A person compelled to submit data or evidence in the course of an investigatory proceeding shall be entitled to retain or, upon payment of appropriate fees as set forth in the Schedule of Fees for records services, 17 CFR part 145b, procure a copy or transcript thereof, except that the witness may for good cause be limited to inspection of the official transcript of his testimony.
(c)
Right to counsel.
A person compelled to appear, or who appears in person by request or permission of the Commission or its staff during an investigation, may be accompanied, represented, and advised by counsel. Subject to the provisions of § 11.8(b) of this part, he may be represented by any attorney-at-law who is admitted to practice before the highest court in any State or territory or the District of Columbia, who has not been suspended or disbarred from appearance and practice before the Commission in accordance with the provisions of part 14 of this title, and who has not been excluded from further participation in the particular investigatory proceeding for good cause established in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
(1) The right to be accompanied, represented and advised by counsel shall mean the right of a person testifying to have an attorney present with him during any aspect of an investigative proceeding and to have this attorney advise his client before, during and after the conclusion of such examination. At the conclusion of the examination, counsel may request the person presiding to permit the witness to clarify any of his answers which may need clarification in order that his answers not be left equivocal or incomplete on the record. For his use in protecting the interests of his client with respect to that examination counsel may make summary notes during the examination.
(2) With due regard for the rights of a witness, the Commission may for good cause exclude a particular attorney from further participation in any investigation in which the Commission has found the attorney to have engaged in dilatory, obstructionist or contumacious conduct. The person conducting an investigation may report to the Commission instances of apparently dilatory, obstructionist or contumacious conduct on the part of an attorney. After due notice to the attorney, the Commission may take such action as the circumstances warrant based upon a written transcript evidencing the conduct of the attorney in that investigation or such other or additional written or oral presentation as the Commission may permit or direct.
(d)
Self-Incrimination; immunity—
(1)
Self-Incrimination.
Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, a witness testifying or otherwise giving information in an investigation may refuse to answer questions on the basis of the right against self-incrimination granted by the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.
(2)
Immunity.
2
If the Commission believes that the testimony or other information sought to be obtained from any individual may be necessary to the public interest and that individual has refused or is likely to refuse to testify or provide other information on the basis of his privilege against self-incrimination, the Commission, with the approval of the Attorney General, may issue an order requiring the individual to give testimony or provide other information which he previously refused to give on the basis of self-incrimination. Whenever a witness refuses, on the basis of his privilege against self-incrimination, to testify or provide other information in an investigation under this part, and the person presiding over the investigation communicates to the witness an order issued by the Commission requiring the witness to give testimony or provide other information, the witness may not refuse to comply with the order on the basis of his privilege against self-incrimination; but no testimony or other information compelled under the order (or any information directly or indirectly derived from such testimony or other information) may be used against the witness in any criminal case, except a prosecution for perjury, giving a false statement, or otherwise failing to comply with the order.
2
This subsection shall be effective on and after such date as section 6001 of Title 18 of the United States Code has been amended to include the Commodity Futures Trading Commission among those agencies which may, with the approval of the Attorney General, grant immunity to witnesses to the extent and in the manner prescribed in 18 U.S.C. 6001
et seq.
[41 FR 29799, July 19, 1976, as amended at 61 FR 1709, Jan. 23, 1996; 89 FR 71808, Sept. 4, 2024]
§ 11.8
Sequestration.
(a)
Sequestration of witnesses.
All witnesses and potential witnesses shall be sequestered and prohibited from being present during the examination of any other witness unless otherwise permitted in the discretion of the person conducting the investigation.
(b)
Sequestration of counsel.
When a reasonable basis exists to believe that an investigation may be obstructed or impeded, directly or indirectly, by an attorney's representation of more than one witness during the course of an investigation, the member of the Commission or of the Commission's staff conducting the investigation may prohibit that attorney from being present during the testimony of any witness other than the witness in whose behalf counsel first appeared in the investigatory proceeding. To the extent practicable, consistent with the integrity of the investigation, the attorney will be advised of the reasons for his having been sequestered.

The Director may, in their discretion, refuse to forward a complaint as to a particular respondent if it appears that the matters alleged therein are not cognizable in reparations, or that grounds exist pursuant to § 12.24(c) or (d) for refusing to forward the complaint. If the Director of the Office of Proceedings should determine not to forward the complaint to all registrants named in the complaint in accordance with this section, no proceeding shall be held thereon and the complainant shall be notified to that effect. If the Director determines to forward the complaint as to less than all of the registrants, the complainant shall be so notified.

complainant to seek such alternative forms of relief as may be available.

§ 12.22
Default proceedings.
(a)
Institution of a default proceeding.
Failure timely to respond to a complaint or a counterclaim, as required by §§ 12.16 and 12.20 of these rules, or, if applicable, to pay a filing fee required by § 12.25(b) or (c), shall be treated as an admission of the allegations of the complaint or counterclaim by the non-responding party, shall constitute a waiver by such party of any decisional procedure afforded by these Rules on the facts set forth in the complaint or counterclaim, and shall result in the institution of a default proceeding.
(b)
Default procedure.
Upon a party's failure to respond timely to a complaint or counterclaim as prescribed in §§ 12.16 and 12.20, or timely to comply with § 12.25(b) or (c), the Director of the Office of Proceedings shall forward the pleadings, and other materials then of record, to an Administrative Judge or Administrative Law Judge who may thereafter enter findings and conclusions concerning the questions of violations and damages and, if warranted, enter a reparation award against the non-responding party. If the facts which are treated as admitted are considered insufficient to support a violation or the amount of reparations sought, the Administrative Judge or Administrative Law Judge may order production of supplementary evidence from the party not in default and may enter a default order and an award based thereon.
(c)
Finality.
A default order issued pursuant to this rule, or pursuant to any other provisions of these part 12 Reparation Rules, shall become the final decision and order of the Commission thirty (30) days after service thereof, unless the order is set aside pursuant to § 12.23(a) of these rules, or unless the Commission takes review of such order on its own motion on or before the thirtieth day.
[49 FR 6621, Feb. 22, 1984, as amended at 57 FR 20638, May 14, 1992; 86 FR 64353, Nov. 18, 2021]
§ 12.23
Setting aside of default.
(a)
Default order not final.
In order to prevent injustice or for good cause shown, and on such conditions as may be appropriate, a non-final default order (including any award therein) may be set aside by the official who issued the order.
(1)
Procedure for setting aside non-final default order.
Any party or person who is the subject of a default order issued pursuant to these rules may, at any time before the order becomes final pursuant to § 12.22(c), file and serve a motion to set aside the default, which shall set forth reasons why the act or omission for which the party was defaulted was not willful, why there is a reasonable likelihood of success for the party's claim or defense if heard on the merits, and why no prejudice will be sustained by other parties if the default is set aside. A motion to set aside a default order filed pursuant to this paragraph (a)(1) shall be decided, in the first instance, by the official who issued the default order.
(2)
Review.
A denial of a motion to set aside a non-final default order by the official who issued the order shall be treated as an initial decision, which may be appealed to the Commission in accordance with the requirements of § 12.401 of these rules. A grant of a motion to set aside a non-final default order may be appealed only in accordance with the requirements of § 12.309 of these rules.
(b)
Default order final.
A default order that has become final pursuant to § 12.22(c) shall not be set aside except upon a motion filed and served by the defaulted party showing that the defaulted party should be relieved from the default order because of fraud perpetrated on a decisionmaking official or the Commission, mistake, excusable neglect, or because the order is void for want of jurisdiction. Such a motion shall also show that, if the default order were set aside, there would be a reasonable likelihood of success for the defaulted party's claim or defense on the merits and that no party would be prejudiced thereby. Motions to set aside a final default order for fraud, mistake, or excusable neglect shall be filed within one year after the order
was issued. All motions to set aside default orders shall be decided, in the first instance, by the official who issued the order. A denial of a motion to set aside a default order that has become final shall be treated as an initial decision, which may be appealed to the Commission in accordance with the requirements of § 12.401. A grant of a motion to set aside a final default order shall be treated as a nonfinal order which may be appealed only in accordance with the requirements of § 12.309.

# Subpart B—Discovery
§ 12.30
Methods of discovery.
(a)
In general.
Parties may obtain discovery by the following methods in accordance with the procedures and limitations set forth in the section indicated:
(1) Production of documents or other items (§ 12.31);
(2) Deposition on written interrogatories (§ 12.32);
(3) Admissions (§ 12.33).
(b)
Scope of discovery.
The scope of discovery is as follows:
(1)
Relevancy.
Except as provided below, discovery may be obtained regarding any matter not privileged, which is relevant to the subject matter in the pending proceeding, including the existence, description, nature, custody, condition and location of any books, documents, or other tangible items, and the identity and location of persons having knowledge of any discoverable matters. Tax returns and personal bank account records shall not be discoverable, except upon motion by the party seeking discovery showing the need for disclosure of information contained therein, and that the same information could not be obtained through other means.
(2)
Protective orders.
Upon motion by a party or the person from whom discovery is sought, filed within twenty days after the objectionable discovery notice or request is served, and for good cause shown, the official presiding over discovery may issue any order to protect a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense, or to prevent the raising of issues untimely or inappropriate to the proceeding, or the inappropriate disclosure of trade secrets or sensitive commercial or financial information. Relief through a protective order may include one or more of the following:
(i) That discovery not be had;
(ii) That discovery may be had only on specified terms and conditions;
(iii) That certain matters not be inquired into, or that the scope of the discovery be limited to certain matters;
(iv) That a trade secret or other confidential commercial information not be disclosed or be disclosed only in a designated way; and
(v) That the parties simultaniously file specified documents or information in sealed envelopes to be opened only as directed by the decisionmaking official.
(3)
Motions for order compelling discovery.
It shall be the duty of a party to obtain an order compelling discovery from another party if the latter party fails to comply with a discovery notice, by filing a motion therefor within twenty days after the time allowed by these rules for compliance with the notice has expired.
(c)
Sanctions for abuse of discovery.
If an Administrative Law Judge or an Administrative Judge finds that any party, without substantial justification, has necessitated the filing of a motion for a protective order or for an order compelling discovery, or any other discovery-related motions, that party shall, if the motion is granted, be ordered to pay, at the termination of the proceeding, the reasonable expenses of the moving party incurred in filing the motion, unless the decisionmaking official finds that circumstances exist which would make an award of such expenses unjust. If a decisionmaking official finds that any party, without substantial justification, has filed a motion for a protective order or for an order compelling discovery, or any discovery-related motions, that party shall, if the motion is
denied, be ordered to pay, at the termination of the proceeding, the reasonable expenses of an adverse party incurred in opposing the motion, unless the decisionmaker finds that circumstances exist which would make an award of such expenses unjust.
(d)
Time limit.
Absent an extension of time, all discovery notices or requests shall be served within (30) days (and all discovery shall be completed within (50) days) after the notification and the order required by § 12.26 (a), (b), or (c) has been served on the parties. Upon motion by a party and for good cause shown, the time allowed for discovery may be enlarged for one additional period not to exceed thirty (30) days.

Any party, within the time prescribed in § 12.30(d) and subject to the limitations in § 12.30(a), may serve on any other party, a notice to produce copies of specifically designated categories of documents, papers, books, accounts, letters, photographs, objects, or tangible things which are in the party's possession, custody or control. A copy of the notice shall be served on all other parties to the proceeding. All documents requested in the notice to produce shall be served on the party seeking the discovery within twenty (20) days after service of the notice to produce.
(b)

Any party may, by filing an appropriate motion showing the need for the materials and an application for a subpoena in accordance with the procedure precribed in § 12.313 and within the time prescribed by § 12.30(d) of these rules, seek leave to serve upon a non-party a notice to produce copies of any specifically designated categories of materials as are described in paragraph (a) of this section. After an appropriate order and subpoena has been issued, such party may serve upon a non-party a notice to produce such materials. All materials requested in the notice to produce, and, if applicable, a detailed explanation of why any of the specified materials cannot be produced, shall be served on the party seeking discovery within such time (not to exceed thirty (30) days) as the subpoena shall specify. Enforcement of the order and subpoena may be sought in accordance with § 12.313.
§ 12.32
Depositions on written interrogatories.
(a)
Notice.
Any party, within the time prescribed by § 12.30(d), may serve on any other party or any officer or agent of a party a notice of the taking of a deposition on written interrogatories.
(b)
Number.
The number of written interrogatories served upon any one party shall not exceed thirty. For the purpose of this rule, each sub-interrogatory or divisible part of an interrogatory shall be regarded as one interrogatory. Leave to serve additional interrogatories shall not be granted absent extraordinary circumstances.
(c)
Reply.
(1) Each interrogatory served shall be answered by the party served or if the party is a corporation, partnership, association, or government agency, by any officer or agent thereof selected by the responding party.
(2) Each interrogatory shall be answered separately and fully in writing, unless objected to, in which event the reasons for objection shall be stated in lieu of an answer. For the purposes of this rule, an evasive or incomplete answer shall be treated as a failure to answer. The answers are to be signed and verified by the person making them. The person upon whom a notice to take a deposition on written interrogatories has been served shall serve a copy of the answers and objections within twenty (20) days after service of the interrogatories.
(d)
Deposition of a non-party.
The deposition on written interrogatories of a non-party may be taken only within the time prescribed by § 12.30(d), and only pursuant to an order entered and subpoena issued in accordance with the provisions of § 12.313 of these rules; provided however, that the deposition on written interrogatories of a Commission member or employee may only be taken upon a showing that the Commission member or employee has personal knowledge of the matters sought to be discovered (
i.e.,
not obtained pursuant to a Commission investigation),
that the information sought to be discovered is material and that the information sought to be discovered is not available from other sources.
(e)
Filing of depositions on written interrogatories in a voluntary or summary decisional proceeding.
In proceedings commenced pursuant to § 12.26 (a) and (b) of these rules, copies of all depositions on written interrogatories shall be filed by the party on whose behalf the discovery was obtained.
§ 12.33
Admissions.
(a)
Request for admissions.
Any party may, within the time permitted by § 12.30(d) of these rules, serve upon any other party a written request for admissions of the truth of any matters set forth in the request that relate to statements or opinions of fact or of the application of law to fact, including the genuineness of any document described in the request. Copies of documents shall be served with the request unless they have been or are otherwise furnished or made available for inspection and copying. A copy of the request shall be filed with the Proceedings Clerk.
(b)
Reply.
Each matter of which an admission is requested shall be separately set forth. The matter is admitted unless within twenty (20) days after service of the request, the party upon whom the request is directed files and serves upon the party requesting a verified written answer or objection to the matter. If objection is made, the reasons therefor shall be stated. The answer shall specifically deny the matter or set forth in detail the reasons why the answering party cannot truthfully admit or deny the matter. A denial shall fairly meet the substance of the requested admission and when good faith requires that an answering party qualify the answer and deny only a part of the matter of which an admission is requested, the answering party shall specify so much of it as is true and qualify or deny the remainder. Answering parties may not give a lack of information or knowledge as a reason for failure to admit or deny unless they state that they have made reasonable inquiry and that the information known or reasonably available to them is insufficient to enable them to admit or deny. Parties who consider that a matter of which an admission has been requested presents a genuine issue for trial may not, on that ground alone, object to the request; they may deny the matter or set forth reasons why they cannot admit or deny it.
(c)
Determining sufficiency of answers or objections.
The party who has requested the admissions may move to determine the sufficiency of the answers or objections. Unless the objecting party sustains the burden of showing that the objection is justified, the official presiding over discovery shall order that an answer be served. If such official determines that an answer does not comply with the requirements of this section, that official may order either that the matter is admitted or that an amended answer be served.
(d)
Effect of admission.
Any matter admitted under this section is conclusively established and may be used as proof against the party who made the admission. However, the discovery or decisionmaking official may permit withdrawal or amendment when the presentation of the merits of the proceeding will be served thereby and the party who obtains the admission fails to satisfy such official that withdrawal or amendments will prejudice them in maintaining an action or defense on the merits.

§ 12.34

Applicability.
The provisions of this section shall apply to all decisional proceedings commenced pursuant to § 12.26. For the purposes of this section, the term “decisionmaking official” shall mean an Administrative Judge or Administrative Law Judge assigned to render a decision in the proceeding.

Production of documents and tangible things
—(1)
Order for production.
A decisionmaking official may, upon the official's own motion, order a party or non-party to produce copies of specifically designated documents, papers, books, accounts, or tangible things (or categories of any of the foregoing) which are in the possession, custody or control of the party, non-party or
agent thereof, against whom the order is directed. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, a party or nonparty ordered to produce documents or any of the items under this paragraph (b)(1) shall file and serve the documents and items listed in the order within twenty (20) days from the date of service of the order, or within such period of time as the decisionmaking official may direct. The decisionmaking official may issue subpoenas to compel the production by parties or non-parties of such documents and tangible things as are described in this section.
(2)
Trade secrets, commercially sensitive or confidential information.
If any party or person against whom an order to produce has been directed acting in good faith has reason to believe that any documents or other tangible thing ordered to be produced contains a trade secret, or commercially sensitive or other confidential information, the party or person may, in lieu of serving any such document, in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section, file and serve a written request for confidential treatment of such documents. Any such request for confidential treatment shall be accompanied by a verified statement identifying with particularity the information on those documents considered to be trade secrets, commercially sensitive or confidential information, with reasons therefor, and indicating which portions, if any, of those documents may be served on other parties without disclosure of such information. Upon considering a request for confidential treatment in accordance with this paragraph (b)(2), the decisionmaking official may, if upon a finding that the information identified in the request warrants confidential treatment and is not probative of any material fact in controversy, make copies of the documents produced, delete such information from the copies, and serve the copies as modified upon the other parties, with or without an appropriate protective order limiting dissemination to the parties and their counsel, if any.
(3)
Inability to produce.
Any party or person who cannot produce documents or other tangible things called for in an order for production, because those documents or things are not in their possession, custody, or control, shall file and serve within the time provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section a verified statement identifying the documents which cannot be produced and setting forth with particularity the reasons for non-production.
(c)
Order for written testimony.
The decisionmaking official may, upon the official's own motion, order a party or non-party witness to submit verified statements or written responses to interrogatories, or both, as to all relevant matters within the party's personal knowledge which are required in response to the order. A party or person ordered to file affidavits and/or verified written responses to interrogatories shall file and serve the documents within such period of time as the decisionmaking official may direct. The official may issue subpoenas to compel the filing by parties or non-parties of such verified statements and written responses as are described in this paragraph (c).

§ 12.35
Consequences of a party's failure to comply with a discovery order.
If a party fails to comply with an order compelling discovery, or an order issued pursuant to § 12.34, the official assigned to render the decision in the case may, upon motion by a party or on the official's own motion, take such action in regard thereto as is just, including but not limited to the following:
(a) Infer that the documents or things not produced would have been adverse to the party;
(b) Rule that for the purposes of the proceeding the information in or contents of the documents or things not produced be taken as established adversely to the party;
(c) Rule that the party may not be heard to object to introduction and use of secondary evidence to show what the withheld documents or other evidence would have shown;
(d) Rule that a pleading, or part of a pleading, or a motion or other submission by the party, to which the order for production related, be stricken;
(e) Dismiss the entire proceeding with prejudice to matters alleged in the complaint, but without prejudice to counterclaims; and
(f) Issue a default order and render a decision against the party, whose rights shall thereafter be determined by §§ 12.22 and 12.23 of these rules.

§ 12.207
Summary disposition.
(a)
Filing of motions, answers.
Any parties who believe that there is no genuine issue of material fact to be determined and that they are entitled to a decision as a matter of law concerning all issues of liability in the proceeding may file a motion for summary disposition at any time until the parties have concluded their submissions of proof. Any adverse party, within ten (10) days after service of the motion, may file and serve opposing papers or may countermove for summary disposition.
(b)
Supporting papers.
A motion for summary disposition shall include a statement of the material facts as to which the moving party contends there is no genuine issue, supported by the pleadings, and by affidavits, other verified statements, admissions, stipulations, and interrogatories. The motion may also be supported by briefs containing points and authorities in support of the contention of the party making the motion. When a motion is made and supported as provided in this section, unless otherwise ordered by the Administrative Judge, adverse parties may not rest upon the mere allegations, but shall serve and file in response a statement setting forth those material facts as to which they contend a genuine issue exists, supported by affidavits and other verified material. They may also submit a brief of points and authorities.
(c)
Summary disposition upon motion of the Administrative Judge.
If the Administrative Judge believes that there may be no genuine issue of material fact to be determined and that one of the parties may be entitled to a decision as a matter of law, the Administrative Judge may direct the parties to submit
papers in support of and in opposition to summary disposition, substantially as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
(d)
Ruling on summary disposition.
The Administrative Judge may grant summary disposition if the undisputed pleaded facts, affidavits, other verified statements, admissions, stipulations, and matters of official notice show that:
(1) There is no genuine issue as to any material fact;
(2) There is no necessity that further facts be developed in the record; and
(3) A party is entitled to a decision in that party's favor as a matter of law.
(e)
Review of ruling; appeal.
An application for interlocutory review of an order denying a motion for summary disposition shall not be allowed. An order granting summary disposition as to all of the issues and all of the parties in the proceeding shall have the same effect as an initial decision (see § 12.210(d)), and may be appealed to the Commission, in accordance with § 12.401 of these rules.
[49 FR 6621, Feb. 22, 1984, as amended at 86 FR 64357, Nov. 18, 2021]
§ 12.208
Submissions of proof.
(a)
Documentary evidence.
Each party may file and serve verified statements of fact and affidavits of non-party witnesses with personal knowledge of the facts which they aver to be true. Proof in support of the complaint and in support of the respondent's answer may be found in those verified documents, in affidavits of non-party witnesses, in other verified statements of fact, and in other documents and tangible exhibits.
(b)
Oral testimony and examination.
The Administrative Judge may order an oral hearing for the presentation of testimony and examination of the parties and their witnesses when appropriate and necessary for the resolution of factual issues, upon motion by either a party or the Administrative Judge. An oral hearing held under this section will be convened by conference telephone call as provided in § 12.209(b), except that an in-person hearing may be held in Washington, DC, under the circumstances set forth in § 12.209(c).
[49 FR 6621, Feb. 22, 1984, as amended at 59 FR 9637, Mar. 1, 1994; 86 FR 64357, Nov. 18, 2021]
§ 12.209
Oral testimony.
(a)
Generally.
When the Administrative Judge determines that an oral hearing is necessary and appropriate, such oral hearing will be held either by telephone or in person in Washington, DC, as set forth in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section. The Administrative Judge, in their discretion with consideration for the convenience of the parties and their witnesses, will determine the time and date of such hearing. During an oral hearing, in their discretion, the Administrative Judge may regulate appropriately the course and sequence of testimony and examination of the parties and their witnesses and limit the issues.
(b)
Telephonic hearings.
When an Administrative Judge has determined to hold an oral hearing by telephone, an order to that effect will be issued at least 15 days prior to the hearing notifying the parties of the date and time of the hearing. The order will direct the parties to confirm, at least 48 hours in advance of the hearing, that the correct telephone numbers for the parties and their witnesses are on file with the Office of Proceedings, and warn that failure to provide correct telephone numbers may be deemed waiver of that party's right to participate in the hearing, to present evidence, or to cross-examine other witnesses. If a party is unavailable by telephone at the appointed time, any other party in attendance may present testimony, and the Administrative Judge also may impose any appropriate sanction listed in § 12.35. All telephonic hearings will be recorded electronically but will be transcribed only upon direction of the Administrative Judge (if necessary) or in the event of Commission review. The parties may secure a copy of the recording of the hearing from the Proceedings Clerk upon written request and payment of the cost of the recording.
(c)
Washington, DC, hearings.
In exceptional circumstances and when an in-person hearing is determined to be
necessary in resolving the issues, the Administrative Judge may order an in-person hearing in Washington, DC, upon written request by a party and the agreement of at least one opposing party. The Administrative Judge will issue notice of the time, date, and location of an in-person hearing to the parties at least 30 days in advance of the hearing. Except as otherwise provided in this section, an in-person hearing will be held and recorded in the manner prescribed in § 12.312(c) through (f). A party not agreeing to appear at the hearing in Washington, DC, may be ordered to participate by telephone. Any party not appearing in person or by telephone will be deemed to have waived the right to participate in the hearing, to present evidence, or to cross-examine other witnesses; further, that party may be subject to such action under § 12.35 as the Administrative Judge may find appropriate. The Administrative Judge may order any party who requests or agrees to appear at a hearing in Washington, DC, and fails to appear without good cause, to pay any reasonable costs unnecessarily incurred by parties appearing at such a hearing.
(d)
Compulsory process.
An application for a subpoena requiring a non-party to participate in a telephonic hearing or to appear at an in-person hearing in Washington, DC, may be made in writing to the Administrative Judge without notice to the other parties. The standards for issuance or denial of an application for a subpoena, the service and travel fee requirements, and the method for enforcing such subpoenas are set forth at § 12.313.
[86 FR 64358, Nov. 18, 2021]
§ 12.210
Initial decision.
(a)
In general.
Proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law briefs shall not be allowed. As soon as practicable after all submissions of proof have been received, the Administrative Judge shall make the initial decision, which will be filed forthwith with the Proceedings Clerk. Upon filing of an initial decision, the Proceedings Clerk shall immediately serve upon the parties a copy of the initial decision and a notification of the effect of a party's failure timely to appeal the initial decision to the Commission, as provided in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, as well as the effect of a failure by a party who has been ordered to pay a reparation award timely to file the documents required by § 12.407(c).
(b)
Content of initial decision.
In the initial decision in a summary decisional proceeding, the Administrative Judge shall:
(1) Include a brief statement of the findings as to the facts, with reference to those portions of the record which support those findings;
(2) Make a determination whether or not the respondent has violated any provision of the Commodity Exchange Act, or rule, regulation or order thereunder;
(3) Make a determination whether the complainant is liable to any respondent who has made a counterclaim in the proceeding;
(4) Determine the amount of damages, if any, that the complainant has sustained as a result of respondent's violations, the amount of punitive damages, if any, for which respondent is liable to complainant, which shall not exceed $30,000, exclusive of interest and costs; and the amount, if any, for which complainant is liable to respondents based on counterclaims, which, in aggregate, shall not exceed $30,000, exclusive of interest and costs; and
(5) Include an order directing either the respondent or the complainant, depending upon whose liability is greater, to pay an amount based on the difference in the amounts determined pursuant to paragraph (b)(4) of this section, on or before a date fixed in the order.
(c)
Costs; prejudgment interest.
The Administrative Judge may, in the initial decision, award costs (including the costs of instituting the proceeding, and if appropriate, reasonable attorneys' fees) and, if warranted as a matter of law under the circumstances of the particular case, prejudgment interest to the party in whose favor a judgment is entered.
(d)
Effect of initial decision.
The initial decision shall become the final decision and order of the Commission thirty (30) days after service thereof, except:
(1) The initial decision shall not become the final decision as to a party
who shall have timely filed and perfected an appeal thereof to the Commission in accordance with § 12.401 of these rules; and
(2) The initial decision shall not become final as to any party to the proceeding if, within thirty (30) days after service of the initial decision, the Commission itself shall have placed the case on its own docket for review or stayed the effective date of the initial decision.
(e)
Effect of failure to file and perfect an appeal to the Commission.
Unless the Commission takes review on its own motion, the timely filing and perfection of an appeal to the Commission of the initial decision is mandatory as a prerequisite to appellate judicial review of a final decision and order entered pursuant to these rules.
[49 FR 6621, Feb. 22, 1984, as amended at 59 FR 9638, Mar. 1, 1994; 86 FR 64358, Nov. 18, 2021]

Dismissal
—(1)
By the Administrative Law Judge.
The Administrative Law Judge, acting on their own motion, may, at any time after they have been assigned the case:
(i) Dismiss the entire proceeding, without prejudice to counterclaims, if they find that none of the matters alleged in the complaint state a claim that is cognizable in reparations; or
(ii) Order dismissal of any claim, counterclaim, or party from the proceeding if they find that such claim or counterclaim (by itself, or as applied to a party) is not cognizable in reparations.

§ 12.309
Interlocutory review by the Commission.
Interlocutory review by the Commission of a ruling on a motion by an Administrative Law Judge may be sought only as prescribed in this rule:
(a)
When interlocutory appeal may be taken.
An interlocutory appeal may be permitted, in the discretion of the Commission, under the following circumstances:
(1) The appeal is from a ruling pursuant to § 12.102, § 12.202, or § 12.305 refusing to grant a motion to disqualify an Administrative Judge or Administrative Law Judge;
(2) The appeal is from a ruling pursuant to § 12.9 suspending an attorney from participation in a reparation proceeding;
(3) Upon a determination by the Administrative Law Judge certified to the Commission either in writing or on the record, that
(i) A ruling sought to be appealed involves a controlling question of law or policy;
(ii) An immediate appeal may materially advance the ultimate resolution of the issues in the proceeding; and
(iii) Subsequent reversal of the ruling would cause unnecessary delay or expense to the parties; or
(4) The appeal is from a ruling which satisfies the conditions of paragraphs (a)(3) (i)-(iii) of this section, despite
the absence of certification, and extraordinary circumstances are shown to exist.
(b)
Procedure to obtain interlocutory review.
An application for interlocutory review may be served and filed within ten (10) days after service of a ruling described in paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2), and (a)(4) of this section or of notice that a determination has been made pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of this section.

(1) A statement of the facts necessary to an understanding of the controlling questions determined by the Administrative Law Judge, and to an understanding of the extraordinary circumstances warranting interlocutory review by the Commission;

Within seven (7) days after service of the application for interlocutory review, any party may file a response in opposition to the application.
(c)
Standard for review.
In the absence of extraordinary circumstances, the Commission will not review a ruling of an Administrative Law Judge prior to the Commission's consideration of the proceeding pursuant to subpart F of these rules. A Commission denial of an application for interlocutory review shall be without prejudice to the applying party's right to raise any argument made in the application as an issue in an appeal taken pursuant to subpart F of these rules.
(d)
Proceedings not stayed.
The filing of an application for interlocutory review and a grant of review shall not stay proceedings before an Administrative Law Judge (or an Administrative Judge, if applicable) unless that official or the Commission shall so order. The Commission will not consider a motion for a stay unless the motion shall have first been made to the Administrative Law Judge (or, if applicable, the Administrative Judge) and denied.
(e)
Interlocutory review by the Commission on its own motion.
Nothing in this section should be construed as restricting the Commission from acting on its own motion to review on an interlocutory basis any ruling of an Administrative Law Judge, Proceedings Officer or an Administrative Judge in any proceeding commenced pursuant to § 12.26.
[49 FR 6621, Feb. 22, 1984, as amended at 86 FR 64359, Nov. 18, 2021]
§ 12.310
Summary disposition.
(a)
Filing of motions, answers.
Any parties who believe that there is no genuine issue of material fact to be determined and that they are entitled to a decision as a matter of law concerning all issues of liability in the proceeding may file a motion for summary disposition at any time before a determination is made by the Administrative Law Judge to order an oral hearing in the proceeding. Any adverse party, within ten (10) days after service of the motion, may file and serve opposing papers or may countermove for summary disposition.
(b)
Supporting papers.
A motion for summary disposition shall include a statement of all material facts as to which the moving party contends that there is no genuine issue, supported by the pleadings, and by affidavits, other verified statements, admissions, stipulations, and interrogatories. The motion may also be supported by briefs containing points and authorities in support of the contention of the party making the motion. When a motion is made and supported as provided in this section, unless otherwise ordered by the Administrative Law Judge, an adverse party may not rest upon the mere allegations, but shall serve and file in response a statement setting forth those material facts as to which the adverse party contends a genuine issue exists, supported by affidavits and other verified material. The adverse party may also submit a brief of points and authorities.
(c)
Oral argument.
Oral argument may be heard at the discretion of the Administrative Law Judge and shall be heard in Washington, DC, or by telephonic conference call. Such argument
shall be recorded, and written transcripts shall be made in the event that a grant or denial of summary disposition is reviewed by the Commission.
(d)
Summary disposition upon motion of the Administrative Law Judge.
If the Administrative Law Judge believes that there may be no genuine issue of material fact to be determined and that one of the parties may be entitled to a decision as a matter of law, the Administrative Law Judge may direct the parties to submit papers in support of and in opposition to summary disposition, and may hear oral argument, substantially as provided in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section.
(e)
Ruling on summary disposition.
The Administrative Law Judge shall grant summary disposition if the undisputed pleaded facts, affidavits, other verified statements, admissions, stipulations, and matters of official notice, show that (1) there is no genuine issue as to any material fact; (2) there is no necessity that further facts be developed in the record; and (3) a party is entitled to a decision as a matter of law.
(f)
Review of ruling; appeal.
An application for interlocutory review of an order denying a motion for summary disposition shall not be allowed. Interlocutory review of an order granting summary disposition which disposes of less than all of the issues in the proceeding may be sought only in accordance with § 12.309 of these rules. An order granting summary disposition which is dispositive of all issues, and as to all parties, in the proceeding may be appealed to the Commission in accordance with the requirements set forth in § 12.401 of these rules.
[49 FR 6621, Feb. 22, 1984, as amended at 86 FR 64359, Nov. 18, 2021]
§ 12.311
Disposing of proceeding or issues without oral hearing.
If the Administrative Law Judge determines that the documentary proof and other tangible forms of proof submitted by the parties are sufficient to permit resolution of some or all of the factual issues in the proceeding without the need for oral testimony, the Administrative Law Judge may order that all proof relating to such issues be submitted in documentary and tangible form, and dispose of such issues without an oral hearing. In such an event, proof in support of the complaint, answer, and reply, may be found in those verified documents, in depositions on written interrogatories, in admissible documents obtained through discovery, in other verified statements of fact, documents, and tangible evidence.
[86 FR 64359, Nov. 18, 2021]
§ 12.312
Oral hearing.
(a)
Notification; prehearing order.
If and when the proceeding has reached the stage of an oral hearing, the Administrative Law Judge, giving due regard for the convenience of the parties, shall set a time for hearing, as well as a location prescribed by paragraph (b) of this section, and shall file with the Proceedings Clerk, for immediate service upon the parties:
(1) An order requiring the parties to file and serve, within fifteen days after service of the order, a prehearing memorandum setting forth briefly:
(i) A statement of all issues to be tried at the hearing;
(ii) An identification of each witness expected to be called by that party;
(iii) A summary of the testimony each witness is expected to provide; and
(2) A notice stating the time and location of the hearing.
Prior to the hearing, the Administrative Law Judge may issue an order based on the contents of the parties' memoranda filed pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section, which, unless modified to prevent injustice, shall control the scope of matters to be tried at the oral hearing. If any change in the time or place of the hearing becomes necessary, it shall be made by the Administrative Law Judge, who, in such event, shall file with the Proceedings Clerk a notice of the change. Such notice shall be served upon the parties, unless it is made during the course of an oral hearing and made a part of the transcript. Hearings shall proceed expeditiously and, absent extraordinary circumstances, shall be held in one location and shall continue, without suspension, until concluded.
(b)
Location of hearing.
Unless the Director of the Office of Proceedings for reasons of administrative economy or
practical necessity determines otherwise, and except as provided in this paragraph (b), the location of an oral hearing shall be in one of the following cities: Albuquerque, N.M.; Atlanta, Ga.; Boston, Mass.; Chicago, Ill.; Cincinnati, Ohio; Columbia, S.C.; Denver, Colo.; Houston, Tex.; Kansas City, Mo.; Los Angeles, Cal.; Minneapolis, Minn.; New Orleans, La.; New York, N.Y.; Oklahoma City, Okla.; Phoenix, Ariz.; San Diego, Cal.; San Francisco, Cal.; Seattle, Wash.; St. Petersburg, Fla.; and Washington, DC. The Administrative Law Judge may, in any case where a party avers, in an affidavit, that none of the foregoing cities is located within 300 miles of the party's principal residence, waive this paragraph (b) and, upon giving due regard for the convenience of all of the parties, order that the hearing be held in a more convenient locale.
(1)
Who may appear.
The parties may appear in person, by counsel, or by other representatives of their choosing, subject to the provisions of § 12.9 of these rules concerning practice before the Commission.
(2)
Effect of failure to appear.
If any party to the proceeding fails to appear at the hearing, or at any part thereof, the non-appearing party shall to that extent be deemed to have waived the opportunity for an oral hearing in the proceeding. The Administrative Law Judge, for just cause, may take such action as is appropriate pursuant to § 12.35 against a party who fails to appear at the hearing. In the event that a party appears at the hearing and no party appears for the opposing side, the party who is present may present evidence, in whole or in part, in the form of affidavits or by oral testimony, before the Administrative Law Judge.
(c)
Public hearings.
All oral hearings shall be public except that upon application of a party or affected witness the Administrative Law Judge may direct that specific documents or testimony be received and retained non-publicly in order to prevent unwarranted disclosure of trade secrets or sensitive commercial or financial information or an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.
(d)
Conduct of the hearing.
Subject to paragraph (e) of this section, and except as otherwise provided, at an oral hearing every party shall be entitled to:
(1)
Conduct direct and cross-examination of parties and witnesses.
All witnesses at a hearing for the purpose of taking evidence shall testify under oath or affirmation, which shall be administered by the Administrative Law Judge. Unless otherwise ordered by the Administrative Law Judge, parties shall be entitled to present oral direct testimony and other documentary proof, and to conduct direct examination and cross examine adverse parties and witnesses. To expedite the hearing, the Administrative Law Judge may, in their discretion, order that the direct testimony of the parties and their witnesses be presented in documentary form, by affidavit, interrogatory, and other documents. In any event, the Administrative Law Judge, in their discretion, may permit cross examination, without regard to the scope of direct testimony, as to any matter which is relevant to the issues in the proceeding;
(2)
Introduce exhibits.
The original of each exhibit introduced in evidence or marked for identification shall be filed unless the Administrative Law Judge permits the substitution of copies for the original documents. A copy of each exhibit introduced by a party or marked for identification shall be supplied by the introducing party to the Administrative Law Judge and to each other party to the proceeding. Exhibits shall be maintained by the reporter who shall serve as custodian of the exhibits until they are transmitted to the Proceedings Clerk pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section;
(3)
Make objections.
A party shall timely and briefly state the grounds relied upon for any objection made to the introduction of evidence. Formal exception to an adverse ruling shall not be required; and
(4)
Make offers of proof.
When an objection to a question propounded to a witness is sustained, examiners may make a specific offer of what they expect to prove by the answer of the witness. Rejected exhibits, adequately
marked for identification, shall be retained in the record so as to be available for consideration by any reviewing authority.
(e)
Admissibility of evidence.
Relevant, material and reliable evidence shall be admitted. Irrelevant, immaterial, unreliable and unduly repetitious evidence shall be excluded.
(f)
Record of an oral hearing.
Oral hearings for the purpose of taking evidence shall be recorded and shall be transcribed in written form under the supervision of the Administrative Law Judge by a reporter employed by the Commission for that purpose. The original transcript shall be a part of the record and shall be the sole official transcript. Copies of transcripts, except those portions granted non-public treatment, shall be available from the reporter at rates not to exceed the maximum rates fixed by the contract between the Commission and the reporter. As soon as practicable after the close of the hearing, the reporter shall transmit to the Proceedings Clerk the transcript of the testimony and the exhibits introduced in evidence at the hearing, except such portions of the transcript and exhibits as shall have already been delivered to the Administrative Law Judge.
(g)
Proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law; briefs.
An Administrative Law Judge, upon their own motion or upon motion of a party, may permit the filing of post-hearing proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. Absent an order permitting such findings and conclusions, none shall be allowed. Unless otherwise ordered by the Administrative Law Judge and for good cause shown, the proposed findings and conclusions (including briefs in support thereof), shall not exceed twenty-five (25) pages and shall be filed not later than forty-five (45) days after the close of the oral hearing.

When the subpoena is issued at the instance of any officer or agency of the United States, fees and mileage need not be tendered at the time of service.
(2)
Service upon a natural person.
Delivery of a copy of a subpoena and tender of fees and mileage to a natural person may be effected by:
(i) Handing them to the person;
(ii) Leaving them at the person's office with the person in charge thereof or, if there is no one in charge, by leaving the subpoena in a conspicuous place therein;
(iii) Leaving them at the person's dwelling place or usual place of abode with some person of suitable age and discretion then residing therein;
(iv) Mailing them by registered or certified mail to them at their last known address; or
(v) Any other method whereby actual notice is given to the person and the fees and mileage are timely made available.

Such motion shall include a brief statement of the reasons therefor. After due notice to the person upon whose request the subpoena was issued, and an opportunity for that person to respond, the Administrative Law Judge may (1) quash or modify the subpoena, or (2) condition denial of the application to quash or modify the subpoena upon just and reasonable terms, including, on the case of a subpoena
duces tecum,
a requirement that the person on whose behalf the subpoena was issued shall advance the reasonable cost of producing documentary or other tangible evidence.
(e)
Attendance and mileage fees.
Persons summoned to testify at a hearing under requirement of subpoenas are entitled to the same fees and mileage as are paid to witnesses in the courts of the United States. Fees and mileage shall be paid by the party at whose instance the persons are subpoenaed or called.

Enforcement of subpoenas.
Upon failure of any person to comply with a subpoena issued at the request of a party, that party may petition the Commission, in its discretion, to institute an action in an appropriate U.S. District Court for enforcement of the subpoena.

§ 12.314
Initial decision.
(a)
In general.
The Administrative Law Judge as soon as practicable after the parties have completed their submissions of proof, or after the conclusion of an oral hearing if one is held, shall render the initial decision, which shall forthwith be filed with the Proceedings Clerk, and a copy of which shall be served immediately by the Proceedings Clerk upon each of the parties. The Proceedings Clerk shall also serve a notice, to accompany the initial decision, of the effect of a party's failure timely to appeal to the Commission the initial decision, as provided in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, and the effect of a failure of a party who has been ordered to pay a reparation award timely to file the documents required by § 12.407(c).
(b)
Content of initial decision.
In the initial decision the Administrative Law Judge shall:
(1) Include a brief statement of findings as to the facts, with references to those portions of the record which support those findings;
(2) Make a determination whether or not the respondent has violated any provision of the Commodity Exchange Act, or rule, regulation or order thereunder;
(3) Make a determination whether the complainant is liable to any respondent who has made a counterclaim in the proceeding;
(4) Determine the amount of damages, if any, that the complainant has sustained as a result of respondent's violations, the amount of punitive damages if warranted, and the amount, if any, for which complainant is liable to a respondent based on a counterclaim; and
(5) Include an order directing either the respondent or the complainant, depending upon whose liability is greater, to pay an amount based on the difference in the amounts determined pursuant to paragraph (b)(4) of this section, on or before a date fixed in the order.
(c)
Costs, prejudgment interest.
Except as provided in §§ 12.30(c) and 12.315 of these rules, the Administrative Law Judge may, in the initial decision, award costs (including the cost of instituting the proceeding and, if appropriate, reasonable attorney's fees) and, if warranted as a matter of law under the cirumstances of the particular case, prejudgment interest, to the party in whose favor a judgment is entered.
(d)
Effect of initial decision.
The initial decision and order shall become the final decision and order of the Commission, without further order by the Commission, thirty (30) days after service thereof, except that:
(1) The initial decision shall not become the final decision as to a party who shall have timely filed and perfected an appeal thereof to the Commission, in accordance with § 12.401 of these rules; and
(2) The initial decision shall not become final as to any party to the proceeding if, within thirty (30) days after service of the initial decision, the Commission itself shall have placed the case on its own docket for review or stayed the effective date of the initial decision.
(e)
Effect of failure to file and perfect an appeal to the Commission.
Unless the Commission takes review of an initial decision on its own motion, the timely filing and perfection of an appeal to the Commission of the initial decision is mandatory as a prerequisite to appellate judicial review of a final decision and order entered pursuant to these rules.
[49 FR 6621, Feb. 22, 1984; 49 FR 15070, Apr. 17, 1984, as amended at 59 FR 9638, Mar. 1, 1994; 86 FR 64361, Nov. 18, 2021]
§ 12.315
Consequences of overstating damages claims not in excess of $30,000.
If a party, who has claimed damages in excess of $30,000, is adjudged to be entitled to recover less than the sum or value of $30,000, computed without regard to a damage award to which an opposing party may be adjudged to be entitled, and exclusive of interest and costs, the Administrative Law Judge may assess such party the cost of the transcript of an oral hearing, if such a hearing is held, and, depending upon whether such party paid any part of the filing fee for the proceeding, deny the party such costs or impose such costs on that party.

# Subpart F—Commission Review of Decisions
§ 12.400
Scope and applicability of rules.
The rules set forth in this subpart are applicable to proceedings forwarded pursuant to § 12.26 (b) and (c) of these rules. Except as provided in §§ 12.106(e) and 12.403(b) of these rules, the rules set forth in this subpart are not applicable to proceedings forwarded pursuant to § 12.26(a) of the Reparation Rules.
[49 FR 6621, Feb. 22, 1984; 49 FR 15070, Apr. 17, 1984]
§ 12.401
Appeal to the Commission.
(a)
How effected.
Any aggrieved party to a proceeding forwarded pursuant to § 12.26 (b) or (c) of these rules may appeal to the Commission an initial decision or other disposition of the entire proceeding by complying with the requirements of this section. An appealing party shall serve upon all parties and file with the Proceedings Clerk a notice of appeal within fifteen (15) days after service of the initial decision or other order disposing of the entire proceeding. The notice need consist only of a brief statement indicating the filing party's intent to appeal the initial decision, and shall include the date upon which the initial decision was rendered, the names of all parties, and the docket number of the proceeding. A non-refundable appellate filing fee in the amount of $50 shall be paid at the time of filing a notice of appeal. The failure of a party timely to file and serve a notice of appeal, and to pay the appellate filing fee, in accordance with this paragraph, or to perfect the appeal in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, shall constitute a voluntary waiver of any objection to the initial decision, or other order disposing of the proceeding, and of all further administrative or judicial review under these rules and the Commodity Exchange Act.
(b)
Perfecting the appeal; appeal brief.
An appeal shall be perfected by the appealing party by timely filing with the Proceedings Clerk an appeal brief which meets the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section. An original and one copy of the appeal brief shall be filed within thirty (30) days after filing of the notice of appeal. By motion of the appealing party, the Commission may, for good cause shown, extend the time for filing the appeal brief. If the appeal brief is not filed within the time prescribed in this subparagraph, the Commission may, upon its own motion or upon motion by a party, dismiss the appeal, in which event the initial decision shall become the final decision and order of the Commission, effective upon service of the order of dismissal.
(c)
Answering brief.
Any party upon whom the appealing party serves a brief may, within thirty (30) days after service of the appeal brief, file an original and one copy of an answering brief, and serve one copy thereof, unless the time limit is extended by the Commission upon motion of the party and for good cause shown.
(d)
Briefs.
Parties filing an appeal brief or answering brief pursuant to this section shall meet the requirements of § 12.11 of these rules as to form. The content of briefs shall satisfy the requirements of § 10.102(d) of the Commission's regulations, 17 CFR 10.102(d), except that any party, with leave of the Commission, may file an informal document in lieu of a brief. No brief shall exceed thirty-five (35) pages in length without leave of the Commission.
(e)
Oral argument.
Any party may request, in writing and within the time provided for filing the initial briefs, the opportunity to present oral argument before the Commission, which the Commission may, in its discretion, grant or deny. In the event the Commission affords the parties the opportunity to present oral argument before the Commission, the oral argument shall proceed in accordance with the provisions of § 10.103 of the Commission's regulations, 17 CFR 10.103.
(f)
Scope of review.
On review, the Commission may, in its discretion, consider
sua sponte
any issues arising from the record and may base its determination thereon, or limit the issues to those presented in the statement of issues in the briefs, treating those issues not raised as waived.
[49 FR 6621, Feb. 22, 1984; 49 FR 15070, Apr. 7, 1984]
§ 12.402
Appeal of disposition of less than all claims or parties in a proceeding.
(a)
In general.
Where two or more different claims for relief are presented, or where multiple parties are involved, in a proceeding forwarded pursuant to § 12.26(b) or (c), the Administrative Judge or Administrative Law Judge, may upon the Judge's own motion or by motion of a party, direct that an initial decision or other order disposing of one or more, but fewer than all of the claims or parties, shall be final and immediately appealable to the Commission. Such a direction may be made
only upon an express determination that there is no just reason for delay. When such a direction is made, a party may appeal the initial decision or order in accordance with the procedure prescribed by § 12.401.
(b)
When decision is not appealable.
In the absence of such a direction by the Administrative Judge or an Administrative Law Judge, an initial decision or order disposing of fewer than all of the claims or all of the parties shall be subject to revision by the decisionmaker at any time before a disposition is made of all remaining claims or parties, and no appeal may be taken to the Commission pursuant to this section.
[86 FR 64361, Nov. 18, 2021]
§ 12.403
Commission review on its own motion.
(a)
In general.
The Commission may on its own motion, within 30 days after it has been served on all parties, determine to review an initial decision, or other order disposing of all issues in the proceeding as to all claims and all parties, in a proceeding forwarded pursuant to § 12.26 (b) and (c) of these rules. In such event, the Commission may determine the scope of the issues on review, and make provisions for the filing of briefs or, if deemed appropriate, such other means for the parties to present their views. The parties shall be duly notified thereof by the Proceedings Clerk.
(b)
Commission review of a final decision in a voluntary decisional proceeding.
If such action is necessary to prevent manifest injustice, the Commission may, upon its own motion, review a final decision issued pursuant to § 12.106 of these rules by appropriate order filed with the Proceedings Clerk within 30 days after service upon the parties of the final decision. In such event, the Commission may determine the scope of the issue on review, make provisions for the filing of briefs (or, if deemed appropriate, such other means for the parties to present their views). The parties shall be duly notified thereof by the Proceedings Clerk.
§ 12.404
The record of proceedings.
The record of proceedings on appeal before the Commission shall include: The pleadings; motions and requests filed, and rulings thereon; the transcript of the testimony taken at an oral hearing, together with the exhibits filed therein; the transcript of testimony taken during an oral examination by telephone; any statements or stipulations filed in any proceeding; any documents or papers filed in connection with prehearing conferences; such proposed findings of fact, conclusions, and orders and briefs as may have been permitted to be filed in connection with an oral hearing; such statements of objections, and briefs in support thereof, as may have been filed in the proceedings; and the initial (or final) decision, or other order disposing of issues in the proceeding.
[49 FR 6621, Feb. 22, 1984, as amended at 59 FR 9638, Mar. 1, 1994]
§ 12.405
Leave to adduce additional evidence.
Any time prior to issuance of its final decision pursuant to § 12.406, the Commission may, after notice to the parties and an opportunity for them to present their views, reopen the hearing to receive further evidence. The application shall show to the satisfaction of the Commission that the additional evidence is material, and that there were reasonable grounds for failure to adduce such evidence at the hearing. The Commission may receive the additional evidence or may remand the proceeding to the Administrative Judge or Administrative Law Judge to receive the additional evidence.
[86 FR 64361, Nov. 18, 2021]
§ 12.406
Final decision of the Commission.
(a)
Opinion and order.
Unless the Commission, in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, orders summary affirmance of the initial decision, the Commission's opinion and order in a proceeding appealed pursuant to § 12.401 of these rules shall constitute the Commission's final decision, effective upon service. On review, the Commission may affirm, reverse, modify, set aside or remand for further proceedings, in whole or in part, the initial decision and make any findings or conclusions which in its judgment are
warranted based on the record in the proceeding.
(b)
Order on summary affirmance.
If the Commission, in its opinion, finds that the result reached in the initial decision is substantially correct and that none of the arguments on appeal made by the appealing party raise any important question of law or policy, the Commission may, by appropriate order, summarily affirm the initial decision and order without opinion, which shall constitute the Commission's final decision, effective upon service. Unless the Commission expressly indicates otherwise in its order, an order of summary affirmance does not reflect a Commission determination to adopt the initial decision, including any rationale contained therein, as its opinion and order, and neither initial decision nor the Commission's order of summary affirmance shall serve as a Commission precedent in other proceedings.
(c)
Filing and service of final decision.
The Commission shall, upon issuance of a final decision pursuant to this § 12.406, file the final decision with the Proceeding's Clerk, who shall forthwith serve upon each of the parties a copy of the final decision as well as notice of the effect of a party's failure to pay a reparation award as provided in § 12.407 of these rules, and of an aggrieved party's right to obtain judicial review of the final decision pursuant to section 14(e) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 18(e).
(d)
Date of the reparation order.
For purposes of computing the 30-day period for filing the appeal bond required by section 14(e) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 18(e), “the date of the reparation order” shall be the date that the Commission's opinion and order (or order of summary affirmance, as the case may be) is filed with the Proceedings Clerk. This date shall be reflected by the date stamp on the first page of the Commission's order.
[49 FR 6621, Feb. 22, 1984, as amended at 53 FR 17692, May 18, 1988]
§ 12.407
Satisfaction of reparation award; enforcement; sanctions.
(a)
Satisfaction of reparation award
—(1)
Where initial decision has become the final decision.
Any reparation award ordered in an initial decision, or similar dispositive order (but not a final decision issued pursuant to § 12.106 of these rules), shall be satisfied in full within forty-five (45) days after service of the initial decision, unless a timely appeal thereof has been perfected pursuant to § 12.401, or unless the Commission, pursuant to § 12.403(a), has stayed the effective date of the initial decision.
(2)
Final decision pursuant to § 12.406.
Any reparation award ordered in a final decision of the Commission issued pursuant to § 12.406 of these rules shall be satisfied in full within fifteen (15) days after service of the final decision, or such other longer period of time as may be specified in the final decision, unless a petition for review is filed in accordance with section 14(e) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 18(e).
(b)
Enforcement of reparation award.
If any person against whom a reparation award has been made does not timely comply with paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, the party in whose favor the award is made is entitled to seek enforcement of award in accordance with the procedure prescribed in section 14(d) of the Commodity Exchange Act, 7 U.S.C. 18(d).
(c)
Automatic suspension.
A person required to pay a reparation award shall be prohibited from trading on all contract markets and if such person is registered, the registration shall be suspended automatically, without further notice, unless such person shall, within fifteen (15) days after the time limit for satisfaction of an award (as prescribed in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section) expires, file with the Proceedings Clerk and serve on the other parties:
(1) A copy of a certified check or the equivalent showing Satisfaction of the award; or
(2) A sworn release executed by each recipient of a reparation award, which has not been satisfied by payment with a certified check or the equivalent; or
(3) A verified statement that a judicial appeal has been filed and perfected in accordance with section 14(e) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 18(e). (This paragraph is applicable only in proceedings commenced pursuant to § 12.26 (b) or (c), and only if the person has timely filed and perfected an appeal to the Commission as prescribed in § 12.401.)
(d)
Reinstatement.
The sanctions imposed in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section shall remain in effect until the person required to pay the reparation award demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Commission that the amount required has been paid in full including prejudgment interest if awarded and post-judgment interest at the prevailing rate computed in accordance with 28 U.S.C. 1961 from the date directed in the final order to the date of payment, compounded annually. In the event an award of post-judgment interest is inadvertently omitted, such interest nevertheless shall run as calculated in accordance with 28 U.S.C. 1961 and the rules in this part.
(e)
Automatic suspension after appeal.
If on appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals the appellee prevails, or if the appeal is dismissed, the automatic prohibition against trading and suspension of registration shall become effective at the expiration of thirty (30) days from the date of judgment on the appeal, but if the judgment is stayed by a court of competent jurisdiction, the suspension shall become effective ten (10) days after the expiration of such stay, unless prior thereto the judgment of the court or the final order of the Commission has been satisfied.

(ii) Where, in their judgment, clarification or supplementation of an initial decision or other order disposing of the entire proceeding prior to Commission review is appropriate; and
(iii) Where, in their judgment, a ministerial act necessary to the proper conduct of the proceeding has not been performed;
(3) Deny applications for interlocutory review by the Commission of a ruling of an Administrative Judge or Administrative Law Judge in cases in which the Administrative Judge or Administrative Law Judge has not certified the ruling to the Commission in the manner prescribed by § 12.309, and the ruling does not concern the disqualification of, or a motion to disqualify, an Administrative Judge or Administrative Law Judge, or the suspension of, or failure to suspend, an attorney from participating in reparation proceedings;
(4) Dismiss any appeal from an initial decision or other disposition of the entire proceeding by an Administrative Law Judge (or Administrative Judge), in a proceeding where such appeal is not filed or perfected in accordance with § 12.401, and deny any application for interlocutory review if it is not filed in accordance with § 12.309;
(5) Strike any filing that does not meet the requirements of, or is not perfected in accordance with, these part 12 rules; and

§ 14.1
Scope.
The rules of this part describe the circumstances under which persons may be denied, either temporarily or permanently, the privilege of appearing or practicing before the Commission as an attorney or accountant. An attorney may also be excluded from further participation in a particular adjudicatory proceeding in accordance with the provisions of § 10.11(b) of this chapter or from further participation in a particular investigatory proceeding in accordance with the provisions of § 11.7(c)(2) of this chapter.
§ 14.2
Definitions of appearance and practice.
(a)
Appearance.
For the purpose of this part, “appearance” refers to the representation of a person by another who appears in his behalf at any adjudicatory, investigatory or rulemaking proceeding conducted before the Commission, including but not limited to those proceedings encompassed in parts 10 through 13 of the Commission's rules.
(b)
Practice.
For the purpose of this part, practicing before the Commission shall include but shall not be limited to:
(1) The preparation of any statement, opinion or other paper by any attorney or accountant filed with or submitted to the Commission on behalf of another person in or in connection with any application, notification, report or other document; and
(2) Transacting any other formal business with the Commission, on behalf of another person, in the capacity of an attorney or accountant.
§ 14.3
Hearings.
Hearings required or permitted to be held under provisions of this part shall be held before an Administrative Law Judge, utilizing the procedures established in the rules of practice (part 10) for adjudicatory proceedings. Any proceeding brought under provisions of this part shall, unless otherwise determined by the Commission, be prosecuted by the General Counsel of the Commission or by such attorneys in his office as he may assign.
§ 14.4
Violation of Commodity Exchange Act.
The Commission may deny, temporarily or permanently, the privilege of appearing or practicing before it in any way to any person who is found by the Commission, after notice of and opportunity for hearing in the matter, to have violated, caused, or aided and abetted any violation of the Commodity Exchange Act, as amended, 7 U.S.C. 1
et seq.,
or the rules and regulations adopted thereunder.
§ 14.5
Criminal conviction.
Any person who after licensing or certification to practice his profession by any competent authority has been convicted of any felony or of a misdemeanor involving fraud or involving moral turpitude in matters related to the regulatory responsibilities of the Commission, and whose conviction has not been reversed by an appellate court, may not appear or practice before the Commission. A conviction within the meaning of this section shall be deemed to have occurred when the convicting court enters its judgment or order, regardless of whether an appeal is pending or could be taken, and includes a judgment on a plea of nolo contendere.
§ 14.6
Disbarment or suspension by licensing authority.
Any attorney who has been suspended or disbarred by a Court of the United States or any state or territory or the District of Columbia and any person whose license to practice as an accountant has been revoked or suspended in any state or territory or the District of Columbia may not appear or practice before the Commission during the period when such suspension or revocation is in effect. A suspension or revocation shall be deemed to have occurred when the disbarring, suspending or revoking agency or tribunal enters its order, regardless of whether appeal is pending or could be taken, and includes a judgment or order on a plea of nolo contendere or the procedural equivalent of such a plea. For purposes of this section it shall be irrelevant that any attorney or accountant who has been suspended, disbarred, or otherwise disqualified from practice before a court or in a jurisdiction continues in professional good standing before other courts or in other jurisdictions.
§ 14.7
Finding of violation of Commodity Exchange Act or Federal securities laws in another proceeding.
(a)
Temporary suspension.
The Commission, with due regard to the public interest, and without preliminary hearing, may by order temporarily suspend from appearing or practicing before it any person who, on or after the effective date of this rule has been by name:
(1) Permanently enjoined by reason of his misconduct by any court of competent jurisdiction (i) whether by consent, default, upon summary judgment or after trial, in any action brought by the Commission based upon violations of any provision of the Commodity Exchange Act, as amended, or of the rules and regulations adopted thereunder, or (ii) after trial or upon summary judgment in any action brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission based upon any violation of the federal securities laws (15 U.S.C. 77a to 80b-20)
or of rules and regulations adopted thereunder;
(2) Found by any court of competent jurisdiction (whether by consent, default, upon summary judgment or after trial) in any action brought by the Commission to which he is a party, or found by the Commission (whether by consent, default, upon summary disposition or after hearing) in any administrative proceeding in which the Commission is a complainant and to which he is a party, to have committed, caused, or aided and abetted a violation of any provision of the Commodity Exchange Act, as amended, or of the rules and regulations promulgated under any of those statutes;
(3) Found upon summary judgment or after trial by any court of competent jurisdiction in any action brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to which he is a party, or found by the Securities and Exchange Commission, upon summary disposition or after hearing, in any administrative proceeding in which the Securities and Exchange Commission is a complainant and to which he is a party, to have committed, caused, or aided or abetted a violation of any provision of the federal securities laws (15 U.S.C. 77a to 80b-20) or of the rules and regulations adopted thereunder.
(b)
Petition to lift suspension.
Any person temporarily suspended from appearing and practicing before the Commission in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section may, within 30 days after service upon him of temporary suspension, petition the Commission to lift the temporary suspension. If no petition has been received by the Commission within 30 days after service of the order by mail the suspension shall become permanent.
(c)
Consideration of petition.
Within 30 days after the filing of the petition described in paragraph (b) of this section the Commission shall either lift the temporary suspension or set the matter down for hearing or both. After opportunity for hearing, the Commission may censure the petitioner or may disqualify the petitioner from appearing or practicing before the Commission for a period of time or permanently or may determine that no action is appropriate.
(d)
Hearing.
A showing that the petitioner has been enjoined or has been found to have committed, caused or aided or abetted violations as described in paragraph (a) of this section, without more, may be a basis for censure or disqualification; that showing having been made, the burden shall then be on the petitioner to show why he should not be censured or disqualified. A petitioner will not be heard to contest any findings against him or admissions made by him in the judicial or administrative proceedings upon which the proposed censure or disqualification is based. A petitioner who has consented to the entry of a permanent injunction as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section without admitting the facts set forth in the complaint shall nevertheless be presumed for all purposes under this section to have been enjoined by reason of the misconduct alleged in the complaint.
§ 14.8
Lack of requisite qualifications, character and integrity.
In addition to those matters specifically referred to in §§ 14.4 through 14.7, the Commission may, after notice and opportunity for hearing in the matter, deny, temporarily or permanently, the privilege of appearing or practicing before it to any person who is found by the Commission by a preponderance of the evidence:
(a) Not to possess the requisite qualifications to represent others; or
(b) To be lacking in character or integrity; or
(c) To have engaged in unethical or improper professional conduct either in the course of any adjudicatory, investigative or rulemaking or other proceeding before the Commission or otherwise. With respect to the professional conduct of persons licensed to practice as accountants, “unethical or improper professional conduct” means:
(1) Intentional or knowing conduct, including reckless conduct, that results in a violation of applicable professional principles or standards; or
(2) Either of the following two types of negligent conduct:
(i) A single instance of highly unreasonable conduct that results in a violation of applicable professional principles or standards in circumstances in
which an accountant knows, or should know, that heightened scrutiny is warranted.
(ii) Repeated instances of unreasonable conduct, each resulting in a violation of applicable professional principles or standards, which indicate a lack of competence to practice before the Commission.
[41 FR 28472, July 12, 1976, as amended at 80 FR 32857, June 10, 2015]
§ 14.9
Duty to file information concerning adverse judicial or administrative action.
Any person appearing or practicing before the Commission who has been the subject of a conviction, suspension, disbarment, revocation, injunction or finding of the kind described in §§ 14.5 through 14.7, unless based on action instituted by the Commission, shall promptly file a copy of the relevant order, judgment or decree with the Secretariat of the Commission at the Commission's Washington, DC headquarters, together with any related opinion or statement of the agency or tribunal involved. Any person who has been the subject of administrative or judicial action of the kind described in §§ 14.5 through 14.7 and who has not filed a copy of the order, judgment or decree within thirty days after its entry shall for that reason alone be disqualified from appearing or practicing before the Commission until such time as the appropriate filing shall be made, but neither the filing of these documents nor the failure of a person to file them shall in any way affect the operations of any other provision of this part.
[41 FR 28472, July 12, 1976, as amended at 60 FR 49335, Sept. 25, 1995; 89 FR 71809, Sept. 4, 2024]
§ 14.10
Reinstatement.
Any person who is disqualified from appearing or practicing before the Commission under any of the provisions of this part may at any time file an application of reinstatement and the applicant may, in the Commission's discretion, be afforded a hearing on the application. However, denial of the privilege of appearing or practicing before the Commission shall continue unless and until the applicant has been reinstated by order of the Commission.

[78 FR 69230, Nov. 18, 2013]
§ 15.05
Designation of agent for foreign persons.
(a) For purposes of this section, the term “futures contract” means any contract for the purchase or sale of any commodity for future delivery, traded or executed on or subject to the rules of any designated contract market, or for the purposes of paragraph (i) of this section, a reporting market (including all agreements, contracts and transactions that are treated by a clearing organization as fungible with such contracts); the term “option contract” means any contract for the purchase or sale of a commodity option, or as applicable, any other instrument subject to the Act, traded or executed on or subject to the rules of any designated contract market, or for the purposes of paragraph (i) of this section, a reporting market (including all agreements, contracts and transactions that are treated by a clearing organization as fungible with such contracts); the term “customer” means any person for whose benefit a foreign broker makes or causes to be made any futures contract or option contract; and the term “communication” means any summons, complaint, order, subpoena, special call, request for information, or notice, as well as any other written document or correspondence.
(b) Any futures commission merchant who makes or causes to be made any futures contract or option contract for the account of any foreign broker or foreign trader, and any introducing broker who introduces such an account to a futures commission merchant, shall thereupon be deemed to be the agent of the foreign broker or the foreign trader for purposes of accepting delivery and service of any communication issued by or on behalf of the Commission to the foreign broker or the foreign trader with respect to any futures or option contracts which are or have been maintained in such accounts carried by the futures commission merchant. In the case of a futures commission merchant who makes or causes to be made any futures or option contract for the account of a foreign broker, the futures commission merchant and the introducing broker, if any, shall also be the agent of the customers of the foreign broker (including any customer who is also a foreign broker and its customers) who have positions in the foreign broker's futures or option contract account carried by the futures commission merchant for purposes of accepting delivery and service of any communication issued by or on behalf of the Commission to the customer with respect to any futures or option contracts which are or have been maintained in such
accounts carried by the futures commission merchant. Service or delivery of any communication issued by or on behalf of the Commission to a futures commission merchant or to an introducing broker pursuant to such agency shall constitute valid and effective service or delivery upon the foreign broker, a customer of the foreign broker or the foreign trader.

# Supplemental List III: Business Purposes of Commodity Derivatives Trading

# Business Purpose

# Definition

# Example
Offsetting Cash or Spot Market Input Price Risk
Using derivative markets for commodities that are direct inputs or purchases for your business so as to offset price risk associated with your purchase of these inputs.
E.g. You are a grain processor, so you use wheat futures to offset the price risk incidental to your cash purchases of wheat.
Offsetting Cash or Spot Market Output Price Risk
Using derivative markets for commodities that are direct outputs or sales of your business so as to offset price risk associated with your sale of these outputs.
E.g. You are a gasoline refiner, so you use gasoline futures to offset price risk associated with your production of gasoline.
Offsetting Other Cash or Spot Market Price Risks (Cross Price Risk)
Using derivative markets for a commodity that is not a direct input or output of your business, but which has significant price correlations with the direct inputs or outputs of your business.
E.g. You manufacture ethanol which is used as an additive in and competitor for gasoline as a combustive fuel. While you neither directly consume nor produce gasoline, you may find that the price you receive for your ethanol product is highly correlated with the price of gasoline, and therefore you reduce ethanol price risk by using gasoline futures contracts.
Other Physical Risk Management Strategies
Managing other price risks incidental to the operation of your business or physical assets through the use of commodity derivative markets.
E.g. You are a manufacturer with significant international sales, so you use foreign currency futures to offset risks associated with changes in the competitiveness of your exports and therefore the value of your physical assets such as production plants, land, machinery, etc.
Client Futures/Options on Futures Trading
Fulfilling customer/client desire for portfolio diversification or exposure to various asset classes through your activity as a Commodity Pool Operator, Commodity Trading Advisor, or other similar role.
E.g. You collect funds and execute trading strategies through the use of futures/options on futures markets at the expressed intent and for the sole benefit of clients.
Managing Client Swaps Exposure
Reducing risk stemming from holding or executing swaps contracts on behalf of clients or customers through the use of futures/options on futures markets.
E.g. You sell crude oil swaps to a client and agree to accept the risk inherent in the index price. You offset this risk through purchases of crude oil futures, in effect transferring price risk from the client to another market participant.
Making Markets/Providing Liquidity
Engaging in derivatives transactions to assume risk and help transfer ownership of derivative positions from one market participant to another, realizing the bid-ask spread as the return.
E.g. You accept risk by buying and selling futures/options on futures contracts so that other traders can move into and out of positions when they wish. You then find other traders willing to take the other side of those transactions.
Arbitrage
Using derivative markets as part of a strategy designed to realize risk-free profit from pricing anomalies.
E.g. You realize that the wheat futures contract is trading at a discount (even after considering storage, transport, etc.) relative to the wheat cash price, and therefore find it profitable to purchase the wheat futures contract, take delivery, and then resell the wheat in the cash market for a risk-free profit.
Establishing Price Exposure
Using derivative markets as a way to express your belief in the future movement of market prices. This strategy does not involve offsetting risks incidental to your business, but instead involves directional trading.
E.g. You conduct research and believe that crude oil prices are due to rise, so you take long futures positions in crude oil to profit from your predictions.
Financial Asset Management
Using derivatives to diversify, rebalance, or otherwise allocate financial assets so that risks to the value of the investment portfolio are reduced. This strategy is used by entities such as pension funds and endowments to manage overall risk to their financial portfolios.
E.g. You hold Treasury bonds as a component of your investment portfolio, and use futures contracts to reduce overall portfolio risk that would result from falling bond prices.
Managing Proprietary Swaps Exposure
Reducing risk stemming from your proprietary holding or execution of swaps contracts through the use of futures/options on futures markets.
E.g. You trade interest rate swaps as part of your business or investment strategy, and offset some of the risk inherent in those swaps through your use of Eurodollar futures markets.
Other: Specify
List and explain your business purpose if the above categories do not adequately describe the reason you trade in a particular commodity derivative market.

Pt. 20, App. A

# Appendix A to Part 20—Guidelines on Futures Equivalency
The following examples illustrate how swaps should be converted into futures equivalents. In general the total notional quantity for each swap should be apportioned to referent futures months based on the fraction of days remaining in the life of the swap during each referent futures month to the total duration of the swap, measured in days. The terms used in the examples are to be understood in a manner that is consistent with industry practice.
Example 1—Fixed for Floating WTI Crude Oil Swap Linked to a DCM Contract
Reference Price
Daily official next to expire contract price for the NYMEX Light Sweet Crude Oil Futures Contract (“WTI”) in $/bbl through the NYMEX spot month.
Fixed Price
$80.00 per barrel.
Floating Price

NYMEX WTI trading in the next to expire futures contract ceases on the third business day prior to the 25th of the calendar month preceding the contract month. For simplicity in this example, the last trading day in each WTI futures contract is shown as the 22nd of the month.

# Futures Equivalent Position on January 1
Total Notional Quantity = 6 months * 100,000 bbls/month = 600,000 bbls
1,000 bbl = 1 futures contract
Therefore 600,000 bbls/1,000 bbls/contract = 600 futures equivalent contracts
Total number of days in swap term = 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 = 181

For simplicity in this example, the last trading day in each Corn futures contract is shown as the 14th of the month. Futures contract months for corn are March, May, July, September, and December.

# Futures Equivalent Position on January 1
Total Notional Quantity = 6 contract months * 1,000,000 bushels/month = 6,000,000 bushels
5,000 bushels = 1 futures contract
Therefore 6,000,000 bushels/5,000 bushels/contract = 1,200 futures equivalent contracts

Example 5—Columbia Gulf, Mainline Midpoint (“Midpoint') Basis Swap
Reference Price
The Platts Gas Daily Columbia Gulf, Mainline Midpoint (“Midpoint”) and the next to expire NYMEX (Henry Hub) Natural Gas Futures contract.
Fixed Price
$0.05 per MMBtu.
Floating Price
The Floating Price will be equal to the arithmetic average of the daily value of the Platts Gas Daily Columbia Gulf, Mainline Midpoint (“Midpoint”) minus the NYMEX (Henry Hub) Natural Gas Futures contract daily settlement price.
Calculation Period
Monthly.
Notional Quantity
10,000 MMBtu/calendar day.
Fixed Price Payer
Company A.
Floating Price Payer
Company B.
Settlement type
Financial.
Swap Term
One month from January 1 to January 31.
Floating Amount
Floating Price * Notional Quantity * calendar days in the month.
Fixed Amount
Fixed Price * Notional Quantity * calendar days in the month.
NYMEX Henry Hub Natural Gas Futures Contract trading ceases three business days prior to the first day of the delivery month. For simplicity in this example, the last trading day in the futures contract is shown as the 28th of the month.

# Futures Equivalent Position on January 1
Total Notional Quantity for each leg = 1 month * 31 days/month * 10,000 MMBtu/day = 310,000 MMBtu
10,000 MMBtu = 1 futures contract
Therefore 310,000 MMBtu/10,000 MMBtu/contract = 31 futures equivalent contracts
Total number of days = 31

# Appendix B to Part 20—Explanatory Guidance on Data Record Layouts

# Record Layout Examples for § 20.3
The following example (in Tables 1, 2 and 3) covers reporting for a particular clearing organization. “Clearing Organization One” would report, for the 27th of September 2010, the following eleven unique data record submissions. Each data record submission represents a unique position, as indicated by § 20.3, held by a clearing member of Clearing Organization One. Paragraph (a) of § 20.3 broadly outlines the data elements that determine unique positions for reports on clearing member positions. Paragraphs (b) of § 20.3 present all of the data elements that should be submitted in reference to a particular data record for a particular clearing member (in Table 1). Paragraph (c) identifies data elements that would comprise end of day record data on cleared products (in Tables 2 and 3). Therefore, paragraphs (b) and (c) of § 20.3 present all of the data elements that should be submitted in reference to a particular data record.
Because CFTC designated Clearing Organization One (in this example) currently has two clearing members, “Clearing Member One” and “Clearing Member Two,” positions cleared for these two distinct clearing members would be subdivided.
In the following example it is assumed that the clearing member accounts are either proprietary or customer (but not both) and therefore data record submissions do not have to be delineated by these account types. However, if clearing members did have both proprietary and customer accounts, then a clearing organization would have to further subdivide these clearing member data records by these two account types.
Clearing Member One currently has five positions with multiple cleared product IDs and futures equivalent months/years, and therefore these positions also constitute separate data records.
Clearing Member Two currently has six positions with the following varying characteristics: Cleared product IDs; futures equivalent months/years; commodity reference prices; swaption positions that involve both puts and calls; and multiple strike prices. Accordingly, these positions must be reported in separate data records. An illustration of how these records would appear is included in Table 1 below. Clearing Organization One would also have to report the corresponding swaption position deltas, strike prices, expiration dates, and settlement prices and swap settlement prices. An illustration of these submissions is included in Tables 2 and 3 below.

# First Record Layout Example for § 20.4:
This first example shows the data records generated under § 20.4 by a single reporting firm for report date September 27, 2011. Each data record represents a unique part of a reportable position in heating oil and natural gas by the reporting entity and its counterparties. Paragraph (b) of § 20.4 outlines the data elements that determine unique positions.
In this example, the reporting entity clears with one clearing organization and therefore the data records do not have to be delineated by clearing organization (there is a reportable position stemming from an uncleared transaction included as well). However, if the reporting entity in this example used multiple clearing organizations, then it would have to further subdivide its data submissions by each clearing organization.
The reporting entity reports fifteen records; six principal positions and nine counterparty positions. The reported positions constitute separate data records because they vary by the following characteristics: swap counterparties; futures equivalent months/years; clearing organization cleared products; swaptions that were either cleared or uncleared; commodity reference prices; and whether the trade was entered into on or off execution facilities. An illustration of how these records would be reported is included in Table 4 below.
For the calculation of notional values, assume for simplicity that the price of heating oil, for all contract months and for both reference prices, is $3/gal. Similarly, assume that the price of natural gas for all contract months is $4.25/MMBtu.

# Note:
The bottom two rows in Table 4 indicate whether, for uncleared and cleared swaps and swaptions, data elements for which any difference in one of the elements constitutes a reason for a new data record (NDR).

# Second Record Layout Example for § 20.4:
In this second example, the data records generated by § 20.4(c) are displayed for a hypothetical swap, as detailed in Example 1 of appendix A. In contrast to the above example, this second example of a § 20.4(c) data record is simplistic in that it displays a situation where the position records arise from a single swap transaction, in one commodity, with a single counterparty.
For the sake of this example, assume the swap dealer gained long exposure from the swap, and that the swap was cleared. The price of crude is assumed to be $100/bbl for all contract months on January 1 and $95/bbl for all contract months on January 2. An illustration of the data records generated for January 1, 2011 and January 2, 2011 as a result of this hypothetical swap can be found in Tables 5 and 6, respectively.

L. 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376 (2010)), for an existing account for any person that is a foreign clearing member or foreign trader, until the futures commission merchant, introducing broker, clearing member or reporting market has explained fully to the customer, in any manner that such person deems appropriate, the provisions of this section.
(c) Upon a determination by the Commission that information concerning accounts may be relevant information in enabling the Commission to determine whether the threat of a market manipulation, corner, squeeze, or other market disorder exists on any reporting market, the Commission may issue a call for information from a futures commission merchant, clearing member, introducing broker or customer pursuant to the provisions of this section.
(d) In the event the call is issued to a foreign broker, foreign clearing member or foreign trader, its agent, designated pursuant to § 15.05 of this chapter, shall, if directed, promptly transmit calls made by the Commission pursuant to this section by electronic mail or a similarly expeditious means of communication.
(e) The futures commission merchant, clearing member, introducing broker, or customer to whom the special call is issued must provide to the Commission the information specified below for the commodity, reporting market and delivery months or option expiration dates named in the call. Such information shall be filed at the place and within the time specified by the Commission.
(1) For each account of a futures commission merchant, clearing member, introducing broker, or foreign broker, including those accounts in the name of the futures commission merchant, clearing member or foreign broker, on the dates specified in the call issued pursuant to this section, such persons shall provide the Commission with the following information:
(i) The name and address of the person in whose name the account is carried or introduced and, if the person is not an individual, the name of the individual to contact regarding the account;

(v) For the accounts which are not carried for and in the name of another futures commission merchant, clearing member, introducing broker, or foreign broker, the name and address of any other person who controls the trading of the account, and the name and address of any person who has a ten percent or more beneficial interest in the account.
(2) Each trader shall provide the Commission with the following information:

(ii) The name and address of any person having a ten percent or more beneficial interest in the open futures or options contracts reported pursuant to this paragraph;

(iv) The cash commodity transaction and position information required to be maintained pursuant to § 18.05 of this chapter as specified in the call which relates to futures or options positions of the trader in the United States.
(f) If the Commission has reason to believe that any person has not responded as required to a call made pursuant to this section, the Commission in writing may inform the reporting market specified in the call and that reporting market shall prohibit the execution of, and no futures commission merchant, clearing member, introducing broker, or foreign broker shall effect a transaction in connection with trades on the reporting market and in the months or expiration dates specified in the call for or on behalf of the futures commission merchant or customer named in the call, unless such trades offset existing open contracts of such futures commission merchant or customer.
(g) Any person named in a special call that believes he or she is or may be adversely affected or aggrieved by action taken by the Commission under paragraph (f) of this section shall have the opportunity for a prompt hearing after the Commission acts. That person may immediately present in writing to the Commission for its consideration any comments or arguments concerning the Commission's action and may present for Commission consideration any documentary or other evidence that person deems appropriate. Upon request, the Commission may, in its discretion, determine that an oral hearing be conducted to permit the further presentation of information and views concerning any matters by any or all such persons. The oral hearing may be held before the Commission or any person designated by the Commission, which person shall cause all evidence to be reduced to writing and forthwith transmit the same and a recommended decision to the Commission. The Commission's directive under
paragraph (f) of this section shall remain in effect unless and until modified or withdrawn by the Commission.
(h) If, during the course of or after the Commission acts pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section, the Commission determines that it is appropriate to undertake a proceeding pursuant to section 6(c) of the Act, the Commission shall issue a complaint in accordance with the requirements of section 6(c), and, upon further determination by the Commission that the conditions described in paragraph (c) of this section still exist, a hearing pursuant to section 6(c) of the Act shall commence no later than five business days after service of the complaint. In the event the person served with the complaint under section 6(c) of the Act has, prior to the commencement of the hearing under section 6(c) of the Act, sought a hearing pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section and the Commission has determined to accord him such a hearing, the two hearings shall be conducted simultaneously. Nothing in this section shall preclude the Commission from taking other appropriate action under the Act or the Commission's regulations thereunder, including action under section 6(c) of the Act, regardless of whether the conditions described in paragraph (c) of this section still exist, and no ruling issued in the course of a hearing pursuant to paragraph (g) or this paragraph shall constitute an estoppel against the Commission in any other action.

(b)
Location of Cleared Swaps Customer Collateral.
(1) A futures commission merchant must segregate all Cleared Swaps Customer Collateral that it receives, and must either hold such Cleared Swaps Customer Collateral itself as set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, or deposit such collateral into one or more Cleared Swaps Customer Accounts held at a Permitted Depository, as set forth in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
(2) If a futures commission merchant holds Cleared Swaps Customer Collateral itself, then the futures commission merchant must:
(i) Physically separate such collateral from its own property;
(ii) Clearly identify each physical location in which it holds such collateral as a “Location of Cleared Swaps Customer Collateral” (the “FCM Physical Location”);
(iii) Ensure that the FCM Physical Location provides appropriate protection for such collateral; and
(iv) Record in its books and records the amount of such Cleared Swaps Customer Collateral separately from its own funds.
(3) If a futures commission merchant holds Cleared Swaps Customer Collateral in a Permitted Depository, then:
(i) The Permitted Depository must qualify pursuant to the requirements set forth in § 22.4 of this part, and
(ii) The futures commission merchant must maintain a Cleared Swaps Customer Account with each such Permitted Depository.

Customer to purchase, margin, or settle the Cleared Swaps or any other trade or contract of, or to secure or extend the credit of, any person other than such Cleared Swaps Customer. Cleared Swaps Customer Collateral shall not be used to margin, guarantee, or secure trades or contracts of the entity constituting a Cleared Swaps Customer other than in Cleared Swaps, except to the extent permitted by a Commission rule, regulation or order.

Exceptions.
Notwithstanding the foregoing:
(1)
Permitted investments.
A futures commission merchant may invest money, securities, or other property constituting Cleared Swaps Customer Collateral in accordance with § 1.25 of this chapter, which shall apply to such money, securities, or other property as if they comprised customer funds or customer money subject to segregation pursuant to section 4d(a) of the Act and the regulations thereunder;
Provided, however,
that the futures commission merchant shall bear sole responsibility for any losses resulting from the investment of customer funds in instruments described in § 1.25 of this chapter. No investment losses shall be borne or otherwise allocated to Cleared Swaps Customers of the futures commission merchant.
(2)

Such share of Cleared Swaps Customer Collateral as in the normal course of business shall be necessary to margin, guarantee, secure, transfer, adjust, or settle a Cleared Swaps Customer's Cleared Swaps with a derivatives clearing organization, or with a Collecting Futures Commission Merchant, may be withdrawn and applied to such purposes, including the payment of commissions, brokerage, interest, taxes, storage, and other charges, lawfully accruing in connection with such Cleared Swaps.
(3)
Deposits of own money, securities, or other property.
(i) In order to ensure that it is always in compliance with paragraph (f) of this section, a futures commission merchant may place in an FCM Physical Location or deposit in a Cleared Swaps Customer Account its own money, securities, or other property (

(4)
Residual financial interest.
(i) If, in accordance with paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section, a futures commission merchant places in an FCM Physical Location or deposits in a Cleared Swaps Customer Account its own money, securities, or other property, then such money, securities, or other property (including accruals thereon) shall constitute Cleared Swaps Customer Collateral.
(ii) The futures commission merchant shall have a residual financial interest in any portion of such money, securities, or other property in excess of that necessary for compliance with paragraph (f)(4) of this section.
(iii) The futures commission merchant may withdraw money, securities, or other property from the FCM Physical Location or Cleared Swaps Customer Account, to the extent of its residual financial interest therein. At the time of such withdrawal, the futures commission merchant shall ensure that
the withdrawal does not cause its residual financial interest to become less than zero.
(f)
Requirements as to amount.
(1) For purposes of this § 22.2(f), the term “account” shall reference the entries on the books and records of a futures commission merchant pertaining to the Cleared Swaps Customer Collateral of a particular Cleared Swaps Customer.
(2) The futures commission merchant must reflect in the account that it maintains for each Cleared Swaps Customer, the net liquidating equity for each such Cleared Swaps Customer, calculated as follows: The market value of any Cleared Swaps Customer Collateral that it receives from such customer, as adjusted by:
(i) Any uses permitted under paragraph (d) of this section;
(ii) Any accruals on permitted investments of such collateral under paragraph (e) of this section that, pursuant to the futures commission merchant's customer agreement with that customer, are creditable to such customer;
(iii) Any gains and losses with respect to Cleared Swaps;
(iv) Any charges lawfully accruing to the Cleared Swaps Customer, including any commission, brokerage fee, interest, tax, or storage fee; and
(v) Any appropriately authorized distribution or transfer of such collateral.
(3) If the market value of Cleared Swaps Customer Collateral in the account of a Cleared Swaps Customer is positive after adjustments, then that account has a credit balance. If the market value of Cleared Swaps Customer Collateral in the account of a Cleared Swaps Customer is negative after adjustments, then that account has a debit balance.
(4) The futures commission merchant must, at all times, maintain in segregation, in its FCM Physical Locations and/or its Cleared Swaps Customer Accounts at Permitted Depositories, an amount equal to the sum of any credit and debit balances that the Cleared Swaps Customers of the futures commission merchant have in their accounts. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, a futures commission merchant must add back to the total amount of funds required to be maintained in segregation any Cleared Swaps Customer Accounts with debit balances in the amounts calculated in accordance with paragraph (f)(5) of this section.
(5) The futures commission merchant, in calculating the total amount of funds required to be maintained in segregation pursuant to paragraph (f)(4) of this section, must include any debit balance, as calculated pursuant to this paragraph (f)(5), that a Cleared Swaps Customer has in its account, to the extent that such debit balance is not secured by “readily marketable securities” that the particular Cleared Swaps Customer deposited with the futures commission merchant.
(i) For purposes of calculating the amount of a Cleared Swaps Customer Account's debit balance that the futures commission merchant is required to include in its calculation of its total segregation requirement pursuant to this paragraph (f)(5), the futures commission merchant shall calculate the net liquidating equity of each Cleared Swaps Customer Account in accordance with paragraph (f)(2) of this section, except that the futures commission merchant shall exclude from the calculation any noncash collateral held in the Cleared Swaps Customer Account as margin collateral. The futures commission merchant may offset the debit balance computed under this paragraph (f)(5) to the extent of any “readily marketable securities,” subject to percentage deductions (
i.e.,
“securities haircuts”) as specified in paragraph (f)(5)(iv) of this section, held for the particular Cleared Swaps Customer to secure its debit balance.
(ii) For purposes of this section, “readily marketable” shall be defined as having a “ready market” as such latter term is defined in Rule 15c3-1(c)(11) of the Securities and Exchange Commission (17 CFR 240.15c3-1(c)(11)).
(iii) In order for a debit balance to be deemed secured by “readily marketable securities,” the futures commission merchant must maintain a security interest in such securities, and must hold a written authorization to liquidate the securities at the discretion of the futures commission merchant.
(iv) To determine the amount of such debit balance secured by “readily marketable securities,” the futures commission merchant shall:
(A) Determine the market value of such securities; and
(B) Reduce such market value by applicable percentage deductions (
i.e.,
“securities haircuts”) as set forth in Rule 15c3-1(c)(2)(vi) of the Securities and Exchange Commission (17 CFR 240.15c3-1(c)(2)(vi)). Futures commission merchants that establish and enforce written policies and procedures to assess the credit risk of commercial paper, convertible debt instruments, or nonconvertible debt instruments in accordance with Rule 240.15c3-1(c)(2)(vi) of the Securities and Exchange Commission (17 CFR 240.15c3-1(c)(2)(vi)) may apply the lower haircut percentages specified in Rule 240.15c3-1(c)(2)(vi) for such commercial paper, convertible debt instruments and nonconvertible debt instruments.
(6)(i) The undermargined amount for a Cleared Swaps Customer Account is the amount, if any, by which:
(A) The total amount of collateral required for that Cleared Swaps Customer's Cleared Swaps, at the time or times referred to in paragraph (f)(6)(ii) of this section, exceeds—
(B) The value of the Cleared Swaps Customer Collateral for that account, as calculated in paragraph (f)(2) of this section.
(ii) Each futures commission merchant must compute, based on the information available to the futures commission merchant as of the close of each business day,
(A) The undermargined amounts, based on the clearing initial margin that will be required to be maintained by that futures commission merchant for its Cleared Swaps Customers, at each derivatives clearing organization of which the futures commission merchant is a member, at the point of the daily settlement (as described in § 39.14 of this chapter) that will complete during the following business day for each such derivatives clearing organization less
(B) Any debit balances referred to in paragraph (f)(4) of this section included in such undermargined amounts.
(iii)(A) Prior to the time of settlement referenced in paragraph (f)(6)(ii)(A) of this section such futures commission merchant must maintain residual interest in segregated funds that is equal to or exceeds the portion of the computation set forth in paragraph (f)(6)(ii) of this section attributable to the clearing initial margin required by the derivatives clearing organization making such settlement.
(B) A futures commission merchant may reduce the amount of residual interest required in paragraph (f)(6)(iii)(A) of this section to account for payments received from or on behalf of undermargined Cleared Swaps Customers (less the sum of any disbursements made to or on behalf of such customers) between the close of the previous business day and the time of settlement.
(iv) For purposes of paragraph (f)(6)(ii) of this section, a Depositing Futures Commission Merchant should include, as clearing initial margin, customer initial margin that the Depositing Futures Commission Merchant will be required to maintain, for that Depositing Futures Commission Merchant's Cleared Swaps Customers, at a Collecting Futures Commission Merchant, and, for purposes of paragraph (f)(6)(iii) of this section, must do so prior to the time it must settle with that Collecting Futures Commission Merchant.

§ 22.13
Additions to Cleared Swaps Customer Collateral.
(a)(1) At the election of the derivatives clearing organization or Collecting Futures Commission Merchant, the collateral requirement referred to in § 22.12(a), (c), and (d) applicable to a particular Cleared Swaps Customer or group of Cleared Swaps Customers may be increased based on an evaluation of the credit risk posed by such Cleared Swaps Customer or group, in which case the derivatives clearing organization or Collecting Futures Commission Merchant shall collect and record such higher amount as provided in § 22.12.
(2) Nothing in paragraph (a)(1) of this section is intended to interfere with the right of a futures commission merchant to increase the collateral requirements at such futures commission merchant with respect to any of its Cleared Swaps Customers, Futures Customers (as § 1.3 of this chapter defines that term), or Foreign Futures or Foreign Options Customers (as § 30.1 of this chapter defines that term).
(b) Any collateral deposited by a futures commission merchant (including a Depositing Futures Commission Merchant) pursuant to § 22.2(e)(3)(ii) of this part, which collateral is identified as such futures commission merchant's own property may be used by the derivatives clearing organization or Collecting Futures Commission Merchant, as applicable, to margin, guarantee or secure the Cleared Swaps of any or all of such Cleared Swaps Customers.
(c) A futures commission merchant may transmit to a derivatives clearing organization any collateral posted by a Cleared Swaps Customer in excess of the amount required by the derivatives clearing organization if:
(1) the rules of the derivatives clearing organization expressly permit the futures commission merchant to transmit collateral in excess of the amount required by the derivatives clearing organization; and
(2) the derivatives clearing organization provides a mechanism by which the futures commission merchant is able to, and maintains rules pursuant to which the futures commission merchant is required to, identify each Business Day, for each Cleared Swaps Customer, the amount of collateral posted in excess of the amount required by the derivatives clearing organization.
[77 FR 6371, Feb. 7, 2012, as amended at 77 FR 66335, Nov. 2, 2012]
§ 22.14
Futures Commission Merchant failure to meet a Cleared Swaps Customer Margin Call in full.
(a) A Depositing Futures Commission Merchant which receives a call for either initial margin or variation margin with respect to a Cleared Swaps Customer Account from a Collecting Futures Commission Merchant, which call such Depositing Futures Commission Merchant does not meet in full, shall, with respect to each Cleared Swaps Customer of such Depositing Futures Commission Merchant whose Cleared Swaps contribute to such margin call,
(1) Transmit to the Collecting Futures Commission Merchant an amount equal to the lesser of
(i) The amount called for; or
(ii) The remaining Cleared Swaps Collateral on deposit at such Depositing Futures Commission Merchant for that Cleared Swaps Customer; and
(2) Advise the Collecting Futures Commission Merchant of the identity of each such Cleared Swaps Customer, and the amount transmitted on behalf of each such Cleared Swaps Customer.
(b) If the entity acting as Depositing Futures Commission Merchant referenced in paragraph (a) of this section is also a Collecting Futures Commission Merchant, then:
(1) Such entity shall include in the transmission required in paragraph (a)(1) of this section any amount that it receives, pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section, from a Depositing Futures Commission Merchant for which such entity acts as a Collecting Futures Commission Merchant; and
(2) Such entity shall present its Collecting Futures Commission Merchant with the information that it receives, pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section, from a Depositing Futures Commission Merchant for which such entity acts as a Collecting Futures Commission Merchant.
(c) A futures commission merchant which receives a call for either initial or variation margin with respect to a Cleared Swaps Customer Account from a derivatives clearing organization, which call such futures commission merchant does not meet in full, shall, with respect to each Cleared Swaps Customer of such futures commission merchant whose Cleared Swaps contribute to such margin call:
(1) Transmit to the derivatives clearing organization an amount equal to the lesser of
(i) The amount called for; or
(ii) The remaining Cleared Swaps Collateral on deposit at such futures commission merchant for each such Cleared Swaps Customer; and
(2) Advise the derivatives clearing organization of the identity of each such Cleared Swaps Customer, and the amount transmitted on behalf of each such Cleared Swaps Customer.
(d) If the futures commission merchant referenced in paragraph (c) is a Collecting Futures Commission Merchant, then:

(2) Such Collecting Futures Commission shall present the derivatives clearing organization with the information that it receives from a Depositing Futures Commission Merchant pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
(e) If,
(1) On the business day prior to the business day on which the Depositing Futures Commission Merchant fails to meet a margin call with respect to a Cleared Swaps Customer Account, such Collecting Futures Commission Merchant referenced in paragraph (a) of this section held, with respect to such account, Cleared Swaps Collateral of a value no less than the amount specified in § 22.12(a)(2) of this part, after the application of haircuts specified by policies applied by such Collecting Futures Commission Merchant in its relationship with the Depositing Futures Commission Merchant, and
(2) As of the close of business on the business day on which the margin call is not met, the market value of the Cleared Swaps Collateral held by the derivatives clearing organization or Collecting Futures Commission Merchant is, due to changes in such market value, less than the amount specified in § 22.12(a)(2) of this part, then the amount of such collateral attributable to each Cleared Swaps Customer pursuant to § 22.12(a)(1) of this part shall be reduced by the percentage difference between the amount specified in § 22.12(a)(2) of this part and such market value.
(f) If:
(1) On the business day prior to the business day on which the futures commission merchant fails to meet a margin call with respect to a Cleared Swaps Customer Account, the derivatives clearing organization referenced in paragraph (c) of this section held, with respect to such account, Cleared Swaps Collateral of a value no less than the amount specified in § 22.12(c)(2) of this part, after the application of haircuts specified by the rules and procedures of such derivatives clearing organization, and
(2) As of the close of business on the business day on which the margin call is not met, the market value of the Cleared Swaps Collateral held by the derivatives clearing organization is, due to changes in such market value, less than the amount specified in § 22.12(c)(2) of this part, then the amount of collateral attributable to each Cleared Swaps Customer pursuant to § 22.12(c)(1) of this part shall be reduced by the percentage difference between the amount specified in § 22.12(c)(2) and such market value.
(g) A derivatives clearing organization or Collecting Futures Commission Merchant is entitled to reasonably rely upon any information provided by a defaulting futures commission merchant under § 22.14. If the defaulting futures commission merchant does not provide such information on the date of the futures commission merchant's default, a derivatives clearing organization or Collecting Futures Commission Merchant may rely on the information previously provided to it by the defaulting futures commission merchant.
[77 FR 6371, Feb. 7, 2012, as amended at 77 FR 66335, Nov. 2, 2012]
§ 22.15
Treatment of Cleared Swaps Customer Collateral on an individual basis.
Subject to § 22.3(d), each derivatives clearing organization and each Collecting Futures Commission Merchant receiving Cleared Swaps Customer Collateral from a futures commission merchant shall treat the value of collateral required with respect to the portfolio of rights and obligations arising out of the Cleared Swaps intermediated for each Cleared Swaps Customer, and collected from the futures commission merchant, as belonging to such Cleared Swaps Customer, and such amount shall not be used to margin, guarantee, or secure the Cleared Swaps or other obligations of the futures commission merchant, or of any other Cleared Swaps Customer, Futures Customer (as § 1.3 of this chapter defines that term), or Foreign Futures or Foreign Options Customer (as § 30.1 of this chapter defines that term). Nothing contained herein shall be construed to limit, in any way, the right of a derivatives clearing organization or Collecting Futures Commission Merchant to liquidate any or all positions in a Cleared Swaps Customer Account in the event of a default of a clearing member or Depositing Futures Commission Merchant.
[77 FR 66335, Nov. 2, 2012]
§ 22.16
Disclosures to Cleared Swaps Customers.
(a) A futures commission merchant shall disclose, to each of its Cleared
Swaps Customers, the governing provisions, as described in paragraph (c) of this section, relating to use of Cleared Swaps Customer Collateral, transfer, neutralization of the risks, or liquidation of Cleared Swaps in the event of a default by the futures commission merchant relating to the Cleared Swaps Customer Account, as well as any change in such governing provisions.
(b) If the futures commission merchant referenced in paragraph (a) of this section is a Depositing Futures Commission Merchant, then such futures commission merchant shall disclose, to each of its Cleared Swaps Customers, the governing provisions, as described in paragraph (c) of this section, relating to use of Cleared Swaps Customer Collateral, transfer, neutralization of the risks, or liquidation of Cleared Swaps in the event of a default by:
(1) Such futures commission merchant or
(2) Any relevant Collecting Futures Commission Merchant relating to the Cleared Swaps Customer Account, as well as any change in such governing provisions.
(c) The governing provisions referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section are the rules of each derivatives clearing organization, or the provisions of the customer agreement between the Collecting Futures Commission Merchant and the Depositing Futures Commission Merchant, on or through which the Depositing Futures Commission Merchant will intermediate Cleared Swaps for such Cleared Swaps Customer.
[77 FR 6371, Feb. 7, 2012]
§ 22.17
Policies and procedures governing disbursements of Cleared Swaps Customer Collateral from Cleared Swaps Customer Accounts.
(a) The provision in section 4d(f)(2) of the Act that prohibits the commingling of Cleared Swaps Customer Collateral with the funds of a futures commission merchant, shall not be construed to prevent a futures commission merchant from having a residual financial interest in the funds segregated as required by the Act and the regulations in this part and set apart for the benefit of Cleared Swaps Customers; nor shall such provisions be construed to prevent a futures commission merchant from adding to such segregated funds such amount or amounts of money, from its own funds or unencumbered securities from its own inventory, of the type set forth in § 1.25 of this chapter, as it may deem necessary to ensure any and all Cleared Swaps Customer Accounts are not undersegregated at any time.
(b) A futures commission merchant may not withdraw funds, except withdrawals that are made to or for the benefit of Cleared Swaps Customers, from a Cleared Swaps Customer Account unless the futures commission merchant has prepared the daily segregation calculation required by § 22.2 as of the close of business on the previous business day. A futures commission merchant that has completed its daily segregation calculation may make withdrawals, in addition to withdrawals that are made to or for the benefit of Cleared Swaps Customers, to the extent of its actual residual financial interest in funds held in segregated accounts, including the withdrawal of securities held in segregated safekeeping accounts held by a bank, trust company, derivatives clearing organization or other futures commission merchant. Such withdrawal(s) shall not result in the funds of one Cleared Swaps Customer being used to purchase, margin or carry the trades, contracts or swaps positions, or extend the credit of any other Cleared Swaps Customer or other person.
(c) A futures commission merchant may not withdraw funds, in a single transaction or a series of transactions, that are not made to or for the benefit of Cleared Swaps Customers from Cleared Swaps Customer Accounts if such withdrawal(s) would exceed 25 percent of the futures commission merchant's residual interest in such accounts as reported on the daily segregation calculation required by § 22.2 and computed as of the close of business on the previous business day, unless:
(1) The futures commission merchant's chief executive officer, chief finance officer or other senior official that is listed as a principal of the futures commission merchant on its
Form 7-R and is knowledgeable about the futures commission merchant's financial requirements and financial position pre-approves in writing the withdrawal, or series of withdrawals;
(2) The futures commission merchant files written notice of the withdrawal or series of withdrawals, with the Commission and with its designated self-regulatory organization immediately after the chief executive officer, chief finance officer or other senior official pre-approves the withdrawal or series of withdrawals. The written notice must:
(i) Be signed by the chief executive officer, chief finance officer or other senior official that pre-approved the withdrawal, and give notice that the futures commission merchant has withdrawn or intends to withdraw more than 25 percent of its residual interest in such accounts holding Cleared Swaps Customer Accounts funds;
(ii) Include a description of the reasons for the withdrawal or series of withdrawals;
(iii) List the amount of funds provided to each recipient and the name of each recipient;
(iv) Include the current estimate of the amount of the futures commission merchant's residual interest in the swaps customer funds after the withdrawal;
(v) Contain a representation by the chief executive officer, chief finance officer or other senior official that pre-approved the withdrawal, or series of withdrawals, that, after due diligence, to such person's knowledge and reasonable belief, the futures commission merchant remains in compliance with the segregation requirements after the withdrawal. The chief executive officer, chief finance officer or other senior official must consider the daily segregation calculation as of the close of business on the previous business day and any other factors that may cause a material change in the futures commission's residual interest since the close of business the previous business day, including known unsecured customer debits or deficits, current day market activity and any other withdrawals made from the Cleared Swaps Customer Accounts; and
(vi) Any such written notice filed with the Commission must be filed via electronic transmission using a form of user authentication assigned in accordance with procedures established by or approved by the Commission, and otherwise in accordance with instruction issued by or approved by the Commission. Any such electronic submission must clearly indicate the registrant on whose behalf such filing is made and the use of such user authentication in submitting such filing will constitute and become a substitute for the manual signature of the authorized signer. Any written notice filed must be followed up with direct communication to the Regional office of Commission which has supervisory authority over the futures commission merchant whereby the Commission acknowledges receipt of the notice; and
(3) After making a withdrawal requiring the approval and notice required in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section, and before the next daily segregated funds calculation, no futures commission merchant may make any further withdrawals from accounts holding Cleared Swaps Customer Account funds, except to or for the benefit of Cleared Swaps Customers, without complying with paragraph (c)(1) of this section and filing a written notice with the Commission under paragraph (c)(2)(vi) of this section and its designated self-regulatory organization signed by the chief executive officer, chief finance officer, or other senior official. The written notice must:
(i) List the amount of funds provided to each recipient and each recipient's name;
(ii) Disclose the reason for each withdrawal;
(iii) Confirm that the chief executive officer, chief finance officer, or other senior official (and identify of the person if different from the person who signed the notice) pre-approved the withdrawal in writing;
(iv) Disclose the current estimate of the futures commission merchant's remaining total residual interest in the segregated accounts holding Cleared Swaps Customer Account funds after the withdrawal; and
(v) Include a representation that to the best of the notice signatory's
knowledge and reasonable belief the futures commission merchant remains in compliance with the segregation requirements after the withdrawal.
(d) If a futures commission merchant withdraws funds that are not for the benefit of Cleared Swaps Customers from Cleared Swaps Customer Accounts, and the withdrawal causes the futures commission merchant to not hold sufficient funds in Cleared Swaps Customer Accounts to meet its targeted residual interest, as required to be computed under § 1.11 of this chapter, the futures commission merchant must deposit its own funds into the Cleared Swaps Customer Accounts to restore the targeted amount of residual interest on the next business day, or, if appropriate, revise the futures commission merchant's targeted amount of residual interest pursuant to the policies and procedures required by § 1.11 of this chapter. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the futures commission merchant's residual interest in Cleared Swaps Customer Accounts is less than the amount required to be maintained by § 22.2 at any particular point in time, the futures commission merchant must immediately restore the residual interest to exceed the sum of such amounts. Any proprietary funds deposited in Cleared Swaps Customer Accounts must be unencumbered and otherwise compliant with § 1.25 of this chapter, as applicable.
(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, a futures commission merchant may not withdraw funds that are not for the benefit of Cleared Swaps Customers from a Cleared Swaps Customer Account unless the futures commission merchant follows its policies and procedures required by § 1.11 of this chapter.

§ 23.102
Calculation of market risk exposure requirement and credit risk exposure requirement using internal models.
(a) A swap dealer may apply to the Commission or to a registered futures association of which the swap dealer is a member to obtain approval to use internal models under terms and conditions required by the Commission or the registered futures association and by these regulations, when calculating the swap dealer's market risk exposure and credit risk exposure under §§ 23.101(a)(1)(i)(B), 23.101(a)(1)(ii)(A), or 23.101(a)(2)(ii)(A);
Provided however,
that the Commission must issue a determination that the registered futures association's model requirements and review process are comparable to the Commission's requirements and review process in order for the registered futures association's model approval to be accepted as an alternative means of compliance with this section.
(b) The swap dealer's application to use internal models to compute market risk exposure and credit risk exposure must be in writing and must be filed with the Commission and with a registered futures association of which the swap dealer is a member. The swap dealer must file the application in accordance with instructions established by the Commission and the registered futures association.
(c) A swap dealer's application must include the following:
(1) In the case of a swap dealer subject to the minimum capital requirements in § 23.101(a)(1)(i) applying to use internal models to compute market risk exposure, the information required under subpart F of 12 CFR part 217, as if the swap dealer were itself a bank holding company subject to 12 CFR part 217.
(2) In the case of a swap dealer subject to the minimum capital requirements in § 23.101(a)(1)(i) applying to use internal models to compute credit risk exposure, the information required under subpart E of 12 CFR part 217 in order to calculate credit risk-weighted assets in accordance with sections 217.131 through 217.155 of that subpart, as if the swap dealer were itself a bank holding company subject to 12 CFR part 217.
(3) In the case of a swap dealer subject to the minimum capital requirements in § 23.101(a)(ii) or § 23.101(a)(2), the information set forth in Appendix A to Subpart E of Part 23.
(d) The Commission, or registered futures association upon obtaining the Commission's determination that its requirements and model approval process are comparable to the Commission's requirements and process, may approve or deny the application, or approve or deny an amendment to the application, in whole or in part, subject to any conditions or limitations the Commission or registered futures association may require, if the Commission or registered futures association finds the approval to be appropriate in the public interest, after determining, among other things, whether the applicant has met the requirements of this section. A swap dealer that has received Commission or registered futures association approval to compute market risk exposure requirements and credit risk exposure requirements pursuant to internal models must compute such charges in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.
(e) A swap dealer must cease using internal models to compute its market risk exposure requirement and credit risk exposure requirement, upon the occurrence of any of the following:
(1) The swap dealer has materially changed a mathematical model described in the application or materially changed its internal risk management control system without first submitting amendments identifying such changes and obtaining the approval of the Commission or the registered futures association for such changes;
(2) The Commission or the registered futures association of which the swap dealer is a member determines that the
internal models are no longer sufficient for purposes of the capital calculations of the swap dealer as a result of changes in the operations of the swap dealer;
(3) The swap dealer fails to come into compliance with its requirements under this section, after having received from the Director of the Commission's Market Participants Division, or from the registered futures association of which the swap dealer is a member, written notification that the swap dealer is not in compliance with its requirements, and must come into compliance by a date specified in the notice; or
(4) The Commission by written order finds that permitting the swap dealer to continue to use the internal models is no longer appropriate.
(f)(1) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section, a swap dealer may use internal market risk or credit risk models upon the submission to the Commission and the registered futures association of which the swap dealer is a member a certification, signed by the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, or other appropriate official with knowledge of the swap dealer's capital requirements and the capital models, that such models are in substantial compliance with Commission's model requirements and have been approved for use in computing capital by the swap dealer, or an affiliate of the swap dealer, by the Securities and Exchange Commission, a prudential regulator (as defined in § 1.3 of this chapter), a foreign regulatory authority in a jurisdiction that the Commission has found to be eligible for substituted compliance under § 23.106, or a foreign regulatory authority whose capital adequacy requirements are consistent with the capital requirements issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. A swap dealer also must file an application containing the information required under paragraph (c) of this section with the Commission with its certification. A swap dealer may use such models pending the subsequent approval or denial of the swap dealer's capital model application by the Commission or the registered futures association of which the swap dealer is a member.
(2) A swap dealer shall revise the certification required under paragraph (f)(1) of this section to address any material changes or revisions to the models, or to reflect any regulatory restrictions placed on the models since the certification was submitted.
(3) A swap dealer shall cease using capital models subject to the certification under paragraph (f)(1) of this section if the regulatory authority that previously approved the models for use by the swap dealer, or by the swap dealer's affiliate, has withdrawn its approval and the Commission or a registered futures association has not approved the models.

§ 23.104
Equity Withdrawal Restrictions.
(a)
Equity withdrawal restrictions.
The capital of a swap dealer, including the capital of any affiliate or subsidiary whose liabilities or obligations are guaranteed, endorsed, or assumed by the swap dealer may not be withdrawn by action of the swap dealer or its equity holders, or by redemption of shares of stock by the swap dealer or by such affiliates or subsidiaries, or through the payment of dividends or any similar distribution, nor may any unsecured advance or loan be made to an equity holder or employee if, after giving effect thereto and to any other such withdrawals, advances, or loans which are scheduled to occur within six months following such withdrawal, advance or loan, the swap dealer's regulatory capital is less than 120 percent of the minimum regulatory capital required under § 23.101 of this part. The equity withdrawal restrictions, however, do not preclude a swap dealer from making required tax payments or from paying reasonable compensation to equity holders. The Commission may, upon application by the swap dealer, grant relief from this paragraph (a) if the Commission deems such relief to be in the public interest.
(b)
Temporary equity withdrawal restrictions by Commission order.
(1) The Commission may by order restrict, for a period of up to twenty business days, any withdrawal by a swap dealer of capital or any unsecured loan or advance to a stockholder, partner, member, employee or affiliate under such terms and conditions as the Commission deems appropriate in the public interest if the Commission, based on the information available, concludes that such withdrawal, loan or advance may be detrimental to the financial integrity of the swap dealer, or may unduly jeopardize the swap dealer's ability to meet its financial obligations to counterparties or to pay other liabilities which may cause a significant impact on the markets or expose the counterparties and creditors of the swap dealer to loss.
(2) An order temporarily prohibiting the withdrawal of capital shall be rescinded if the Commission determines that the restriction on capital withdrawal should not remain in effect. A hearing on an order temporarily prohibiting withdrawal of capital will be held within two business days from the date of the request in writing by the swap dealer.
