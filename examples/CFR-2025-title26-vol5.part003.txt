's pre-change losses would be accounted for separately and limited under section 382 and the pre-change losses of L
2
would be accounted for separately under § 1.382-2(a)(1)(iii) of this section, but would not be limited under section 382. See § 1.382-2(a)(1)(ii) for the treatment of L
2
following the transaction.

# Example 4.
The facts are the same as
Example (2),
except, instead of acquiring L
1
in a merger, L
2
acquires all of the L
1
stock from A on January 1, 1988, solely in exchange for stock representing a 40 percent interest in L
2
, in a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(B). The acquisition of stock by L
2
is an equity structure shift (as well as an owner shift) with respect to L
1
that results in an ownership change with respect to L
1
because the percentage of L
1
stock owned by B immediately after the reorganization (60 percent, by virtue of B's ownership of L
2
, through the operation of the constructive ownership rules of paragraph (h) of this section) increases by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of L
1
stock owned by B at any time during the testing period (0 percent prior to the reorganization). The acquisition also results in an equity structure shift and an owner shift with respect to L
2
, but L
2
incurs no ownership change, because A's stock ownership in L
2
increased by only 40 percentage points over the percentage of L
2
stock owned by A prior to the reorganization (0 percent).

(10)
5-percent owner.
A 5-percent owner is any individual that, at any time during the testing period, owns a five percent or more direct ownership interest in a first tier entity or a higher tier entity. See paragraph (g) of this section for rules to determine whether, as a result of the constructive ownership rules of paragraph (h) of this section, a 5-percent owner is a 5-percent shareholder.

(13)
Public group.
A public group is a group of individuals, entities, or other persons each of whom owns, directly or constructively, less than five percent of the loss corporation. See paragraphs (g) and (j) of this section for the rules applicable to identify public groups and to determine whether a public group is a 5-percent shareholder.
(14)
Higher tier entity.
A higher tier entity is any entity that, at any time during the testing period, owns a five percent or more direct ownership interest in a first tier entity or in any higher tier entity.
(15)

The next lower tier entity with respect to a higher tier entity is any first tier entity or other higher tier entity in which the higher tier entity owns, at any time during the testing period, a five percent or more direct ownership interest.
(18)
Stock
—(i)
In general.
For further guidance, see § 1.382-2(a)(3)(i).
(ii)
Treating stock as not stock.
Any ownership interest that otherwise would be treated as stock under paragraph (f)(18)(i) of this section shall not be treated as stock if—
(A) As of the time of its issuance or transfer to (or by) a 5-percent shareholder, the likely participation of such interest in future corporate growth is disproportionately small when compared to the value of such stock as a proportion of the total value of the outstanding stock of the corporation,
(B) Treating the interest as not constituting stock would result in an ownership change, and
(C) The amount of the pre-change loss (determined as if the testing date were the change and treating the amount of any net unrealized built-in loss as a pre-change loss) is more than twice the amount determined by multiplying
(
1
) the value of the loss corporation (as determined under section 382(e)) on the testing date, by
(
2
) the long-term tax exempt rate (as defined in section 382(f)) for the calendar month in which the testing date occurs.
Stock that is not treated as stock under this paragraph (f)(18)(ii), however, is taken into account for purposes of determining the value of the loss corporation under section 382(e).
(iii)
Treating interests not constituting stock as stock.
Any ownership interest that would not be treated as stock under paragraph (f)(18)(i) of this section (other than an option that is subject to paragraph (h)(4) of this section) shall be treated as constituting stock if—
(A) As of the time of its issuance or transfer to (or by) a 5-percent shareholder (or a person who would be a 5-percent shareholder if the interest not constituting stock were treated as stock), such interest offers a potential significant participation in the growth of the corporation,
(B) Treating the interest as constituting stock would result in an ownership change, and
(C) The amount of the pre-change losses (determined as if the testing date were the change date and treating the amount of any net unrealized built-in loss as a pre-change loss) is more than twice the amount determined by multiplying
(
1
) The value of the loss corporation (as determined under section 382(e)) on the testing date, by
(
2
) The long-term tax exempt rate (as defined in section 382(f)) for the calendar month in which the testing date occurs.
An ownership interest is that treated as stock under this paragraph (f)(18)(iii) is taken into account for purposes of determining the value of the loss corporation under section 382(e). See § 1.382-4(d)(12) for rules that apply with respect to options and this paragraph (f)(18)(iii).
(iv)
Stock of the loss corporation.
The
stock of the loss corporation
means stock of such corporation within the meaning of this paragraph (f)(18) and, as the context may require, includes any indirect ownership interest in the loss corporation.

change date
means the date on which a shift (or any other transaction described in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section) that is the last component of an ownership change occurs.
(20)
Year.
A
year,
or any multiple thereof, means a 365-day period (or a 366-day period in the case of a leap year), or any multiple thereof, unless the year is specifically identified as a taxable year.
(21)
Old section 382.
“Old section 382” means section 382, as in effect prior to the effective date of section 382 in the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (the “Act”), but taking into account section 621(f)(2) of the Act.
(22)
Pre-change loss.
See section 382 and § 1.382-2(a)(2) for the definition of pre-change loss.
(23)
Unrelated.
Any two persons are unrelated if the constructive ownership rules of paragraph (h) of this section do not apply to treat either person as owning stock that is owned, directly or constructively, by the other person.
(24)
Percentage ownership interest.
A person's percentage ownership interest in—
(i) A corporation shall be determined under the rules of this section that are applicable to the determination of a shareholder's percentage stock ownership interest in a loss corporation (see paragraphs (f)(18)(i) through (iii) of this section),
(ii) A partnership shall be equal to the relative fair market value of such person's partnership interest to the total fair market value of all outstanding partnership interests, determined without regard to any limited and preferred partnership interest that is described in paragraph (h)(2)(ii)(C) of this section,
(iii) A trust shall be determined in accordance with the principles of section 318(a)(2)(B) for determining the constructive ownership of stock,
(iv) An estate shall be determined in accordance with the principles of section 318(a)(2)(A) for determining the constructive ownership of stock, and
(v) All other entities shall be determined by reference to the person's relative economic interest in the entity, taking into account all of the relevant facts and circumstances.
(g)
5-percent shareholder
—(1)
In general.
Subject to the rules of paragraphs (k)(2) and (4) of this section, the term
5-percent shareholder
means—
(i) An individual that owns, at any time during the testing period,
(A) A direct ownership interest in the stock of the loss corporation of five percent or more or
(B) An indirect ownership interest in the stock of the loss corporation of five percent or more by virtue of an ownership interest in any one first tier entity or higher tier entity,
(ii) A public group, of either a first tier entity or a higher tier entity, identified as a 5-percent shareholder under paragraph (j)(1)(iv)(A) or (B) of this section,
(iii) A public group of the loss corporation identified as a 5-percent shareholder under paragraph (j)(1)(iv)(C) of this section, and
(iv) A public group, of the loss corporation, a first tier entity or a higher tier entity, identified as a 5-percent shareholder under paragraph (j)(2) or (3) of this section. An individual owning five percent or more of the stock of the loss corporation at any time during the testing period is a 5-percent shareholder notwithstanding that the individual may own less than five percent of the stock of the loss corporation on the testing date. See paragraph (g)(5)(i)(B) of this section for rules permitting a loss corporation to make an adjustment in cases described in the preceding sentence.
(2)
Determination of whether a person is a 5-percent shareholder.
Except as provided in paragraphs (k)(2) and (4) of this section, a person shall be treated as constructively owning stock of the
loss corporation pursuant to paragraph (h)(2) of this section only if the loss corporation stock is attributed to such person in the person's capacity as a higher tier entity or a 5-percent owner of the first tier entity or higher tier entity from which such stock is attributed. See paragraph (k)(3) of this section for rules explaining the extent of the obligation of the loss corporation to determine the identity of its 5-percent shareholders. Nothing in this paragraph (g)(2), however, shall limit the attribution of loss corporation stock under section 318(a)(2) and paragraph (h) of this section to a public owner.
(3)
Determination of the percentage stock ownership interest of a 5-percent shareholder.
Subject to the rules of paragraphs (k)(2) and (4) of this section, in determining a 5-percent shareholder's percentage ownership interest in the loss corporation, the shareholder's direct ownership interest, if any, and each indirect ownership interest that he may have in the loss corporation in his capacity as a 5-percent owner of any one first tier entity or higher tier entity, if any, are required to be added together and taken into account with respect to such shareholder only to the extent that each such direct or indirect ownership interest constitutes five percent or more of the stock of the loss corporation.
(4)
Examples.

# Example 1.
(i) Twenty percent of L stock is owned by A, 10 percent is owned by P
1
, 20 percent is owned by E, a joint venture, and the remaining 50 percent of L stock is owned by Public L. P
1
is owned 15 percent by B and 85 percent by Public P
1
. E is owned 30 percent by P
2
and 70 percent by P
3
, which, in turn, are owned by Public P
2
and Public P
3
, respectively.
(ii) The ownership structure of L is illustrated by the following chart:
EC17OC91.002
(iii) P
1
and E, each of which has a direct ownership interest in L of five percent or more, are first tier entities. The shareholders with direct ownership interests in L who individually own less than five percent of L are public shareholders (Public L). B, who has a direct ownership interest of five percent or more in P
1
, is a 5-percent owner of P. P
2
and P
3
, and P
3
, each of which has a direct ownership interest in a first tier entity (E) of five percent or more, are higher tier entities with respect to L and, because neither entity is owned at any time during the testing period by a higher tier entity, they also are highest tier entities. The shareholders of P
2
and P
3
(Public P
2
and Public P
3
, respectively) are public owners of such entities, because none of those shareholders own five percent or more of either entity at any time during the testing period.
(iv) A, who has a 20 percent direct ownership interest in L, is a 5-percent shareholder of L. Because, by application of the constructive ownership rules of paragraph (h) of this section, B owns only 1.5 percent of L stock in his capacity as a 5-percent owner of P
1
(15 percent ownership of P
1
× 10 percent ownership of L), B is not a 5-percent shareholder of L, even though he is a 5-percent owner of P
1
. Under the rules of paragraph (j) of this section, therefore, B is treated as a member of Public P
1
. See
Example (3)
of paragraph (j)(1)(vi) of this section for a determination of which public owners and public shareholders constitute public groups that are treated as 5-percent shareholders of L.

# Example 2.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example (1),
except that P
3
is owned 60 percent by C, 30 percent by P
4
, and 10 percent by Public P
3
. The stock of P
4
is owned by a group of persons (Public P
4
), none of whom own five percent or more of the stock of P
4
.
(ii) The ownership structure of L is illustrated by the following chart:
EC17OC91.003
(iii) The defined terms are the same as in
Example (1),
except that P
3
is a higher tier entity, not a highest tier entity, because five percent or more of P
3
is, in turn, owned by another entity (P
4
). P
4
, which owns five percent or more of a higher tier entity (P
3
), also is a higher tier entity and, because it is not owned at any time during any testing period by any entity that is also a higher tier entity, P
4
is a highest tier entity. All of the shareholders of P
4
, none of which own a direct ownership interest of five percent or more in P
4
, are public owners of P
4
.
(iv) C is a 5-percent owner of P
3
and, under the constructive ownership rules of paragraph (h) of this section, C indirectly owns 8.4 percent of L ([60 percent ownership of P
3
] × [70 percent ownership of E] × [20 percent ownership of L]), in his capacity as a 5-percent owner of P
3
. B is a 5-percent owner of P
1
and, under the constructive ownership rules of paragraph (h) of his section, B owns 1.5 percent of L ([15 percent ownership of P
1
] × [10 percent ownership of L]) in his capacity as a 5-percent owner of P
1
. Therefore, C is a 5-percent shareholder of L, but B is not a 5-percent shareholder of L, even though he is a 5-percent owner of P
1
. See
Example (4)
of
paragraph (j)(1)(vi) of this section for a determination of which public owners and public shareholders constitute public groups that are treated as separate 5-percent shareholders of L.

# Example 3.
(i) L is owned 30 percent by A and 70 percent by P. A owns six percent of P stock and the balance (94 percent) is owned equally by 500 unrelated shareholders (“Public P”).
(ii) A is a 5-percent shareholder because he directly owns 30 percent of L. Even though A is a 5-percent owner of P, A's 4.2 percent indirect ownership interest in L (six percent ownership interest in P × P's 70 percent ownership of L) is generally not taken into account in determining A's ownership interest, because such indirect ownership interest is less than five percent. Instead, A's 4.2 percent indirect interest is treated under paragraph (j)(1)(iv) of this section as owned by Public P. If, however, L has actual knowledge of A's less-than-five-percent indirect ownership interest in L and is thus subject to paragraph (k)(2) of this section, or paragraph (k)(4) of this section otherwise applies, L must take A's total 34.2 percent ownership interest into account in determining A's percentage ownership in L.

# Example 4.
The facts are the same as in
Example (3),
except that A owns ten percent of P's stock. Because A's indirect ownership interest in L in his capacity as a 5-percent owner of P is five percent or more, both A's 30 percent direct ownership interest in L and his seven percent indirect ownership interest in L (10 percent ownership interest in P × P's 70 percent ownership of L) are taken into account in determining his ownership interest in L, without regard to L's actual knowledge or whether paragraph (k)(4) of this section applies.

# Example 5.
See § 1.382-3(a)(1)(ii) for additional examples with respect to the definition of an entity.
(5)
Stock ownership presumptions in connection with certain acquisitions, and dispositions of loss corporation stock
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of this section—
(A) If an individual owns less than five percent of the stock of a loss corporation during the testing period (excluding the testing date) and acquires an amount of such stock so that the individual becomes a 5-percent shareholder on the testing date, the loss corporation may treat any interest in the loss corporation owned by such individual prior to that acquisition as owned by a public group during the period of such individual's ownership of that interest and as not owned by the 5-percent shareholder during the same period, and
(B) If a 5-percent shareholder's percentage ownership interest in the loss corporation is reduced to less than five percent, the loss corporation may presume that the remaining stock owned by such 5-percent shareholder immediately after such reduction is the stock owned by such shareholder for each subsequent testing date having a testing period that includes the date on which the reduction occurred as long as such shareholder continues to own less than five percent of the stock of the loss corporation. In that event, such ownership interest shall be treated as owned by a separate public group for purposes of the rules of paragraph (j)(2)(vi) of this section.
(ii)
Example.

# Example.
L has 100,000 shares of stock outstanding. All of the L stock is owned equally by 40 unrelated, individual shareholders, including A (who owns 2.5 percent of L stock). Because no person owns as much as five percent of L stock, Public L is the only 5-percent shareholder of L. See paragraph (j)(1) of this section. A purchases 5,000 shares of L stock over a public stock exchange on June 8, 1989. The purchase is an owner shift. When added to his ownership interest before that date (the testing date), A owns 7,500 shares of L stock (7.5 percent). Under paragraph (g)(5)(i)(A) of this section, L may treat A and Public L as having owned 0 percent and 100 percent, respectively, at all times prior to June 8, 1989 (rather than having owned 2.5 percent by A and 97.5 percent by Public L, even if L has actual knowledge of A's less than five percent ownership interest). The increase in A's stock ownership of L as of June 8, 1989 thus would be 7.5 percentage points, rather than 5.0 percentage points, for purposes of determining whether an ownership change occurs on that testing date and any subsequent testing date.
(h)
Constructive ownership of stock
—(1)
In general.
Subject to certain modifications set forth in this section and section 382(l)(3), the constructive ownership rules of section 318(a) generally apply for purposes of determining ownership of loss corporation stock.
(2)
Attribution from corporations, partnerships, estates and trusts
—(i)
In general.
Stock owned (directly or indirectly) by an entity shall be attributed to its owners—
(A) Except as otherwise provided in this section, by treating the stock attributed pursuant to section 318(a)(2) as no longer being owned by the entity from which it is attributed, and
(B) If attribution is from a corporation, without regard to the 50 percent stock ownership limitation contained in section 318(a)(2)(C).
(ii)
Limitation on attribution from entities with respect to certain interests.
Section 318(a)(2) shall not apply to treat the stock of the loss corporation that is owned directly by a first tier entity (or indirectly by any higher tier entity) as being indirectly owned by any person that has an ownership interest in the first tier entity (or any higher tier entity) to the extent that such interest is (or is attributable to)—
(A) Stock of any such entity that is described in section 1504(a)(4),
(B) Any ownership interest in any such entity that does not constitute stock under paragraph (f)(18)(ii) of this section, or
(C) If the entity is not a corporation, any ownership interest in any such entity that has characteristics similar to the interests described in paragraph (h)(2)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section.
The ownership interests described in this paragraph (h)(2)(ii) shall not be taken into account in determining a person's percentage ownership interest in an entity under paragraph (f)(24) of this section.
(iii)
Limitation on attribution from certain entities.
For purposes of this section, except as provided in paragraphs (k)(2) and (4) of this section, each of the following shall be treated as an individual who is unrelated to any other owner (direct or indirect) of the loss corporation—
(A) Any entity other than a higher tier entity that owns five percent or more of the loss corporation stock (determined without regard to paragraph (h)(2)(i)(A) of this section) on a testing date, a first tier entity or the loss corporation,
(B) A qualified trust described in section 401(a),
(C) Any State, any possession of the United States, the District of Columbia, the United States (or any agency or instrumentality thereof), any foreign government, or any political subdivision of any of the foregoing, and
(D) Any other person designated by the Internal Revenue Service in the Internal Revenue Bulletin.
Stock of a loss corporation that is owned by any such person shall thus not be attributed to any other person for purposes of this section. See paragraph (g)(2) of this section limiting attribution from a first tier entity or a higher tier entity to any person that is not a 5-percent owner or a higher tier entity.
(iv)
Examples.

# Example 1.
All the stock of L is owned by A. B and C respectively own 70 and 30 percent of the outstanding P stock. P acquires 60 percent of the outstanding L stock from A on July 1, 1988 (a testing date). After the acquisition, P is a first tier entity and a higher tier entity of L. B and C are each 5-percent owners of P and also are 5-percent shareholders of L having a 42 percent and 18 percent stock ownership interest in L, respectively, through the operation of the constructive ownership rules of paragraph (h) of this section. Because B and C together have increased their ownership in L by more than 50 percentage points during the testing period ending on the testing date (60 percent on the testing date and 0 percent prior thereto), an ownership change occurs with respect to L on July 1, 1988.

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in
Example (1),
except that B and C are not shareholders in a corporation, but instead are partners in a general partnership, E. B and C respectively own 70 percent and 30 percent of E. E acquires 60 percent of the L stock on July 1, 1988. The results are the same as in
Example (1).

# Example 3.
The facts are the same as in
Example (1),
except that the acquisition is accomplished in a transaction that qualifies under section 351(a). In that transaction, HC is formed through (i) a contribution of money by P in exchange for 60 shares of HC common stock and (ii) a contribution of all the outstanding shares of L stock plus cash by A in exchange for 40 shares of HC common stock and 30 shares of HC preferred stock that is described in section 1504(a)(4). The respective values of each share of HC stock, common and preferred, are equal. The stock of L is attributed to A through his interest in HC common stock, but not through his interest in HC preferred stock (see paragraph (h)(2)(ii)(A) of this section). Thus, A is treated as owning indirectly only 40 percent of L. B and C are 5-percent shareholders of L having indirect ownership interests in L of 42 percent and 18 percent, respectively, through their ownership of HC common stock. The
results are therefore the same as in
Example (1).
(3)
Attribution to corporations, partnerships, estates and trusts.
Except as otherwise provided by regulation under section 382 or by the Internal Revenue Service in the Internal Revenue Bulletin, the rules of section 318(a)(3) shall not apply in determining the ownership of stock under this section.
(4)
Option attribution
—(i)
In general.
Solely for the purpose of determining whether there is an ownership change on any testing date, stock of the loss corporation that is subject to an option shall be treated as acquired on any such date, pursuant to an exercise of the option by its owner on that date, if such deemed exercise would result in an ownership change. The preceding sentence shall be applied separately with respect to—
(A) Each class of options (
i.e.,
options with terms that are identical, issued by the same issuer, and issued on the same date) owned by each 5-percent shareholder (or person who would be a 5-percent shareholder if the option were treated as exercised), and
(B) Each 5-percent shareholder, each owner of an option who would be a 5-percent shareholder if the option were treated as exercised, and each combination of such persons.
(ii)
Examples.

# Example 1.
(
i
) A owns all of the 100 shares of outstanding L stock. A grants options for the purchase of his L stock, exercisable for 10 years from the date of issuance, in the following transactions: An option to B for four shares (issued January 1, 1988), an option to C for six shares (issued June 1, 1989), and an option to D for 15 shares (issued July 30, 1989). On July 30, 1990, A sells 41 shares of his L stock to BB.
(
ii
) Pursuant to paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, the date on which each option is acquired is a testing date. The issuance of options to acquire L stock to each of B, C, and D is not treated as an acquisition of the underlying stock on any such testing date since such treatment with respect to any one of the option owners (or any combination thereof) would not have resulted in an ownership change on any of those testing dates.
(
iii
) The date on which BB acquires 41 shares also is a testing date. BB's acquisition of 41 percent of the L stock, taken together with the shift in ownership that would result if the options held by B, C and D were exercised, would result in an ownership change, because the stock owned or treated as owned by Public L (a group including only B, the sole shareholder who owns less than five percent of L stock), C, D and BB would have increased by 66 percentage points (four, six, 15, and 41 percentage points, respectively) during the testing period. Subject to paragraph (h)(4)(ix) of this section, the options are treated as exercised and an ownership change occurs on July 30, 1990, pursuant to paragraph (h)(4)(i) of this section. Accordingly, no new testing period can begin before July 31, 1990. Under paragraph (h)(4)(x)(F) of this section, the option attribution rules of paragraph (h)(4)(i) of this section shall not be applicable with respect to any of the options owned by B, C, and D immediately before the ownership change until such time, if any, that such options are transferred to (or by) 5-percent shareholder (or a person who would be a 5-percent shareholder if such option were exercised). In addition, the subsequent exercise of any of those options by A, B, or C (the persons owning such options immediately before the ownership change) is disregarded. See paragraph (h)(4)(vi) of this section. Also see paragraph (h)(4)(viii) of this section for the treatment of options that lapse or are forfeited.
(
iv
) The facts are the same as in (
i
), except that the sale of A's 41 shares of L stock to BB occurs on July 30, 1995. Because the options are treated as exercised and the related stock is treated as acquired on the July 30, 1995 testing date, the results are the same as described in (
iii
).

# Example 2.
(
i
) A owns all of the outstanding 100 shares of the stock of L. On July 22, 1988, the value of A's stock in L is $500 and the following agreements are entered into: (i) A sells 40 shares of his L stock to B for $200, (ii) in exchange for $10, A grants B an option to acquire the balance of his L stock for $305 at any time before July 22, 1992, and (iii) L grants A an option to acquire 100 shares of L stock at a price of $600 exercisable until such time as B's option is no longer outstanding.
(
ii
) If the stock subject to the options owned by both A and B were treated as acquired on the July 22, 1988 testing date, B would have increased his ownership interest in L by only 50 percentage points to 50 percent ([40 shares purchased + 60 shares acquired pursuant to the option]/200 outstanding shares of L stock, including 100 shares deemed outstanding pursuant to the option issued to A by L) as compared with 0 percent prior to July 22, 1988. In determining whether the options with respect to the stock of L would, if exercised, result in an ownership change, paragraph (h)(4)(i)(B) of this section requires that such options be treated as exercised separately with respect to each 5-percent shareholder, each person who would be a 5-percent shareholder if the option were treated as exercised or each combination of such persons. Therefore, by
treating the option owned by A as not having been exercised and the option owned by B as having been exercised, B's interest in L increases by 100 percentage points during the testing period. An ownership change with respect to L therefore results from the transactions occurring on July 22, 1988.
(iii)
Contingencies.
Except as provided in paragraph (h)(4)(x)(D) of this section, the extent to which an option is contingent or otherwise not currently exercisable shall be disregarded for purposes of this section.
(iv)
Series of options.
For purposes of this section, an option to acquire an option with respect to the stock of the loss corporation, and each one of a series of such options, shall be considered as an option to acquire such stock.
(v)
Interests that are similar to options.
For purposes of this section,
(A) An interest that is similar to an option includes, but is not limited to, a warrant, a convertible debt instrument, an instrument other than debt that is convertible into stock, a put, a stock interest subject to risk of forfeiture, and a contract to acquire or sell stock, and
(B) Any such interest shall be treated as an option.
(vi)
Actual exercise of options
—(A)
In general.
The actual exercise of any option in existence immediately before and after an ownership change, whether or not the option was treated as exercised in connection with the ownership change under paragraph (h)(4)(i) of this section, shall be disregarded for purposes of this section, but only if the option is exercised by the 5-percent shareholder (or person who would have been a 5-percent shareholder if the options owned by such person had been exercised immediately before the ownership change) who owned the option immediately before and after such ownership change.
(B)
Actual exercise within 120 days of deemed exercise.
If the actual exercise of an option occurs on or before the end of the period which is 120 days after the date on which the option is treated as exercised under paragraph (h)(4)(i) of this section, the loss corporation may elect to treat paragraphs (h)(4)(i) and (vi)(A) of this section as not applying to such option and take into account only the acquisition of loss corporation stock resulting from the actual exercise of the option. An election under this paragraph (h)(4)(vi)(B) shall have no effect on the determination of whether an ownership change occurs, but shall apply only for the purpose of determining the date on which the change date occurs. An election under this paragraph (h)(4)(vi)(B) shall be made in the statement described in § 1.382-11(a).
(vii)
Effect of deemed exercise of options on the outstanding stock of the loss corporation
—(A)
Right or obligation to issue stock.
Solely for purposes of determining whether an ownership change has occurred under paragraph (h)(4)(i) of this section, the deemed exercise of an option with respect to unissued stock (or treasury stock) of a corporation shall result in a corresponding increase in the amount of its total outstanding stock.
(B)
Right or obligation to acquire outstanding stock by the loss corporation.
Solely for purposes of determining whether an ownership change has occurred under paragraph (h)(4)(i) of this section, the deemed exercise of a right to transfer outstanding stock to the issuing corporation (or a right of the issuing corporation to acquire its stock) shall result in a corresponding decrease in the amount of its total outstanding stock.
(C)
Effect on value of old loss corporation.
The deemed exercise of an option with respect to unissued stock (or treasury stock) under paragraph (h)(4)(i) of this section shall have no effect on the determination of the value of the old loss corporation and the computation of the section 382 limitation. See section 382(l)(1)(B) disregarding capital contributions made during the two-year period preceding the change date for purposes of computing the section 382 limitation.
(viii)
Options that lapse or are forfeited.
If an option that is treated as exercised under paragraph (h)(4)(i) of this section lapses unexercised or the owner of such option irrevocably forfeits his right to acquire stock pursuant to the option, the option shall be treated for purposes of this section as if it never had been issued. In that case, the loss corporation may file an amended return for prior years (subject to any applicable statute of limitations) if the
section 382 limitation was thus inapplicable. If paragraph (h)(4)(i) of this section applied to an option (or options) with respect to a taxable year for which an income tax return has not been filed by the date that the option (or options) lapses or is irrevocably forfeited, the loss corporation may treat paragraph (h)(4)(i) of this section as inapplicable to such option (or options).
(ix)
Option rule inapplicable if pre-change losses are de minimis.
Paragraph (h)(4)(i) of this section shall not apply to treat the stock of the loss corporation as acquired by the owner of an option if, on a testing date, the amount of pre-change losses (determined as if the testing date were a change date and treating the amount of any net unrealized built-in loss as a pre-change loss) is less than twice the amount determined by multiplying.
(A) The value of the loss corporation (as determined under section 382(e)) on the testing date, by
(B) The long-term tax exempt rate (as defined in section 382(f)) for the calendar month in which the testing date occurs.
(x)
Options not subject to attribution.
Paragraph (h)(4)(i) of this section shall not apply to—
(A)
Long-held options with respect to actively traded stock.
Any option with respect to stock of the loss corporation which stock is actively traded on an established securities market (within the meaning of section 1273(b)) for which market quotations are readily available, if such option has been continuously owned by the same 5-percent shareholder (or a person who would be a 5-percent shareholder if such option were exercised) for at least three years, but only until the earlier of such time as—
(
1
) The option is transferred by or to a 5-percent shareholder (or a person who would be a 5-percent shareholder if such option were exercised), or
(
2
) The fair market value of the stock that is subject to the option exceeds the exercise price for such stock on the testing date. For purposes of this paragraph (h)(4)(x)(A), options with respect to the stock of a loss corporation that are assumed (or substituted) in a reorganization and converted into options with respect to the stock of another party to the reorganization shall not be treated as transferred, provided that there are no changes in the terms of the options, other than that the stock that may be acquired pursuant to the option is that of another party to the reorganization and that the amount of stock subject to the option is adjusted only to reflect the exchange ratio for the exchange of stock of the loss corporation in the reorganization.
(B)
Right to receive or obligation to issue a fixed dollar amount of value of stock upon maturity of certain debt.
Any right to receive or obligation to issue stock pursuant to the terms of a debt instrument that, in economic terms, is equivalent to nonconvertible debt because the right to receive stock of the issuer of a fixed dollar amount is based upon the fair market value for such stock determined at or about the date the stock is transferred pursuant to such right or obligation (
i.e.,
the amount of the stock transferred pursuant to the option is equal to a fixed dollar amount, divided by the value of each share of such stock at or about the date of the stock transfer). This paragraph (h)(4)(x)(B) shall not apply if the method for determining the fair market value of the stock of the issuer is intended to or, in fact, provides the owner of the debt instrument with a participation in any appreciation of any stock of the issuer.
(C)
Right or obligation to redeem stock of the loss corporation.
Any right or obligation of the loss corporation to redeem any of its stock at the time such stock is issued, but only to the extent such stock is issued to persons who are not 5-percent shareholders immediately before the issuance.
(D)
Options exercisable only upon death, disability or mental incompetency.
Any option entered into between owners of the same entity (or an owner and the entity in which the owner has a direct ownership interest) with respect to such owner's ownership interest in the entity that is exercisable only upon the death, complete disability or mental incompetency of such owner.
(E)
Right to receive or obligation to issue stock as interest or dividends.
Any right to receive or obligation to issue stock of a corporation in payment of interest or dividends by the issuing
corporation. (For an example illustrating this exception, see paragraph (j)(2)(iv)(B) of this section.)
(F)
Options outstanding following an ownership change
—(
1
)
In general.
Any option in existence immediately before and after an ownership change, whether or not the option was treated as exercised in connection with the ownership change under paragraph (h)(4)(i) of this section, but only so long as the option continues to be owned by the 5-percent shareholder (or person who was treated as a 5-percent shareholder) who owned the option immediately before and after such ownership change.
(
2
)
Example
(
i
) A, B, C and D own all of the outstanding stock of L. A owns 70 shares of L stock and each of B, C and D own 10 shares of L stock. On July 12, 1988, L issues warrants to each of its shareholders entitling them to acquire an additional 8.5 shares of L stock for each share of stock owned.
(
ii
) If B, C and D, but not A, each exercise their respective rights to acquire an additional 85 shares of L stock (10 shares × 8.5 shares that may be acquired for each share owned) on July 12, 1988, their combined ownership interest in L on that date would exceed 80 percent (255 shares deemed to be acquired + 30 shares actually owned)/355 shares outstanding (actual and deemed)). B, C and D thus would increase their ownership interest in L by 50.3 percentage points during the testing period, causing an ownership change, because, under paragraph (h)(4)(i)(B) of this section, the options are treated as exercised if the exercise would cause an ownership change.
(
iii
) Following the ownership change, paragraph (h)(4)(i) of this section applies to prevent A's right to acquire 595 shares of L stock (70 shares × 8.5 shares that may be acquired for each share owned) or the rights held by B, C, or D, to be treated as exercised on any subsequent testing date, except to the extent that those rights are transferred. To the extent any of those options are transferred following the ownership change, paragraph (h)(4)(i) of this section will apply to any such options on the date of the transfer and on any subsequent testing date.
(G)
Right to acquire loss corporation stock pursuant to a default under a loan agreement.
Any right to acquire stock of a corporation by a bank (as that term is defined in section 581), an insurance company (as that term is defined in § 1.801-3(a)), or a trust qualified under section 401(a) solely as the result of a default under a loan agreement entered into in the ordinary course of the trade or business of such bank, life insurance company or qualified trust.
(H)
Agreement to acquire or sell stock owned by certain shareholders upon retirement.
Any option entered into between noncorporate owners of the same entity (or a noncorporate owner and the entity in which the owner has a direct ownership interest) with respect to such owner's ownership interest in the entity, but only if each of such owners actively participate in the management of the entity's trade or business, the option is issued at a time that the loss corporation is not a loss corporation and the option is exercisable solely upon the retirement of such owner. An option with terms described in both this paragraph (h)(4)(x)(H) and in paragraph (h)(4)(x)(D) of this section shall also not be subject to paragraph (h)(4)(i) of this section.
(I) [Reserved]
(J)
Title 11 or similar case.
See § 1.382-9(o) which excepts certain options created by or under a plan of reorganization in a title 11 or similar case from the operation of paragraph (h)(4)(i) of this section.
(K)-(Y) [Reserved]
(xi)
Certain transfers of options disregarded.
Transfers of options between persons who are not 5-percent shareholders (and between members of separate public groups resulting from the application of the segregation rules of paragraphs (j)(2) and (3)(iii) of this section) are not taken into account. Transfers of options in any of the circumstances described in section 382(l)(3)(B) are also disregarded and the transferee shall be treated as having owned the option for the period that it was owned by the transferor.
(xii)
Exercise of an option that has not been treated as stock.
The acquisition of stock pursuant to the actual exercise of an option (other than an option described in paragraph (h)(4)(vi)(A) of this section) shall not be disregarded.
(xiii)
Effective date.
See paragraph (m)(4)(vi) of this section for special rules regarding the effective date of the provisions of this paragraph (h)(4).
(5)
Stock transferred under certain agreements.
Notwithstanding paragraph (h)(4) of this section, no shift results solely because under section 1058(a)—
(i) A shareholder transfers stock of a corporation pursuant to an agreement that meets the requirements of section 1058(b), or
(ii) A person having rights under such an agreement exchanges those rights for stock identical to the stock transferred pursuant to the agreement.
(6)
Family attribution.
For purposes of this section—
(i) Paragraphs (1) and (5)(B) of section 318(a) shall not apply,
(ii) An individual and all members of his family described in section 318(a)(1) shall be treated as one individual,
(iii) Subject to paragraph (k)(2) of this section, paragraph (h)(6)(ii) of this section shall not apply to members of a family who, without regard to that paragraph (h)(6)(ii), would not be 5-percent shareholders, and
(iv) If under paragraph (h)(6)(ii) of this section, an individual may be treated as a member of more than one family, and each family that is treated as one individual is a 5-percent shareholder (or would be treated as a 5-percent shareholder if such individual were treated as a member of such family), then such individual shall be treated only as a member of the family that results in the smallest increase in the total percentage stock ownership of the 5-percent shareholders on the testing date and shall not be treated as the member of any other family.
(i) [Reserved]
(j)
Aggregation and segregation rules.
For purposes of this section, except as provided in paragraphs (k)(2) and (4) of this section—
(1)
Aggregation of public shareholders and public owners into public groups
—(i)
Public group.
Under this paragraph (j), a loss corporation or other entity can be treated as owned, in whole or in part, by one or more public groups. A public group can include public shareholders, public owners, and 5-percent owners who are not 5-percent shareholders of the loss corporation.
(ii)
Treatment of a public group that is a 5-percent shareholder.
Each public group that is treated as a 5-percent shareholder under paragraph (g)(1)(ii), (iii) or (iv) of this section shall be treated as one individual. See paragraph (j)(2)(iv) for a rule combining certain de minimis public groups.
(iii)
Presumption of no cross-ownership.
The public owners, 5-percent owners who are not 5-percent shareholders and public shareholders in any public group, subject to paragraphs (j)(2)(iii), (k)(2) and (k)(4) of this section, are presumed not to be members of any other public group. It also is presumed that each such person is unrelated to all other shareholders (direct and indirect) of the loss corporation. See paragraph (h)(6)(iii) of this section. The members of a public group that exists by virtue of its direct ownership interest in an entity are presumed not to be members (and not to be related to a member) of any other public group that exists at any time by virtue of its direct ownership interest in any other entity. To the extent that the presumptions adopted in this paragraph (j)(1)(iii) are not applicable because the loss corporation has actual knowledge of facts to the contrary and is thus subject to paragraph (k)(2) of this section, public shareholders, public owners and 5-percent owners who are not 5-percent shareholders may be aggregated into additional public groups.
(iv)
Identification of the public groups treated as 5-percent shareholders
—(A)
Analysis of highest tier entities.
The loss corporation must identify first tier entities and higher tier entities in order to identify any highest tier entities that must be identified under paragraph (k)(3) of this section. The loss corporation must then identify any 5-percent owners of each such highest tier entity who indirectly own, at any time during the testing period, five percent or more of the loss corporation through the ownership interest in such highest tier entity. Under paragraph (g)(1)(i)(B) of this section, any such 5-percent owner is a 5-percent shareholder. See paragraph (k)(3) of this section for rules explaining the extent of the obligation of the loss corporation
to determine the identity of its shareholders. Each person who has an ownership interest in any highest tier entity and who is not treated as a 5-percent shareholder (
i.e.,
persons who are public owners or 5-percent owners who are not 5-percent shareholders) is a member of the public group of that highest tier entity. A public group, so identified, that indirectly owns five percent or more of the loss corporation on the testing date is treated under paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section as a 5-percent shareholder. If the public group so identified owns less than five percent of the loss corporation on the testing date, such public group is treated as part of the public group of the next lower tier entity.
(B)
Analysis of other higher tier entities and first tier entities.
The analysis and aggregation of public groups described in paragraph (j)(1)(iv)(A) of this section is repeated for any next lower tier entity and successively for any next lower tier entity of any entity described in this paragraph (j)(1)(iv)(B) until applied to each first tier entity.
(C)
Aggregation of the public shareholders.
The public shareholders are aggregated and, under paragraph (g)(1)(iii) of this section, are treated as a public group that is a 5-percent shareholder without regard to whether such group, at any time during the testing period, owns five percent or more of the loss corporation. For this purpose, if the public group of any first tier entity indirectly owns less than five percent of the loss corporation on the testing date, and is thus not treated as a 5-percent shareholder, but is treated as part of the public group of the loss corporation under paragraph (j)(1)(iv)(A) or (B) of this section, the ownership interest of that group is included in the public group of the loss corporation referred to in the preceding sentence.
(v)
Appropriate adjustments.
A loss corporation may apply the principles of paragraph (g)(5) of this section with respect to—
(A) Any public group that is treated as a 5-percent shareholder on the testing date if such public group, at any time during the testing period, was treated as part of the public group of the next lower tier entity, or
(B) Any public group that is treated as part of the public group of a next lower tier entity if such public group, at any time during the testing period, was part of the public group of a higher tier entity that was treated as a 5-percent shareholder and had a direct or indirect ownership interest in such lower tier entity.
(vi)
Examples.

# Example 1.
(i) All of the stock of L is owned by 1,000 shareholders, none of whom own as much as five percent of L stock (“Public L”). All of the stock of P is owned by 150,000 shareholders, none of whom own as much as five percent of P stock (“Public P”). Between July 12, 1988 and August 13, 1988, P purchases all of the L stock through a series of transactions on the public stock exchange. P's percentage of direct stock ownership in L increases from 4.9 percent to five percent on July 15, 1988, and from 50 percent to 51 percent on July 30, 1988.
(ii) Before July 15, 1988, P is a public shareholder of L. On and after July 15, 1988, P is a first tier entity (and a highest tier entity) of L. Accordingly, under the rules of paragraph (j)(1) of this section, Public P, on and after July 15, 1988, is treated as a public group that is a 5-percent shareholder. Each acquisition by P on and after such date affects the percentage of L stock that is owned by Public P and thus constitutes an owner shift.
(iii) Immediately after the transaction on July 30, 1988, P owns 51 percent of L stock. Under paragraph (j)(1)(iv)(A) of this section, Public P thus owns 51 percent of L. Under paragraph (j)(1)(iv)(C) of this section, Public L, the public group that includes the public shareholders of L, is treated as a 5-percent shareholder that owns 49 percent of L. Under paragraph (j)(1)(iii) of this section, Public L and Public P are presumed not to have any common members and it is also presumed that no member of either public group is related to any other member of either of the two public groups.
(iv) Assuming that the presumption provided in paragraph (j)(1)(iii) of this section (
i.e.,
that no person owns stock in both P and L) is not rebutted to any extent, Public P is treated as a 5-percent shareholder whose stock ownership in L, as of the July 30, 1988 testing date, has increased by 51 percentage points over its lowest percentage of stock ownership in L at any time during the testing period (0 percent prior to July 12, 1988). Accordingly, an ownership change with respect to L occurs as a result of P's acquisition on July 30, 1988. L is thus a new loss corporation and its pre-change losses are subject to limitation under section 382.

# Example 2.
(i) All of the stock of P is owned by 1,000 unrelated shareholders, none of
whom owns as much as five percent of P stock. L
1
is a wholly owned subsidiary of P. On January 2, 1988, P distributes all of the L
1
stock pro rata to its shareholders.
(ii) Prior to the stock distribution, the public owners of P are members of a public group (“Public P”) that is treated as a 5-percent shareholder owning 100 percent of the stock of L
1
.
See paragraph (j)(1)(iv)(A) of this section. Following the stock distribution to the P shareholders, L
1
is owned by 1,000 public shareholders that are members of a public group (“Public L
1
”) that is treated as a 5-percent shareholder owning 100 percent of the stock of L
1
. See paragraph (j)(1)(iv)(C) of this section.
(iii) Public P and Public L
1
are treated as unrelated, individual 5-percent shareholders under paragraph (j)(1)(iii) of this section. Although the members of one public group are presumed not to be members of any other public group under paragraph (j)(1)(iii) of this section, L
1
has actual knowledge that all of its public shareholders immediately following the distribution (Public L
1
) received L
1
stock pro rata in respect to the outstanding P stock and thus were also members of Public P. Applying paragraph (k)(2) of this section, the loss corporation may take into account the identity of ownership interests between Public L
1
and Public P to establish that Public L
1
did not increase its percentage ownership in L
1
. Accordingly, the transaction would not constitute an owner shift.

# Example 3.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 1
of paragraph (g)(4) of this section. Thus, 20 percent of L stock is owned by A, 10 percent is owned by P
1
, 20 percent is owned by E, a joint venture, and the remaining 50 percent of L stock is owned by Public L. P
1
is owned 15 percent by B and 85 percent by Public P
1
. E is owned 30 percent by P
2
and 70 percent by P
3
, which are owned by Public P
2
and Public P
3
, respectively. See
Example (1)(ii)
of paragraph (g)(4) of this section for a chart illustrating this ownership structure.
(ii) The public owners of P
2
and P
3
(Public P
2
and Public P
3
, respectively), are public groups that are treated as 5-percent shareholders of L, because each such public group indirectly owns five percent or more of L stock (six percent by Public P
2
[(30 percent ownership of E) × (20 percent ownership of L)] and 14 percent by Public P
3
[(70 percent ownership of E) × (20 percent ownership of L)]). The public owners of P
1
(“Public P
1
”), who indirectly own 8.5 percent of L stock [(85 percent ownership of P
1
) × (10 percent ownership of L)] and B, who indirectly owns 1.5 percent of L and is thus included in Public P
1
under paragraph (j)(1)(iv)(A) of this section, are members of a public group that is treated as a 5-percent shareholder of L that owns ten percent of L stock. Finally, the public group of L (“Public L”) is a 5-percent shareholder that owns 50 percent of L. Accordingly, A, Public L, Public P
1
(including B), Public P
2
, and Public P
3
are the only 5-percent shareholders of L.

# Example 4.
(i) The facts are the same as
Example 3
above, except that P
3
is owned 60 percent by C, 30 percent by P
4
, and 10 percent by P
3
. The stock of P
4
is publicly traded and is owned by Public P
4
. The facts are thus the same as in
Example (2)
in paragraph (g)(4) of this section. See
Example (2)(ii)
of paragraph (g)(4) of this section for a chart illustrating this ownership structure.
(ii) The public owners of P
4
(a highest tier entity) are members of a public group that indirectly owns 4.2 percent of L ([30 percent ownership of P
3
] × [70 percent ownership of E] × [20 percent ownership of L]). For purposes of identifying public groups that are 5-.percent shareholders, L is not required to identify P
4
as a highest tier entity under paragraph (k)(3) of this section because P
4
does not own five percent or more of L stock. Moreover, under paragraph (h)(2)(iii) of this section, P
4
generally is treated as an individual from which there is no attribution of loss corporation stock. The public group of P
3
(including P
4
) indirectly owns 5.6 percent of L ([40 percent of P
3
] × [70 percent ownership of E] × [20 percent of L]), and is thus a 5-percent shareholder of L. The public groups of P
2
and P
1
(both Public P
1
and B), respectively, also own five percent or more of L stock and are thus 5-percent shareholders of L. In addition, the public group of L is a 5-percent shareholder regardless of whether it owns five percent of L stock. Accordingly, A, Public L, Public P
3
(including P
4
), Public P
2
, and Public P
1
(including B), are the only 5-percent shareholders of L.

# Example 5(i)
On September 4, 1987, L is owned 14 percent by each of A and B, 30 percent by each of P
1
and P
2
, four percent by each of C and P
3
, and two percent by each of D and AA. P
1
is owned 30 percent by each of A, B, and P
4
and 10 percent by D. P
2
is owned 70 percent by A, 10 percent by each of B and D, six percent by DD and four percent by C. AA owns 100 percent of the stock of P
3
. P
4
is owned 60 percent by C and 20 percent by each of BB and CC.
(ii) The ownership structure of L is illustrated by the following chart:
EC17OC91.004
(iii) In order to identify L's 5-percent shareholders and their respective ownership interests in L on September 4, 1987, the rules of paragraph (j)(1) of this section apply to identify the public groups that are treated as separate 5-percent shareholders. Analysis begins with any highest tier entity, such as P
4
. Each of P
4
's shareholders is a 5-percent owner of P
4
. C
4
owns 5.4 percent of L in his capacity as a 5-percent owner of P
4
and therefore is a 5-percent shareholder. Notwithstanding that C actually owns, directly and by attribution, 10.6 percent of L (four percent directly, 5.4 percent indirectly through P
4
, and 1.2 percent through P
2
), C's ownership interest in L as a 5-percent shareholder is presumed to include only the 5.4 percent indirect ownership through P
4
. (Under paragraphs (g) and (k)(2) of this section, however, L must account for C's direct and indirect ownership interests in determining whether an ownership change occurs on any testing date if it has actual knowledge of such ownership on or before the date that its income tax return is filed for the taxable year that includes the testing date). Although BB and CC are each 5-percent owners of P
4
, they are not 5-percent shareholders and therefore are members of the public group of P
4
. Because the public group of P
4
indirectly owns only 3.6 percent of L, it is treated under paragraph (j)(1)(iv)(A) of this section as part of the public group of the next lower tier entity, P
1
.
(iv) With respect to P
1
, a first tier entity, each of its shareholders are 5-percent owners. Because A and B each indirectly own nine percent of L as 5-percent owners of P
1
and A indirectly owns 21 percent of L as a 5-percent owner of P
2
, they are each 5-percent shareholders without regard to their direct
ownership interests in L. A's ownership interest in L as a 5-percent shareholder is 44 percent (14 percent directly, nine percent in his capacity as a 5-percent owner of P
1
, and 21 percent in his capacity as a 5-percent owner of P
2
). B's ownership interest in L as a 5-percent shareholder is 23 percent (14 percent directly and nine percent in his capacity as a 5-percent and nine percent in his capacity as a 5-percent owner of P
1
). B's ownership interest as a 5-percent shareholder does not include the three percent interest he owns indirectly through P
2
. (Under paragraphs (g) and (k)(2) of this section, however, L must account for B's direct and indirect ownership interests, including his three percent interest through P
2
, in determining whether an ownership change occurs on any testing date if L has actual knowledge of such ownership on or before the date that its income tax return is filed for the taxable year that includes the testing date.) D is a 5-percent owner of P
1
. Although D owns eight percent of L (two percent directly, three percent indirectly through P
1
, and three percent indirectly through P
2
), he is not a 5-percent shareholder because he does not own five percent or more of L stock either directly or in his capacity as a 5-percent owner of either P
1
or P
2
. (Under paragraphs (g) and (k)(2) of this section, however, L must account for D's direct and indirect ownership interests in determining whether an ownership change occurs on any testing date to the extent L has actual knowledge of such ownership amounting to five percent or more of L stock before the date that its income tax return is filed for the taxable year that includes the testing date.) The public group of P
1
(comprised of the public group of P
4
and D's direct ownership interest in P
1
) has a 6.6 percent interest in L and is therefore treated as a separate 5-percent shareholder.
(v) With respect to highest tier entity P
2
, D is a 5-percent owner who is not a 5-percent shareholder for the reason described in the preceding subdivision. DD is a 5-percent owner of P
2
, who is not a 5-percent shareholder, because DD indirectly owns only 1.8 percent of L. Assuming that L does not have actual knowledge of B's and C's direct ownership interest in P
2
, those interests are accounted for in computing the ownership interest are accounted for in computing the ownership interest of the public group of P
2
. Therefore, each of P
2
's shareholders, except A who is a 5-percent shareholder in his capacity as a 5-percent owner of P
2
, are treated as members of the public group of P
2
that owns nine percent of L and is thus treated as a separate 5-percent shareholder.
(vi) Because the direct ownership interest of P
3
is less than five percent, it is a public shareholder. Therefore, assuming that L does not have actual knowledge of C's, D's, or AA's direct and/or indirect ownership interests in L, the public group of L is a separate 5-percent shareholder owning 12 percent of L (comprised of the direct ownership interests of C, D, AA and P
3
).

Segregation rules applicable to transactions involving the loss corporation
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of this section, if—
(A) A transaction is described in paragraph (j)(2)(iii) of this section, and
(B) The loss corporation has one or more direct public groups immediately before and after the transaction,
the stock owned by such direct public group or groups is subject to the segregation rules described in paragraph (j)(2)(iii) of this section for purposes of determining whether an ownership change has occurred on the date of the transaction (and on any subsequent testing date with a testing period that includes the date of such transaction). See paragraph (j)(3) of this section for the application of the rules of this paragraph (j)(2) to transactions involving first tier entities or higher tier entities.
(ii)
Direct public group.
For purposes of this section, a direct public group is any public group of the loss corporation described in paragraph (j)(1)(iv)(C) of this section or any public group of the loss corporation resulting from the application of paragraph (j)(2)(iii) or (j)(3)(i) of this section.
(iii)
Transactions to which segregation rules apply
—(A)
In general.
The segregation rules of this paragraph (j)(2)(iii) apply to any transaction described in paragraph (j)(2)(iii)(B), (C), (D), (E), or (F) of this section in the manner specified. The presumptions adopted by this paragraph (j)(2)(iii) shall not apply only if, and to the extent that, the loss corporation either has actual knowledge of facts to the contrary regarding its stock ownership and is thus subject to paragraph (k)(2) of this section, or is subject to paragraph (k)(4) of this section. Any direct public group that is required to be identified as a result of a transaction described in paragraph (j)(2)(iii) of this section shall be treated as a 5-percent shareholder under paragraph (g)(1)(iv) of this section without regard to whether such group, at any time during the testing period, owns five percent or more of the loss corporation stock. To the extent that the presumptions are rebutted, the public
shareholders, public owners and 5-percent owners who are not 5-percent shareholders may be aggregated into additional public groups. For an exception applicable to certain regulated investment companies, see § 1.382-3(k)(1).
(B)
Certain equity structure shifts and transactions to which section 1032 applies
—(
1
)
In general.
In the case of—
(
i
) A transaction that is an equity structure shift that also is described in section 381(a)(2) and in which the loss corporation is a party to the reorganization, or
(
ii
) A transfer of the stock of the loss corporation (including treasury stock) by the loss corporation in any other transaction to which section 1032 applies,
each direct public group that exists immediately after such transaction shall be segregated so that each direct public group that existed immediately before the transaction is treated separately from the direct public group that acquires stock of the loss corporation in the transaction. The direct public group that acquires stock of the loss corporation in the transaction is presumed not to include any members of any direct public group that existed immediately before the transaction. For purposes of this paragraph (j)(2)(iii)(B), a person is treated as acquiring stock of the loss corporation in a reorganization as the result of the person's ownership interest in another corporation that succeeds to the loss corporation's pre-change losses (determined as if the testing date were the change date and treating the amount of any net unrealized built-in loss as a pre-change loss) in a transaction to which section 381(a)(2) applies. In determining whether a transaction is described in section 1032 for purposes of this paragraph (j)(2)(iii)(B), the transfer by the loss corporation of any interest not constituting stock that is treated as stock under paragraph (f)(18)(iii) of this section shall be treated as the transfer of stock. See § 1.382-3(j) for exceptions to the segregation rules of this paragraph (j)(2)(iii)(B)(
1
).
(

)
Examples.

# Example 1.
(i) P
1
owns 60 percent of the stock of L. The remaining L stock (40 percent) is owned by Public L. A owns 40 percent of the P
1
stock. The remaining P
1
stock (60 percent) is owned by Public P
1
. P
2
is a publicly traded corporation owned by shareholders who each own less than five percent of P
2
stock (Public P
2
).
(ii) On May 22, 1988, L merges into P
2
in a transaction described in section 368(a)(1)(A), with the shareholders of L receiving an amount of P
2
stock equal to 70 percent of the value of P
2
immediately after the reorganization.
(iii) Immediately before the merger, L's 5-percent shareholders were Public L (40 percent), Public P
1
(36 percent), and A (24 percent). Although the shareholders of P
2
(immediately before the merger) do not acquire any stock in the merger, they are treated as acquiring a direct ownership interest in the loss corporation in the reorganization because P
2
succeeds to the pre-change losses of L in a transaction to which section 381(a)(2) applies. As a result of the merger, which constitutes a transaction described in (j)(2)(iii)(B)(
1
) of this section, L's direct public group, Public L, must be segregated from the direct public group that would otherwise exist after the transaction (Public L and Public P
2
). Public L, the direct public group that exists before the merger, has a continuing 28 percent interest in the loss corporation [70 percent of P
2
shares received in the merger × 40 percent shares of L owned prior to the merger] that must be segregated from the interests acquired by Public P
2
.
(iv) In addition, Public P
1
, which owns five percent or more of the stock of P
2
through P
1
's ownership interest in P
2
, also is segregated from any other public group (
i.e.,
both Public L and Public P
2
) under paragraph (j)(1) of this section. Therefore, under paragraphs (j)(1) and (2) of this section, Public P
2
(excluding the members of Public L and Public P
1
immediately before the merger) is treated as a separate public group and 5-percent shareholder.
(v) The only 5-percent shareholder whose interest in the loss corporation, P
2
, has increased during the testing period is Public P
2
. Its interest has increased by 30 percentage points. Accordingly, no ownership change results from the merger. For purposes of measuring the shift in ownership of P
2
on any subsequent testing date with a testing period that includes May 22, 1988 (the date on which L merged into P
2
), Public P
2
will continue to be treated as a direct public group, separate from Public L (the members of which own P
2
stock as a result of the merger) and Public P
1
.

# Example 2.
(i) P and L are each owned by 21 equal shareholders. Each of 14 of the shareholders of P and L are owners of both corporations (“common owners”). L has actual knowledge of this cross ownership. therefore, as a group, these persons own 66
2/3
percent of each of P and L. P stock has a value of $600 and L stock has a value of $400.
(ii) P merges into L under section 368(a)(1)(A) on June 10, 1988. Ordinarily, the direct public group of L that exists immediately before the transaction would be segregated from the direct public group that acquires stock in the merger (the public group of P immediately before the merger). In view of the common ownership of P and L, however, a third group may be created under paragraph (j)(2)(iii)(A) of this section so that L's owners following the merger would be: The common owners (66
2/3
percent), Public L, less the common owners, 13
1/3
percent), and Public P, less the common owners (20 percent). Accordingly, the only 5-percent shareholder increasing its ownership interest by 20 percentage points and no ownership change occurs as a result of the merger.

# Example 3.
(i) L is entirely owned by Public L. L commences and completes a public offering of common stock on January 22, 1988, with the result that its outstanding stock increases from 100,000 shares to 300,000 shares. No person owns as much as five percent of L stock following the public offering.
(ii) The public offering of L stock is a transaction to which section 1032 applies. Immediately before the public offering, L's only 5-percent shareholder was Public L, a direct public group. Therefore, Public L (as in existence immediately before the transaction) must be segregated from the direct public group that would otherwise exist immediately after the transaction. Under paragraph (j)(2)(iii)(B)(
1
) of this section, the acquisition of 200,000 shares of L stock in the public offering must be treated as acquired by a direct public group (“New Public L”) that is separate from Public L. Each such public group is treated as an individual that is a separate 5-percent shareholder. See paragraphs (g)(1)(iv) and (j)(1)(ii) of this section.
(iii) As a result of the public offering, L has two 5-percent shareholders, Public L and New Public L, which own 33
1/3
percent and 66
2/3
percent of the stock of L, respectively. Because the members of New Public L are presumed not to be members of Public L (and not to be related to any such members), the ownership interest of New Public L immediately prior to the offering of stock was 0 percent.
(iv) New Public L is a 5-percent shareholder that has increased its ownership interest in L by more than 50 percentage points during the testing period (by 66
2/3
percentage points). Thus, there is an ownership change with respect to L. For purposes of subsequent transactions, Public L and New Public L will not be segregated into two public groups because a new testing period commences on the day following the change date, January 23, 1988 (
i.e.,
any subsequent testing date will not have a testing period that includes the date of the public offering).

# Example 4.
The facts are the same as in
Example 3,
but L establishes that 60,000 shares of the newly issued L stock were acquired by its shareholders of record on the date of the stock issuance (
i.e.,
members of Public L, referred to as Acquiring Public L) by persons owning 27 percent of the L stock immediately before the stock issuance. Accordingly, L has actual knowledge that New Public L acquired no more than 140,000 shares of L stock in the public offering. Under paragraphs (j)(2)(iii) and (k)(2) of this section, New Public L may be treated as having increased its ownership interest in L by 46
2/3
percentage points (140,000 shares acquired in the offering/300,000 shares outstanding). L also has actual knowledge that the members of Public L owning 27 percent of L stock immediately before the stock issuance (27,000 shares/100,000 shares outstanding) own 29 percent of L stock immediately after such issuance ([27,000 shares + 60,000 shares acquired in the offering]/300,000 shares outstanding). Assuming that L chooses to take its actual knowledge into account for purposes of determining whether an ownership change occurred on January 22, 1988, Public L is segregated into two direct public groups immediately before the stock issuance so that the two percentage point increase in the ownership interest in L by Acquiring Public L is taken into account. The total increased ownership interest in L by New Public L and Acquiring Public L on the testing date over their lowest ownership interest during the testing period is 48
2/3
percent. Thus, no ownership change occurs with respect to L.

# Example 5.
(i) L is owned entirely by 10,000 unrelated individuals, none of whom own as much as five percent of L stock (“Public L”). P is owned entirely by 1,500 unrelated individuals, none of whom own as much as five percent of P stock (“Public P”). On December 22, 1988, L acquires all of the P stock from Public P in exchange for L stock representing 25 percent of the value of L, in a transaction described in section 368(a)(1)(B).
(ii) Under paragraph (j)(2)(iii)(B)(
1
) of this section, Public L, the direct public group that owns L stock immediately before and after the transaction to which section 1032 applies, is treated separately from Public P, the direct public group that acquires L stock in the transaction. Because Public P's percentage ownership interest in L increases to only 25 percent (as compared with 0 percent before the acquisition), no ownership change occurs. For purposes of determining whether an ownership change occurs on any testing date with a testing period that includes December 22, 1988, Public L and Public P will continue to be treated as separate 5-percent shareholders.
(iii) See
Example (4)
in paragraph (j)(3)(iv) of this section for the application of paragraph (j)(2)(iii)(B) of this section to a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(B) in which the loss corporation is acquired.
(C)
Redemption-type transactions
—(
1
)
In general.
In the case of a transaction in which the loss corporation acquires its stock in exchange for property, each direct public group that exists immediately before the transaction shall be segregated at that time (and thereafter) so that the stock that is acquired in the transaction is treated as owned by a separate public group from each public group that owns the stock that is not acquired. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term property shall include stock described in section 1504(a)(4) and stock described in paragraph (f)(18)(ii) of this section. Each direct public group that owned the stock that is acquired in the transaction is presumed not to own any such stock immediately after the transaction.
(

)
Examples.

# Example 1.
L is entirely owned by Public L. There are 500,000 shares of L stock outstanding. On July 12, 1988, L acquires 150,000 shares of its stock for cash. Because L's acquisition is a redemption, Public L is segregated into two different public groups immediately before the transaction (and thereafter) so that the redeemed interests (“Public RL”) are treated as part of a public group that is separate from the ownership interests that are not redeemed (“Public CL”). Therefore, as a result of the redemption, Public CL's interest in L increases by 30 percentage points (from 70 percent (350,000/500,000) to 100 percent) on the July 12, 1988 testing date. Because the resulting increase is not more than 50 percentage points, no ownership change occurs. For purposes of determining whether an ownership change occurs on any subsequent testing date having a testing period that includes such redemption, Public CL is treated as a 5-percent shareholder whose percentage ownership interests in L increased by 30 percentage points as a result of the redemption.

# Example 2.
L is entirely owned by Public L. There are 250,000 shares of L common stock outstanding. On April 22, 1988, L acquires 100,000 shares of its outstanding common stock in exchange for 100,000 shares of preferred stock described in section 1504(a)(4). (The transaction thus constitutes a recapitalization within the meaning of section 368(a)(1)(E).) As a result of the recapitalization, which is a transaction described in paragraph (j)(2)(iii)(C) of this section, Public L is segregated into two different public groups immediately before the transaction (and thereafter) so that the stock acquired by L is treated as owned by a public group (“Public RL”) that is separate from the public group that owns the stock that is not so acquired (“Public CL”). Therefore, as a result of the transaction, Public CL's interest in L increases by 40 percentage points (from 60 percent to 100 percent). Because the resulting increase is not more than 50 percentage points, no ownership change occurs. For purposes of determining whether an ownership change occurs on any subsequent testing date with a testing period that includes the date of the recapitalization, Public CL is treated as a separate 5-percent shareholder whose percentage ownership interest increased by 40 percentage points as a result of the redemption type transaction.
(D)
Acquisition of loss corporation stock as the result of the ownership of a right to acquire stock—(1
)
In general.
In the case of a deemed acquisition of stock of the loss corporation as the result of the ownership of a right issued by the loss corporation to acquire such stock (see paragraph (h)(4) of this section), each direct public group that exists immediately after such acquisition shall be segregated so that each direct public group that existed immediately before the transaction is treated separately from the direct public group that is deemed to acquire stock of the loss corporation as a result of the ownership of the right to acquire such stock. The direct public group that is treated as acquiring stock of the loss corporation in the transaction is presumed not to include any members of any direct public group that existed immediately before the transaction. In applying the rules of paragraph (h)(4) of this section, the segregation rules of this paragraph (j)(2)(iii)(D) shall apply before making the determination required under that paragraph (h)(4) of this section. See § 1.382-3(j)(9) for rules relating to this paragraph (j)(2)(iii)(D).

Example.

# Example.
(i) L has 700,000 shares of common stock outstanding. Public L owns all of the outstanding L common stock. On May 20, 1988, L issues a class of debentures to the public that, in the aggregate, may be converted into 300,000 shares of L common stock. On September 7, 1988, P
1
acquires 210,000 shares of L common stock over a public stock exchange. None of the L debentures have been converted as of that date.
(ii) By virtue of L's issuance of convertible debentures, May 20, 1988 is a testing date. See paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section. Immediately before the issuance of the convertible debentures, L's only 5-percent shareholder
was Public L, a direct public group. Therefore, under paragraph (j)(2)(iii)(D) of this section, Public L must be segregated from the direct public group that would otherwise exist immediately after the transaction for the purpose of applying paragraph (h)(4) of this section, so that any acquisition of L stock through the conversion of L's debentures is treated as made by a public group other than Public L (“New Public L”). Assuming the largest increase in the total percentage stock ownership of New Public L on the testing date (see paragraph (h)(4) of this section), New Public L would have increased its ownership interest in L by 30 percentage points. Therefore, the stock of L would not be treated as acquired pursuant to a deemed conversion of the L debentures on May 20, 1988, under paragraph (h)(4) of this section, because the conversion would not cause an ownership change.
(iii) P
1
's acquisition of L common stock results in second testing date. For the purpose of applying paragraph (h)(4) of this section, Public L must again be segregated from the direct public group that would otherwise result from conversion of the debentures, so that a deemed acquisition of L stock through the conversion of L's debentures on September 7, 1988 is treated as made by a public group other than Public L (“New Public L”). As on the previous testing date, New Public L would have increased its ownership interest in L by 30 percentage points if it were treated as having acquired L common stock pursuant to the conversion of the L debentures. The increase in New Public L's ownership, taken together with P
1
's 21 percentage point ownership increase in L during the testing period [210,000 shares deemed converted/(700,000 (actual) + 300,000 (deemed) shares outstanding)], results in an ownership change.
(E)
Transactions identified in the Internal Revenue Bulletin.
Any transaction that is designated by the International Revenue Service in the Internal Revenue Bulletin shall be subject to the rules, as provided in such bulletin, similar to the rules described in this paragraph (j)(2)(iii).
(F)
Issuance of rights to acquire loss corporation stock
—(
1
)
In general.
In the case of any transaction that is described in paragraph (j)(2)(iii)(B), (D) or (E) of this section in which the loss corporation issues rights to acquire its stock to the members of more than one public group, those rights shall be presumed to be exercised pro rata by each such public group as those rights are actually exercised. See § 1.382-3(j)(10) for an exception to the application of the rule of this paragraph (j)(2)(iii)(F)(
1
) to stock issued on the exercise of a transferable option.
(
2
)
Example.

# Example.
(i) L, which has six million shares outstanding, is owned entirely by Public L and P is owned entirely by Public P. On November 30, 1988, P merges into L in a transaction qualifying under section 368(a)(1)(A) with Public P receiving four million shares of L stock as a result of the reorganization. Under paragraph (j)(2)(iii)(B) of this section, Public L and Public P continue to be treated as separate public groups following the merger. Pursuant to the plan of reorganization, L also issues an amount of warrants in L stock pro rata to Public L and Public P that, if exercised, would result in the issuance of an additional two million shares of L stock. On November 30, 1989, when only one-half of the outstanding warrants have been exercised, A acquires all of the unexercised warrants.
(ii) Without regard to the warrants distributed in reorganization, Public P's ownership interest in L increases by 40 percentage points on November 30, 1988, relative to its lowest ownership interest in L at any time during the testing period (0 percent prior to the merger). For purposes of determining whether an ownership change occurs on November 30, 1988, the segregation rules of paragraphs (j)(2)(iii)(B) and (D) of this section does not require that a third direct public group be separately identified and treated as acquiring the warrants, because L has actual knowledge that Public L and Public P acquired the distributed warrants in proportion to their respective ownership interests in L stock. Because the largest increase in the ownership of L on the testing date results from treating only Public P as exercising the distributing warrants, in which event, its ownership interest would increase by 44.4 percentage points ([four million shares acquired in the merger + 800,000 shares deemed acquired]/10.8 million (actual and deemed) shares outstanding), the issuance of the warrants by L does not cause an ownership change on November 30, 1988.
(iii) Under paragraph (j)(2)(iii)(F)(
1
) of this section, each actual exercise of warrants to acquire one million shares of L stock between November 30, 1988 and November 30, 1989 is treated as made pro rata by Public L and Public P (600,000 shares to Public L and 400,000 shares to Public P). Accordingly, as a result of the actual exercises of warrants during that period the ownership interests of the only 5-percent shareholders, Public L and Public P, are proportionately increased.
(iv) A's acquisition of the all of the outstanding warrants on November 30, 1989 requires the determination whether there has been an ownership change with respect to L, because A would be 5-percent shareholder
under paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section owning 8
1/3
percent of the L stock if the acquired warrants were exercised (one million shares deemed acquired/12 million (actual and deemed) shares outstanding). See paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section. Under paragraph (h)(4)(i) of this section, A is not treated as having exercised those warrants, because an ownership change would not results. (Public P's 36
2/3
percentage point increase [(four million shares acquired in the merger + 400,000 shares deemed acquired)/12 million (actual and deemed) shares outstanding] and A's 8
1/3
percentage point increase is not greater than 50 percentage points).
(iv)
Combination of de minimis public groups
—(A)
In general.
Notwithstanding paragraph (j)(2)(iii)(A) of this section, any public group first identified during a taxable year, as a result of any transaction described in paragraph (j)(2)(iii)(B), (D), (E), or (F) of this section, that owns less than five percent of loss corporation stock may be combined, at the option of the loss corporation, with any other such groups also first identified as a result of any such transaction that occurs during such taxable year.
(B)
Example.

# Example.
(i) L is widely held with no person owning as much as five percent of the L stock at any time (“Public L”). L's taxable year ends on December 31. On January 1, 1989, L issues a class of debt maturing on December 31, 2019 (“Class A Debentures”) with respect to which it will semi-annually issue L stock in discharge of its interest obligation. In addition, L issues an amount of L stock to the public in two separate transactions during 1989. As a percentage of the L stock outstanding at the close of L's taxable year on December 31, 1989, L issued .45 percent of its stock on each of two dates in payment of interest with respect to the Class A Debentures, 4.5 percent of its stock in the first stock offering and six percent of its stock in the second stock offering. During 1990, L did not issue stock other than in payment of interest with respect to the Class A Debentures. As a percentage of L stock outstanding on December 31, 1990, L issued .41 percent of its stock on each of two dates during 1990 with respect to its outstanding debt.
(ii) Under paragraph (h)(4)(x)(E) of this section, L's obligation to issue stock in satisfaction of the interest with respect to the Class A Debentures until December 31, 2019, is not subject to paragraph (h)(4)(i) of this section and thus is taken into account only as such stock is issued.
(iii) The application of the segregation rules of paragraphs (j)(2)(iii)(B) and (iv) of this section require the identification of at least two additional, separate direct public groups during 1989. First, the persons who acquire six percent of L stock in a public offering to which section 1032 applies must be treated as a separate 5-percent shareholder (“Public 1L”). See paragraph (j)(2)(iii)(B) of this section. Even though this group was first identified in 1989, it may not be combined with other public groups also first identified in 1989 because it owns five percent or more of L stock. Second, although each of the three other issuances of L stock during the year ordinarily result in the identification of an additional, separate direct public group, each such direct public group may be combined with the two other such groups into a single public group (“Public 2L”). As of the end of 1989, Public 2L would own a total of 5.4 percent of the stock of L.
(iv) The application of the segregation rules of paragraphs (j)(2)(iii)(B) and (iv) of this section require the identification of at least one additional, direct public group during 1990. Because each additional, direct public group first identified in 1990 acquires less than five percent of L stock, they may be combined into a single public group (“Public 3L”) owning .82 percent of the stock of L. Public 3L is treated as a five percent shareholder even though it owns less than five percent of the stock of L. See paragraph (j)(2)(iv)(A) of this section.
(v)
Multiple transactions
—(A)
In general.
If a transaction (or any part thereof) is described by more than one subdivision of paragraph (j)(2)(iii) of this section, each such subdivision shall apply to the transaction (or each part of the transaction) in the manner that results in the largest increase in the percentage stock ownership by the 5-percent shareholders.
(B)
Example.

# Example.
(i) All of the common stock of L is owned by 1,000 unrelated persons, none of whom owns as much as five percent of the L stock (“Public CL”). L has outstanding a class of preferred stock described in section 1504(a)(4) that is owned in equal amounts by 500 unrelated persons (“Public PL”).
(ii) On September 4, 1988, L rearranges its capital structure by redeeming 70 percent of the common stock owned by 700 of the shareholders in exchange for cash. In addition, all of the preferred stock is exchanged for a new class of common stock (nonvoting) representing 40 percent of the value of L.
(iii) With respect to the part of the transaction that is treated as a redemption under paragraph (j)(2)(iii)(C) of this section (the exchange of common stock for cash), Public CL is segregated into two different public groups immediately before the transaction (and
thereafter) so that the owners of the redeemed stock (“Public RCL”) are treated as part of a public group that is separate from the public group comprised of the owners of the stock that is not redeemed (“Public CCL”). As a result of the redemption, Public CCL's percentage ownership interest in L thus increases by 30 percentage points from 30 percent to 60 percent (taking into account all transactions occurring on the testing date, because the change in ownership is measured under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section by reference to each 5-percent shareholder's ownership interest immediately after the testing date). In addition, the exchange of preferred stock for nonvoting common stock is a transaction to which section 1032 applies. Under paragraph (j)(2)(v) of this section, the part of the transaction to which section 1032 applies is also subject to the segregation rules in the manner specified in paragraph (j)(2)(iii)(B) of this section. Accordingly, Public PL, the direct public group that acquires L nonvoting common stock in exchange for L preferred stock, must be treated as a separate public group from the other direct public groups, Public CCL and Public RCL. As a separate public group, Public PL's percentage stock ownership in L increases by 40 points (as compared to 0 percent prior to the transaction).
(iv) In summary, Public CCL increases its percentage ownership in L by 30 percentage points and Public PL increases its percentage ownership by 40 percentage points. Consequently, an ownership change occurs with respect to L on September 4, 1988.
(vi)
Acquisitions made by either a 5-percent shareholder or the loss corporation following application of the segregation rules.
Unless a different proportion is established by either the loss corporation or the Internal Revenue Service, the acquisition of loss corporation stock by either a 5-percent shareholder or the loss corporation on any date on which more than one public group of the loss corporation exists by virtue of the application of the rules of this paragraph (j)(2) shall be treated as being made proportionately from each public group existing immediately before such acquisition. See paragraph (g)(5)(i)(B) of this section for the application of this paragraph to the ownership interest of a 5-percent shareholder that owns less than five percent of the stock of the loss corporation on the testing date.
(3)
Segregation rules applicable to transactions involving first tier entities or higher tier entities
—(i)
Dispositions.
If a loss corporation is owned, in whole or in part, by a public group (or groups), the rules of paragraphs (j)(2)(iii)(B) and (iv) of this section shall apply to any transaction in which a first tier entity or an individual that owns a direct ownership interest in the loss corporation of five percent or more transfers a direct ownership interest in the loss corporation to public shareholders. Therefore, each direct public group that exists immediately after such a disposition shall be segregated so that the ownership interests of each public group that existed immediately before the transaction are treated separately from the public group that acquires stock of the loss corporation as a result of the disposition by the individual or first tier entity. The principles of this paragraph (j)(3)(i) shall also apply to transactions in which an ownership interest in a higher tier entity that owns five percent or more of the loss corporation (determined without regard to the application of paragraph (h)(2)(i)(A) of this section) or a first tier entity is transferred to a public owner or 5-percent owner who is not a 5-percent shareholder.
(ii)
Example.

# Example.
(A) L is owned equally by Public L, P and E. Public L consists of 150 equal, unrelated shareholders. P is owned by Public P, a group consisting of 1,500 equal, unrelated shareholders. E is a partnership and none of its partners are 5-percent owners. On October 22, 1988, E sells its entire interest in L over a public stock exchange. No individual or entity acquires as much as five percent of L's stock as the result of E's disposition of the L stock.
(B) The disposition of the L stock by E is a transaction that causes the segregation of L's direct public group that exists immediately before the transaction (Public L) from the direct public group that acquires L stock in the transaction (Public EL). As a result, L has three 5-percent shareholders, Public L, Public P (through the application of paragraph (j)(1) of this section) and Public EL, each of which owns 33
1/3
percent of L stock. Therefore, Public EL is a 5-percent shareholder that has increased its ownership interest in L by 33
1/3
percentage points during the testing period. For purposes of subsequent transactions, Public L and Public EL will continue to be treated as separate direct public groups until any subsequent testing date that does not have a testing period that includes E's disposition of L stock.
(iii)
Other transactions affecting direct public groups of a first tier entity or higher tier entity.
The rules of paragraphs (j)(2)(i), (iii), (iv) and (v) of this section shall apply to transactions described in such paragraphs that involve either a higher tier entity that owns five percent or more of the loss corporation (determined without regard to the application of paragraph (h)(2)(i)(A) of this section) or a first tier entity. In applying those rules for purposes of this paragraph (j)(3)(iii), each direct public group of a first tier entity or a higher tier entity is any public group of any such entity identified in paragraph (j)(1)(iv)(A) or (B) of this section or resulting from the application of this paragraph (j)(3)(iii). The principles of paragraph (j)(2)(iii)(C) of this section also shall apply to any transaction that has the effect of a redemption-type transaction (e.g., an acquisition by the loss corporation of stock in a first tier entity).
(iv)
Examples.

# Example 1.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1
of paragraph (j)(2)(iii)(B)(
2
) of this section, except that Public L and P
1
own 40 percent and 60 percent, respectively, of the stock of HC which, in turn, owns 100 percent of L and HC merges into P
2
. Under paragraph (j)(3)(iii) of this section, the rules of paragraph (j)(2)(iii)(B) of this section apply to segregate HC's direct public group (Public L) immediately before the merger from the direct public group (Public P
2
) that acquires loss corporation stock in the merger. The consequences of the merger of HC into P
2
are thus the same as in
Example (1)
of paragraph (j)(2)(iii)(B)(
2
) of this section.

# Example 2.
(i) Twenty-five individual shareholders each own four percent of L (“Public L”). Public L is therefore the only 5-percent shareholder of L. Each of the shareholders of L contribute their L stock to a newly formed corporation, HC. In exchange for their contribution of L stock, HC issues 100 percent of each of its two classes of common stock (voting and nonvoting).
(ii) The formation of HC, a first tier entity of L, is a transaction to which section 1032 applies. Under paragraph (j)(3)(iii) of this section, the rules of paragraphs (j)(1)(iii) and (j)(2)(iii)(B) of this section are applied to this transaction with the result that the shareholders of HC, immediately after the issuance of HC stock, are presumed not to include any persons that previously had a direct or indirect ownership interest in L. The presumption underlying those rules, however, is rebutted by establishing that all of the HC stock outstanding immediately after the transaction was issued solely in exchange for L stock. Thus, Public HC (immediately after the transaction) and Public L (immediately before the transaction) would be treated owned by the same direct public group.

# Example 3.
(i) All of the stock of L is owned by unrelated shareholders, none of whom owns as much as five percent of L stock. P also is owned by unrelated shareholders, none of whom owns as much as five percent of P stock. On November 22, 1988, P incorporates P
1
with a contribution of P stock. Immediately thereafter, P
1
acquires all of the properties of L in exchange for its P stock in a forward triangular merger qualifying under sections 368 (a)(1)(A) and (a)(2)(D). The P stock transferred by P
1
equals 45 percent of the total outstanding P stock.
(ii) Immediately before the merger of L into P
1
, P's only 5-percent shareholder was Public P, a direct public group of P. The rules of paragraph (j)(2)(iii)(B) of this section thus apply to the transaction under paragraph (j)(3)(i) of this section since P, a first tier entity, is a party to the reorganization described in such paragraph. Although Public P does not acquire any stock in the merger, it is treated as acquiring stock in the loss corporation, P
1
, because such corporation succeeds to the pre-change losses of L in a transaction to which 381(a) applies. As a result of the merger, Public P, the direct public group of P that exists immediately before the merger, must be segregated from the direct public groups acquiring P stock in the reorganization. Public P is, therefore, treated as acquiring 55 percent of the outstanding stock of the loss corporation, P
1
, in the transaction. The transaction, therefore, results in an ownership change for P
1
.

# Example 4.
(i) L is owned 20 percent by A and 80 percent by 1,000 unrelated individuals and entities, none of whom owns as much as five percent of L stock (“Public L”). P is owned 10 percent by B, 40 percent by E, and 50 percent by 5,000 unrelated individuals, none of whom owns as much as five percent of P stock (“Public P”). E is owned 30 percent by C and 70 percent by 30 unrelated individuals, none of whom owns as much as five percent of E (“Public E”).
(ii) On October 31, 1987, P acquires all of the L stock from A and Public L in exchange for P stock representing 20 percent of the value of P (determined immediately after the acquisition) in a transaction described in section 368(a)(1)(B). After the acquisition, P is owned eight percent by B, 32 percent by E, four percent by A, and 56 percent by 6,000 unrelated individuals, none of whom owns as much as five percent of P. Because L is wholly owned by P immediately after the acquisition, L, under paragraph (j)(1) of this section, is treated as owned as follows: Eight percent by B, 9.6 percent by C (through C's ownership
interest in E, a highest tier entity, and E's ownership interest in P, a first tier entity), 22.4 percent by Public E (through its ownership interest in E and E's ownership interest in P), four percent by A, and 56 percent by the shareholders who each own less than five percent of L through their ownership interest in P.
(iii) Under paragraph (j)(3)(iii) of this section, the rules of paragraph (j)(2)(iii)(B) of this section apply to the reorganization since the transaction involved a first tier entity of L. Thus, the direct public group of P that exists immediately after the transaction must be segregated into two public groups—the direct public group of P that existed immediately before the acquisition (Public P) is treated separately from the direct public group consisting of the persons who acquire P stock in the transaction (Public L). Accordingly, immediately after the reorganization, Public P and Public L own 40 percent and 16 percent of L, respectively. See paragraph (h) of this section. (Under paragraph (g)(5)(ii)(B) of this section, L may treat the four percent of L stock owned by A immediately after the reorganization as the amount of L stock owned by A for each subsequent testing date having a testing period that includes the reorganization.)
(iv) In summary, after applying the rules of paragraphs (j)(1) and (3) of this section, L is treated as owned as follows:
5-percent shareholder
Percentage ownership interest
A
4.0
B
8.0
C
9.6
Public E
22.4
Public P
40.0
Public L
16.0
(
v
) The reorganization results in an ownership change, because B, C, Public E and Public P, all of whom are 5-percent shareholders, together have increased their percentage ownership in L by 80 percentage points as compared to their lowest percentage ownership in L at any time during the testing period (0 percent prior to the acquisition).
(v)
Acquisitions made by a 5-percent shareholder, a higher tier entity, or a first tier entity following application of the segregation rules.
The rules of paragraph (j)(2)(vi) of this section shall apply to the acquisition of an ownership interest in a first tier entity (or higher tier entity) if more than one direct public group of any such entity are segregated under the rules of this paragraph (j)(3). Accordingly, an acquisition by such an entity or a 5-percent shareholder of any ownership interest in such an entity shall be treated as made proportionately from the direct public groups resulting from the application of this paragraph (j)(3).
(k)
Operating rules
—(1)
Presumptions regarding stock ownership.
Subject to paragraphs (k)(2) and (4) of this section, for purposes of applying paragraphs (f), (g), (h), and (j)(1) of this section—
(i)
Stock subject to regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
With respect to loss corporation stock that is described in Rule 13d-1(d) of Regulation 13D-G (or any rule or regulation to generally the same effect), promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (“registered stock”), a loss corporation may rely on the existence and absence of filings of Schedules 13D and 13G (or any similar schedules) as of any date to identify all of the corporation's shareholders who have a direct ownership interest of five percent or more (both individuals and first tier entities) on such date. A loss corporation may similarly rely on the existence and absence of such filings as of any date with respect to registered stock of any first tier entity or any higher tier entity to identify the 5-percent owners of any such entities on such date who indirectly own five percent or more of the loss corporation stock, and are thus 5-percent shareholders, and to identify any higher tier entities of such entities.
(ii)
Statements under penalties of perjury.
A loss corporation may rely on a statement, signed under penalties of perjury, by an officer, director, partner, trustee, executor or similar responsible person, on behalf of a first tier entity or a higher tier entity to establish the extent, if any, to which the ownership interests of any 5-percent owners or higher tier entities with respect to such entities have changed during a testing period. A loss corporation may not rely on such a statement (A) that it knows to be false or (B) that is made by either a first tier entity or higher tier entity that owns 50 percent or more of the stock of the loss corporation. For purposes of the preceding sentence, any first tier entities and higher tier entities that are known by the loss corporation to be members of
the same controlled group (within the meaning of section 267(f)) shall be treated as one corporation.
(2)
Actual knowledge regarding stock ownership.
For purposes of this section (other than paragraphs (g)(5) and (j)(1)(v) of this section), to the extent that the loss corporation has actual knowledge of stock ownership on any testing date (or acquires such knowledge before the date that the income tax return is filed for the taxable year in which the testing date occurs) by—
(i) An individual who would be a 5-percent shareholder, but for the application of paragraphs (h)(2)(iii), (h)(6)(iii) or (g)(2) of this section, or
(ii) A 5-percent shareholder that would be taken into account, but for paragraphs (h)(2)(iii), (h)(6)(iii) or (g)(3) of this section,
the loss corporation must take such stock ownership into account for purposes of determining whether an ownership change has occurred on that testing date. If a loss corporation acquires such knowledge after such income tax return is filed, the loss corporation may take such ownership into account for purposes of determining whether an ownership change occurred on that testing date and, if appropriate, file an amended income tax return (subject to any applicable statute of limitations). To the extent the loss corporation has actual knowledge on or after any testing date regarding the ownership interest in the loss corporation by members of one public group (described in paragraphs (g)(1)(ii), (iii) or (iv) of this section) and the ownership interest of those members in the loss corporation as members in another such public group, the loss corporation may take such ownership into account for purposes of determining whether an ownership change occurred on that testing date.
(3)
Duty to inquire as to actual stock ownership in the loss corporation.
For purposes of this section, the loss corporation is required to determine the stock ownership on each testing date (and, except as otherwise provided in this section, the changes in the stock ownership during the testing period) of—
(i) Any individual shareholder who has a direct ownership interest of five percent or more in the loss corporation,
(ii) Any first tier entity,
(iii) Any higher tier entity that has an indirect ownership interest of five percent or more in the loss corporation (determined without regard to paragraph (h)(2)(i)(A) of this section), and
(iv) Any 5-percent owner who indirectly owns five percent or more of the stock of the loss corporation in his capacity as a 5-percent owner in any one first tier entity or higher tier entity.
The loss corporation does not have any obligation to inquire or to determine facts relating to the stock ownership of any shareholders other than those described in the preceding sentence. In addition, the loss corporation does not have any obligation to inquire or to determine if the actual facts relating to the stock ownership of any shareholder are consistent with the ownership interests of the loss corporation as determined by applying the presumptions and other rules of paragraphs (g), (h), (j) or (k)(1) of this section.
(4)
Ownership interest structured to avoid the section 382 limitation.
For purposes of this section, if the ownership interests in a loss corporation are structured by a person with a direct or indirect ownership interest in the loss corporation to avoid treating a person as a 5-percent shareholder (or to permit the loss corporation to rely on the presumption provided in paragraph (g)(5)(i)(B) of this section) for a principal purpose of circumventing the section 382 limitation, then—
(i) Paragraph (h)(2)(iii) of this section shall not apply with respect to the ownership interests so structured and the constructive ownership rules of paragraph (h)(2)(i) of this section shall thus apply to attribute stock from any entity without regard to the amount of stock it owns in the loss corporation or any other corporation,
(ii) Paragraphs (g)(2) and (3) of this section shall be modified with respect to the ownership interests so structured so that the ownership interest of a person includes all of an individual's direct and indirect ownership in the loss corporation, without regard to whether each such interest represents five percent or more of the stock of the loss corporation, and
(iii) Paragraph (g)(5)(i)(B) of this section shall not apply with respect to the ownership interests so structured so that the ownership interest of a person takes into account his actual ownership interest in the loss corporation.
This paragraph (k)(4) shall apply, however, only if application would result in an ownership change.
(5)
Example.

# Example.
L is owned by 25 individuals who each own four percent of the outstanding L stock. A purchases 40 percent of L stock from such shareholders on August 13, 1988. Thereafter, B plans to acquire 15 percent of the L stock. B is advised concerning the potential application of section 382 to L. On February 1, 1989, B acquires a 15 percent interest in L pursuant to a program in which each of four corporations, P
1
through P
4
, each of which is wholly-owned by B, acquire a 3.75 percent interest in L. A principal purpose of acquiring the L stock through four corporations is to avoid treating B as owning any ownership interest in L amounting to as much as five percent, and thus to circumvent the section 382 limitation by avoiding an ownership change. Under paragraph (k)(4) of this section, the limitation on the constructive ownership rules of paragraph (h)(2)(iii) of this section are disregarded and B is treated as a 5-percent shareholder owning 15 percent of the stock of L by virtue of his ownership interests in P
1
through P
4
, notwithstanding paragraph (g)(2) of this section. Accordingly, an ownership change occurs with respect to L.
(6)
First tier entity or higher tier entity that is a foreign corporation or entity.
[Reserved]
(l)
Changes in percentage ownership which are attributable to fluctuations in value.
[Reserved]
(m)
Effective date
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in this paragraph (m), section 382 shall apply to any ownership change that occurs immediately after an owner shift or an equity structure shift that occurs after December 31, 1986, or any other event occurring after such date that requires the determination of whether an ownership change has occurred under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section. In the case of an equity structure shift (including an equity structure shift that also constitutes an owner shift), any equity structure shift completed pursuant to a plan of reorganization adopted before January 1, 1987, shall be treated as occurring on the date such plan was adopted. Therefore, section 382 shall apply to any ownership change occurring immediately after—
(i) An owner shift (excluding an owner shift that also constitutes an equity structure shift) that occurs on or after January 1, 1987,
(ii) An equity structure shift that occurs after December 31, 1986, if it is completed pursuant to a plan of reorganization adopted on or after January 1, 1987, or
(iii) Any transfer or issuance of an option, or other interest that is similar to an option, that occurs on or after January l, 1987 and that is taken into account under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section.
With respect to equity structure shifts completed pursuant to plans adopted before January 1, 1987, section 382 shall be inapplicable only if the equity structure shift that is treated as occurring on the date the plan of reorganization for such shift was adopted (or other event occurring after the adoption of such plan) results in an ownership change before January 1, 1987. In that event, a new testing period for the loss corporation shall begin on the day after such ownership change.
(2)
Plan of reorganization.
For purposes of paragraph (m)(1) of this section, a plan of reorganization shall be treated as adopted on the earlier of—
(i) The first date that the boards of directors of all the parties to the reorganization have adopted the plan or have recommended adoption to their shareholders, or
(ii) The date the shareholders approve such reorganization.
If there is an ownership change with respect to a subsidiary as the result of a reorganization of the parent, the treatment of the subsidiary under this paragraph (m)(2) shall be governed by the classification of the parent-level transaction. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a corporation shall be treated as a subsidiary of another corporation only if the other corporation owns stock in that corporation meeting the requirements of section 1504(a)(2).
(3)
Earliest commencement of the testing period.
For purposes of determining if an ownership change has occurred at any time after May 5, 1986, the testing
period shall begin no earlier than May 6, 1986. Under paragraph (d)(4) of this section, therefore, shifts in the ownership of stock of the loss corporation prior to May 6, 1986 are disregarded.
(4)
Transitional rules
—(i)
Rules provided in paragraph (j) of this section for testing dates before September 4, 1987.
For purposes of determining whether an ownership change occurs for any testing date before September 4, 1987.
(A) The rules of paragraph (j)(1) of this section shall apply only to stock of the loss corporation acquired after May 5, 1986, by any first tier entity or higher tier entity and shall not apply to any stock acquired by such an entity on or before that date,
(B) The rules of paragraph (j)(2) of this section shall apply only to equity structure shifts in which more than one corporation is a party to the reorganization and shall not apply to any other transactions, and
(C) The rules of paragraph (j)(3) of this section shall apply only to—
(
1
) Dispositions of stock acquired by an individual, a first tier entity or higher tier entity after May 5, 1986 (and shall not apply to dispositions of stock acquired on or before such date), and
(
2
) Equity structure shifts in which more than one corporation is a party to the reorganization (and shall not apply to any other transactions).
For any testing date before September 4, 1987, however, the loss corporation is permitted to apply all of the rules of paragraph (j) of this section. A loss corporation that applies the rules of paragraph (j) of this section under the preceding sentence must apply all of the rules of such paragraph in determining whether any ownership change occurs on any testing dates after May 5, 1986.
(ii)
Example.

# Example.
(i) L is owned entirely by 10,000 unrelated individuals, none of whom owns as much as five percent of the stock of L (“Public L”). P is owned entirely by 1,000 unrelated individuals, none of whom owns as much as five percent of the stock of P (“Public P”).
(ii) Between March 1, 1987 and June 1, 1987, P acquires 45 percent of L stock in a series of transactions. On June 15, 1987, L redeems 20 percent of the L stock from Public L.
(iii) Under paragraph (m)(4)(i)(A) of this section, the rules of paragraph (j)(1) of this section apply to the acquisitions made by P, because they occurred after May 5, 1986. Accordingly, following those acquisitions, the stock of L is owned 45 percent by Public P and 55 percent by Public L. Because the increase in the percentage ownership by Public P as a result of P's stock purchases is not more than 50 percent, no ownership change occurs as the result of P's purchases.
(iv) On or after September 4, 1987, the rules of paragraph (j)(2)(iii)(C) of this section apply to treat any L stock that is redeemed as owned by a public group that is separate from the public group owning the stock that is not redeemed. (Under paragraph (j)(2)(iii)(C) of this section, the continuing shareholders of Public L, who owned 35 percent of the stock of L before the redemption ([55 percent—20 percent]/100 percent) increase their ownership interest in L by 8.8 percentage points as a result of such redemption (43.8 percent—35 percent)). Those rules, however, do not apply to the June 15, 1987 redemption because it occurs before the date that paragraph (j)(2)(iii) of this section generally is effective. (Until September 4, 1987, paragraph (j)(2)(iii) of this section generally is effective only for equity structure shifts in which more than one corporation is a party to the reorganization.) Solely because of the application of paragraph (j)(1) of this section to P's acquisitions of L stock, Public P's ownership interest in L as a result of the redemption has increased from 45 percentage points to 56.2 percentage points which, compared to its lowest percentage ownership interest at any time during the testing period (0 percent prior to March 1, 1987), is a more than 50 percentage point increase thus causing an ownership change with respect to L on June 15, 1987.
(iii)
Rules provided in paragraph (j) of this section for testing dates on or after September 4, 1987.
For purposes of determining whether an ownership change occurs for any testing date on or after September 4, 1987, the rules of paragraphs (j)(2) and (3) of this section shall not apply to identify any public group resulting from—
(A) Any transaction described in such paragraphs (j)(2) and (3), unless that transaction is also described in paragraph (m)(4)(i)(B) or (C) of this section, or
(B) Any disposition of stock acquired on or before May 5, 1986, but only if such disposition or other transaction occurs before September 4, 1987. Thus, for example, the rules of paragraph (j)(2)(iii)(D) of this section shall apply only to rights to acquire stock of the loss corporation issued on or after such date.
(iv)
Rules provided in paragraphs (f)(18)(ii) and (iii) of this section.
For purposes of determining whether an ownership change occurs for any testing date, the rules of paragraphs (f)(18)(ii) and (iii) of this section apply only to stock (or any other ownership interest) that is—
(A) Issued on or after September 4, 1987, or
(B) Transferred to (or by) a person who is a 5-percent shareholder (or would be a 5-percent shareholder if paragraph (f)(18)(iii) of this section were applicable) on or after September 4, 1987.
(v)
Rules provided in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section.
The information statement required under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section is not required to be filed with respect to any taxable year for which the due date (including extensions) of the income tax return of the loss corporation is on or before October 5, 1987.
(vi)
Rules provided in paragraph (h)(4) of this section.
The rules provided in paragraph (h)(4) of this section do not apply on any testing date on or after November 5, 1992. The rule provided in paragraph (h)(4)(viii) of this section applies to the lapse or forfeiture of any option treated as exercised under paragraph (h)(4)(i) of this section. If an option is treated as exercised under paragraph (h)(4)(i) of this section, and the option is actually exercised on a day that is within 120 days after the date on which the option is treated as exercised, the rule provided in paragraph (h)(4)(vi)(B) of this section applies (even if the actual exercise of the option occurs on a date on which the rules of paragraph (h)(4) of this section would not otherwise apply). Thus, in such a case, the loss corporation may elect to treat paragraphs (h)(4)(i) and (vi)(A) of this section as not applying to the option and take into account only the acquisition of loss corporation stock resulting from the actual exercise of the option.
(vii)
Rules provided in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section.
The rules provided in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section apply to determine whether dates prior to November 5, 1992, are testing dates. For rules regarding the determination of whether dates on or after November 5, 1992, are testing dates, see § 1.382-2(a)(4).
(5)
Bankruptcy proceedings
—(i)
In general.
In the case of a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(G) or an exchange of debt for stock in a title 11 or similar case (within the meaning of section 368(a)(3)), section 382 shall not apply to any ownership change resulting from such a reorganization or proceeding if a petition in such case was filed with the court before August 14, 1986. Accordingly, any shift in ownership in the loss corporation arising out of such reorganization or proceeding shall not be taken into account for purposes of determining whether an ownership change occurs on any testing date that occurs after December 31, 1986.
(ii)
Example.

# Example.
(i) L filed a petition in bankruptcy on September 29, 1985. As a result of a title 11 bankruptcy reorganization of L that is confirmed by a court on February 2, 1988, there is a shift in the ownership of L so that JK increased her interest in L by 24 percentage points relative to her lowest ownership interest in L during the testing period. JK is the only 5-percent shareholder of L following the reorganization whose interest in L increased as a result of the transaction. On December 25, 1988, GK purchases 42 percent of the outstanding stock of L from shareholders other than JK.
(ii) There is no ownership change on December 25, 1988 because the 24 percentage point increase in JK's ownership interest in L is not taken into account under paragraph (m)(6)(i) of this section.
(iii) The facts are the same as in (i), except that the acquisitions by JK and GK occurred on August 5, 1986 and September 26, 1986, respectively. Because paragraph (m)(6)(i) of this section is only applicable with respect to the determination of whether an ownership change has occurred on any testing date that occurs after December 31, 1986, there is an ownership change as a result of GK's acquisition on September 26, 1986. Accordingly, section 382 is inapplicable to such ownership change under paragraph (m)(1) of this section because it occurred prior to January 1, 1987. Under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the testing period for determining whether an ownership change occurs on any subsequent testing date shall commence no earlier than September 27, 1986.
(6)
Transactions of domestic building and loan associations.
The rules of paragraph (j)(2)(iii)(B) of this section (and the application of those rules by virtue
of paragraph (j)(3) of this section) shall not apply to a public offering of stock by a domestic building and loan association described in section 591 (or any corporation that owns stock in the association meeting the requirements of section 1504(a)(2)) prior to January 1, 1989. In the case of any transaction described in the preceding sentence, any transitory ownership of stock by any entity that is an underwriter shall be disregarded so that the rules of paragraph (j)(1) of this section shall not apply to treat such stock as owned by the owners of the underwriter and thus the rules of paragraph (j)(3)(i) of this section shall not apply to the disposition of such stock by the underwriter. For purposes of this paragraph (m)(7)—
(i) Ownership shall be considered transitory only with respect to an underwriter acquiring stock in a firm commitment underwriting to the extent the stock is disposed of pursuant to the offer (but in no event later than sixty (60) days after the initial offering) and,
(ii) To the extent a transaction may be described both by paragraph (j)(2)(iii)(B) of this section and any other provision of paragraph (j)(2)(iii) or (3) of this section, paragraph (j)(2)(v)(A) of this section shall not apply and the transaction shall be treated as described solely by paragraph (j)(2)(iii)(B) of this section.
(7)
Transactions not subject to section 382
—(i)
Application of old section 382.
Old section 382 shall not apply to a loss corporation on or after the date on which an ownership change occurs, but only if such ownership change results in the application of the section 382 limitation (as defined in section 382(b)) with respect to the loss corporation.
(ii)
Effect on testing period.
The application of old section 382 to a transaction is disregarded for purposes of paragraph (d)(2) of this section unless the transaction that results in such application is the last component of an ownership change after May 5, 1986 that is not subject to section 382 under the effective date rules of this paragraph (m) (
e.g.,
an ownership change occurring as the result of an individual's purchase of more than 50 percent of L stock on any date on or before December 31, 1986).
(iii)
Termination of old section 382.
[Reserved]
(8)
Options issued or transferred before January 1, 1987
—(i)
Options issued before May 6, 1986.
An option issued before May 6, 1986, is subject to the rules of paragraph (h)(4) of this section only if it is transferred by (or to) a 5-percent shareholder (or a person who would be a 5-percent shareholder if the option were treated as exercised) on or after such date. In all other cases, such an option shall not be subject to paragraph (h)(4)(i) of this section, but shall be subject to paragraph (h)(4)(xii) of this section. Thus, for example, a warrant to acquire stock of the loss corporation issued before May 6, 1986 shall not be subject to paragraph (h)(4) of this section unless the warrant is transferred by (or to) a 5-percent shareholder. The exercise of such a warrant, however, would be taken into account as required by this paragraph (m)(8)(i) and paragraph (h)(4)(xii) of this section.
(ii)
Options issued on or after May 6, 1986 and before September 18, 1986.
An option issued or transferred on or after May 6, 1986, and before September 18, 1986, is subject to the rules of paragraph (h)(4) of this section.
(iii)
Options issued on or after September 18, 1986 and before January 1, 1987.
An option issued or transferred on or after September 18, 1986, and before January 1, 1987, is subject to the rules of paragraph (h)(4) of this section, except that the option shall be treated for purposes of this section as if it never had been issued in the event that either—
(A) The option lapses unexercised or is irrevocably forfeited by the holder thereof, or
(B) On the date the option was issued, there was no significant likelihood that such option would be exercised within the five-year period from the date of such issuance and a purpose for the issuance of the option was to cause an ownership change prior to January 1, 1987.
(9)
Examples.
The rules of this paragraph (m) may be illustrated by the following examples.

# Example 1.
(i) A owns all 100 outstanding shares of L stock. A sells 11 shares to B on January 1, 1986. The January 1, 1986 testing
date is disregarded under paragraph (m)(3) of this section. A sells another 40 shares to B on January 1, 1988. B's second stock purchase is an owner shift that does not result in an ownership change. B's percentage ownership interest on the testing date (51 percent) is only 40 percentage points greater than the lowest percentage of L stock owned by B at any time during the testing period (11 percent on and after May 6, 1986).
(ii) The facts are the same as in (i). In addition A sells 20 shares of his L stock to C on July 1, 1990. C's stock purchase is an owner shift. Because B and C together have increased their respective ownership interests in L by 40 and 20 percentage points relative to their lowest percentage stock ownership interests in L at any time during the testing period, C's purchase causes an ownership change. The testing period for any subsequent ownership change begins on the first day following C's acquisition, July 2, 1990.

# Example 2.
(i) C has owned 100 percent of L since March 22, 1980. On October 13, 1986, P merges into L. As a result of the merger, 40 percent of L stock is acquired by A, the sole shareholder of P. The merger of P into L is both an equity structure shift and an owner shift. The transaction, however, is not an ownership change with respect to L, because A's percentage ownership interest has increased by only 40 percentage points. On August 22, 1987, B purchases 15 percent of the L stock from C. B's purchase constitutes an owner shift resulting in an ownership change that is subject to section 382 because the aggregate increases in percentage ownership by B and C (respectively 40 percent and 15 percent) is more than 50 percentage points.
(ii) The facts are the same as in (i), except that the plan of reorganization is adopted on October 13, 1986, and the merger is completed on July 22, 1987. The result is the same as in (i).
(iii) The facts are the same as in (ii), except that the reorganization is completed on August 22, 1987, and B's purchase of the L stock occurs one month earlier, on July 22, 1987. Assume that after the reorganization on August 22, 1987, A and B own 40 percent and 15 percent, respectively, of L stock. Although the merger occurred pursuant to a plan of reorganization adopted before 1987, L is subject to section 382 following the equity structure shift, because the merger would not have caused an ownership change if it had been completed in 1986 after the commencement of the L's testing period.
(iv) The facts are the same as in (ii), except that B's purchase occurs on June 7, 1986. Assume that immediately after the reorganization on August 22, 1987, A and B own 40 percent and 15 percent, respectively, of L stock. Since the reorganization pursuant to a plan adopted before 1987, taken together with the other shifts in the ownership of L's stock between May 5, 1986, and December 31, 1986, would have caused an ownership change, section 382 does not apply as a result of the merger. Since an ownership change occurs as a result of the merger, L's testing period for purposes of any subsequent ownership change begins on October 14, 1986.
(v) The facts are the same as in (iv), except that B makes an additional purchase from C of one percent of L's stock on February 14, 1987. The result is the same as in (iv). B's additional purchase, however, is taken into account for the purpose of determining whether there is a second ownership change with respect to L.

§ 1.382-3
Definitions and rules relating to a 5-percent shareholder.
(a)
Definitions
—(1)
Entity
—(i)
In general.
An entity is any corporation, estate, trust, association, company, partnership or similar organization. An entity includes a group of persons who have a formal or informal understanding among themselves to make a coordinated acquisition of stock. A principal element in determining if such an understanding exists is whether the investment decision of each member of a group is based upon the investment decision of one or more other members. However, the participation by creditors in formulating a plan for an insolvency workout or a reorganization in a title 11 or similar case (whether as members of a creditors' committee or otherwise) and the receipt of stock by creditors in satisfaction of indebtedness pursuant to the workout or reorganization do not cause the creditors to be considered an entity.
(ii)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the provisions of paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section.

# Example 1.
(i) L corporation has 1,000 shares of common stock outstanding. For the three-year period ending on October 1, 1992, L's stock was owned by unrelated individuals, none of whom owned five percent or more of L. A group of 20 individuals who previously owned no stock (the “Group”) agree among themselves to acquire more than 5 percent of L's stock. The Group is not a corporation, trust, association, partnership or company.
On October 1, 1992, pursuant to their understanding, the members of the Group purchase 600 shares of L common stock from the old shareholders of L (a total of 60 percent of L stock), with each member purchasing 30 shares.
(ii) Before the members of the Group acquired L's stock on October 1, 1992, no individual or entity owned, directly or indirectly, five percent or more of the stock of L. As a result, all shareholders were aggregated into a public group and L was considered to be owned by a single 5-percent shareholder (“Public L”) in accordance with § 1.382-2T (g)(1) and (j)(1).
(iii) Under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, the members of the Group have a formal or informal understanding among themselves to make a coordinated acquisition of stock and, therefore, the Group is an entity. Thus, the acquisition of more than five percent of the stock of L on October 1, 1992, by members of the Group is not disregarded under § 1.382-2T(e)(1)(ii). Because no member of the Group owns, directly or indirectly, five percent or more of the stock of L, §§ 1.382-2T (g)(1) and (j)(1) require that the members of the Group be aggregated into a separate public group, which will be presumed to consist of persons unrelated to the members of Public L. Because there is a shift of more than fifty percentage points in the ownership of L stock during the three-year testing period ending on October 1, 1992, an ownership change occurs on October 1, 1992, as a result of the Group's purchase of the 600 shares.

# Example 2.
(i) Prior to October 1, 1992, L's 1,000 shares of outstanding stock were owned by unrelated individuals, none of whom owned five percent or more of the stock of L. L's management is concerned that L may become subject to a takeover bid. In separate meetings, L's management meets with potential investors who own no stock and are friendly to management to convince them to acquire L's stock based on an understanding that L will assemble a group that in the aggregate will acquire more than 50 percent of L's stock. On October 1, 1992, 15 of these investors each purchase 4 percent of L's stock.
(ii) Under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, the 15 investors (the “Group”) are treated as an entity because the members of the Group purchase L stock pursuant to a formal or informal understanding among themselves to make a coordinated acquisition of stock. Sections 1.382-2T (g)(1) and (j)(1) require that on October 1, 1992, the Group be aggregated into a separate public group, which has increased its ownership of L stock by 60 percentage points over its lowest level of ownership in the three-year period ending on October 1, 1992. Accordingly, an ownership change occurs on that date.

# Example 3.
(i) Prior to October 1, 1992, L's 1,000 shares of outstanding stock were owned by unrelated individuals, none of whom owned five percent or more of the stock of L. On October 1, 1992, an investment advisor advises its clients that it believes L's stock is undervalued and recommends that they acquire L stock. Acting on the investment advisor's recommendation, 20 unrelated individuals purchase 6 percent of L's stock in aggregate, with each individual purchasing less than 5 percent. Each client's decision was not based upon the investment decisions made by one or more other clients.
(ii) Because there is no formal or informal understanding among the clients to make a coordinated acquisition of L stock, their purchase of stock is not made by an entity under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section. As a result, they remain part of the public group which owns L stock, and no owner shift results upon their purchase of L stock under § 1.382-2T(e)(1)(ii).
(iii) The result in this example would be the same under paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section if the only additional fact was that the investment advisor is also the underwriter (without regard to whether it is a firm commitment or best efforts underwriting) for a primary or secondary offering of L stock.
(iv) Assume that the facts are the same except that, instead of an investment advisor recommending that clients purchase L stock, the trustee of several trusts qualified under section 401(a) sponsored by unrelated corporations causes each trust to purchase the L stock. In this case, the result is the same, so long as the investment decision made on behalf of each trust was not based on the investment decision made on behalf of one or more of the other trusts.
(iii)
Effective date.
(A)
In general.
The second, third and fourth sentences of paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section and
Examples 1, 2
and
3
of paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section apply to testing dates (determined by applying such sentence and examples) on or after November 20, 1990, but with respect to any group of persons that pursuant to a formal or informal understanding among themselves makes a coordinated acquisition of stock before November 20, 1990, only if the group increases or decreases its ownership of stock of the loss corporation relative to its percentage ownership interest at the close of November 19, 1990, by five percentage points or more on or after November 20, 1990.
(B)
Special rule.
If pursuant to a formal or informal understanding among themselves a group consisting only of regulated investment companies under
section 851, qualified trusts under section 401, common trust funds under section 584, or trusts or estates that are clients of a trust department of a bank under section 581, make a coordinated acquisition of stock before November 20, 1990, the second, third and fourth sentences of paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section and
Examples 1, 2,
and
3
of paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section apply for testing dates (determined by applying such sentences and examples) on or after November 20, 1990, only if the group increases its ownership of stock of the loss corporation relative to its percentage ownership interest at the close of November 19, 1990, by five percentage points or more on or after November 20, 1990.
(C)
Example.
The following example illustrates the provisions of paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section.

# Example.
Prior to November 1, 1990, L, a loss, corporation, is owned entirely by 1,000 unrelated individuals, none of whom owns as much as 5 percent of the stock of L (“Public L”). On November 1, 1990, 15 individuals (the “Group”) each acquired 3 percent, or 45 percent, in total, of L stock pursuant to an understanding among themselves to make a coordinated acquisition of stock. The Group is not a corporation, trust, association, partnership or company. On March 1, 1992, six members of the Group each purchased an additional one percent of L stock, or 6 percent, in total, pursuant to the understanding. Accordingly, the Group increased its ownership in L stock by 51 percentage points during the three-year testing period ending on March 1, 1992. As a result, an ownership change of L occurs on March 1, 1992.
(2) [Reserved]
(b)-(i) [Reserved]
(j)
Modification of the segregation rules of § 1.382-2T(j)(2)(iii) and (3)
—(1)
Introduction.
This paragraph (j) exempts, in whole or in part, certain transfers of stock from the segregation rules of § 1.382-2T(j)(2)(iii) and (3). Terms and nomenclature used in this paragraph (j), and not otherwise defined herein, have the same meanings as in section 382 and the regulations issued under section 382.
(2)
Small issuance exception
—(i)
In general.
Section 1.382-2T(j)(2)(iii)(B) does not apply to a small issuance (as defined in paragraph (j)(2)(ii) of this section), except to the extent that the total amount of stock issued in that issuance and all other small issuances previously made in the same taxable year (determined in each case on issuance) exceeds the small issuance limitation. This paragraph (j)(2) does not apply to an issuance of stock that, by itself, exceeds the small issuance limitation.
(ii)
Small issuance defined.
“Small issuance” means an issuance (other than an issuance described in paragraph (j)(6) of this section) by the loss corporation of an amount of stock not exceeding the small issuance limitation. For purposes of this paragraph (j)(2)(ii), all stock issued in the issuance is taken into account, including stock owned immediately after the issuance by a 5-percent shareholder that is not a direct public group.
(iii)
Small issuance limitation
—(A)
In general.
For each taxable year, the loss corporation may, at its option, apply this paragraph (j)(2)—
(
1
) On a corporation-wide basis, in which case the small issuance limitation is 10 percent of the total value of the loss corporation's stock outstanding at the beginning of the taxable year (excluding the value of stock described in section 1504(a)(4)); or
(
2
) On a class-by-class basis, in which case the small issuance limitation is 10 percent of the number of shares of the class outstanding at the beginning of the taxable year.
(B)
Class of stock defined.
For purposes of this paragraph (j)(2)(iii), a class of stock includes all stock with the same material terms.
(C)
Adjustments for stock splits and similar transactions.
Appropriate adjustments to the number of shares of a class outstanding at the beginning of a taxable year must be made to take into account any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend to which section 305(a) applies, recapitalization, or similar transaction occurring during the taxable year.
(D)
Exception.
The loss corporation may not apply this paragraph (j)(2)(iii) on a class-by-class basis if, during the taxable year, more than one class of stock is issued in a single issuance (or in two or more issuances that are treated as a single issuance under paragraph (j)(8)(ii) of this section).
(iv)
Short taxable years.
In the case of a taxable year that is less than 365
days, the small issuance limitation is reduced by multiplying it by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the taxable year, and the denominator of which is 365.
(3)
Other issuances of stock for cash
—(i)
In general.
If the loss corporation issues stock solely for cash, § 1.382-2T(j)(2)(iii)(B) does not apply to such stock in an amount equal (as a percentage of the total stock issued) to one-half of the aggregate percentage ownership interest of direct public groups immediately before the issuance.
(ii)
Solely for cash
—(A)
In general.
A share of stock is not issued solely for cash if—
(
1
) The acquiror, as a condition of acquiring that share for cash, is required to purchase other stock for consideration other than cash; or
(
2
) The share is acquired upon the exercise of an option that was not issued solely for cash or was not distributed with respect to stock.
(B)
Related issuances.
Paragraph (j)(8)(i) of this section (relating to the treatment of one or more issuances as a single issuance) does not apply in determining whether stock is issued solely for cash.
(iii)
Coordination with paragraph (j)(2) of this section.
This paragraph (j)(3) does not apply to a small issuance exempted in whole from § 1.382-2T(j)(2)(iii)(B) under paragraph (j)(2) of this section. In the case of a small issuance exempted in part from § 1.382-2T(j)(2)(iii)(B) under paragraph (j)(2) of this section, this paragraph (j)(3) applies only to the portion of the issuance not so exempted, and that portion is treated as a separate issuance for purposes of this paragraph (j)(3).
(4)
Limitation on exempted stock.
The total amount of stock that is exempted from the application of § 1.382-2T(j)(2)(iii)(B) under paragraphs (j)(2) and (j)(3) of this section cannot exceed the total amount of stock issued in the issuance less the amount of that stock owned by a 5-percent shareholder (other than a direct public group) immediately after the issuance. Except to the extent that the loss corporation has actual knowledge to the contrary, any increase in the amount of the loss corporation's stock owned by a 5-percent shareholder on the day of the issuance is considered to be attributable to an acquisition of stock in the issuance.
(5)
Proportionate acquisition of exempted stock
—(i)
In general.
Each direct public group that exists immediately before an issuance to which paragraph (j)(2) or (j)(3) of this section applies is treated as acquiring its proportionate share of the amount of stock exempted from the application of § 1.382-2T(j)(2)(iii)(B) under paragraph (j)(2) or (j)(3) of this section.
(ii)
Actual knowledge of greater overlapping ownership.
Under the last sentence of § 1.382-2T(k)(2), the loss corporation may treat direct public groups existing immediately before an issuance to which paragraph (j)(2) or (j)(3) of this section applies as acquiring in the aggregate more stock than the amount determined under paragraph (j)(5)(i) of this section, but only if the loss corporation actually knows that the aggregate amount acquired by those groups in the issuance exceeds the amount so determined.
(6)
Exception for equity structure shifts.
This paragraph (j) does not apply to any issuance of stock in an equity structure shift, except that paragraph (j)(2) of this section applies (if its requirements are met) to the issuance of stock in a recapitalization under section 368(a)(1)(E).
(7)
Transitory ownership by underwriter disregarded.
For purposes of § 1.382-2T(g)(1) and (j), and this paragraph (j), the transitory ownership of stock by an underwriter of the issuance is disregarded.
(8)
Certain related issuances.
For purposes of this paragraph (j), two or more issuances (including issuances of stock by first tier or higher tier entities) are treated as a single issuance if—
(i) The issuances occur at approximately the same time pursuant to the same plan or arrangement; or
(ii) A principal purpose of issuing the stock in separate issuances rather than in a single issuance is to minimize or avoid an owner shift under the rules of this paragraph (j).
(9)
Application to options.
The principles of this paragraph (j) apply for purposes of applying § 1.382-2T(j)(2)(iii)(D) (relating to the deemed
acquisition of stock as a result of the ownership of an option).
(10)
Issuance of stock pursuant to the exercise of certain options.
If stock is issued on the exercise of a transferable option issued by the loss corporation, § 1.382-2T(j)(2)(iii)(F) does not apply and, in applying the last sentence of § 1.382-2T(k)(2), the loss corporation must take into account any transfers of the option (including transfers described in § 1.382-2T(h)(4)(xi)). Therefore, even if transferable options are distributed pro rata to members of existing public groups, the actual knowledge exception of § 1.382-2T(k)(2) applies only to the extent that the loss corporation actually knows that the persons acquiring stock on exercise of the options are members of a pre-existing public group. Moreover, if transferable options are issued to more than one public group, § 1.382-2T(j)(2)(iii)(F) does not apply to treat the options as exercised pro rata by each such public group as the options are actually exercised.
(11)
Application to first tier and higher tier entities
—(i)
In general.
The principles of paragraphs (j)(1) through (10) and paragraph (j)(12) apply to issuances of stock by a first tier entity or a higher tier entity that owns 5 percent or more of the loss corporation's stock (determined without regard to § 1.382-2T(h)(2)(1)(A)).
(ii)
Small issuance limitation.
In applying paragraph (j)(2) of this section to any issuance of stock by a first tier or higher tier entity, the small issuance limitations of paragraph (j)(2)(iii)(A) and (B) of this section are computed by reference to the stock value and the stock classes of the issuing corporation.
(12)
Certain non-stock ownership interests.
As the context may require, a non-stock ownership interest in an entity other than a corporation is treated as stock for purposes of this paragraph (j).
(13)
Secondary transfer exception.
The segregation rules of § 1.382-2T(j)(3)(i) will not apply to the transfer of a direct ownership interest in the loss corporation by a first tier entity or an individual that owns five percent or more of the loss corporation to public shareholders. Instead, each public group existing at the time of the transfer will be treated under § 1.382-2T(j)(3)(i) as acquiring its proportionate share of the stock exempted from the application of § 1.382-2T(j)(3)(i). The segregation rules also will not apply if an ownership interest in an entity that owns five percent or more of the loss corporation (determined without regard to the application of § 1.382-2T(h)(2)(i)(A)) is transferred to a public owner or a 5-percent owner who is not a 5-percent shareholder of the loss corporation. Instead, provided that the transferor is either a 5-percent owner that is a 5-percent shareholder of the loss corporation or a higher tier entity owning five percent or more of the loss corporation (determined without regard to the application of section 1.382-2T(h)(2)(i)(A)), each public group of the entity existing at the time of the transfer is treated under § 1.382-2T(j)(3)(i) as acquiring its proportionate share of the transferred ownership interest. With regard to a transferor that is neither a 5-percent shareholder of the loss corporation nor a higher tier entity owning five percent or more of the loss corporation (determined without regard to the application of § 1.382-2T(h)(2)(i)(A)), see generally § 1.382-2T(e)(1)(ii) (disregarding these transactions if the transferee is not a 5-percent shareholder).
(14)
Small redemption exception
—(i)
In general.
Section 1.382-2T(j)(2)(iii)(C) does not apply to a small redemption (as defined in paragraph (j)(14)(ii) of this section), except to the extent that the total amount of stock redeemed in that redemption and all other small redemptions previously made in the same taxable year (determined in each case on redemption) exceeds the small redemption limitation. This paragraph (j)(14) does not apply to a redemption of stock that, by itself, exceeds the small redemption limitation.
(ii)
Small redemption defined. Small redemption
means a redemption of public shareholders by the loss corporation of an amount of stock not exceeding the small redemption limitation.
(iii)
Small redemption limitation
—(A)
In general.
For each taxable year, the loss corporation may, at its option, apply this paragraph (j)(14)—
(
1
) On a corporation-wide basis, in which case the small redemption limitation is 10 percent of the total value
of the loss corporation's stock outstanding at the beginning of the taxable year (excluding the value of stock described in section 1504(a)(4)); or
(
2
) On a class-by-class basis, in which case the small redemption limitation is 10 percent of the number of shares of the class redeemed that are outstanding at the beginning of the taxable year.
(B)
Class of stock defined.
For purposes of this paragraph (j)(14)(iii), a class of stock includes all stock with the same material terms.
(C)
Adjustments for stock splits and similar transactions.
Appropriate adjustments to the number of shares of a class outstanding at the beginning of a taxable year must be made to take into account any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend to which section 305(a) applies, recapitalization, or similar transaction occurring during the taxable year.
(D)
Exception.
The loss corporation may not apply this paragraph (j)(14)(iii) on a class-by-class basis if, during the taxable year, more than one class of stock is redeemed in a single redemption (or in two or more redemptions that are treated as a single redemption under paragraph (j)(14)(v) of this section).
(E)
Short taxable years.
In the case of a taxable year that is less than 365 days, the small redemption limitation is reduced by multiplying it by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the taxable year, and the denominator of which is 365.
(iv)
Proportionate redemption of exempted stock
—(A)
In general.
Each direct public group that exists immediately before a redemption to which this paragraph (j)(14) applies is treated as having been redeemed of its proportionate share of the amount of stock exempted from the application of § 1.382-2T(j)(2)(iii)(C) under this paragraph (j)(14).
(B)
Actual knowledge of greater redemption.
Under the last sentence of § 1.382-2T(k)(2), the loss corporation may treat direct public groups existing immediately before a redemption to which this paragraph (j)(14) applies as having been redeemed of more stock than the amount determined under paragraph (j)(14)(iv)(A) of this section, but only if the loss corporation actually knows that the amount redeemed from those groups in the redemption exceeds the amount so determined.
(v)
Certain related redemptions.
For purposes of this paragraph (j)(14), two or more redemptions (including redemptions of stock by first tier or higher tier entities) are treated as a single redemption if—
(A) The redemptions occur at approximately the same time pursuant to the same plan or arrangement; or
(B) A principal purpose of redeeming the stock in separate redemptions rather than in a single redemption is to minimize or avoid an owner shift under the rules of this paragraph (j)(14).
(vi)
Certain non-stock ownership interests.
As the context may require, a non-stock ownership interest in an entity other than a corporation is treated as stock for purposes of this paragraph (j)(14).
(vii)
Application to first tier and higher tier entities
—(A)
In general.
The principles of this paragraph (j)(14) apply to redemptions of stock by a first tier entity or a higher tier entity that owns 5 percent of the loss corporation stock (determined without regard to § 1.382-2T(h)(2)(i)(A)).
(B)
Small redemption limitation.
In applying this paragraph (j)(14) to any redemption of stock by a first tier or a higher tier entity, the small redemption limitations of paragraph (j)(14)(iii)(A) of this section are computed by reference to the stock value and the stock classes of the redeeming corporation.
(15)
Exception for first tier and higher tier entities
—(i)
In general.
The segregation rules of § 1.382-2T(j)(3)(iii) will not apply to a transaction involving stock in a first tier or a higher tier entity if, after taking into account the results of such transaction and all other transactions occurring on that date, the first tier or higher tier entity owns 10 percent or less (by value) of all the outstanding stock (without regard to § 1.382-2(a)(3)) of the loss corporation.
(ii)
Anti-avoidance rule.
The rules of paragraph (j)(15)(i) of this section do not apply to a transaction involving an ownership interest in a first tier or higher tier entity if the loss corporation, directly or through one or more
persons, has participated in planning or structuring the transaction with a view to avoiding the application of the segregation rules. For this purpose, a transaction includes any event that would result in segregation under § 1.382-2T(j)(3)(iii), absent the application of this paragraph (j)(15), and any event (for example, the formation of a holding company) occurring as part of the same plan that includes the event that would result in segregation (without the application of this paragraph (j)(15)). Other anti-avoidance rules continue to be applicable. See, for example, §§ 1.382-2T(k)(4) and 1.382-3(a)(1).
(iii)
Special rules.
If application of paragraph (j)(15)(i) of this section results in the combination of public groups, then—
(A) The amount of increase in the percentage of stock ownership of the continuing public group will be the sum of its increase and a proportionate amount of any increase by any public group that is combined with the continuing public group (the former public group); and
(B) The continuing public group's lowest percentage ownership will be the sum of its lowest percentage ownership and a proportionate amount of the former public group's lowest percentage ownership.
(iv)
Ownership of the loss corporation.
In making the determination under paragraph (j)(15)(i) of this section—
(A) The rules of § 1.382-2T(h)(2) will not apply;
(B) The entity will be treated as owning the loss corporation stock that it actually owns, and any other loss corporation stock if that other stock would be attributed to the entity under section 318(a) (without regard to paragraph (4) thereof) unless an option is treated as exercised under § 1.382-4(d)); and
(C) The operating rules of paragraph (j)(15)(v) of this section will apply.
(v)
Operating rules.
Subject to the principles of § 1.382-2T(k)(4), a loss corporation may establish the ownership limitation of paragraph (j)(15)(i) of this section through either—
(A) Actual knowledge; or
(B) Absent actual knowledge to the contrary, the presumptions regarding stock ownership in § 1.382-2T(k)(1).
(16)
Examples.
The provisions of this paragraph (j) are illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
(i) L corporation is a calendar year taxpayer. On January 1, 1994, L has 1,000 shares of a single class of common stock outstanding, all of which are owned by a single direct public group (Public L). On February 1, 1994, L issues to employees as compensation 60 new common shares of the same class. On May 1, 1994, L issues 50 new common shares of the same class solely for cash. Following each issuance, L's stock is owned entirely by public shareholders. No other changes in the ownership of L's stock occur prior to May 1, 1994. L chooses to determine its small issuance limitation for 1994 on a class-by-class basis under paragraph (j)(2)(iii)(A)(
2
) of this section.
(ii) The February issuance is a small issuance because the number of shares issued (60) does not exceed 100, the small issuance limitation (10 percent of the number of common shares outstanding on January 1, 1994). Under paragraph (j)(2) of this section, the segregation rules of § 1.382-2T(j)(2)(iii)(B) do not apply to the February issuance. Under paragraph (j)(5) of this section, Public L is treated as acquiring all 60 shares issued.
(iii) The May issuance is a small issuance because the number of shares issued (50) does not exceed 100, the small issuance limitation (10 percent of the number of common shares outstanding on January 1, 1994). However, under paragraph (j)(2) of this section, only 40 of the 50 shares issued are exempted from the segregation rules of § 1.382-2T(j)(2)(iii)(B) because the total number of shares of common stock issued in the February and May issuances exceeds 100, the small issuance limitation, by 10. Because the May issuance is solely for cash, paragraph (j)(3) of this section exempts 5 of the 10 remaining shares from the segregation rules of § 1.382-2T(j)(2)(iii)(B) (10 shares multiplied by 50 percent, one-half of Public L's 100 percent ownership interest immediately before the May issuance—1,060 shares/1,060 shares). Accordingly, under paragraph (j)(5) of this section, Public L is treated as acquiring 45 shares in the May issuance. Section 1.382-2T(j)(2)(iii)(B) applies to the remaining 5 shares issued, which are treated as acquired by a direct public group separate from Public L. Each such public group is treated as an individual who is a separate 5-percent shareholder. See § 1.382-2T (g)(1)(iv) and (j)(1)(ii).
(iv) Assume that L actually knows that at least 10 shares of the May issuance are acquired by members of Public L. The result is the same. See paragraph (j)(5)(ii) of this section.
(v) Assume instead that L actually knows that all 50 shares of the May issuance are acquired by members of Public L. Under paragraph (j)(5)(ii) of this section, L may treat
Public L as acquiring 50 shares in the May issuance.

# Example 2.
(i) L corporation is a calendar year taxpayer. On January 1, 1995, L has 1,000 shares of Class A common stock outstanding, the aggregate value of which is $1,000. Five hundred shares are owned by one direct public group (Public 1), and 500 shares are owned by another direct public group (Public 2). On August 1, 1995, L issues 200 shares of Class B common stock for $200 cash. A, an individual, acquires 120 Class B shares in the transaction. The remaining 80 Class B shares are acquired by public shareholders. No other changes in ownership of L's stock occur prior to August 1, 1995.
(ii) The August issuance is not a small issuance. The total value of the Class B stock issued ($200) exceeds $100, the small issuance limitation as calculated under paragraph (j)(2)(iii)(A)(
1
) of this section (10 percent of the value of L's stock on January 1, 1995). The total number of Class B shares issued (200) exceeds 0, the small issuance limitation as calculated under paragraph (j)(2)(iii)(A)(
2
) of this section (10 percent of the number of Class B shares outstanding on January 1, 1995). Accordingly, paragraph (j)(2) of this section does not apply to the August issuance.
(iii) Paragraph (j)(3) of this section, as limited by paragraph (j)(4) of this section, exempts 80 Class B shares from the segregation rule of § 1.382-2T(j)(2)(iii)(B). Paragraph (j)(3) of this section, without regard to paragraph (j)(4) of this section, would exempt 100 Class B shares: the product of the 200 Class B shares issued and 50 percent (one-half of the combined 100 percent pre-issuance ownership interest of Public 1 and Public 2). Paragraph (j)(4), however, limits the total number of Class B shares that may be excluded to 80 Class B shares: the difference between the 200 shares issued and the 120 shares acquired by A. Under paragraph (j)(5) of this section, Public 1 and Public 2 are treated as acquiring the 80 exempted Class B shares. Because Public 1 and Public 2 each owned 500 Class A shares prior to the issuance, Public 1 and Public 2 are considered to acquire 40 Class B shares each.

# Example 3.
(i) L has 1,000 shares of a single class of common stock outstanding, all of which are owned by a direct public group (Public L). At the same time pursuant to the same plan, L issues 500 shares of its stock to its creditors in exchange for its outstanding debt and 500 shares of its stock to the public for cash. Assume that the separate issuances of stock for debt and stock for cash do not have a principal purpose of minimizing or avoiding an owner shift. L has no individual 5-percent shareholders immediately after the issuances.
(ii) The 500 shares of stock issued by L to its former creditors were not issued solely for cash. Therefore, paragraph (j)(3) of this section does not apply to those 500 shares, which are treated as owned by a public group separate from Public L. See § 1.382-2T(j)(2)(iii)(B)(
1
)(
ii
).
(iii) Paragraph (j)(3) of this section applies to the 500 shares of stock issued by L to the public because that stock was issued solely for cash. Because the two issuances occur at the same time pursuant to the same plan, they are generally treated as a single issuance for purposes of this paragraph (j). See paragraph (j)(8)(i) of this section. The treatment of the two issuances as a single issuance does not apply, however, for the purpose of determining whether the stock issued to the public was issued solely for cash. See paragraph (j)(3)(ii)(B) of this section.
(iv) Paragraph (j)(3) of this section applies to exempt 250 of the 500 shares issued solely for cash from the segregation rules of § 1.382-2T(j)(2)(iii)(B) (the product of the 500 shares issued for cash and 50 percent (one-half of the 100 percent pre-issuance ownership interest of Public L)). The creditors that receive stock in exchange for their debt would not be treated as acquiring any of the 250 exempted shares even if their exchange of debt for stock occurs prior to the cash issuance. Paragraph (j)(5)(i) of this section allocates exempted shares among the direct public groups that exist immediately before an issuance. Because the issuance for cash and the issuance for debt are generally treated as a single issuance, the public group comprised of the former creditors of L was not a public group that existed immediately before the issuance.
(v) Three public groups owning L stock exist immediately after the two issuances. Public L owns 1,250 shares—the 1,000 shares it owned prior to the issuances plus the 250 shares it is treated as acquiring in the cash issuance. A separate group comprised of the former creditors of L owns the 500 shares issued for debt. A third public group owns the 250 shares that are not treated as acquired by Public L in the cash issuance.

# Example 4.
(i) L has 1,000 shares of a single class of common stock outstanding, all of which are owned by a direct public group (Public L). L issues 1,000 shares pursuant to an offer under which 500 shares must be acquired in exchange for debt and the remainder may be acquired for cash. Under the terms of the offer, only persons that acquire stock for debt are eligible to acquire stock for cash. L has no 5-percent shareholders other than direct public groups immediately after the issuance.
(ii) As a condition of acquiring shares for cash, the creditors are required to purchase stock for debt. Therefore, paragraph (j)(3) of this section does not apply to any part of the issuance because it is not an issuance of stock solely for cash. The segregation rules of § 1.382-2T(j)(2)(iii)(B) apply to treat all
1,000 shares as acquired by a new public group separate from Public L.

# Example 5.
Secondary transfer exception to segregation rules—no new public group.
(i)
Facts.
L is owned 60 percent by one public group (Public L
1
) and 40 percent by another public group (Public L
2
). On July 1, 2014, individual A acquires 10 percent of L's stock over a public stock exchange. On December 31, 2014, A sells all of his L stock over a public stock exchange. No individual or entity acquires as much as five percent of L's stock as a result of A's disposition of his L stock. On January 3, 2015, individual B acquires 10 percent of L's stock over a public stock exchange. On June 30, 2015, B sells all of her L stock over a public stock exchange. No individual or entity acquires as much as five percent of L's stock as a result of B's disposition of her L stock.
(ii)
Analysis.
The dispositions of the L stock by A and B are not transactions that cause the segregation of L's direct public groups that exist immediately before the transaction (Public L
1
and Public L
2
). When A and B sell their shares to public shareholders over the public stock exchange, the shares are treated as being reacquired by Public L
1
and Public L
2
. As a result, Public L
1
's ownership interest is treated as increasing from 54 percent to 60 percent during the testing period, and Public L
2
's ownership interest is treated as increasing from 36 percent to 40 percent during the testing period.

# Example 6.
Secondary transfer exception—first tier entity.
(i)
Facts.
L has a single class of common stock outstanding that is owned 60 percent by a direct public group (Public L) and 40 percent by P. P is owned 20 percent by individual A and 80 percent by a direct public group (Public P). On October 6, 2014, A sells 50 percent of his interest in P to B, an individual who is, and remains, a member of Public P.
(ii)
Analysis.
P is an entity that owns five percent or more of L. A is a 5-percent owner of P that is a 5-percent shareholder of L. Because A's sale of the P stock is to a member of Public P, the disposition of the P stock by A is not a transaction that causes the segregation of P's direct public group that exists immediately before the transaction (Public P). See paragraph (j)(13) of this section. When A sells his shares to B, the shares are treated as being acquired by Public P. As a result, Public P's ownership interest in L is treated as increasing from 32 percent to 36 percent during the testing period.

# Example 7.
Small redemption exception.
(i)
Facts.
L is a calendar year taxpayer. On January 1, 2014, L has 1,060 shares of a single class of common stock outstanding, all of which are owned by a single direct public group (Public L). On July 1, 2014, L acquires 60 shares of its stock for cash. On December 31, 2014, in an unrelated redemption, L acquires 90 more shares of its stock for cash. Following each redemption, L's stock is owned entirely by public shareholders. No other changes in the ownership of L's stock occur prior to December 31, 2014.
(ii)
Analysis—(A) July redemption.
The July redemption is a small redemption because the number of shares redeemed (60) does not exceed 106, the small redemption limitation (10 percent of the number of common shares outstanding on January 1, 2014). Under paragraph (j)(14) of this section, the segregation rules of § 1.382-2T(j)(2)(iii)(C) do not apply to the July redemption. Under paragraph (j)(14)(iv) of this section, Public L is treated as having all 60 shares redeemed.
(B)
December redemption.
The December redemption is a small redemption because the number of shares redeemed (90) does not exceed 106, the small redemption limitation (10 percent of the number of common shares outstanding on January 1, 2014). However, under paragraph (j)(14)(i) of this section, only 46 of the 90 shares redeemed are exempted from the segregation rules of § 1.382-2T(j)(2)(iii)(C) because the total number of shares of common stock redeemed in the July and December redemptions exceeds 106, the small redemption limitation, by 44. Accordingly, under paragraph (j)(14)(iv) of this section, Public L is treated as having 46 shares redeemed in the December redemption. Section 1.382-2T(j)(2)(iii)(C) applies to the remaining 44 shares redeemed. Accordingly, Public L is segregated into two different public groups immediately before the transaction (and thereafter) so that the redeemed interests (Public RL) are treated as part of a public group that is separate from the ownership interests that are not redeemed (Public CL). Therefore, as a result of the December redemption, Public CL's interest in L increases by 4.4 percentage points (from 95.6 percent (956/1,000) to 100 percent (910/910)) on the December 31, 2014 testing date. For purposes of determining whether an ownership change occurs on any subsequent testing date having a testing period that includes the December redemption, Public CL is treated as a 5-percent shareholder whose percentage ownership interests in L increased by 4.4 percentage points as a result of such redemption.

# Example 8.
Segregation rules inapplicable—proportionate amount.
(i)
Facts.
P
1
is a corporation that owns 8 percent of the stock of
L. The remaining L stock (92 percent) is owned by Public L. P
1
is entirely owned by Public P
1
. P
2
is a corporation owned 90 percent by individual A and 10 percent by a public group (Public P
2
). On May 22, 2014, P
1
merges into P
2
with the shareholders of P
1
receiving an amount of P
2
stock equal to 25 percent of the value of P
2
immediately after the reorganization. L was owned 92 percent by Public L and 8 percent by P
1
throughout the testing period ending on the date of the merger.
(ii)
Analysis.
Assuming L can establish that P
2
owns 10 percent or less (by value) of L on May 22, 2014 pursuant to the operating rules of paragraph (j)(15)(v) of this section, the segregation rules of § 1.382-2T(j)(3)(iii) will not apply to segregate P
1
's direct public group (Public P
1
) immediately before the merger from P
2
's direct public group (Public P
2
). Thus, following the merger, P
2
is owned 67.5 percent (90 percent × 75 percent) by A and 32.5 percent (25 percent + (10 percent × 75 percent)) by Public P
2
. Pursuant to paragraph (j)(15)(iii)(B) of this section, Public P
2
's lowest percentage of ownership is the sum of its lowest percentage of ownership (zero) and a proportionate amount of former Public P
1
's lowest ownership percentage of L of 2.6 percent (32.5 percent × 8 percent). P
2
will be treated as having one public group whose ownership interest in L was 2.6 percent before the merger and remains 2.6 percent after the merger. Because Public P
2
owns less than 5 percent of L, Public P
2
is treated as part of Public L. See § 1.382-2T(j)(1)(iv). Thus, pursuant to paragraph (j)(15)(iii)(B) of this section, Public L's lowest ownership percentage of L during the testing period is 94.6 percent.

# Example 9.
Segregation rules inapplicable—prior increase in ownership by former public group during testing period.
(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as
Example 8,
except that P
1
acquired its 8 percent interest in L during the testing period that includes the merger.
(ii)
Analysis.
Pursuant to the rules of paragraph (j)(15)(iii)(A) of this section, the amount of increase in the percentage of stock ownership by Public P
2
is the sum of its increase (zero) and a proportionate amount of the increase by former Public P
1
of 2.6 percent (32.5 percent × 8 percent). Pursuant to paragraph (j)(15)(iii)(B) of this section, Public P
2
's lowest percentage of ownership is zero, because both former Public P
1
and Public P
2
owned no L stock at the beginning of the testing period. Accordingly, Public P
2
, the continuing public group, is treated as having increased its ownership interest by 2.6 percent. Because Public P
2
is treated as part of Public L, Public L is treated as increasing its ownership interest by 2.6 percent.

# Example 10.
Ownership limitation based upon fair market value.
(i)
Facts.
L has one class of common stock and one class of preferred stock outstanding. The preferred stock is stock within the meaning of § 1.382-2(a)(3). Before December 23, 2014, a direct public group (Public L) owns all of the common stock of L. On December 23, 2014, P purchases all of the preferred stock of L and a portion of the common stock of L. On the date of purchase, the value of the L common stock held by P was greater than 5 percent of the value of L, and the total value of L common and L preferred stock held by P was less than 10 percent of the value of all stock of L. P has one class of common stock outstanding, all of which is owned by a direct public group (Public P). On October 7, 2015, P redeems 30 percent of its single outstanding class of common stock. On the redemption date of the P stock, due to a decline in the relative value of the common stock of L, the preferred stock of L owned by P represents 40 percent of the value of all the outstanding stock of L. No ownership change of L occurs between December 23, 2014, and October 7, 2015.
(ii)
Analysis.
The rules of paragraph (j)(15) of this section do not apply to the redemption because P owns more than 10 percent of L (by value) on that date.

# Example 11.
Ownership limitation—fair market value includes preferred stock.
The facts are the same as in
Example 10,
except that the preferred stock is not stock within the meaning of § 1.382-2(a)(3). Although the preferred stock is not stock for the purpose of determining owner shifts, the value of that stock is taken into account in computing the 10-percent limitation of paragraph (j)(15)(i) of this section. Therefore, the results are the same as in
Example 10.

# Example 12.
Ownership limitation—application of attribution rules.
(i)
Facts.
Individual A owns all the outstanding stock of X. A also owns preferred stock in Y that is not stock within the meaning § 1.382-2(a)(3), which represents 50 percent of the value of Y. All the Y common stock is owned by public owners. Each of X and Y own 6 percent of the single class of L stock outstanding. On October 6, 2014, Y redeems 15 percent of its common stock.
(ii)
Analysis.
In determining satisfaction of the ownership limitation of paragraph (j)(15)(i) of this section, the attribution rules of section 318(a) apply. Pursuant to section 318(a)(2), A is treated as owning the L stock owned by X. Pursuant to section 318(a)(3), Y is treated as owning the L stock that A indirectly owns. Because Y's ownership of L exceeds the 10 percent ownership limitation of paragraph (j)(15)(i) of this section, the rules of paragraph (j)(15) of this section do not apply.

# Example 13.
Anti-avoidance rule.
(i)
Facts.
P
1
is a corporation that owns 10 percent of the stock of L. P
1
is owned entirely by a direct public group (Public P). L has had owner shifts of 45 percentage points in its current
testing period. P
1
is planning to merge into P
2
, a corporation which has a public group. Advisers to L, upon learning of the proposed merger, asked the management of P
1
for details of the proposed merger, including the stock ownership of P
2
after P
1
merges into P
2
. After finding out that information, L or L's advisers did not request any changes in the planned transaction.
(ii)
Analysis.
The anti-avoidance rule of paragraph (j)(15)(ii) of this section does not apply because L did not participate in planning or structuring the transaction. Pursuant to paragraph (j)(15)(i) of this section, § 1.382-2T(j)(3)(iii) does not apply to cause the segregation of P
1
's public group from P
2
's public group.
(17)
Effective/applicability date.
This paragraph (j) generally applies to issuances or deemed issuances of stock in taxable years beginning on or after November 4, 1992. However, paragraphs (j)(11)(ii) and (j)(13) through (15) of this section and
Examples 5
through
13
of paragraph (j)(16) of this section apply to testing dates occurring on or after October 22, 2013, other than with respect to the sale of a Program Instrument by the Treasury Department. For purposes of this paragraph (j)(17), a Program Instrument is an instrument issued pursuant to a Program, as defined in Internal Revenue Service Notice 2010-2 (2010-2 IRB 251 (December 16, 2009)) (see § 601.601(a)(2)(ii)(
b
) of this chapter), or a Covered Instrument, as defined in that Notice. Taxpayers may apply paragraphs (j)(11)(ii) and (j)(13) through (15) of this section and
Examples 5
through
13
of paragraph (j)(16) of this section in their entirety (other than with respect to a sale of a Program Instrument by the Treasury Department) to all testing dates that are included in a testing period beginning before and ending on or after October 22, 2013. However, the provisions described in the preceding sentence may not be applied to any date on or before the date of any ownership change that occurred before October 22, 2013, under the regulations in effect before October 22, 2013, and they may not be applied as described in the preceding sentence if such application would result in an ownership change occurring on a date before October 22, 2013, that did not occur under the regulations in effect before October 22, 2013. See § 1.382-3(j)(14)(ii) and (iii), as contained in 26 CFR part 1 revised as of April 1, 1994 for the application of paragraph (j)(10) of this section to stock issued on the exercise of certain options exercised on or after November 4, 1992, and for an election to apply paragraphs (j)(1) through (12) of this section retroactively to certain issuances and deemed issuances of stock occurring in taxable years prior to November 4, 1992.
(k)
Special rules for certain regulated investment companies
—(1)
In general.
The segregation rules of § 1.382-2T(j)(2) do not apply to the issuance (as described in § 1.382-2T(j)(2)(iii)(B)(1)(
ii
)) or the redemption (as described in § 1.382-2T(j)(2)(iii)(C)) of any redeemable security, as defined in 15 U.S.C. 80a-2(a)(32), by a regulated investment company in the ordinary course of business.
(2)
Effective date
—(i)
General rule.
Paragraph (k)(1) of this section applies to testing dates after December 31, 1986. A corporation may file an amended return for taxable years ending before August 21, 1992 (subject to any applicable statute of limitations) to take into account paragraph (k)(1) of this section only if corresponding adjustments are made in amended returns for all affected taxable years ending after December 31, 1986 (subject to any applicable statute of limitations).
(ii)
Election to apply prospectively.
A corporation may elect to apply paragraph (k)(1) of this section only to testing dates on or after October 29, 1991. The election must be made on the first return which is filed after October 20, 1992 by stating on such return, “This is an Election To Apply § 1.382-3(k)(1) Only to Testing Dates on or After October 29, 1991.”

(1) [Reserved].
(2)
Limitation.
Section 1.382-2T(h)(2)(i)(A) applies solely for purposes of determining whether a loss corporation has an ownership change.

[Reserved]
(d)
Treatment of options as exercised
—(1)
General rule.
Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, an option is not treated as exercised under section 382(l)(3)(A).
(2)
Options treated as exercised
—(i)
Issuance or transfer.
For purposes of determining whether an ownership change occurs, an option is treated as exercised on the date of its issuance or transfer if, on that date, the option satisfies—
(A) The ownership test of paragraph (d)(3) of this section,
(B) The control test of paragraph (d)(4) of this section, or
(C) The income test of paragraph (d)(5) of this section.
(ii)
Subsequent testing dates.
Except as provided in paragraph (d)(10) of this section, an option that is treated as exercised on the date of its issuance or transfer is treated as exercised on any subsequent testing date (as defined in § 1.382-2(a)(4)) for purposes of determining whether an ownership change occurs.
(3)
The ownership test.
An option satisfies the ownership test if a principal purpose of the issuance, transfer, or structuring of the option (alone or in combination with other arrangements) is to avoid or ameliorate the impact of an ownership change of the loss corporation by providing the holder of the option, prior to its exercise or transfer, with a substantial portion of the attributes of ownership of the underlying stock.
(4)
The control test
—(i)
In general.
An option satisfies the control test if—
(A) A principal purpose of the issuance, transfer, or structuring of the option (alone or in combination with other arrangements) is to avoid or ameliorate the impact of an ownership change of the loss corporation, and
(B) The holder of the option and any persons related to the option holder have, in the aggregate, a direct and indirect ownership interest in the loss corporation of more than 50 percent (determined as if the increase in such persons' percentage ownership interest that would result from the exercise of the option in question and any other options to acquire stock held by such persons, and any other intended increases in such persons' percentage ownership interest, actually occurred on the date the option is issued or transferred).
(ii)
Operating rules
—(A)
Person and related persons.
For purposes of this paragraph (d)(4)—
(
1
) The term
person
includes an individual or entity, but not a public group, as defined in § 1.382-2T(f)(13), and
(
2
) Persons are related if they bear a relationship specified in section 267(b) or 707(b) or if they have a formal or informal understanding among themselves to make a coordinated acquisition of stock, within the meaning of § 1.382-3(a)(1)(i).
(B)
Indirect ownership interest.
The indirect ownership interest that the holder of the option and any persons related to the holder have in the loss corporation is determined by applying the constructive ownership rules of § 1.382-2T(h), other than § 1.382-2T(h)(2)(i)(A) (which treats stock attributed pursuant to section 318(a)(2) as no longer being owned by the entity from which it is attributed) and § 1.382-2T(h)(4) (which treats options as exercised in certain circumstances). If, however, the application of such constructive ownership rules without regard to § 1.382-2T(h)(2)(i)(A) would result in the same stock of the loss corporation being owned by two or more such persons, appropriate adjustments must be made so that such stock is not counted more than once in computing the aggregate ownership interests of such persons.
(5)
The income test.
An option satisfies the income test if a principal purpose of the issuance, transfer, or structuring of the option (alone or in combination with other arrangements) is to avoid or ameliorate the impact of an ownership change of the loss corporation by facilitating the creation of income (including accelerating income or deferring deductions) or value (including unrealized built-in gains) prior to the exercise or transfer of the option.
(6)
Application of the ownership, control, and income tests
—(i)
In general.
Whether an option satisfies the ownership, control, or income test depends on all the relevant facts and circumstances. Among the factors that
are relevant in applying all three tests are any business purposes for the issuance, transfer, or structure of the option, the likelihood of exercise of the option (taking into account, for example, any contingencies to its exercise), transactions related to the issuance or transfer of the option, and the consequences of treating the option as exercised.
An option is not treated as exercised under any of the three tests, however, if a principal purpose of its issuance, transfer, or structuring is to avoid an ownership change by having it treated as exercised. Paragraphs (d)(6)(ii), (iii) and (iv) of this section describe additional examples of factors that are relevant in applying each test. The weight given to any factor depends on all the facts and circumstances. The presence or absence of any factor described in this paragraph (d)(6) does not create a presumption.
(ii)
Application of ownership test.
Among the additional factors that are taken into account in applying the ownership test are the relationship, at the time of issuance or transfer of the option, between the exercise price of the option and the value of the underlying stock, whether the option provides its holder or a related person with the right to participate in the management of the loss corporation or with other rights that ordinarily would be afforded to owners of the underlying stock, and the existence of reciprocal options (e.g., a call option held by the prospective purchaser and a corresponding put option held by the prospective seller). The ability of the holder of an option with a fixed exercise price to share in future appreciation of the underlying stock is also a relevant factor, but is not sufficient, by itself, for the option to satisfy the ownership test. Conversely, the fact that the holder of such an option does not bear the risk of loss due to declines in value of the underlying stock does not preclude the option from satisfying the ownership test.
(iii)
Application of control test.
Among the additional factors that are taken into account in applying the control test are the economic interests in the loss corporation of the option holder or related persons and the influence of those persons over the management of the loss corporation (in either case, through the option or a related arrangement, or through rights in stock).
(iv)
Application of income test.
Among the additional factors that are taken into account in applying the income test are whether, in connection with the issuance or transfer of the option, the loss corporation engages in income acceleration transactions or the holder of the option or a related person purchases stock (including section 1504(a)(4) stock) from, or makes a capital contribution or loan to, the loss corporation that can reasonably be expected to avoid or ameliorate the impact of an ownership change. Examples of income acceleration transactions are those outside the ordinary course of the loss corporation's business that accelerate income or gain into the period prior to the exercise of the option (or defer deductions to the period after the exercise of the option). A stock purchase, capital contribution, or loan is more probative toward an option satisfying the income test the larger the amount received by the loss corporation in the transaction or related transactions. A stock purchase, capital contribution, or loan is generally not taken into account in applying the income test if it is made to enable the loss corporation to continue basic operations of its business (
e.g.,
to meet the monthly payroll or fund other operating expenses of the loss corporation).
(7)
Safe harbors.
Except as provided in paragraph (d)(7)(i) of this section, an option described in this paragraph (d)(7) is not treated as exercised pursuant to the ownership, control, or income test. The failure of an option to be described in this paragraph (d)(7) does not affect the determination of whether the option satisfies the ownership, income, or control test. The following options are described in this paragraph (d)(7):
(i)
Contracts to acquire stock.
A stock purchase agreement or a similar arrangement, the terms of which are commercially reasonable, in which the parties' obligations to complete the transaction are subject only to reasonable closing conditions, and which is closed on a change date within one year after it is entered into. An option
is not exempt from the income test of paragraph (d)(5) of this section solely by reason of its description in this paragraph (d)(7)(i).
(ii)
Escrow, pledge, or other security agreements.
An option that is part of a security arrangement in a typical lending transaction (including a purchase money loan), if the arrangement is subject to customary commercial conditions. For this purpose, a security arrangement includes, for example, an agreement for holding stock in escrow or under a pledge or other security agreement, or an option to acquire stock contingent upon a default under a loan.
(iii)
Compensatory options.
An option to acquire stock in a corporation with customary terms and conditions provided to an employee, director, or independent contractor in connection with the performance of services for the corporation or a related person (and that is not excessive by reference to the services performed) and which—
(A) Is nontransferable within the meaning of § 1.83-3(d); and
(B) Does not have a readily ascertainable fair market value as defined in § 1.83-7(b) on the date the option is issued.
(iv)
Options exercisable only upon death, disability, mental incompetency, or retirement.
An option entered into between stockholders of a corporation (or a stockholder and the corporation) with respect to stock of either stockholder, that is exercisable only upon the death, disability, mental incompetency of the stockholder, or, in the case of stock acquired in connection with the performance of services for the corporation or a related person (and that is not excessive by reference to the services performed), the stockholder's retirement.
(v)
Rights of first refusal.
A bona fide right of first refusal with customary terms, entered into between stockholders of a corporation (or between the corporation and a stockholder), and regarding the corporation's stock.
(vi)
Options designated in the Internal Revenue Bulletin.
An option designated by the Internal Revenue Service in the Internal Revenue Bulletin as being exempt from one or more of the ownership, control, or income tests. See § 601.601(d)(2)(ii) of this chapter (relating to the Internal Revenue Bulletin).
(8)
Additional rules
—(i)
Contracts to acquire stock.
For purposes of this paragraph (d), a contract is considered to be issued or transferred on the date it is entered into or assigned, respectively.
(ii)
Indirect transfer of an option.
If an entity is formed or availed of for a principal purpose of facilitating an indirect transfer of an option by issuing or transferring interests in the entity, an issuance or transfer of an interest in the entity will be treated as a transfer of the option for purposes of applying the ownership, control, and income tests of paragraphs (d)(3) through (5) of this section.
(iii)
Options related to interests in non-corporate entities.
The rules of this paragraph (d) apply, with appropriate adjustments, to options to acquire or transfer interests in non-corporate entities.
(iv)
Puts.
In applying the rules of this section to puts, appropriate adjustments must be made to take into account that the put provides its holder with a right to transfer, instead of acquire, stock.
(9)
Definition of option
—(i)
In general.
Any contingent purchase, warrant, convertible debt, put, stock subject to a risk of forfeiture, contract to acquire stock, or similar interest is treated as an option for purposes of this paragraph (d), regardless of whether it is contingent or otherwise not currently exercisable.
(ii)
Convertible stock.
Convertible stock is treated as an option for purposes of this paragraph (d) (in addition to being treated as stock under § 1.382-2(a)(3)(ii)) only if the terms of the conversion feature permit or require consideration other than the stock being converted.
(iii)
Series of options.
For purposes of this paragraph (d), an option to acquire an option with respect to the stock of the loss corporation, and each one of a series of such options, is treated as an option to acquire such stock.
(iv)
General principles of tax law.
This paragraph (d) does not affect the determination under general principles of tax law (such as substance over form) of whether an instrument is an option or stock.
(10)
Subsequent treatment of options treated as exercised on a change date
—(i)
In general.
The following rules apply to options that are treated as exercised under paragraph (d)(2) of this section on a change date:
(A) The option is not treated as exercised under paragraph (d)(2) of this section on any testing date after the change date and prior to a transfer of the option that would itself (
i.e.,
without regard to the purposes for the issuance or any prior transfers of the option) cause the option to satisfy the ownership test of paragraph (d)(3) of this section, the control test of paragraph (d)(4) of this section, or the income test of paragraph (d)(5) of this section; and
(B) The exercise of the option, if by the person who owned the option immediately after the ownership change (or by a transferee of the option who acquired the option, directly or indirectly, from that person in one or more transfers described in paragraph (d)(11) of this section), does not contribute to another ownership change on any testing date on or after the date of exercise.
(ii)
Alternative look-back rule for options exercised within 3 years after change date.
If a loss corporation, on its return, as originally filed, for a taxable year that includes a change date, properly treats an option as exercised under paragraph (d)(2) of this section on the change date, and the option is actually exercised within three years after the change date, the loss corporation may treat the rules of paragraph (d)(10)(i) of this section as inapplicable to the option and instead treat the option as having been exercised on the change date for the purpose of determining whether an ownership change occurs on any and all testing dates after the change date (filing such amended returns as may be necessary for taxable years ending after the change date and before the date of exercise of the option). A transfer after the change date of an option to which this paragraph (d)(10)(ii) applies is treated as a transfer of the stock subject to the option. The exercise of an option to which this paragraph (d)(10)(ii) applies is not taken into account for the purpose of determining whether an ownership change occurs on or after the date of exercise.
(11)
Transfers not subject to deemed exercise.
Paragraph (d)(2) of this section does not apply to the transfer of an option (including a transfer described in paragraph (d)(8)(i) or (ii) of this section), if—
(i) Neither the transferor nor the transferee is a 5-percent shareholder and neither person would be a 5-percent shareholder if all options held by that person to acquire stock were treated as exercised;
(ii) The transfer is between members of separate public groups resulting from the application of the segregation rules of § 1.382-2T(j)(2) and (3)(iii); or
(iii) The transfer occurs in any of the circumstances described in section 382(l)(3)(B) (relating to stock acquired by reason of death, gift, divorce, separation, etc.).
(12)
Certain rules regarding non-stock interests as stock.
Section 1.382-2T(f)(18)(iii) does not apply to treat an option (whether or not treated as exercised under this paragraph (d)) as stock.
(e)
Stock transferred under certain agreements.

Option attribution rules
—(i)
General rule.
The rules of paragraph (d) of this section apply, instead of the rules of § 1.382-2T(h)(4), on any testing date on or after November 5, 1992. See paragraph (h)(2)(vi) of this section for an election relating to the effective date.
(ii)
Special rule for control test.
An option issued on or before March 17, 1994, or an option issued within 60 days after that date pursuant to a plan existing before that date, is not treated as exercised under the control test provided in paragraph (d)(4) of this section on any testing date prior to a transfer of the option after March 17, 1994 that would itself cause the option to satisfy the control test.
(iii)
Convertible stock issued prior to July 20, 1988
—(A)
In general.
Except as
provided in paragraph (h)(2)(iii)(B) of this section, convertible stock issued prior to July 20, 1988, is not treated as an option subject to the rules of § 1.382-2T(h)(4) or paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
(B)
Exceptions
—(1)
Nonvoting convertible preferred stock.
Convertible stock issued prior to July 20, 1988, is treated as an option subject to the rules of § 1.382-2T(h)(4) or paragraph (d)(2) of this section if—
(
i
) The stock, when issued, would be described in section 1504(a)(4) by disregarding subparagraph (D) thereof and by ignoring the potential participation in corporate growth that the conversion feature may offer; and
(
ii
) The loss corporation makes the election described in Notice 88-67, 1988-1 C.B. 555 (see § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(
b
) of this chapter for availability of Cumulative Bulletins (C.B.)), on or before the earlier of the date prescribed in Notice 88-67 or December 7, 1992.
(
2
)
Other convertible stock.
Convertible stock issued prior to July 20, 1988, is treated as an option subject to the rules of § 1.382-2T(h)(4) or paragraph (d)(2) of this section if—
(
i
) The terms of the conversion feature permit or require the tender of consideration other than the stock being converted; and
(
ii
) The loss corporation makes the election described in Notice 88-67 on or before the date prescribed in the Notice.
(iv)
Convertible stock issued on or after July 20, 1988, and before November 5, 1992.
Convertible stock issued on or after July 20, 1988, and before November 5, 1992, is treated as an option subject to the rules of § 1.382-2T(h)(4) or paragraph (d) of this section only if—
(A) The stock, when issued, would be described in section 1504(a)(4) by disregarding subparagraph (D) thereof and by ignoring the potential participation in corporate growth that the conversion feature may offer; or
(B) The terms of the conversion feature permit or require the tender of consideration other than the stock being converted.
(v)
Certain options in existence immediately before and after an ownership change.
If an option existed immediately before and after an ownership change occurring on a testing date to which § 1.382-2T(h)(4) applies—
(A) The option is not treated as exercised under paragraph (d)(2) of this section on any testing date after the change date and prior to a transfer of the option that would itself cause the option to satisfy the ownership test of paragraph (d)(3) of this section, the control test of paragraph (d)(4) of this section, or the income test of paragraph (d)(5) of this section; and
(B) Except as provided in § 1.382-2T(m)(4)(vi) (which relates to the effective date of the rules provided in § 1.382-2T(h)(4) and includes a special rule related to options that are actually exercised within 120 days after they are treated as exercised under that section), the actual exercise of the option, if by the person who owned the option immediately after the ownership change (or by a transferee of the option who acquired the option, directly or indirectly, from that person in one or more transfers described in paragraph (d)(11) of this section), will not contribute to an ownership change on any testing date on or after the date of exercise.
(vi)
Election to apply § 1.382-2T(h)(4)
—(A)
In general.
If a loss corporation makes an election under this paragraph (h)(2)(vi), §§ 1.382-2T(a)(2)(i) and (h)(4) (relating to testing dates and option attribution) apply (instead of the definition of testing date in § 1.382-2(a)(4) and paragraph (d) of this section) for the purpose of determining whether an ownership change occurs—
(
1
) On any testing date on or before May 17, 1994, or
(
2
) In the case of a loss corporation that is under the jurisdiction of a court in a title 11 or similar case filed on or before May 17, 1994, subject to § 1.382-9(o)(1), on any testing date at or before the time the plan of reorganization becomes effective.
(B)
Additional consequences of election.
If a loss corporation makes an election under this paragraph (h)(2)(vi)—
(
1
) In determining whether any convertible preferred stock issued by the loss corporation during the period that the election is in effect is treated as stock or as an option, the convertible preferred stock is treated as if it were issued on November 4, 1992, and
(
2
) The special effective date for the control test provided in paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of this section does not apply to any option with respect to stock of the loss corporation.
(C)
Time and manner of making the election.
The election described in paragraph (h)(2)(vi)(A) of this section is made by attaching a statement to the loss corporation's income tax return for the first taxable year ending after November 4, 1992, in which a testing date (within the meaning of § 1.382-2T(a)(2)(i)) occurs, or if such return is filed on or before May 17, 1994, with its first return filed after May 17, 1994. However, a loss corporation that is under the jurisdiction of a court in a title 11 or similar case filed on or before May 17, 1994, may make the election described in paragraph (h)(2)(vi)(A) by attaching a statement to its tax return for its first taxable year ending after that date. The statement must say “THIS IS AN ELECTION UNDER § 1.382-4(h)(2)(vi) TO APPLY § 1.382-2T(h)(4) ON OR AFTER NOVEMBER 5, 1992.” Any amended returns required by paragraph (h)(2)(vi)(D) of this section must accompany the return with which the election is made. An election under paragraph (h)(2)(vi)(A) of this section is irrevocable.
(D)
Amended returns.
If an election under this paragraph (h)(2)(vi) affects the amount of taxable income or loss for a prior taxable year, the loss corporation (or the common parent of any consolidated group of which the loss corporation was a member for the year) must file an amended return for the year that reflects the effect of the election.
(3)
Special rule for options subject to attribution under § 1.382-2T(h)(4).
Section § 1.382-2T(h)(4)(i) does not apply to any option designated by the Internal Revenue Service in the Internal Revenue Bulletin as being excepted from the operation of § 1.382-2T(h)(4)(i).
[T.D. 8531, 59 FR 12837, Mar. 18, 1994, as amended by T.D. 8825, 64 FR 36178, July 2, 1999]
§ 1.382-5
Section 382 limitation.
(a)
Scope.
Following an ownership change, the section 382 limitation for any post-change year is an amount equal to the value of the loss corporation multiplied by the long-term tax-exempt rate that applies with respect to the ownership change, and adjusted as required by section 382 and the regulations thereunder. See, for example, section 382(b)(2) (relating to the carryforward of unused section 382 limitation), section 382(b)(3)(B) (relating to the section 382 limitation for the post-change year that includes the change date), section 382(m)(2) (relating to short taxable years), and section 382(h) (relating to recognized built-in gains and section 338 gains).
(b)
Computation of value.
[Reserved]
(c)
Short taxable year.
The section 382 limitation for any post-change year that is less than 365 days is the amount that bears the same ratio to the section 382 limitation determined under section 382(b)(1) as the number of days in the post-change year bears to 365. The section 382 limitation, as so determined, is adjusted as required by section 382 and the regulations thereunder. This paragraph (c) does not apply to a 52-53 week taxable year that is less than 365 days unless a return is required under section 443 (relating to short periods) for such year.
(d)
Successive ownership changes and absorption of a section 382 limitation
—(1)
In general.
If a loss corporation has two (or more) ownership changes, any losses or section 382 disallowed business interest carryforwards ((within the meaning of § 1.382-2(a)(7)) attributable to the period preceding the earlier ownership change are treated as pre-change losses with respect to both ownership changes. Thus, the later ownership change may result in a lesser (but never in a greater) section 382 limitation with respect to such pre-change losses. In any case, the amount of taxable income for any post-change year that can be offset by pre-change losses may not exceed the section 382 limitation for such ownership change, reduced by the amount of taxable income offset by pre-change losses subject to any earlier ownership change(s).
(2)
Recognized built-in gains and losses.
[Reserved]
(3)
Effective date.
This paragraph (d) applies to taxable years of a loss corporation beginning on or after January 1, 1997.
(e)
Controlled groups.
See § 1.382-8 for rules for determining the value of a loss corporation that is a member of a controlled group.
(f)
Effective date.
Except as otherwise provided, this section applies to a loss corporation that has an ownership change to which section 382(a), as amended by the Tax Reform Act of 1986, applies. Paragraph (d)(1) of this section applies with respect to an ownership change occurring on or after November 13, 2020. For loss corporations that have undergone an ownership change before or after November 13, 2020, see § 1.382-5 as contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised April 1, 2019. However, taxpayers and their related parties, within the meaning of sections 267(b) and 707(b)(1), may choose to apply the rules of this section to testing dates occurring during a taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017, so long as the taxpayers and their related parties consistently apply the rules of this section, the section 163(j) regulations (as defined in § 1.163(j)-1(b)(37)), §§ 1.382-1, 1.382-2, 1.382-6, 1.382-7, 1.383-0, and 1.383-1, and, if applicable, §§ 1.263A-9, 1.263A-15, 1.381(c)(20)-1, 1.469-9, 1.469-11, 1.704-1, 1.882-5, 1.1362-3, 1.1368-1, 1.1377-1, 1.1502-13, 1.1502-21, 1.1502-36, 1.1502-79, 1.1502-91 through 1.1502-99 (to the extent they effectuate the rules of §§ 1.382-2, 1.382-5, 1.382-6, and 1.383-1), and 1.1504-4, to that taxable year.
[T.D. 8679, 61 FR 33316, June 27, 1996, as amended by T.D. 8825, 64 FR 36178, July 2, 1999; T.D. 9905, 85 FR 56835, Sept. 14, 2020]
§ 1.382-6
Allocation of income and loss to periods before and after the change date for purposes of section 382.
(a)
General rule
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section, a loss corporation must allocate its net operating loss or taxable income (see section 382(k)(4)), and its net capital loss (see section 1222(10)) or modified capital gain net income (as defined in paragraph (g)(4) of this section), for the change year between the pre-change period and the post-change period by ratably allocating an equal portion to each day in the year.
(2)
Allocation of business interest expense
—(i)
Scope.
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, this paragraph (a)(2) applies if a loss corporation has business interest expense (as defined in § 1.163(j)-1(b)(3)) in the change year. The rules of this paragraph (a)(2) apply to determine the amount of current-year business interest expense (as defined in § 1.163(j)-1(b)(9)) that is deducted in the change year. These rules also apply to determine the amount of any current-year business interest expense that is characterized as disallowed business interest expense (as defined in § 1.163(j)-1(b)(10)) allocable to the pre-change period and the post-change period, and to allocate disallowed business interest expense carryforwards (as defined in § 1.163(j)-1(b)(11)) to the change year for deduction in the pre-change period and the post-change period.
(ii)
Deductibility of business interest expense.
The rules of this paragraph (a)(2)(ii) apply in the following order.
(A) First, the loss corporation calculates its section 163(j) limitation (as defined in § 1.163(j)-1(b)(36)) for the change year.
(B) Second, the loss corporation calculates its deductible current-year BIE and deducts this amount in determining its taxable income or net operating loss for the change year. For purposes of this paragraph (a)(2)(ii), the term
deductible current-year BIE
means the loss corporation's current-year business interest expense (including its floor plan financing interest expense, as defined in § 1.163(j)-1(b)(19)), to the extent of its section 163(j) limitation.
(C) Third, if the loss corporation has disallowed business interest expense paid or accrued (without regard to section 163(j)) in the change year that is carried forward to post-change years, it allocates an equal portion of that disallowed business interest expense to each day in the change year. Any amount of disallowed business interest expense that is allocated to the pre-change period pursuant to this paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(C) is carried forward subject to section 382(d)(3). Any amount of disallowed business interest expense that is allocated to the post-change period pursuant to this paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(C) is carried forward and is not subject to section 382(d)(3).
(D) Fourth, if the loss corporation has excess section 163(j) limitation,
then the loss corporation calculates its deductible disallowed business interest expense carryforward and allocates an equal portion to each day in the change year. For purposes of this paragraph (a)(2)(ii), the term
excess section 163(j) limitation
means the excess, if any, of the loss corporation's section 163(j) limitation over its deductible current-year BIE, and the term
deductible disallowed business interest expense carryforward
means the loss corporation's disallowed business interest expense carryforward to the extent of its excess section 163(j) limitation.
(E) Fifth, the loss corporation deducts its deductible disallowed business interest expense carryforward that was allocated to the pre-change period under paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(D) of this section. Subject to the application of sections 382(b)(3)(B) and 382(d)(3), the loss corporation deducts its deductible disallowed business interest expense carryforward that was allocated to the post-change period under paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(D) of this section. Any amount of disallowed business interest expense carryforward that is not deducted pursuant to this paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(E) is carried forward subject to section 382(d)(3).
(b)
Closing-of-the-books election
—(1)
In general.
Subject to paragraphs (b)(3)(ii), (b)(4), and (d) of this section, a loss corporation may elect to allocate its net operating loss or taxable income and its net capital loss or modified capital gain net income for the change year between the pre-change period and the post-change period as if the loss corporation's books were closed on the change date. An election under this paragraph (b)(1) does not terminate the loss corporation's taxable year as of the change date (e.g., the change year is a single tax year for purposes of section 172).
(2)
Making the closing-of-the-books election
—(i)
Time and manner.
A loss corporation makes the closing-of-the-books election by including the following statement on the information statement required by § 1.382-11(a) for the change year: “THE CLOSING-OF-THE-BOOKS ELECTION UNDER § 1.382-6(b) IS HEREBY MADE WITH RESPECT TO THE OWNERSHIP CHANGE OCCURRING ON [INSERT DATE].” The election must be made on or before the due date (including extensions) of the loss corporation's income tax return for the change year.
(ii)
Election irrevocable.
An election under this paragraph (b) is irrevocable.
(3)
Special rules relating to consolidated and controlled groups
—(i)
Consolidated groups.
If an election under this paragraph (b) is made with respect to an ownership change occurring in a consolidated return year, all allocations under this section with respect to that ownership change must be consistent with the election.
(ii)
Controlled groups.
If paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section does not apply, and if, as part of the same plan or arrangement, two or more members of a controlled group (as defined in section 1563(a), determined by substituting “50 percent” for “80 percent” each place that it appears, and without regard to section 1563(a)(4)), have ownership changes and continue to be members of the controlled group (or become members of the same other controlled group), a closing-of-the-books election applies only if the election is made by all members having the ownership changes.
(4)
Allocation of business interest expense
—(i)
Scope.
This paragraph (b)(4) applies if a loss corporation makes a closing-of-the-books election pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section and has business interest expense in the change year. The rules of this paragraph (b)(4) apply to determine the amount of deductible current-year business interest expense that is allocable to the pre-change period and the post-change period for purposes of the allocations referred to in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. These rules also apply to determine the amount of any current-year business interest expense that is characterized as disallowed business interest expense allocable to the pre-change period and the post-change period, and to allocate disallowed business interest expense carryforwards to the change year between the pre-change period and the post-change period for deduction.
(ii)
Deductibility of business interest expense.
The rules of this paragraph (b)(4)(ii) apply in the order provided.
(A) The loss corporation calculates its ATI limit, which is the product of
its ATI (as defined in § 1.163(j)-1(b)(1)) for the change year and 30 percent. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(4)(ii), the terms
pre-change ATI limit
and
post-change ATI limit
mean the amount of ATI limit allocated to the pre-change period or the post-change period, respectively, computed by allocating an equal portion of the ATI limit to each day in the change year.
(B) Pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the loss corporation allocates its current-year business interest expense (including its floor plan financing interest expense) and its business interest income (as defined in § 1.163(j)-1(b)(4)) to the pre-change and post-change periods as if the loss corporation's books were closed on the change date. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(4)(ii), the terms
pre-change BIE
and
post-change BIE
mean the amount of the loss corporation's current-year business interest expense that is allocated to the pre-change period or the post-change period, respectively, under this paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(B).
(C) The loss corporation deducts its pre-change BIE to the extent of its pre-change section 163(j) limit, and the loss corporation deducts its post-change BIE to the extent of its post-change section 163(j) limit. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(4)(ii), the term
pre-change section 163(j) limit
means the sum of the pre-change ATI and the amount of business interest income and floor plan financing interest expense allocated to the pre-change period; the term
post-change section 163(j) limit
means the sum of the post-change ATI limit and the amount of business interest income and floor plan financing interest expense allocated to the post-change period.
(D) If any pre-change BIE or post-change BIE has not been deducted under paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(C) of this section, the loss corporation deducts either any pre-change BIE that has not been deducted to the extent of its surplus post-change section 163(j) limit or any post-change BIE that has not been deducted to the extent of its surplus pre-change section 163(j) limit. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(4)(ii), the term
surplus pre-change section 163(j) limit
means the amount by which the pre-change section 163(j) limit exceeds the amount of pre-change BIE deducted pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(C) of this section; the term
surplus post-change section 163(j) limit
means the amount by which the post-change section 163(j) limit exceeds the amount of post-change BIE deducted pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(C) of this section.
(E) If the loss corporation has any excess pre-change section 163(j) limit or excess post-change section 163(j) limit, the loss corporation allocates its disallowed business interest expense carryforward, if any, ratably between the pre-change and post-change periods based upon the relative amounts of excess pre-change section 163(j) limit and excess post-change section 163(j) limit. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(4)(ii), the term
excess pre-change section 163(j) limit
means the amount by which the surplus pre-change section 163(j) limit exceeds the amount of post-change BIE deducted pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(D) of this section; the term
excess post-change section 163(j) limit
means the amount by which the surplus post-change section 163(j) limit exceeds the amount of pre-change BIE deducted pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(D) of this section.
(F) The loss corporation deducts its disallowed business interest expense carryforward that was allocated to the pre-change period under paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(E) of this section to the extent of its excess pre-change section 163(j) limit. Subject to the application of sections 382(b)(3)(B) and 382(d)(3), the loss corporation deducts its disallowed business interest expense carryforward that was allocated to the post-change period under paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(E) of this section to the extent of its excess post-change section 163(j) limit. Any amount of disallowed business interest expense carryforward that is not deducted pursuant to this paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(F) is subject to section 382(d)(3) irrespective of the period to which it was allocated pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(E) of this section.

Example 1
—(A)
Facts.
X is a calendar-year domestic C corporation that is not a member of a consolidated group. As of January 1, 2021, X has no disallowed business interest expense carryforwards. On October 19, 2021, X
experiences an ownership change under section 382(g). For calendar year 2021, X's ATI is $500. For the period beginning on January 1, 2021 and ending on October 19, 2021, X pays or accrues $250 of current-year business interest expense that is deductible but for the potential application of section 163(j), including $50 of floor plan financing interest expense, and X has $60 of business interest income. For the period beginning on October 20, 2021 and ending on December 31, 2021, X pays or accrues $100 of current-year business interest expense that is deductible but for the potential application of section 163(j), including $40 of floor plan financing interest expense, and X has $70 of business interest income. X makes a closing-of-the-books election pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section.

Analysis
—(
1
)
Calculation and allocation of ATI limit.
For purposes of allocating its net operating loss or taxable income for the change year between the pre-change period and the post-change period under § 1.382-6, X applies paragraph (b)(4) of this section to allocate items related to section 163(j). X's ATI for calendar year 2021 is $500x. Therefore, pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(A) of this section, X's ATI limit is $150 ($500 × 30 percent). Additionally, pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(A) of this section, X's pre-change ATI limit is $120 ($150 × (292 days/365 days)), and X's post-change ATI limit is $30 ($150 × (73 days/365 days)).
(

)
Determination of pre-change BIE and post-change BIE.
Pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(B) of this section, X's pre-change BIE and post-change BIE are $250 and $100, respectively.
(
3
)
Determination of pre-change section 163(j) limit and post-change section 163(j) limit.
Pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(C) of this section, X's pre-change section 163(j) limit is $230 ($120 (X's pre-change ATI limit) + $60 (X's business interest income allocated to the pre-change period) + $50 (X's floor plan financing interest expense allocated to the pre-change period)). Additionally, pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(C) of this section, X's post-change section 163(j) limit is $140 ($30 (X's post-change ATI limit) + $70 (X's business interest income allocated to the post-change period) + $40 (X's floor plan financing interest expense allocated to the post-change period)).
(
4
)
Initial deduction of BIE.
Pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(C) of this section, X deducts $230 (its pre-change section 163(j) limit) of its $250 pre-change BIE and all $100 (less than its $140 post-change section 163(j) limit) of its post-change BIE.
(
5
)
Deduction of BIE due to surplus post-change section 163(j) limit.
After applying paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(C) of this section, X has $20 of pre-change BIE that has not been deducted ($250−$230) and a surplus post-change section 163(j) limit of $40 ($140−$100). As a result, pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(D) of this section, X deducts its remaining $20 of pre-change BIE. (If, after applying paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(C) of this section, X instead had $20 of post-change BIE that had not yet been deducted and a $40 surplus pre-change section 163(j) limit, then X would deduct its remaining $20 of post-change BIE pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(D) of this section.)
(iv)
Example 2
—
Potential deduction of disallowed business interest expense carryforwards.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (b)(4)(iii)(A) of this section, except that, as of January 1, 2021, X has $90 of disallowed business interest expense carryforwards and $150 (rather than $250) of pre-change BIE. X's pre-change section 163(j) limit and post-change section 163(j) limit are the same as in paragraph (b)(4)(iii)(B)(
3
) of this section. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(C) of this section, X deducts all $150 of its pre-change BIE and all $100 of its post-change BIE. X has no remaining pre-change BIE or post-change BIE to deduct under paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(D) of this section. Paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(E) of this section applies because X has $80 of excess pre-change section 163(j) limit ($230−$150) and $40 of excess post-change section 163(j) limit ($140−$100). Under paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(E) of this section, X allocates $60 of its disallowed business interest expense carryforwards to the pre-change period ($90 × ($80/($80 + $40))) and $30 of its disallowed business interest expense carryforwards to the post-change period ($90 × ($40/($80 + $40))). As provided in paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(F) of
this section, X deducts all $60 of its disallowed business interest expense carryforwards that are allocated to the pre-change period; subject to the application of section 382, X deducts all $30 of its disallowed business interest expense carryforwards that are allocated to the post-change period.
(c)
Operating rules for determining net operating loss, taxable income, net capital loss, modified capital gain net income, and special allocations.
For purposes of this section, for the change year—
(1)
In general
—(i) Net operating loss or taxable income is determined without regard to gains or losses on the sale or exchange of capital assets; and
(ii) Net operating loss or taxable income and net capital loss or modified capital gain net income are determined without regard to the section 382 limitation and do not include the following items, which are allocated entirely to the post-change period—
(A) Any income, gain, loss, or deduction to which section 382(h)(5)(A) applies; and
(B) Any income or gain recognized on the disposition of assets transferred to the loss corporation during the post-change period for a principal purpose of ameliorating the section 382 limitation.
(2)
Adjustment to net operating loss
—(i)
Determination of remaining capital gain.
The amount of modified capital gain net income (defined in paragraph (g)(4) of this section) allocated to each period is offset by capital losses to which section 382(h)(5)(A) applies and capital loss carryovers, subject to the section 382 limitation (in the case of modified capital gain net income allocated to the post-change period).
(ii)
Reduction of net operating loss by remaining capital gain.
The amount of net operating loss allocated to each period is reduced (but not below zero) without regard to the section 382 limitation, first by the modified capital gain net income remaining in the same period, and then by the modified capital gain net income remaining in the other period.
(d)
Coordination with rules relating to the allocation of income under § 1.1502-76(b).
If § 1.1502-76 applies (relating to the taxable year of members of a consolidated group), an allocation of items under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section is determined after applying § 1.1502-76. Thus, if a short taxable year under § 1.1502-76 is a change year for which an allocation under this section is to be made, the allocation under this section applies only to the items allocated to that short taxable year under § 1.1502-76.
(e)
Allocation of certain credits.
The principles of this section apply for purposes of allocating, under section 383, excess foreign taxes under section 904(c), current year business credits under section 38, and the minimum tax credit under section 53. The loss corporation must use the same method of allocation (ratable allocation or closing-of-the-books) for purposes of sections 382 and 383.
(f)
Examples.
The rules of this section are illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
(i) Assume that the loss corporation, L, a calendar year taxpayer with a May 26, 1995, change date, determines a section 382 limitation under section 382(b)(1) of $100,000. Thus, for the change year, its section 382 limitation is $100,000 × (219/365) = $60,000. L makes the closing-of-the- books election under paragraph (b) of this section.
(ii) Assume that L has a $150,000 capital loss carryover (from its 1994 taxable year) and a $300,000 net operating loss carryover (from its 1994 taxable year) to the change year. L recognizes, in the pre-change period, $200,000 of ordinary loss, and, in the post-change period, $150,000 of capital gain and $100,000 of ordinary income. Assume that section 382(h) does not apply to the capital gain or the ordinary income.
(iii) L has a $100,000 net operating loss for the change year ($200,000 pre-change loss less $100,000 post-change income), as determined under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section. Because L has no current year capital losses, L's $150,000 capital gain recognized in the post-change period is its modified capital gain net income for the change year (as defined at paragraph (g)(4) of this section). L allocates $100,000 of net operating loss to the pre-change period and $150,000 of modified capital gain net income to the post-change period.
(iv) Under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, L uses its capital loss carryover to offset its modified capital gain net income allocated to the post-change period, subject to its section 382 limitation. L's section 382 limitation is $60,000, so L uses $60,000 of its capital loss carryover to offset $60,000 of its $150,000 modified capital gain net income. L has absorbed its entire section 382 limitation
for the change year and has $90,000 of modified capital gain net income remaining in the post-change period.
(v) Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, L offsets its $100,000 net operating loss allocated to the pre-change period by the $90,000 of modified capital gain net income remaining in the post-change period, without regard to the section 382 limitation, thereby reducing its pre-change net operating loss to $10,000.
(vi) From its 1994 taxable year, L will carry over $90,000 of capital loss and $300,000 of net operating loss to its 1996 taxable year. From its 1995 taxable year, L will carry over $10,000 of net operating loss subject to the section 382 limitation to its 1996 taxable year.

# Example 2.
(i) Assume the facts of
Example 1,
except that L does not make the closing-of-the-books election under paragraph (b) of this section.
(ii) L ratably allocates its $100,000 net operating loss and its $150,000 of modified capital gain net income for the change year. $40,000 of net operating loss ($100,000 × (146/365)) and $60,000 of modified capital gain net income ($150,000 × (146/365)) are allocated to the pre-change period. $60,000 of net operating loss ($100,000 × (219/365)) and $90,000 of modified capital gain net income ($150,000 × (219/365)) are allocated to the post-change period.
(iii) Under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, L uses its capital loss carryovers to offset modified capital gain net income. The capital loss carryovers offset the $60,000 modified capital gain net income allocated to the pre-change period without limitation. Subject to the section 382 limitation, the remaining $90,000 of capital loss carryovers offset the modified capital gain net income allocated to the post-change period. Accordingly, L uses $60,000 of its capital loss carryovers to offset $60,000 of its $90,000 modified capital gain net income allocated to the post-change period. L has absorbed its entire section 382 limitation for the change year.
(iv) Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, L's $60,000 net operating loss allocated to the post-change period is offset by its remaining $30,000 of post-change modified capital gain net income, reducing its post-change net operating loss to $30,000.
(v) From its 1994 taxable year, L will carry over $30,000 of capital loss and $300,000 of net operating loss to its 1996 taxable year. From its 1995 taxable year, L will carry over $70,000 of net operating loss ($40,000 pre-change + $30,000 post-change) to its 1996 taxable year. The $40,000 pre-change portion of that carryover is subject to the section 382 limitation.
(g)

§ 1.382-8
Controlled groups.
(a)
Introduction.
This section provides rules to adjust the value of a loss corporation that is a member of a controlled group of corporations on a change date so that the same value is not included more than once in computing the limitations under section 382 for the loss corporations that are members of the controlled group. In general, the adjustment is made under paragraph (c) of this section by reducing the value of the loss corporation by the value of the stock of each component member of the controlled group that the loss corporation owns immediately after the ownership change. The loss corporation's value may, however, be increased under paragraph (c) of this section by any amount of value that the other member elects to restore to the loss corporation.

A controlled group loss is a pre-change loss (or a net unrealized built-in loss) of a loss corporation that is attributable to a taxable year of the corporation with respect to which the corporation is a component member of a controlled group (as defined by paragraphs (e)(2) and (3) of this section). The controlled group with respect to each controlled group loss is composed of the loss corporation and each other corporation that is a component member of a controlled group that includes the loss corporation both—
(1)(i) With respect to the taxable year to which the controlled group loss is attributable; and
(1)(ii) On the date the loss corporation has an ownership change.
(2)
Presumption regarding net unrealized built-in loss.
For purposes of determining whether a net unrealized built-in loss of a loss corporation is attributable to a taxable year (the determination year) with respect to which the corporation is a component member of a controlled group, the built-in loss in a prior change date asset is deemed to be attributable to a period ending before the determination year. A prior change date asset is any asset held by the loss corporation at all times during the period beginning on
the change date of its most recent ownership change after 1986 (the first change date), and ending on the first day of the determination year. The built-in loss in a prior change date asset is the amount by which the adjusted basis of the asset on the first change date exceeds the fair market value of the asset on that date. The principles of this paragraph (b)(2) also apply to items described in section 382(h)(6)(B).
(c)
Computation of value.
For purposes of computing the limitation under section 382 with respect to each controlled group loss, the value of the stock of each component member of the controlled group with respect to that loss is determined immediately before the ownership change, and is adjusted by applying the following rules:
(1)
Reduction in value.
The value of the stock of each component member is reduced by the value (immediately before the ownership change and without regard to any restoration of value or other adjustment under this section) of the stock of any other component member directly owned by the component member immediately after the ownership change.
(2)
Restoration of value.
After the value of the stock of each component member is reduced pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the value of the stock of each component member is increased by the amount of value, if any, restored to the component member by another component member (the electing member) pursuant to this paragraph (c)(2). The electing member may elect (or may be deemed to elect under paragraph (h)(2)(i) of this section in the case of a foreign component member) to restore value to another component member in an amount that does not exceed the lesser of—
(i) The sum of—
(A) The value, determined immediately before the ownership change, of the electing member's stock (after adjustment under paragraph (c)(1) of this section and before any restoration of value under this paragraph (c)(2)); plus
(B) Any amount of value restored to the electing member by another component member under this paragraph (c)(2); or
(ii) The value, determined immediately before any ownership change, of the electing member's stock (without regard to any adjustment under this section) that is directly owned by the other component member immediately after the ownership change.
(3)
Reduction in value by the amount restored.
The value of the stock of the electing member is reduced by any amount of value that the electing member elects to restore under paragraph (c)(2) of this section to another component member.
(4)
Appropriate adjustments.
Appropriate additional adjustments consistent with paragraphs (c)(1), (2), and (3) of this section must be made to prevent any duplication of value. Thus, for example, adjustments must be made to reflect—
(i) Any indirect ownership interest in another component member;
(ii) Any cross ownership of stock by component members of the controlled group with respect to the controlled group loss; and
(iii) Any value used to determine a limitation under section 382 with respect to controlled group losses from the same period.
(5)
Certain reductions in the value of members of a controlled group.
A loss corporation that has an ownership change is required to make adjustments consistent with this paragraph (c) with respect to its stock if the stock of another corporation in which it had a direct or indirect ownership interest was disposed of before the ownership change, and;
(i) Both corporations were component members of a controlled group—
(A) With respect to a taxable year to which a controlled group loss of the loss corporation is attributable; and
(B) At any time during the 2 year period before the ownership change; and
(ii) Both corporations are component members of a controlled group at any time during the 2 year period following the ownership change.
(d)
No double reduction.
To the extent consistent with the purposes of this section, section 382 and this section shall not be applied to duplicate a reduction in the value of a loss corporation. Thus, for example, if the value of
a loss corporation is reduced under section 382(l)(1) to reflect a capital contribution of stock of a component member, it is not again reduced by such amount under paragraph (c)(1) of this section. If this paragraph (d) applies to prevent a reduction in value from being duplicated, the application of the other rules of this section, such as those relating to the restoration of value, is correspondingly limited in a manner consistent with the principles of this section.
(e)
Definitions and nomenclature
—(1)
Definitions in section 382 and the regulations thereunder.
Except as otherwise provided, the definitions and nomenclature contained in section 382 and the regulations thereunder apply to this section.
(2)
Controlled group.
Controlled group has the same meaning as in section 1563(a), determined by substituting “50 percent” for “80 percent” each place that it appears, and without regard to section 1563(a)(4).
(3)
Component member.
Component member has the same meaning as in section 1563(b), determined by substituting “December 31 (or the change date, if earlier)” for “December 31” each place it appears, and without regard to section 1563 (b)(2), (b)(3)(C), and (b)(4).
(4)
Foreign component member
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of this section, foreign component member means a component member that is a foreign corporation.
(ii)
Exception.
A foreign component member shall not include a foreign corporation that has items treated as connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States that it takes into account in determining its value pursuant to section 382(e)(3).
(5)
Predecessor and successor corporation.
As the context may require, a reference to a corporation, or component member includes a reference to a predecessor or successor corporation.
(f)
Coordination between consolidated groups and controlled groups.
Some or all of the component members of a controlled group may also be members of a consolidated group, and a controlled group loss may be subject to a consolidated section 382 limitation or subgroup section 382 limitation determined under § 1.1502-93. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (f) and §§ 1.1502-91 through 1.1502-99, § 1.1502-93 applies instead of this section when both sections, by their terms, are otherwise applicable. This section is applicable and may require an adjustment to value if a member of a consolidated group, a loss group, or loss subgroup (as those terms are defined in §§ 1.1502-1(h) and 1.1502-91) is also a component member of a controlled group with respect to a controlled group loss. Solely for purposes of applying this section, a consolidated group, loss group, or loss subgroup is treated as a single corporation. Thus to determine the limitation with respect to any portion of the pre-change consolidated attributes or pre-change subgroup attributes of the loss group or loss subgroup that is a controlled group loss, the consolidated section 382 limitation or subgroup section 382 limitation is computed by treating the loss group or the loss subgroup as a single corporation, and adjusting value in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. See paragraph (g)
Example 4
of this section.
(g)
Examples.
For purposes of the examples in this section, unless otherwise stated, the nomenclature and assumptions of the examples in § 1.382-2T(b) apply, all corporations file separate income tax returns on a calendar year basis, the only 5-percent shareholder of a corporation is a public group, and the facts set forth the only owner shifts with respect to the corporations during the testing period.

# Example 1. Controlled group with respect to a controlled group loss.
(a) Public L owns all of the L stock, L and Public L1 own 30 percent and 70 percent, respectively, of the L1 stock, and L1 owns all of the corporation T stock. L1 has a net operating loss arising in Year 1 that is carried over to Year 4. L has a net operating loss arising in Year 2 that is carried over to Year 4. On August 1, Year 3, L acquires 30 percent of the stock of L1, thereby increasing its percentage ownership interest in L1 to 60 percent. On December 1, Year 3, L1 purchases all of the stock of corporation S from Public S. On November 1, Year 4, P acquires all of the L stock. The acquisition by P of all of the L stock on November 1, Year 4, causes ownership changes of both L
and L1 under the rules of § 1.382-2T. The following is a graphic illustration of these facts.
ER02JY99.019
(b)(1) Under paragraph (b) of this section, the Year 1 net operating loss carryover of L1 is a controlled group loss because L1 is a component member of a controlled group with respect to Year 1, the year to which the loss is attributable. L1 and T compose a controlled group with respect to the net operating loss carryover because L1 and T are component members of a controlled group both—
(A) With respect to the taxable year to which L1's net operating loss carryover is attributable (i.e., Year 1); and
(B) On November 1, Year 4, L1's change date. Although L and S are component members of L1's controlled group on L1's change date, they are not component members of the controlled group with respect to the Year 1 net operating loss carryover because they were not component members with respect to the year to which the net operating loss carryover is attributable.
(2) The value of L1's stock must therefore be adjusted in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section to take into account an adjustment with respect to the T stock (but not the S stock) in computing L1's limitation under section 382 with respect to its net operating loss carryover.
(c) Although L is a member of a controlled group composed of L, L1, S, and T on November 1, Year 4, L's change date, it is not a component member of a controlled group with respect to Year 2, the taxable year to which its net operating loss carryover is attributable. Therefore, L's Year 2 net operating loss carryover is not a controlled group loss under paragraph (b) of this section and the value of L's stock is not adjusted in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section to compute L's limitation under section 382 with respect to the Year 2 net operating loss carryover.

# Example 2. Adjustments to value of the controlled group members.
(a) Since Year 1, A has owned all of the stock of L, L and B have owned 80 percent and 20 percent, respectively, of the stock of corporation P, and P and C have owned 75 percent and 25 percent, respectively, of the stock of L1. L and L1 each has a net operating loss for the Year 6 taxable year that is carried over to its respective Year 7 taxable year. On December 1, Year 7, A sells all of the L stock to D. The sale results in ownership changes of both L and L1. Immediately before the ownership changes, the total value of the L1 stock is $40, the total value of the P stock (including the value of its L1 stock) is $100, and the total value of the L stock (including the value of the P stock) is $200. The following is a graphic illustration of these facts.
ER02JY99.020
(b) Under paragraph (b) of this section, the Year 6 net operating loss carryovers of each of L and L1 are controlled group losses because each of L and L1 is a component member of a controlled group with respect to Year 6, the year to which the losses are attributable. L, P, and L1 compose controlled groups with respect to both Year 6 net operating loss carryovers because L, P, and L1 are component members of a controlled group both—
(1) With respect to the taxable years to which the net operating loss carryovers are attributable (i.e., Year 6); and
(2) On December 1, Year 7, the change date.
(c) The value of the stock of L1 for purposes of determining its limitation under section 382 with respect to its net operating loss carryover from Year 6 is $40. L1 does not elect to restore any value to P paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
(d) The value of the stock of P ($100) is reduced under paragraph (c)(1) of this section by the value of the stock of L1 that it directly owns, $30 (75% × $40). Following the adjustment, the value of the stock of P is $70. P elects to restore this entire $70 of value to L.
(e) The value of the stock of L, $200, is reduced under paragraph (c)(1) of this section by the value of the stock of P it directly owns, i.e., $80 (80% × $100), and increased paragraph (c)(2) of this section by the amount P elects to restore to L, i.e., $70. Thus, the value of the L stock for purposes of determining L's limitation under section 382 with respect to its net operating loss carryover from Year 6 is $190 ($200−$80 + $70).

# Example 3. Limitation on restoration of value.
(a) The facts are the same as in
Example 2,
except that L1 elects to restore $20 to P. For purposes of determining L1's limitation under section 382 with respect to the Year 6 net operating loss carryover, the value of the stock of L1 is $20 ($40−$20) because the value of its stock is reduced under paragraph (c)(3) of this section by the $20 of value it elects to restore to P.
(b) The value of the stock of P ($100) is reduced under paragraph (c)(1) of this section by the value of the L1 stock it directly owns ($30), and is increased paragraph (c)(2) of this section by the value that L1 elects to restore to P ($20). Thus, the value of the P stock is $90 ($100−$30 + $20).
(c)(1) P elects to restore to L the maximum value permitted under this section. The value of the stock of L, $200, is reduced under paragraph (c)(1) of this section by the value of the P stock it directly owns ($80), and is increased by the value that P elects to restore to L. P may elect to restore to L the lesser of—
(A) The sum of the value of its stock immediately after adjustment under paragraph (c)(1) of this section (i.e., $70) plus the value restored to it by L1 (i.e., $20) (a total of $90); or
(B) The value of the P stock (without regard to the adjustment required by paragraph (c)(1) and (2) of this section) that is directly owned by L immediately before the ownership change (i.e., $80).
(2) Thus, $80 is the maximum amount that P may elect to restore to L. Following the restoration of value by P, the value of the L stock for purposes of determining L's limitation under section 382 is $200 ($200 −$80 + $80).

# Example 4. Coordination with consolidated return regulations.
(a) P and its wholly owned subsidiary L file a consolidated return. L owns 79 percent of the outstanding stock of L1. P acquired the stock of L in Year 1 and L acquired the stock of L1 in Year 2. The P consolidated group has a consolidated net operating loss arising in the Year 6 consolidated return year that is carried over to Year 8. L1 has a net operating loss arising in its Year 6 taxable year that is also carried over to Year 8. On January 1, Year 8, the P consolidated group has an ownership change under § 1.1502-92(b)(1)(i) and L1 has an ownership change under § 1.382-2T.
(b)(1) Under paragraph (b) of this section, the Year 6 net operating loss carryover of the P group is a controlled group loss because P, L, and L1 are component members of a controlled group with respect to Year 6, the year to which the loss is attributable. P, L, and L1 compose a controlled group with respect to the Year 6 net operating loss carryover of the P loss group because they are component members of a controlled group both—
(A) With respect to the taxable years to which the net operating loss carryover is attributable (i.e., Year 6); and
(B) On January 1, Year 8, the P group's change date.
(2) Because P and L compose a loss group (within the meaning of § 1.1502-91(c)) with respect to its Year 6 net operating loss carryover, the P loss group must compute a consolidated section 382 limitation with respect to its Year 6 net operating loss carryover as a result of the ownership change.
(c) In computing the consolidated section 382 limitation under § 1.1502-93 with respect to the Year 6 net operating loss carryover, the value of the P stock immediately before the ownership change is reduced under paragraphs (c)(1) and (f) of this section by the value immediately before the ownership change of the L1 stock directly owned by L immediately after the ownership change. L1 may, however, elect to restore such value to the P consolidated group to the extent permitted under paragraph (c)(2) of this section§ 1.382-8T.

# Example 5. Appropriate adjustments for indirect ownership interest.
(a) Individual A owns all of the stock of L, L owns an 80 percent interest in the capital and profits of partnership PS, and PS owns 75 percent of the stock of L1. Both L and L1 have net operating losses for the Year 1 taxable year that are carried over to their respective Year 2 taxable years. On December 19, Year 2, A sells all of the L stock to an unrelated individual. The sale results in an ownership change of L and L1.
(b) Under paragraph (b) of this section, the Year 1 net operating loss carryovers of each of L and L1 are controlled group losses because each of L and L1 is a component member of a controlled group with respect to Year 1, the year to which the losses are attributable. L and L1 compose controlled groups with respect to each corporation's net operating loss carryovers because L and L1 are component members of a controlled group both—
(1) With respect to the taxable years to which the net operating loss carryovers are attributable (i.e., Year 1); and
(2) On December 19, Year 2, the change date.
(c) L has an indirect ownership interest in L1 which, under paragraph (c)(4) of this section, must be taken into account in applying this section. As a result, the value of the L stock for purposes of determining its limitation under section 382 with respect to the Year 1 net operating loss carryover must be reduced by the value of L's indirect ownership interest in the L1 stock (60 percent) that it owns through PS immediately before the ownership change, and is increased by the amount (if any) that L1 elects to restore to L under paragraph (c)(2) of this section. The value of L1 is reduced under paragraph (c)(3) of this section to the extent that L1 elects to restore value to L.

Time and manner of filing election to restore
—(1)
Statements required
—(i)
Filing by loss corporation.
The election to restore value described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section must be in the form set forth in this paragraph
(h)(1)(i). It must be filed by the loss corporation by including a statement on or with its income tax return for the taxable year in which the ownership change occurs (or with an amended return for that year filed on or before the due date (including extensions) of the income tax return of any component member with respect to the taxable year in which the ownership change occurs). The common parent of a consolidated group must make the election on behalf of the group. The election is made in the form of a statement entitled, “STATEMENT PURSUANT TO § 1.382-8(h)(1) TO ELECT TO RESTORE ALL OR PART OF THE VALUE OF [INSERT NAME AND EMPLOYER IDENTIFICATION NUMBER (IF ANY) OF THE ELECTING MEMBER] TO [INSERT NAME AND EMPLOYER IDENTIFICATION NUMBER (IF ANY) OF THE CORPORATION TO WHICH VALUE IS RESTORED].” The statement must include the amount of the value being restored and must also indicate that an agreement signed and dated by both parties, as described in paragraph (h)(1)(iii) of this section, has been entered into. Each such party must retain either the original or a copy of this agreement as part of its records. See § 1.6001-1(e).
(ii)
Filing by electing member.
An electing member must include a statement identical to the one described in paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section on or with its income tax return (or with an amended return for that year filed on or before the due date (including extensions) of the income tax return of any component member with respect to the taxable year in which the ownership change occurs) (if any) for the taxable year which includes the change date in connection with which the election described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section is made. If the electing member is a controlled foreign corporation (within the meaning of section 957), each United States shareholder (within the meaning of section 951(b)) with respect thereto must include this statement on or with its return. It is not necessary for the electing member (or the United States shareholder, as the case may be) to include this statement on or with its return if the loss corporation includes an identical statement on or with the same return for the same election.
(iii)
Agreement.
Both the electing member and the corporation to which value is restored must sign and date an agreement. The agreement must—
(A) Identify the change date for the loss corporation in connection with which the election is made;
(B) State the value of the electing member's stock (without regard to any adjustment under paragraph (c) of this section) immediately before the ownership change;
(C) State the amount of any reduction required under paragraph (c)(1) of this section with respect to stock of the electing member that is owned directly or indirectly by the corporation to which value is restored;
(D) State the amount of value that the electing member elects to restore to the corporation; and
(E) State whether the value of either component member's stock was adjusted pursuant to paragraph (c)(4) of this section.
(2)
Special rule for foreign component members
—(i)
Deemed election to restore full value.
Unless the election described in paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of this section is made for a foreign component member, each foreign component member of the controlled group is deemed to have elected to restore to each other component member the maximum value allowable under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, taking into account the limitations of this section.
(ii)
Election not to restore full value.
(A) A loss corporation may elect to reduce the amount of value restored from a foreign component member (the electing foreign component member) to another component member under paragraph (h)(2)(i) of this section in the form set forth in this paragraph (h)(2)(ii). It must be filed by the loss corporation by including a statement on or with its income tax return for the taxable year in which the ownership change occurs (or with an amended return for that year filed on or before the due date (including extensions) of the income tax return of any component member with respect to the taxable year in which the ownership change occurs). The common parent of a consolidated group must make the
election on behalf of the group. The election is made in the form of a statement entitled, “STATEMENT PURSUANT TO § 1.382-8(h)(2)(ii) TO ELECT NOT TO RESTORE FULL VALUE OF [INSERT NAME AND EMPLOYER IDENTIFICATION NUMBER (IF ANY) OF ELECTING FOREIGN COMPONENT MEMBER] TO [INSERT NAME AND EMPLOYER IDENTIFICATION NUMBER (IF ANY) OF THE CORPORATION TO WHICH SUCH VALUE IS NOT TO BE RESTORED].” The statement must include the amount of the value not being restored and must also indicate that an agreement signed and dated by both parties, as described in paragraph (h)(2)(iii) of this section, has been entered into. Each such party must retain either the original or a copy of the agreement as part of its records. See § 1.6001-1(e).
(B) An electing foreign component member must include a statement identical to the one described in paragraph (h)(2)(ii)(A) of this section on or with its income tax return (or with an amended return for that year filed on or before the due date (including extensions) of the income tax return of any component member with respect to the taxable year in which the ownership change occurs) (if any) for the taxable year which includes the change date in connection with which the election described in paragraph (h)(2)(ii)(A) of this section is made. If the electing foreign component member is a controlled foreign corporation (within the meaning of section 957), each United States shareholder (within the meaning of section 951(b)) with respect thereto must include this statement on or with its return. It is not necessary for the electing foreign component member (or United States shareholder, as the case may be) to include this statement on or with its return if the loss corporation includes an identical statement on or with the same return for the same election.
(iii)
Agreement.
Both the electing foreign component member and the corporation to which full value is not restored must sign and date an agreement. The agreement must—
(A) Identify the change date for the loss corporation in connection with which the election is made;
(B) State the value of the electing foreign component member's stock (without regard to any adjustment under paragraph (c) of this section) immediately before the ownership change;
(C) State the amount of any reduction required under paragraph (c)(1) of this section with respect to stock of the electing foreign component member that is owned directly or indirectly by the corporation to which value is not restored;
(D) State the amount of value that the electing foreign component member elects not to restore to the corporation; and
(E) State whether the value of either component member's stock was adjusted pursuant to paragraph (c)(4) of this section.
(3)
Revocation of election.
An election (other than the deemed election described in paragraph (h)(2)(i) of this section) made under this section is revocable only with the consent of the Commissioner.
(i) [Reserved]
(j)
Effective date
—(1)
In general.
This section applies to a loss corporation that has an ownership change with respect to a controlled group loss on or after January 1, 1997.
(2)
Transition rule
—(i)
In general.
The members of a controlled group on January 1, 1997, that have had an ownership change with respect to a controlled group loss before January 1, 1997, must determine the limitations under section 382 for any post-change year with respect to controlled group losses by using a reasonable method to preclude the value of stock of a component member that was owned directly or indirectly by another member immediately after an ownership change from being taken into account more than once in determining the limitations under section 382 with respect to controlled group losses. If such a reasonable method was not used for a post-change year, subject to the exception in paragraph (j)(3) of this section, the members of the controlled group described in the preceding sentence must reduce their limitations under section 382 for post-change years for which the income tax return is filed after January 1, 1997, to recapture, as
quickly as possible, any limitation that members took into account in excess of the amount that would be allowable under this section.
(ii)
Special transition rule for controlled groups that had ownership changes before January 29, 1991.
For purposes of this section, in the case of an ownership change occurring before January 29, 1991, the controlled group with respect to a controlled group loss does not include a corporation that is not a component member of the controlled group on January 29, 1991. Thus, in the case of an ownership change occurring before January 29, 1991, paragraph (c) of this section does not require that a loss corporation that is a component member of a controlled group to disregard the value of stock of another corporation directly owned immediately after the ownership change in determining the value of its own stock unless the other corporation is a component member of the controlled group on January 29, 1991.
(3)
Amended returns.
A taxpayer that has had an ownership change before January 1, 1997, may file an amended return for any taxable year to modify the amount of a limitation under section 382 with respect to a controlled group loss only if—
(i) The modification complies with the rules contained in this section for computing a limitation under section 382;
(ii) Any other component member of the controlled group with respect to the controlled group loss who elects to restore value and whose taxable income is affected by the election to restore value also files amended returns that comply with such rules; and
(iii) Corresponding adjustments are made in amended returns for all taxable years ending after December 31, 1986.
(4)
Effective/applicability date.
Paragraphs (c)(2), (e)(4) and (h) of this section apply to any taxable year beginning on or after May 30, 2006. However, taxpayers may apply paragraphs (c)(2), (e)(4) and (h) of this section to any original Federal income tax return (including any amended return filed on or before the due date (including extensions) of such original return) timely filed on or after May 30, 2006. For taxable years beginning before May 30, 2006, see § 1.382-8 as contained in 26 CFR part 1 in effect on April 1, 2006.
[T.D. 8679, 61 FR 33316, June 27, 1996, as amended by T.D. 8825, 64 FR 36178, July 2, 1999; T.D. 9264, 71 FR 30599, 30607, May 30, 2006; T.D. 9329, 72 FR 32801, June 14, 2007; T.D. 10018, 89 FR 106851, Dec. 30, 2024]
§ 1.382-9
Special rules under section 382 for corporations under the jurisdiction of a court in a title 11 or similar case.
(a)
Introduction.
Either section 382(l)(5) or section 382(l)(6) may apply to an ownership change which occurs in a title 11 or similar case (as defined in section 368(a)(3)(A)) if the transaction resulting in the ownership change is ordered by the court or is pursuant to a plan approved by the court. Terms and nomenclature used in this section, and not otherwise defined herein (including the nomenclature and assumptions in § 1.382-2T(b) relating to the examples) have the same respective meanings as in section 382 and the regulations thereunder.
(b)
Application of section 382(l)(5).
section 382(a) does not apply to any ownership change if—
(1) The old loss corporation is (immediately before the ownership change) under the jurisdiction of the court in a title 11 or similar case; and
(2) The pre-change shareholders and qualified creditors of the old loss corporation (determined immediately before the ownership change) own (after the ownership change and as a result of being pre-change shareholders or qualified creditors immediately before the ownership change) stock of the new loss corporation (or stock of a controlling corporation if also in bankruptcy) that meets the requirements of section 1504(a)(2) (determined by substituting “50 percent” for “80 percent” each place it appears).
(c) [Reserved]
(d)
Rules for determining whether stock of the loss corporation is owned as a result of being a qualified creditor
—(1)
Qualified creditor.
A qualified creditor is the beneficial owner, immediately before the ownership change, of qualified indebtedness of the loss corporation. A qualified creditor owns stock of
the new loss corporation (or a controlling corporation) as a result of being a qualified creditor only to the extent that the qualified creditor receives stock in full or partial satisfaction of qualified indebtedness (including interest accrued on such indebtedness) in a transaction that is ordered by the court or is pursuant to a plan approved by the court in a title 11 or similar case. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(1), ownership of stock after the ownership change is determined without applying the attribution rules generally applicable under section 382(l)(3)(A) or § 1.382-2T(h).
(2)
General rules for determining whether indebtedness is qualified indebtedness
—(i)
Definition.
Indebtedness of the loss corporation is qualified indebtedness if it—
(A) Has been owned by the same beneficial owner since the date that is 18 months before the date of the filing of the title 11 or similar case; or
(B) Arose in the ordinary course of the trade or business of the loss corporation and has been owned at all times by the same beneficial owner.
(ii)
Determination of beneficial ownership.
For purposes of paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, beneficial ownership of indebtedness is determined without applying attribution rules.
(iii)
Duty of inquiry.
The loss corporation must determine that indebtedness that the loss corporation treats as qualified indebtedness, other than indebtedness to which paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section applies, has been owned for the requisite period by the beneficial owner who owns the indebtedness immediately before the ownership change. The loss corporation may rely on a statement, signed under penalties of perjury, by a beneficial owner regarding the amount of indebtedness the beneficial owner owns and the length of time that the beneficial owner has owned the indebtedness.
(iv)
Ordinary course indebtedness.
For purposes of this paragraph (d)(2), indebtedness arises in the ordinary course of the loss corporation's trade or business only if the indebtedness is incurred by the loss corporation in connection with the normal, usual, or customary conduct of business, determined without regard to whether the indebtedness funds ordinary or capital expenditures of the loss corporation. For example, indebtedness (other than indebtedness acquired for a principal purpose of being exchanged for stock) arises in the ordinary course of the loss corporation's trade or business if it is trade debt; a tax liability; a liability arising from a past or present employment relationship, a past or present business relationship with a supplier, customer, or competitor of the loss corporation, a tort, a breach of warranty, or a breach of statutory duty; or indebtedness incurred to pay an expense deductible under section 162 or included in the cost of goods sold. A claim that arises upon the rejection of a burdensome contract or lease pursuant to the title 11 or similar case is treated as arising in the ordinary course of the loss corporation's trade or business if the contract or lease so arose.
(3)
Treatment of certain indebtedness as continuously owned by the same owner
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of paragraph (d)(2) of this section, a loss corporation may treat indebtedness as always having been owned by the beneficial owner of the indebtedness immediately before the ownership change if the beneficial owner is not, immediately after the ownership change, either a 5-percent shareholder or an entity through which a 5-percent shareholder owns an indirect ownership interest in the loss corporation (a
5-percent entity
). This paragraph (d)(3)(i) does not apply to indebtedness beneficially owned by a person whose participation in formulating a plan of reorganization makes evident to the loss corporation (whether or not the loss corporation had previous knowledge) that the person has not owned the indebtedness for the requisite period.
(ii)
Operating rules.
For purposes of paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section: (A) If a loss corporation has actual knowledge of a coordinated acquisition of its indebtedness by a group of persons, through a formal or informal understanding among themselves, for a principal purpose of exchanging the indebtedness for stock, the indebtedness (and any stock received in exchange therefor) is treated as owned by an entity. A principal element in determining if an
understanding exists among members of a group is whether the investment decision of each member is based upon the investment decision of one or more other members.
(B) If the loss corporation has actual knowledge regarding stock ownership described in § 1.382-2T(k)(2), the loss corporation must take that ownership into account in determining which beneficial owners of indebtedness are, immediately after the ownership change, 5-percent shareholders or 5-percent entities. The loss corporation is not required to take into account an ownership interest described in § 1.382-2T(k)(4) unless the loss corporation has actual knowledge of the ownership interest.
(C) The term
5-percent shareholder
includes any person who is a 5-percent shareholder of the loss corporation within the meaning of § 1.382-2T(g), without regard to the option attribution rules of section 382(l)(3)(A) or § 1.382-4(d) (or, if applicable, § 1.382-2T(h)(4)).
(D) Paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section does not apply to indebtedness if the loss corporation has actual knowledge immediately after the ownership change that the exercise of an option to acquire or dispose of stock of the loss corporation would cause the beneficial owner of the indebtedness immediately before the ownership change to be, after the ownership change, either a 5-percent shareholder or a 5-percent entity. An interest that is treated as an option under § 1.382-4(d)(9) (or § 1.382-2T(h)(4)(v) if applicable) is treated as an option for purposes of this paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(D).
(iii)
Indebtedness owned by beneficial owner who becomes a 5-percent shareholder or 5-percent entity.
If the beneficial owner of indebtedness immediately before the ownership change is a 5-percent shareholder or 5-percent entity immediately after the ownership change, the general rules of paragraph (d)(2) of this section apply to determine whether the indebtedness has been owned for the requisite period by the beneficial owner.
(iv)
Example.
The following example illustrates paragraph (d)(3) of this section.

# Example.
(A)(1) L is a loss corporation in a title 11 case. The plan of reorganization of L approved by the bankruptcy court provides for the satisfaction of claims by the issuance of new L common stock to its creditors as follows:
A—2 percent
B—7.5 percent
C—2.5 percent
P1—3 percent
P2—10 percent
P3—4.9 percent
P4—4.9 percent
P5—4.9 percent
(2) P2 is owned by Public P2. B owns 10 percent of the stock of P1 and L has no actual knowledge of this ownership. L has actual knowledge that D owns P3, P4 and P5. In addition, L has actual knowledge, immediately after the ownership change, that C owns an option to acquire newly-issued stock of L that, if exercised, would increase C's percentage ownership of L stock from 2.5 percent to 8 percent. An ownership change of L occurs on the date the plan becomes effective.
(B) Under paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, L may treat the indebtedness owned by A and P1 immediately before the ownership change as always having been owned by A and P1. Neither A nor P1 is a 5-percent shareholder immediately after the ownership change. Further, because P1 owns less than 5 percent of the L stock (and L has no actual knowledge of B's ownership interest in P1), P1 is treated as an individual, and the L stock owned by P1 is not attributed to any other person, including B. See § 1.382-2T(h)(2)(iii). Therefore, P1 is not a 5-percent entity.
(C) Paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section does not apply to the indebtedness owned by B, C, P2, P3, P4, or P5. B is a 5-percent shareholder immediately after the ownership change. L has actual knowledge immediately after the ownership change that the exercise of C's option would cause C to be a 5-percent shareholder immediately after the ownership change. (L does not take into account the effect of the exercise of the option, however, in determining the percentage stock ownership of any person other than C because the deemed exercise would not cause any other person to be a 5-percent shareholder or a 5-percent entity after the ownership change.) P2 is a 5-percent entity, because Public P2, a 5-percent shareholder, owns an indirect ownership interest in L through P2. P3, P4, and P5 are 5-percent entities because D, a 5-percent shareholder, owns an indirect ownership interest in L through P3, P4, and P5. Because L has actual knowledge that D would be a 5-percent shareholder but for the application of § 1.382-2T(h)(2)(iii), that section does not apply to P3, P4, or P5. See § 1.382-2T(k)(2). Thus, under § 1.382-2T(h)(2)(i), the L stock
owned by P3, P4, and P5 is attributed to D, and D is a 5-percent shareholder. Because paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section does not apply to the indebtedness owned by B, C, P2, P3, P4, and P5, L may treat as qualified indebtedness only indebtedness that it determines had been owned by such persons for the requisite period. See paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section.
(4)
Special rule if indebtedness is a large portion of creditor's assets
—(i)
In general.
Indebtedness is not qualified indebtedness if—
(A) The beneficial owner of the indebtedness is a corporation or other entity that had an ownership change on any day during the applicable period;
(B) The indebtedness represents more than 25 percent of the fair market value of the total gross assets (excluding cash or cash equivalents) of the beneficial owner on its change date; and
(C) The beneficial owner is a 5-percent entity immediately after the ownership change of the loss corporation (determined by applying the rules of paragraph (d)(3) of this section).
(ii)
Applicable period.
For purposes of paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section, the term
applicable period
means the period beginning on the day 18 months before the filing of the title 11 or similar case (or the day on which the beneficial owner acquired the indebtedness, if later) and ending with the change date of the loss corporation.
(iii)
Determination of ownership change.
For purposes of paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section, the determination whether a beneficial owner of indebtedness has an ownership change is made under the principles of section 382 and the regulations thereunder, without regard to whether the beneficial owner is a loss corporation and by beginning the testing period no earlier than the latest of the day three years before the change date, the day 18 months before the filing of the title 11 or similar case, or the day on which the beneficial owner acquired the indebtedness.
(iv)
Reliance on statement.
Paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section does not apply to indebtedness if the loss corporation obtains a statement, signed under penalties of perjury, by the beneficial owner of the indebtedness that states that paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section does not apply to the indebtedness.
(5)
Tacking of ownership periods
—(i)
Transferee treated as owning indebtedness for period owned by transferor.
To determine whether indebtedness transferred in a qualified transfer is qualified indebtedness, the transferee is treated as having owned the indebtedness for the period that it was owned by the transferor.
(ii)
Qualified transfer.
For purposes of paragraph (d)(5)(i) of this section, a transfer of indebtedness is a qualified transfer if—
(A) The transfer is between parties who bear a relationship to each other described in section 267(b) or 707(b) (substituting at least 80 percent for more than 50 percent each place it appears in section 267(b) (and section 267(f)(1)) or 707(b));
(B) The transfer is a transfer of a loan within 90 days after its origination, pursuant to a customary syndication transaction;
(C) The transfer is a transfer of newly incurred indebtedness by an underwriter that owned the indebtedness for a transitory period pursuant to an underwriting;
(D) The transferee's basis in the indebtedness is determined under section 1014, 1015, or 1022 or with reference to the transferor's basis in the indebtedness;
(E) The transfer is in satisfaction of a right to receive a pecuniary bequest;
(F) The transfer is pursuant to any divorce or separation instrument (within the meaning of section 71(b)(2));
(G) The transfer is pursuant to a subrogation in which the transferee acquires a claim against the loss corporation by reason of a payment to the claimant pursuant to an insurance policy or a guarantee, letter of credit or similar security arrangement; or
(H) The transfer is a transfer of an account receivable in a customary commercial factoring transaction made within 30 days after the account arose to a transferee that regularly engages in such transactions.
(iii)
Exception.
A transfer of indebtedness is not a qualified transfer for purposes of paragraph (d)(5)(i) of this section if the transferee acquired the indebtedness for a principal purpose of benefiting from the losses of the loss corporation by—
(A) Exchanging the indebtedness for stock of the loss corporation pursuant to the title 11 or similar case; or
(B) Selling the indebtedness at a profit that reflects the expectation that, by reason of section 382(l)(5), section 382(a) will not apply to any ownership change resulting from the title 11 or similar case.
(iv)
Debt-for-debt exchanges.
If the loss corporation satisfies its indebtedness with new indebtedness, either through an exchange of new indebtedness for old indebtedness or a change in the terms of indebtedness that results in an exchange under section 1001—
(A) The owner of the new indebtedness is treated as having owned that indebtedness for the period that it owned the old indebtedness; and
(B) The new indebtedness is treated as having arisen in the ordinary course of the trade or business of the loss corporation if the old indebtedness so arose.
(6)
Effective date
—(i)
In general.
This paragraph (d) applies to ownership changes occurring on or after March 17, 1994. The provisions of paragraph (d)(5)(ii)(D) of this section relating to section 1022 are effective on and after January 19, 2017.
(ii)
Elections and amended returns
—(A)
Election to apply this paragraph (d) retroactively.
A loss corporation may elect to apply this paragraph (d) to an ownership change occurring prior to March 17, 1994. This election must be made by the later of the due date (including any extensions of time) of the loss corporation's tax return for the taxable year which includes the change date or the date that the loss corporation files its first tax return after May 16, 1994. The election is made by attaching the following statement to the return: “This is an Election to Apply § 1.382-9(d) Retroactively with Respect to the Ownership Change on [Insert Date of Ownership Change] That Occurred in Connection with the title 11 or Similar Case filed on [Insert Date of Filing].” This statement must be accompanied by the amended returns described in paragraph (d)(6)(ii)(C) of this section. An election under this paragraph (d)(6) is irrevocable.
(B)
Election to revoke section 382(l)(5)(H) election.
A loss corporation may elect to revoke a prior election made under section 382(l)(5)(H) with respect to an ownership change occurring before March 17, 1994 by including the following statement with its election to apply § 1.382-9(d) retroactively: “This is an Election to Revoke a Prior Election Made Under Section 382(l)(5)(H) With Respect to the Ownership Change on [Insert Date of Ownership Change] That Occurred in Connection With the title 11 or Similar Case Filed on [Insert Date of Filing].”
(C)
Amended returns.
If the retroactive application of this paragraph (d) affects the amount of taxable income or loss for a prior taxable year, then, except as precluded by the applicable statute of limitations, the loss corporation (or the common parent of any consolidated group of which the loss corporation was a member for the year) must file an amended return for the year that reflects the effects of the retroactive application of the rules of this paragraph (d). If the statute of limitations precludes the filing of an amended return for one or more such prior taxable years, the loss corporation (or the common parent) must make appropriate adjustments under the principles of section 382(l)(2)(A) in subsequent taxable years to reflect the difference between the losses and credits actually used in such prior taxable years and the amount that would have been used in those years applying the rules of this paragraph (d).
(e)
Option attribution for purposes of determining stock ownership under section 382(l)(5)(A)(ii)
—(1)
In general.
Solely for purposes of determining whether the stock ownership requirements of section 382(l)(5)(A)(ii) are satisfied at the time of an ownership change, stock of the loss corporation (or of a controlling corporation if also in bankruptcy) that is subject to an option is treated as acquired at that time, pursuant to an exercise of the option by its owner, if such deemed exercise would cause
the pre-change shareholders and qualified creditors of the loss corporation to own (after such ownership change and as a result of being pre-change shareholders or qualified creditors immediately before such change) less than an amount of such stock sufficient to satisfy the ownership requirements of section 382(l)(5)(A)(ii). An option that is owned as a result of being a pre-change shareholder or qualified creditor and that, if exercised, would result in the ownership of stock by a pre-change shareholder or qualified creditor is not treated as exercised under this paragraph (e). For purposes of this paragraph (e)(1), rules similar to those option attribution rules under § 1.382-2T(h)(4)(iii), (iv), (v), (vii), and (x)(A), (B) (except with respect to a debt instrument that was issued after the filing of the petition in the title 11 or similar case), (D), (E) (except with respect to a right to receive or obligation to issue stock as interest or dividends on a debt instrument or stock that was issued after the filing of the petition in the title 11 or similar case), (G), (H), and (Z), apply.
(2)
Special rules
—(i)
Lapse or forfeiture of options deemed exercised.
A loss corporation may apply rules similar to the rules of § 1.382-2T(h)(4)(viii) with respect to an option except to the extent any person owning the option at any time on or after the change date acquires additional stock or an option to acquire additional stock during the period of time on or after the ownership change and on or before the lapse or forfeiture of the option.
(ii)
Actual exercise of options not deemed exercised.
In determining whether the ownership change pursuant to the plan of reorganization qualifies under section 382(l)(5), a loss corporation may take into account stock acquired pursuant to the actual exercise of an option issued pursuant to the plan of reorganization if that option was not deemed exercised under paragraph (e)(1) of this section. However, this paragraph (e)(2)(ii) applies only if the option is actually exercised within the 3 years of the ownership change by the 5-percent shareholder who, as a result of being a pre-change shareholder or qualified creditor, acquired the option under the plan.
(iii)
Amended returns.
A loss corporation may file an amended return for a prior taxable year (subject to any applicable statute of limitations) if it determines that section 382(l)(5) applies to an ownership change as a result of the operation of paragraph (e)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section, but only if the loss corporation makes corresponding adjustments on amended returns for all affected taxable years (subject to any applicable statute of limitations).
(3)
Examples.
In each of the examples in this paragraph (e)(3), assume that there is an ownership change of loss corporation L on the date the plan of reorganization is effective.

# Example 1.
L is a loss corporation in a title 11 case. The plan of reorganization of L approved by the bankruptcy court provides for the cancellation of all existing L stock, the issuance of 100 shares of new L common stock to qualified creditors, and the issuance of an option to a new investor to acquire, at any time during the next 3 years, 90 shares of new L common stock from L at its fair market value on the date the plan becomes effective. Under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, on the date the plan becomes effective, the option held by the new investor is deemed exercised if the exercise would cause the qualified creditors of L to own less than 50 percent of the total voting power or value of the L stock after the ownership change. Because the qualified creditors would receive at least 50 percent of the voting power and value of the new L common stock even if the option were deemed exercised, the stock ownership requirements of section 382(l)(5)(A)(ii) are satisfied.

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except that L issues an option to the new investor to acquire 110 shares of new L common stock. This option is deemed exercised under paragraph (e)(1) of this section on the date the plan becomes effective, because, as a result of the deemed exercise, the qualified creditors would own only 100 of 210 shares of the new L common stock (approximately 48 percent) after the ownership change. Accordingly, the stock ownership requirements of section 382(l)(5)(A)(ii) are not satisfied and section 382(a) applies to the ownership change.

# Example 3.
(a) L is a loss corporation in a title 11 case. The plan of reorganization of L approved by the bankruptcy court provides for the cancellation of all existing L stock, the issuance of new L common stock and 5-year options to acquire L common stock as follows:
(i) To qualified creditors—100 shares of stock and options to acquire 50 shares;
(ii) To a new investor—options to acquire 110 shares.
(b) Under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the option held by the new investor is deemed exercised on the date the plan becomes effective because the exercise would cause the qualified creditors of L to own less than 50 percent of the total voting power and value of the L stock after the ownership change (100 of 210 shares or approximately 48 percent). Accordingly, the stock ownership requirements of section 382(l)(5)(A)(ii) are not satisfied initially and section 382(a) applies to the ownership change.
(c) Assume, however, that the qualified creditors actually exercise enough options that were acquired pursuant to the plan of reorganization to purchase 30 additional shares during the 3 year period after the plan becomes effective. Under paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section, L may take into account the 30 shares purchased by the qualified creditors by the exercise of the options in determining whether the stock ownership requirements of section 382(l)(5)(A)(ii) were satisfied on the date the plan of reorganization became effective. If L takes such purchases into account, the qualified creditors of L are deemed to own as of the date of the ownership change more than 50 percent of the total voting power or value of the L stock after the ownership change (130 of 240 shares or approximately 54 percent), with the result that the stock ownership requirements of section 382(l)(5)(A)(ii) are satisfied and section 382(l)(5) applies to the ownership change as of the effective date of the plan.
(d) Assume instead that the qualified creditors acquire 30 additional shares by exercise of options more than 3 years after the plan becomes effective. Such exercise is not taken into account under paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section for purposes of determining whether the stock ownership requirements of section 382(l)(5)(A)(ii) are satisfied as of the effective date of the plan. Thus, the qualified creditors are deemed to own less than 50 percent of the total voting power and value of the L stock after the ownership change (100 of 210 shares) and section 382(l)(5) does not apply to the ownership change.
(e) Assume instead that, during the 3 year period after the plan becomes effective, the new investor exercises part of his option and purchases 105 shares of stock. The exercise causes a lapse of the rights to acquire the remaining 5 shares of stock. Also during that time, the qualified creditors exercise part of their options and acquire 6 additional shares of stock. Under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, L may treat the lapse of that part of the new investor's option to acquire 5 shares of stock as if that part of the option had never been issued for purposes of determining whether the stock ownership requirements of section 382(l)(5)(A)(ii) are satisfied as of the effective date of the plan. Also, under paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section, L may take into account the 6 shares purchased by the qualified creditors by the exercise of the options in determining whether the stock ownership requirements of section 382(l)(5)(A)(ii) are satisfied as of the effective date of the plan. If L takes all of this information into account, the qualified creditors are deemed to own more than 50 percent of the total voting power or value of the L stock after the ownership change (106 of 211 shares or approximately 50.2 percent) and section 382(l)(5) applies to the ownership change as of the effective date of the plan.
(4)
Effective dates
—(i)
In general.
This paragraph (e) applies to ownership changes occurring on or after September 5, 1990.
(ii)
Special rule for interest or dividends.
Rules similar to the rules of § 1.382-2T(h)(4)(x)(E) (relating to option attribution for purposes of determining whether an ownership change occurs) apply to a right to receive or obligation to issue stock as interest or dividends on a debt instrument or stock that was issued after the filing of the petition in the title 11 or similar case for ownership changes occurring before April 8, 1992.
(f)-(h) [Reserved]
(i)
Election not to apply section 382(l)(5).
Under section 382(l)(5)(H), a loss corporation may elect not to have the provisions of section 382(l)(5) apply to an ownership change in a title 11 or similar case. This election is irrevocable and must be made by the due date (including any extensions of time) of the loss corporation's tax return for the taxable year which includes the change date. The election is to be made by attaching the following statement to the tax return of the loss corporation for that taxable year: “This is an Election Under § 1.382-9(i) not to Apply the Provisions of Section 382(l)(5) to the Ownership Change Occurring Pursuant to a Plan of Reorganization Confirmed by the Court on [Insert Confirmation Date].”
(j)
Value of the loss corporation in an ownership change to which section 382(l)(6) applies.
Section 382(l)(6) applies to any ownership change occurring pursuant to a plan of reorganization in a title 11 or similar case to which section 382(l)(5) does not apply. In such case, the value of the loss corporation
under section 382(e) is equal to the lesser of—
(1) The value of the stock of the loss corporation immediately after the ownership change (determined under the rules of paragraph (k) of this section); or
(2) The value of the loss corporation's pre-change assets (determined under the rules of paragraph (l) of this section).
(k)
Rules for determining the value of the stock of the loss corporation
—(1)
Certain ownership interests treated as stock.
For purposes of paragraph (j)(1) of this section—
(i) Stock includes stock described in section 1504(a)(4) and any stock that is not treated as stock under § 1.382-2T(f)(18)(ii) for purposes of determining whether a loss corporation has an ownership change; and
(ii) Stock does not include an ownership interest that is treated as stock under § 1.382-2T(f)(18)(iii) for purposes of determining whether a loss corporation has an ownership change.
(2)
Coordination with section 382(e)(2).
In the case of a redemption or other corporate contraction occurring after and in connection with the ownership change, the value of the stock of the loss corporation under paragraph (j)(1) of this section is reduced under section 382(e)(2).
(3)
Coordination with section 382(e)(3).
If the loss corporation is a foreign corporation, in determining the value of the stock under paragraph (j)(1) of this section, only items treated as connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States are taken into account.
(4)
Coordination with section 382(l)(1).
Section 382(l)(1) does not apply in determining the value of the stock of the loss corporation under paragraph (j)(1) of this section.
(5)
Coordination with section 382(l)(4).
If, immediately after the ownership change, the loss corporation has substantial nonbusiness assets (as determined under section 382(l)(4)(B) taking into account only those assets the loss corporation held immediately before the ownership change), the value of the stock of the loss corporation under paragraph (j)(1) of this section is reduced by the excess of the value of such nonbusiness assets over those assets' share of the loss corporation's indebtedness (determined under section 382(l)(4)(D) taking into account the loss corporation's assets and liabilities immediately after the ownership change).
(6)
Special rule for stock not subject to the risk of corporate business operations
—(i)
In general.
The value of the stock of the loss corporation under paragraph (j)(1) of this section is reduced by the value of stock that is issued as part of a plan one of the principal purposes of which is to increase the section 382 limitation without subjecting the investment to the entrepreneurial risks of corporate business operations.
(ii)
Coordination of special rule and other rules affecting value.
If the value of the loss corporation is modified under another rule affecting value, appropriate adjustments are to be made so that such modification is not duplicated under this paragraph (k)(6).
(7)
Limitation on value of stock.
For purposes of paragraph (j)(1) of this section, the value of stock of the loss corporation issued in connection with the ownership change cannot exceed the cash and the value of any property (including indebtedness of the loss corporation) received by the loss corporation in consideration for the issuance of that stock.
(l)
Rules for determining the value of the loss corporation's pre-change assets
—(1)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (l), the value of the loss corporation's pre-change assets is the value of its assets (determined without regard to liabilities) immediately before the ownership change.
(2)
Coordination with section 382(e)(2).
Section 382(e)(2) does not apply in determining the value of the pre-change assets of the loss corporation under paragraph (j)(2) of this section.
(3)
Coordination with section 382(e)(3).
If the loss corporation is a foreign corporation, in determining the value of the pre-change assets under paragraph (j)(2) of this section, only assets treated as connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States are taken into account.
(4)
Coordination with section 382(l)(1).
For purposes of paragraph (j)(2) of this
section, the value of the pre-change assets of the loss corporation is determined without regard to the amount of any capital contribution to which section 382(l)(1) applies. For purposes of applying this paragraph (l)(4), the receipt of cash or property by the loss corporation in exchange for the issuance of indebtedness is considered a capital contribution if it is part of a plan one of the principal purposes of which is to increase the value of the loss corporation under paragraph (j) of this section.
(5)
Coordination with section 382(l)(4).
If, immediately after the ownership change, the loss corporation has substantial nonbusiness assets (as determined under section 382(l)(4)(B) taking into account only those assets the loss corporation held immediately before the ownership change), the value of the loss corporation's pre-change assets is reduced by the value of the nonbusiness assets.
(m)
Continuity of business requirement
—(1)
Under section 382(l)(5).
If section 382(l)(5) applies to an ownership change of a loss corporation, section 382(c) and the regulations thereunder do not apply with respect to the ownership change.
(2)
Under section 382(l)(6).
If section 382(l)(6) applies to an ownership change of a loss corporation, section 382(c) and the regulations thereunder apply to the ownership change.
(n)
Ownership change in a title 11 or similar case succeeded by another ownership change within two years
—(1)
Section 382(l)(5) applies to the first ownership change.
If section 382(l)(5) applies to an ownership change and, within the two-year period immediately following such ownership change, a second ownership change occurs, section 382(l)(5) cannot apply to the second ownership change and the section 382(a) limitation with respect to the second ownership change is zero.
(2)
Section 382(l)(6) applies to the first ownership change.
If the value of a loss corporation in an ownership change was determined under section 382(l)(6) and a second ownership change occurs within the two-year period immediately following the first ownership change, the value of the loss corporation under section 382(e) with respect to the second ownership change is not reduced under section 382(l)(1) for any increase in value of the loss corporation previously taken into account under section 382(l)(6) with respect to the first ownership change.
(o)
Treatment of certain options for ownership change purposes
—(1) Neither § 1.382-2T(h)(4)(i) nor § 1.382-4(d) (relating to the treatment of options as exercised) applies to the following options to acquire stock of a loss corporation reorganized pursuant to a plan of reorganization that is confirmed in a title 11 or similar case (within the meaning of section 368(a)(3)(A)) but only until the time the plan becomes effective—
(i) Any option created by the solicitation or receipt of acceptances to the plan;
(ii) The option created by the confirmation of the plan; and
(iii) Any option created under the plan.
(2) This paragraph (o) generally applies to any testing date occurring on or after September 5, 1990. However, this paragraph (o) does not apply on any testing date occurring on or after April 8, 1992, if, in connection with the plan of reorganization, the loss corporation issues stock (including stock described in section 1504(a)(4)) or otherwise receives a capital contribution before the effective date of the plan for a principal purpose of using before the effective date losses and credits that would be subject to limitation under section 382(a) or would be eliminated under section 382(l)(5)(B) or (C) if this paragraph (o) did not apply on the testing date. A loss corporation may elect to apply this paragraph (o) to any testing date occurring before September 5, 1990, by filing a statement substantially similar to the following with its income tax return: “THIS IS AN ELECTION TO APPLY § 1.382-3(o) (OR § 1.382-9(o) AFTER REDESIGNATION) FOR TESTING DATES PRIOR TO SEPTEMBER 5, 1990, TO OPTIONS CREATED BY OR UNDER A PLAN OF REORGANIZATION CONFIRMED IN A TITLE 11 OR SIMILAR CASE.” A loss corporation may elect to not apply this paragraph (o) to testing dates occurring on or after September 5, 1990, to April 8, 1992, by filing a statement substantially similar to the following with
its income tax return: “THIS IS AN ELECTION TO NOT APPLY § 1.382-3(o) (OR § 1.382-9(o) AFTER REDESIGNATION) FOR TESTING DATES OCCURRING ON OR AFTER SEPTEMBER 5, 1990, TO APRIL 8, 1992, TO OPTIONS CREATED BY OR UNDER A PLAN OF REORGANIZATION CONFIRMED IN A TITLE 11 OR SIMILAR CASE.”
(p)
Effective date for rules relating to section 382(l)(6)
—(1)
In general.
Paragraphs (i), (j), (k), (l), (m)(2), and (n)(2) of this section apply to any ownership change occurring on or after March 17, 1994.
(2)
Ownership change to which section 382(l)(6) applies occurring before March 17, 1994.
In the case of an ownership change occurring before March 17, 1994, the loss corporation may elect to apply the rules of paragraphs (j), (k), (l), (m)(2), and (n)(2) of § 1.382-9 in their entirety. The election must be made by the later of the due date (including any extensions of time) of the loss corporation's tax return for the taxable year which includes the change date or the date that the loss corporation files its first tax return after May 16, 1994. The election is made by attaching the following statement to the return: “This is an Election to Apply §§ 1.382-9 (j), (k), (l), (m)(2), and (n)(2) of the Income Tax Regulations to the Ownership Change Occurring Pursuant to a Plan of Reorganization Confirmed by the Court on [Insert Confirmation Date].” In connection with making this election, on the same return the loss corporation may also elect not to apply section 382(l)(5) to the ownership change under paragraph (i) of this section (if the loss corporation has not already done so pursuant to § 301.9100-7T(a) of this chapter). If, under the applicable statute of limitations, the loss corporation may file amended returns for the year of the ownership change and all subsequent years (an open year), an electing loss corporation must file an amended return for each prior affected year to reflect the elections. If, under the applicable statute of limitations, the loss corporation may not file an amended return for the year of the ownership change or any subsequent year (a closed year), an electing loss corporation must file an amended return for each affected open year to reflect the elections and the section 382 limitation resulting from the ownership change must be appropriately adjusted for the earliest open year (or years) to reflect the difference between the amount of pre-change losses actually used in closed years and the amount of pre-change losses that would have been used in such years applying the rules of paragraphs (j), (k), (l), (m)(2), (n)(2) of this section to the ownership change.

§ 1.382-10
Special rules for determining time and manner of acquisition of an interest in a loss corporation.
(a)
Distributions from qualified trusts
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of § 1.382-2T, if a qualified trust described in section 401(a) (qualified trust) distributes an ownership interest in an entity (as defined in § 1.382-3(a)(1)), then for testing dates on or after the date of the distribution, the distributed ownership interest is treated as having been acquired by the distributee on the date and in the manner acquired by the trust and not as having been acquired or disposed of by the trust. The distribution does not cause the day of the distribution to be a testing date.
(2)
Accounting for dispositions
—(i)
General rule.
For purposes of this paragraph (a), in order to determine which ownership interest in an entity is distributed from a qualified trust, a loss corporation must either specifically identify the ownership interests that are the subject of all dispositions by the qualified trust of ownership interests in an entity, or apply the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method to all such dispositions.
(ii)
Special rules.
For purposes of this paragraph (a)(2):
(A) The FIFO method must be applied on a class-by-class basis; and
(B) The term
dispositions
includes distributions, sales, and other transfers.
(3)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the principles of this paragraph (a). For purposes of these examples, unless otherwise stated, the nomenclature and assumptions of the examples in § 1.382-2T(b) apply, all corporations file separate income tax returns on a calendar year basis, the only 5-percent shareholder of a loss corporation is a public group, and the facts set forth the only acquisitions of stock by any participants in a qualified plan and the only owner shifts with respect to the loss corporation during the testing period. The examples are as follows:

# Example 1.
(i)
Facts.
In 1994, E, a qualified trust established under Plan F, acquires 10 percent of L stock. A is a participant in Plan F. On January 1, 2002, A acquires 4 percent of L stock, and B, who is not a participant or a beneficiary of a participant in Plan F, acquires 5 percent of L stock. On January 1, 2004, E distributes 2 percent of L stock to A. On July 1, 2004, A acquires 1 percent of L stock.
(ii)
Analysis.
January 1, 2002, is a testing date because B's acquisition of 5 percent of L stock causes an increase in the percentage ownership of B, a 5-percent shareholder. As of the close of that testing date, A is treated as owning only 4 percent of L stock. Therefore, A is treated as a member of the public group of L. In addition, E is treated as owning 10 percent of L stock that it acquired in 1994.
(iii) As a result of the application of paragraph (a)(1) of this section to E's distribution of 2 percent of L stock to A on January 1, 2004, for testing dates on and after January 1, 2004, A is treated as having acquired that 2 percent interest in L in 1994, and E is treated as having acquired only 8 percent of L stock in 1994. Because there are no owner shifts on January 1, 2004, that date is not a testing date.
(iv) July 1, 2004, is a testing date because on that date A, a 5-percent shareholder, acquires 1 percent of L stock. As of the close of that testing date, A's percentage of ownership of L stock is 7 percent, and A's lowest percentage of ownership of L stock at any time within the testing period is 2 percent (deemed acquired in 1994), representing an increase of 5 percentage points. In addition, as of the close of July 1, 2004, B's percentage of ownership of L stock is 5 percent, and B's lowest percentage of ownership of L stock at any time within the testing period is 0 percent, representing an increase of 5 percentage points. Thus, on July 1, 2004, L must take into account an increase of 10 (5 + 5) percentage points in determining whether it has an ownership change.

# Example 2.
(i)
Facts.
E is a qualified trust established under Plan F. L, a publicly traded corporation, has 100x shares of stock outstanding. As of January 1, 2006, C owns 5x shares of L stock and is not a participant or beneficiary of a participant in Plan F. At all times prior to January 1, 2006, E owns no L stock. On January 1, 2006, E acquires 10x shares of L stock from members of the public group of L. On December 1, 2007, E distributes 5x shares of L stock to some of the participants in Plan F. No one participant acquires all 5x shares as a result of the distribution. On February 1, 2008, C purchases 1x shares of L stock from the public group of L.
(ii)
Analysis.
Because E's acquisition of 10x shares of L stock on January 1, 2006, is an owner shift, that date is a testing date. As of the close of that date, E's percentage of stock ownership in L has increased by 10 percentage points.
(iii) As a result of the application of paragraph (a)(1) of this section to E's distribution of 5x shares of L stock to some Plan F participants on December 1, 2007, for testing dates on and after December 1, 2007, those distributees are treated as having acquired those shares of stock on January 1, 2006, from members of the public group of L, and E is not treated as having acquired those shares on that date. E's distribution of the 5x shares is not an owner shift. Therefore, December 1, 2007, is not a testing date.
(iv) February 1, 2008, is a testing date because on that date an owner shift results from C's purchase of 1x shares of L stock. As of the close of that testing date, the distributees of 5x shares of L stock are treated as members of the public group of L having acquired 5x shares of L stock from other members of the public group of L on January 1, 2006. Because those acquisitions are not by 5-percent shareholders, L does not take them into account. In addition, as of the close of February 1, 2008, E's percentage of stock ownership in L is 5 percent, and E's lowest percentage of stock ownership in L at any time within the testing period is 0 percent, representing an increase of 5 percentage points. In addition, as of the close of February 1, 2008, C's percentage of stock ownership in L is 6 percent, and C's lowest percentage of stock ownership in L at any time within the testing period is 5 percent, representing an increase of 1 percentage point. Therefore, on February 1, 2008, L must take into account an increase of 6 (5 + 1) percentage points in determining whether it has an ownership change.

Effective dates.
This section applies to all distributions after June 23, 2006. For distributions on or before

§ 1.382-11
Reporting requirements.
(a)
Information statement required.
A loss corporation must include a statement entitled, “STATEMENT PURSUANT TO § 1.382-11(a) BY [INSERT NAME AND EMPLOYER IDENTIFICATION NUMBER OF TAXPAYER], A LOSS CORPORATION,” on or with its income tax return for each taxable year that it is a loss corporation in which an owner shift, equity structure shift or other transaction described in § 1.382-2T(a)(2)(i) occurs. The statement must include the date(s) of any owner shifts, equity structure shifts, or other transactions described in § 1.382-2T(a)(2)(i), the date(s) on which any ownership change(s) occurred, and the amount of any attributes described in § 1.382-2(a)(1)(i) that caused the corporation to be a loss corporation. A loss corporation may also be required to include certain elections on this statement, including—
(1) An election made under § 1.382-2T(h)(4)(vi)(B) to disregard the deemed exercise of an option if the actual exercise of that option occurred within 120 days of the ownership change; and
(2) An election made under § 1.382-6(b)(2) to close the books of the loss corporation for purposes of allocating income and loss to periods before and after the change date for purposes of section 382.
(b)
Effective/applicability date.
This section applies to any taxable year beginning on or after May 30, 2006. However, taxpayers may apply this section to any original Federal income tax return (including any amended return filed on or before the due date (including extensions) of such original return) timely filed on or after May 30, 2006. For taxable years beginning before May 30, 2006, see § 1.382-2T as contained in 26 CFR part 1 in effect on April 1, 2006.

§ 1.382-12
Determination of adjusted Federal long-term rate.
(a)
In general.
The long-term tax-exempt rate for an ownership change is the highest of the adjusted Federal long-term rates in effect for any month in the 3-calendar-month period ending with the calendar month in which the change date occurs. For purposes of the previous sentence, the adjusted Federal long-term rate is the Federal long-term rate determined under section 1274(d) (without regard to paragraphs (2) and (3) thereof), adjusted for differences between rates on long-term taxable and tax-exempt obligations. The Secretary calculates the adjusted Federal long-term rate as provided in paragraph (b) of this section. The Internal Revenue Service publishes the long-term tax-exempt rate and the adjusted Federal long-term rate for each month in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see § 601.601(d)(2)(ii) of this chapter).
(b)
Adjusted Federal long-term rate.
The adjusted Federal long-term rate for a calendar month is the product of the Federal long-term rate determined under section 1274(d) for that month, based on annual compounding, multiplied by the adjustment factor described in paragraph (c) of this section.
(c)
Adjustment factor.
The adjustment factor is a percentage equal to—
(1) The excess of 100 percent, over
(2) The product of—
(i) 59 percent, and
(ii) The sum of the maximum rate in effect under section 1 applicable to individuals and the maximum rate in effect under section 1411 applicable to individuals for the month to which the adjusted applicable Federal rate applies.
(d)
Effective/applicability date.
The rules of this section apply to the determination of the long-term tax-exempt rate and the adjusted Federal long-term rate beginning with the rates determined during August 2016 that apply during September 2016.

(b)
In general.
Under section 383, if an ownership change occurs with respect to a loss corporation, the section 382 limitation and the section 383 credit limitation (as defined in paragraph (c)(6) of this section) for a post-change year shall apply to limit the amount of taxable income and regular tax liability, respectively, that can be offset by pre-change capital losses and pre-change credits of the new loss corporation. The section 383 credit limitation for a post-change year bears a direct relationship to the amount, if any, of the section 382 limitation that remains after taking into account the reduction in the loss corporation's taxable income during a post-change year as a result of its pre-change losses (as defined in paragraph (c)(4) of this section). In general, the section 383 credit limitation is an amount equal to the tax liability of the new loss corporation for the post-change year which is attributable to so much of the corporation's taxable income that would be reduced by allowing as a deduction its section 382 limitation remaining after accounting for the use of pre-change losses. As pre-change losses and pre-change credits of a corporation are used, they absorb the section 382 limitation and the section 383 credit limitation, respectively, in the manner prescribed by paragraph (d) of this section. See also section 382 and the regulations thereunder.
(c)
Definitions
—(1)
Coordination with definitions and nomenclature used in section 382.
Terms and nomenclature used in this section, and not otherwise defined herein, shall have the same respective meanings as in section 382 and the regulations thereunder, taking into account that the limitations of section 383 and this section apply to pre-change capital losses and pre-change credits.
(2)
Pre-change capital loss.
The term
pre-change capital loss
means—
(i) Any capital loss carryover under section 1212 of the old loss corporation to the taxable year ending on the change date or in which the change date occurs,
(ii) Any net capital loss of the old loss corporation for the taxable year in which the ownership change occurs, to
the extent such loss is allocable to the period in such year ending on or before the change date, and
(iii) If the old loss corporation has a net unrealized built-in loss, any recognized built-in loss for any recognition period taxable year (within the meaning of section 382(h)) that is a capital loss.
(3)
Pre-change credit.
The term
pre-change credit
means—
(i) Any excess foreign taxes under section 904(c) of the old loss corporation—
(A) carried forward to the taxable year ending on the change date or in which the change date occurs, or
(B) carried forward from the taxable year that includes the change date, to the extent such credit is allocable to the period in such year ending on or before the change date,
(ii) Any credit under section 38 of the old loss corporation—
(A) carried forward to the taxable year ending on the change date or in which the change date occurs, or
(B) carried forward from a taxable year that includes the change date to the extent such credit is allocable to the period in such year ending on or before the change date, and
(iii) The available minimum tax credit of the old loss corporation under section 53 to the extent attributable to periods ending on or before the change date.
(4)
Pre-change loss.
Solely for purposes of this section, the term
prechange loss
means any pre-change loss described in § 1.382-2(a)(2) other than pre-change credits described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
(5)
Regular tax liability.
For purposes of this section, the term
regular tax liability
has the same meaning as provided in section 26(b).
(6)
Section 383 credit limitation
—(i)
Definition.
The
section 383 credit limitation
for a post-change year of a new loss corporation is an amount equal to the excess of—
(A) The new loss corporation's regular tax liability for the post-change year, over
(B) The new loss corporation's regular tax liability for the post-change year computed, for this purpose, by allowing as an additional deduction an amount equal to the section 382 limitation remaining after the application of paragraphs (d)(2)(i) through (v) of this section.
(ii)
Example.
L, a new loss corporation, is a calendar-year taxpayer. L has an ownership change on December 31, 2021. For 2022, L has taxable income (prior to the use of any pre-change losses) of $100,000. In addition, L has a section 382 limitation of $25,000, a pre-change net operating loss carryover of $12,000, a pre-change general business credit carryforward under section 39 of $50,000, and no items described in § 1.383-1(d)(2)(i) through (iv). L's section 383 credit limitation for 2022 is the excess of its regular tax liability computed after allowing a $12,000 net operating loss deduction (taxable income of $88,000; regular tax liability of $18,480), over its regular tax liability computed after allowing an additional deduction in the amount of L's section 382 limitation remaining after the application of paragraphs (d)(2)(i) through (v) of this section, or $13,000 (taxable income of $75,000; regular tax liability of $15,750). L's section 383 credit limitation is therefore $2,730 ($18,480 minus $15,750).
(d)
Limitation on use of pre-change losses and pre-change credits
—(1)
In general
—(i)
General rule.
The amount of taxable income of a new loss corporation for any post-change year that may be offset by pre-change losses shall not exceed the amount of the section 382 limitation for the post-change year. The amount of the regular tax liability of a new loss corporation for any post-change year that may be offset by pre-change credits shall not exceed the amount of the section 383 credit limitation for the post-change year.
(ii)
Ordering rule for losses or credits from same taxable year.
A loss corporation's taxable income is offset first by losses subject to a section 382 limitation, to the extent the section 382 limitation for that taxable year has not yet been absorbed, before being offset by losses of the same type from the same taxable year that are not subject to a section 382 limitation. For example, assume that Corporation X has an ownership change in Year 1 and carries over disallowed business interest expense as defined in § 1.163(j)-1(b)(10), some of
which constitutes a section 382 disallowed business interest carryforward, from Year 1 to Year 2. To the extent of its section 163(j) limitation, as defined in § 1.163(j)-1(b)(36), and its remaining section 382 limitation, Corporation X offsets its Year 2 income with the section 382 disallowed business interest carryforward before using any of the disallowed business interest expense that is not a section 382 disallowed business interest carryforward. Similar principles apply to the use of tax credits.
(2)
Ordering rules for utilization of pre-change losses and pre-change credits and for absorption of the section 382 limitation and the section 383 credit limitation.
Pre-change losses described in any subdivision of this paragraph (d)(2) can offset taxable income in a post-change year only to the extent that the section 382 limitation for that year has not been absorbed by pre-change losses described in any lower-numbered subdivisions. Pre-change credits described in any subdivision of this paragraph (d)(2) can offset regular tax liability in a post-change year only to the extent that the section 383 credit limitation for that year has not been absorbed by pre-change credits described in any lower numbered subdivisions. The section 382 limitation is absorbed by one dollar for each dollar of pre-change loss that is used to offset taxable income. The section 383 credit limitation is absorbed by one dollar for each dollar of pre-change credit that is used to offset regular tax liability. For each post-change year, the section 382 limitation and the section 383 credit limitation of a new loss corporation are absorbed by such corporation's pre-change losses and pre-change credits in the following order:
(i) Pre-change capital losses described in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section that are recognized and are subject to the section 382 limitation in such post-change year;
(ii) Pre-change capital losses described in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section;
(iii) Pre-change losses that are described in § 1.382-2(a)(2)(iii), other than losses that are pre-change capital losses, that are recognized and are subject to the section 382 limitation in such post-change year;
(iv)(A) With respect to an ownership change date occurring prior to November 13, 2020, but during the taxable year which includes November 13, 2020, the pre-change loss described in section 382(d)(3);
(B) With respect to an ownership change date occurring on or after November 13, 2020, section 382 disallowed business interest carryforwards (within the meaning of § 1.382-2(a)(7));
(v) Pre-change losses not described in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) through (iv) of this section;
(vi) Pre-change credits described in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section (excess foreign taxes),
(vii) Pre-change credits described in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section (business credits); and
(viii) Pre-change credits described in paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section (minimum tax credit).
(3)
Coordination with other limitations
—(i)
In general.
Paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section shall be applied after the application of all other limitations contained in subtitle A which are applicable to the use of a pre-change loss or pre-change credit in a post-change year. Thus, only otherwise currently allowable pre-change losses and pre-change credits will result in the absorption of the section 382 limitation and the section 383 credit limitation. The application of section 59A is not a limitation contained in subtitle A for purposes of this paragraph (d)(3)(i). Therefore, the treatment of pre-change losses and pre-change credits in the computation of the base erosion minimum tax amount will not affect whether such losses or credits result in absorption of the section 382 limitation and the section 383 credit limitation.
(ii)
Example.
L, a calendar-year taxpayer, has an ownership change on December 31, 2021. For 2022, L has taxable income of $300,000 and a regular tax liability of $63,000. L has no pre-change losses, but it has a business credit carryforward from 2020 of $25,000. L has a section 382 limitation for 2022 of $50,000. L's section 383 credit limitation is $10,500, an amount equal to the excess of L's regular tax liability ($63,000)
over its regular tax liability calculated by allowing an additional deduction of $50,000 ($52,500). Pursuant to the limitation contained in section 38(c), however, L is entitled to use only $9,500 (($63,000−$25,000) × 25 percent) of its business credit carryforward in 2022. The unabsorbed portion of L's section 382 limitation, $1,000 (computed pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section), is carried forward under section 382(b)(2). The unused portion of L's business credit carryforward, $14,500, is carried forward to the extent provided in section 39.
(e)
Carryforward of unused section 382 limitation
—(1)
Computation of carryforward amount.
The section 382 limitation that can be carried forward under section 382(b)(2) is the excess, if any, of (i) the section 382 limitation for the post-change year remaining after the application of paragraphs (d)(2)(i) through (v) of this section, over (ii) the section 383 credit reduction amount for that post-change year.
(2)
Section 383 credit reduction amount.
The section 383 credit reduction amount for a post-change year is equal to the amount of taxable income attributable to the portion of the new loss corporation's regular tax liability for the year that is offset by pre-change credits. Each dollar of regular tax liability that is offset by a dollar of pre-change credit is divided by the effective marginal rate at which that dollar of tax was imposed to determine the amount of taxable income that resulted in that particular dollar of regular tax liability. The sum of these “grossed-up” amounts for the taxable year is the section 383 credit reduction amount. In determining the effective marginal rate at which a dollar of tax was imposed, special rules regarding rates of tax (
e.g.,
section 15 or taxable income brackets (
e.g.,
section 1561), or both, shall be taken into account.
(3) [Reserved]
(4)
Special rules for determining the section 383 credit reduction amount
—(i)
Ordering rules.
For purposes of this paragraph (e), credits, including pre-change credits, are considered to offset regular tax liability in the order that such credits are applied under the ordering rules of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 and section 904. For example, for purposes of this paragraph (e), excess foreign taxes carried over under section 904(c) (whether or not a pre-change credit) are considered (under section 38(c)) to offset regular tax liability before the general business credit carryovers to the taxable year are considered (under section 39) to offset regular tax liability before general business credits arising in the taxable year.
(ii)
Special rule for credits under section 38(a).
For purposes of applying this paragraph (e), credits under section 38(a) that, under section 38(c)(2) as applicable, taking into account amendments made by section 11813 of the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1990, effectively offset both regular tax liability and the tax imposed by section 55 (relating to minimum tax), are considered to offset regular tax liability.
(f)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the operation of paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section. For purposes of these examples, the term
modified tax liability
means the amount determined under paragraph (c)(6)(i)(B) of this section.
(1)
Example 1.
(i) L, a calendar year taxpayer, has an ownership change on December 31, 1987. Before the application of carryovers, L, a new loss corporation, has $60,000 of capital gain, $100,000 of ordinary taxable income and a section 382 limitation of $100,000 for its first post-change year beginning after the change date. L's only carryovers are an $80,000 capital loss carryover and a $100,000 net operating loss carryover. Both carryovers are from taxable years ending before the change date and thus are pre-change losses.
(ii) L first uses $60,000 of its pre-change capital loss carryover to offset its capital gain. This reduces its section 382 limitation to $40,000 (i.e., $100,000−$60,000). L's pre-change net operating loss carryover can therefore be used only to the extent of $40,000. L's remaining $20,000 pre-change capital loss carryover and remaining $60,000 pre-change net operating loss carryover are carried to later years to the extent permitted under this section and sections 172, 382(l)(2) and 1212.

Facts.
L, a calendar-year taxpayer, has an ownership
change on December 31, 2021. For 2022, L has $750,000 of ordinary taxable income (before the application of carryovers) and a section 382 limitation of $1,500,000. L's only carryovers are from pre-2021 taxable years and consist of a $500,000 net operating loss (NOL) carryover, and a $200,000 foreign tax credit carryover (all of which may be used under the section 904 limitation). The NOL carryover is a pre-change loss, and the foreign tax credit carryover is a pre-change credit. L has no other pre-change losses or credits that can be used in 2022.

Coordination with section 382 and the regulations thereunder.
The rules and principles of section 382 (including, for example, section 382(b)(3) and section 382(l)(2)) and the regulations thereunder shall also apply with respect to section 383 and this section. To the extent section 382(h)(6) applies to credits, the principles of this section apply to such credits. In applying the rules and principles of section 382 and the regulations thereunder, appropriate adjustments shall be made to take into account that section 383 and this section apply to pre-change capital losses and pre-change credits. For example, in applying § 1.382-2T (f)(18)(ii)(C), (f)(18)(iii)(C) and (h)(4)(ix), any pre-change credits, as defined in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, must be converted to a deduction equivalent by dividing the amount of such credits by the maximum effective rate of tax provided for under section 11.

Applicability date—
(1)
In general.
Subject to any exception from the application of section 382 or the section 382 limitation with respect to a loss corporation, section 383 and this section apply to any loss corporation with respect to which an ownership change occurs after December 31, 1986. See § 1.382-2T(m) for effective date rules relating to ownership changes. If section 383 was not taken into account or was applied other than in accordance with this section in a prior taxable year with respect to which section 383 applies, the taxpayer should, within the period of limitation, file an amended return and pay any additional tax due plus interest.

Interaction with section 163(j).
Paragraphs (c)(6)(i)(B) and (c)(6)(ii), (d)(1), (d)(2)(iii) through (viii), (d)(3)(ii), (e)(1) through (3), (f), and (g) of this section apply with respect to ownership changes occurring during a taxable year beginning on or after November 13, 2020. For loss corporations that have undergone an ownership change during a taxable year beginning before November 13, 2020, see § 1.383-1 as contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised April 1, 2019. However, taxpayers and their related parties, within the meaning of sections 267(b) and 707(b)(1), may choose to apply the rules of this section to an ownership change occurring during a taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017, so long as the taxpayers and their related parties consistently apply either the rules of this section (except paragraph (d)(2)(iv)(B) of this section), the section 163(j) regulations (as defined in § 1.163(j)-1(b)(37)), §§ 1.382-1, 1.382-2, 1.382-5, 1.382-6, 1.382-7, and 1.383-0, and, if applicable, §§ 1.263A-9, 1.263A-15, 1.381(c)(20)-1, 1.469-9, 1.469-11, 1.704-1, 1.882-5, 1.1362-3, 1.1368-1, 1.1377-1, 1.1502-13, 1.1502-21, 1.1502-36, 1.1502-79, 1.1502-91 through 1.1502-99 (to the extent they effectuate the rules of §§ 1.382-2, § 1.382-5, 1.382-6, and 1.383-1), and 1.1504-4; or the rules of this section (except paragraph (d)(2)(iv)(A) of this section), the section 163(j) regulations (as defined in § 1.163(j)-1(b)(37)) and §§ 1.382-1, 1.382-2, 1.382-5, 1.382-6, and 1.383-0, and, if applicable, §§ 1.263A-9, 1.263A-15, 1.381(c)(20)-1, 1.469-9, 1.469-11, 1.704-1, 1.882-5, 1.1362-3, 1.1368-1, 1.1377-1, 1.1502-13, 1.1502-21, 1.1502-36, 1.1502-79, 1.1502-91 through 1.1502-99 (to the extent they effectuate the rules of §§ 1.382-2, 1.382-5, 1.382-6, 1.382-7, and 1.383-1), and 1.1504-4, to those ownership changes.

Limitations on certain capital losses and excess credits in computing alternative minimum tax. [Reserved]
§ 1.385-1
General provisions.
(a)
Overview of section 385 regulations.
This section and §§ 1.385-3 through 1.385-4 (collectively, the section 385 regulations) provide rules under section 385 to determine the treatment of an interest in a corporation as stock or indebtedness (or as in part stock and in part indebtedness) in particular factual situations. Paragraph (b) of this section provides the general rule for determining the treatment of an interest based on provisions of the Internal
Revenue Code and on common law, including the factors prescribed under common law. Paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section provide definitions and rules of general application for purposes of the section 385 regulations. Section 1.385-3 sets forth additional factors that, when present, control the determination of whether an interest in a corporation that is held by a member of the corporation's expanded group is treated (in whole or in part) as stock or indebtedness.
(b)
General rule.
Except as otherwise provided in the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations thereunder, including the section 385 regulations, whether an interest in a corporation is treated for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code as stock or indebtedness (or as in part stock and in part indebtedness) is determined based on common law, including the factors prescribed under such common law.
(c)
Definitions.
The definitions in this paragraph (c) apply for purposes of the section 385 regulations. For additional definitions that apply for purposes of their respective sections, see §§ 1.385-3(g) and 1.385-4(e).
(1)
Controlled partnership.
The term controlled partnership means, with respect to an expanded group, a partnership with respect to which at least 80 percent of the interests in partnership capital or profits are owned, directly or indirectly, by one or more members of the expanded group. For purposes of identifying a controlled partnership, indirect ownership of a partnership interest is determined by applying the principles of paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section. Such determination is separate from the determination of the status of a corporation as a member of an expanded group. An unincorporated organization described in § 1.761-2 that elects to be excluded from all of subchapter K of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code is not a controlled partnership.
(2)
Covered member.
The term covered member means a member of an expanded group that is—
(i) A domestic corporation; and
(ii) [Reserved]
(3)
Disregarded entity.
The term disregarded entity means a business entity (as defined in § 301.7701-2(a) of this chapter) that is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner for federal income tax purposes under §§ 301.7701-1 through 301.7701-3 of this chapter.
(4)
Expanded group
—(i)
In general.
The term expanded group means one or more chains of corporations (other than S corporations) connected through stock ownership with a common parent corporation that is not an S corporation or a regulated investment company or a real estate investment trust subject to tax under subchapter M of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code (a RIC or a REIT, respectively) (such common parent corporation, an expanded group parent), but only if—
(A) The expanded group parent owns directly or indirectly stock meeting the requirements of section 1504(a)(2) (modified by substituting “or” for “and” in section 1504(a)(2)(A)) in at least one of the other corporations; and
(B) Stock meeting the requirements of section 1504(a)(2) (modified by substituting “or” for “and” in section 1504(a)(2)(A)) in each of the other corporations (except the expanded group parent) is owned directly or indirectly by one or more of the other corporations.
(ii)
Definition of stock.
For purposes of paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, the term stock has the same meaning as “stock” in section 1504 (without regard to § 1.1504-4) and all shares of stock within a single class are considered to have the same value. Thus, control premiums and minority and blockage discounts within a single class are not taken into account.
(iii)
Indirect stock ownership.
For purposes of paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, indirect stock ownership is determined by applying the constructive ownership rules of section 318(a) with the following modifications:
(A) Section 318(a)(1) and (a)(3) do not apply except as set forth in paragraph (c)(4)(v) of this section;
(B) Section 318(a)(2)(C) applies by substituting “5 percent” for “50 percent;” and
(C) Section 318(a)(4) only applies to options (as defined in § 1.1504-4(d)) that are reasonably certain to be exercised as described in § 1.1504-4(g).
(iv)
Member of an expanded group or expanded group member.
The expanded group parent and each of the other corporations described in paragraphs (c)(4)(i)(A) and (c)(4)(i)(B) of this section is a member of an expanded group (also referred to as an expanded group member). For purposes of the section 385 regulations, a corporation is a member of an expanded group if it is described in this paragraph (c)(4)(iv) immediately before the relevant time for determining membership (for example, immediately before the issuance of a debt instrument (as defined in § 1.385-3(g)(4)) or immediately before a distribution or acquisition that may be subject to § 1.385-3(b)(2) or (3)).
(v)
Brother-sister groups with non-corporate owners.
[Reserved]
(vi)
Special rule for indirect ownership through options for certain members of consolidated groups.
In the case of an option of which a member of a consolidated group, other than the common parent, is the issuing corporation (as defined in § 1.1504-4(c)(1)), section 318(a)(4) only applies (for purposes of applying paragraph (c)(4)(iii)(C) of this section) to the option if the option is treated as stock or as exercised under § 1.1504-4(b) for purposes of determining whether a corporation is a member of an affiliated group.
(vii)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (c)(4). Except as otherwise stated, for purposes of the examples in this paragraph (c)(4)(vii), all persons described are corporations that have a single class of stock outstanding and file separate federal tax returns and are not an S corporation, a RIC, or a REIT. In addition, the stock of each publicly traded corporation is widely held such that no person directly or indirectly owns stock in the publicly traded corporation meeting the requirements of section 1504(a)(2) (as modified by this paragraph (c)(4)).
(A)
Example 1. Two different expanded group parents
—(

)
Facts.
P has two classes of common stock outstanding: Class A and Class B. X, a publicly traded corporation, directly owns all shares of P's Class A common stock, which is high-vote common stock representing 85% of the vote and 15% of the value of the stock of P. Y, a publicly traded corporation, directly owns all shares of P's Class B common stock, which is low-vote common stock representing 15% of the vote and 85% of the value of the stock of P. P directly owns 100% of the stock of S1.
(
2
)
Analysis.
X owns directly 85% of the vote of the stock of P, which is stock meeting the requirements of section 1504(a)(2) (as modified by paragraph (c)(4)(i)(A) of this section). Therefore, X is an expanded group parent described in paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section with respect to P. Y owns 85% of the value of the stock of P, which is stock meeting the requirements of section 1504(a)(2) (as modified by paragraph (c)(4)(i)(A) of this section). Therefore, Y is also an expanded group parent described in paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section with respect to P. P owns directly 100% of the voting power and value of the stock of S1, which is stock meeting the requirements of section 1504(a)(2) (as modified by paragraph (c)(4)(i)(B) of this section). Therefore, X, P, and S1 constitute an expanded group as defined in paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section. Additionally, Y, P, and S1 constitute an expanded group as defined in paragraph (c)(4) of this section. X and Y are not members of the same expanded group under paragraph (c)(4) of this section because X does not directly or indirectly own any of the stock of Y and Y does not directly or indirectly own any of the stock of X, such that X and Y do not comprise a chain of corporations described in paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section.
(B)
Example 2. Inclusion of a REIT within an expanded group
—(
1
)
Facts.
All of the stock of P is publicly traded. In addition to other assets representing 85% of the value of its total assets, P directly owns all of the stock of S1. S1 owns 99% of the stock of S2. The remaining 1% of the stock of S2 is owned by 100 unrelated individuals. In addition to other assets representing 85% of the value of its total assets, S2 owns all of the stock of S3, which has elected to be treated as a taxable REIT subsidiary of S2 under section 856(l)(1). Both P and S2 are REITs.
(
2
)
Analysis.
P directly owns 100% of the stock of S1. However, under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, P cannot
be the expanded group parent because P is a REIT. Because no other corporation owns stock in P meeting the requirements described in paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, P is not an expanded group member. S1 directly owns 99% of the stock of S2, which is stock meeting the requirements of section 1504(a)(2) (as modified by paragraph (c)(4)(i)(A) of this section). Although S2 is a corporation that is a REIT, a REIT may be a member of an expanded group described under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section provided the corporation is not the expanded group parent. In this case, S1 is the expanded group parent. S2 directly owns 100% of the stock of S3, which is stock meeting the requirements of section 1504(a)(2) (as modified by paragraph (c)(4)(i)(B) of this section). Therefore, S1, S2, and S3 constitute an expanded group as defined in paragraph (c)(4) of this section.

Example 3. Attribution of hook stock
—(

)
Facts.
P, a publicly traded corporation, directly owns 50% of the stock of S1. S1 directly owns 100% of the stock of S2. S2 directly owns the remaining 50% of the stock of S1.
(
2
)
Analysis.
(
i
) P directly owns 50% of the stock of S1. Under paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section (which applies section 318(a)(2) with modifications), P constructively owns 50% of the stock of S2 because P directly owns 50% of the stock of S1, which directly owns 100% of S2. Under section 318(a)(5)(A), stock constructively owned by P by reason of the application of section 318(a)(2) is, for purposes of section 318(a)(2), considered as actually owned by P.
(
ii
) S2 directly owns 50% of the stock of S1. Thus, under paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section, P is treated as constructively owning an additional 25% of the stock of S1. For purposes of determining the expanded group, P's ownership must be recalculated treating the additional 25% of S1 stock as actually owned. Under the second application of section 318(a)(2)(C) as modified by paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section, P constructively owns an additional 12.5% of the stock of S1 as follows: 25% (P's new attributed ownership of S1) × 100% (S1's ownership of S2) × 50% (S2's ownership of S1) = 12.5%. After two iterations, P's ownership in S1 is 87.5% (50% direct ownership + 25% first order constructive ownership + 12.5% second order constructive ownership) and thus S1 is a member of the expanded group that includes P and S2. Subsequent iterative calculations of P's ownership, treating constructive ownership as actual ownership, would demonstrate that P owns, directly and indirectly, 100% of the stock of S1. P, S1, and S2 therefore constitute an expanded group as defined in paragraph (c)(4) of this section and P is the expanded group parent.

Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (c)(4)(vii)(C)(

) of this section (
Example 3
), except that P directly owns only 25% of the stock of S1. X, a corporation unrelated to P, also directly owns 25% of the stock of S1.
(
2
)
Analysis.
(
i
) P and X each directly owns 25% of the stock of S1. Under paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section, P and X each constructively owns 25% of the stock of S2 because P and X each directly owns 25% of the stock of S1, which directly owns 100% of the stock of S2. Under section 318(a)(5)(A), stock constructively owned by P or X by reason of the application of section 318(a)(2) is, for purposes of section 318(a)(2), considered as actually owned by P or X, respectively.
(
ii
) S2 directly owns 50% of the stock of S1. Thus, under paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section, P and X each is treated as constructively owning an additional 12.5% of the stock of S1. Under a second application of section 318(a)(2)(C) as modified by paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section, P and X each constructively owns an additional 6.25% of the stock of S1 as follows: 12.5% (each of P's and X's new attributed ownership of S1) × 100% (S1's ownership of S2) × 50% (S2's ownership of S1) = 6.25%. After two iterations, each of P's and X's ownership in S1 is 43.75% (25% direct ownership + 12.5% first order constructive ownership + 6.25% second order constructive ownership). Subsequent iterative calculations of each of P's and X's ownership, treating constructive ownership as actual ownership, would demonstrate that P and X each owns, directly and indirectly, 50% of the stock of S1.
(

) S1 and S2 constitute an expanded group as defined under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section because S1 directly owns 100% of the stock of S2. S1 is the expanded group parent of the expanded group and neither P nor X are a member of the expanded group that includes S1 and S2.
(5)

Treatment of deemed exchanges
—(1)
Debt instrument deemed to be exchanged for stock
—(i)
In general.
If a debt instrument (as defined in § 1.385-3(g)(4)) is deemed to be exchanged under the section 385 regulations, in whole or in part, for stock, the holder is treated for all Federal tax purposes as having realized an amount equal to the holder's adjusted basis in that portion of the debt instrument as of the date of the deemed exchange (and as having basis in the stock deemed to be received equal to that amount), and, except as provided in paragraph (d)(1)(iv)(B) of this section, the issuer is treated for all Federal tax purposes as having retired that portion of the debt instrument for an amount equal to its adjusted issue price as of the date of the deemed exchange. In addition, neither party accounts for any accrued but unpaid qualified stated interest on the debt instrument or any foreign exchange gain or loss with respect to that accrued but unpaid qualified stated interest (if any) as of the deemed exchange. This paragraph (d)(1)(i) does not affect any rules in Title 26 of the United States Code that otherwise apply to the debt instrument prior to the date of the deemed exchange (for example, this paragraph (d)(1)(i) does not affect the issuer's deduction of accrued but unpaid qualified stated interest otherwise deductible prior to the date of the deemed exchange). Moreover, the stock issued in the deemed exchange is not treated as a payment of accrued but unpaid original issue discount or qualified stated interest on the debt instrument for Federal tax purposes.
(ii)
Section 988.
Notwithstanding the first sentence of paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section, the rules of § 1.988-2(b)(13) apply to require the holder and the issuer of a debt instrument that is deemed to be exchanged under the section 385 regulations, in whole or in part, for stock to recognize any exchange gain or loss, other than any exchange gain or loss with respect to accrued but unpaid qualified stated interest that is not taken into account under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section at the time of the deemed exchange. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(1)(ii), in applying § 1.988-2(b)(13) the exchange gain or loss under section 988 is treated as the total gain or loss on the exchange.
(iii)
Section 108(e)(8).
For purposes of section 108(e)(8), if the issuer of a debt instrument is treated as having retired all or a portion of the debt instrument in exchange for stock under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section, the stock is treated as having a fair market value equal to the adjusted issue price of that portion of the debt instrument as of the date of the deemed exchange.
(iv)
Issuer of stock deemed exchanged for debt.
For purposes of applying paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section—
(A) A debt instrument that is issued by a disregarded entity is deemed to be exchanged for stock of the regarded owner under § 1.385-3(d)(4);
(B) A debt instrument that is issued by a partnership that becomes a deemed transferred receivable, in whole or in part, is deemed to be exchanged by the holder for deemed partner stock under § 1.385-3(f)(4) and the partnership is therefore not treated for any federal tax purpose as having retired any portion of the debt instrument; and
(C) A debt instrument that is issued in any situation not described in paragraph (d)(1)(iv)(A) or (B) of this section is deemed to be exchanged for stock of the issuer of the debt instrument.
(2)
Stock deemed to be exchanged for newly-issued debt instrument.

(ii)
Debt instruments recharacterized under § 1.385-3.
If a debt instrument treated as stock under § 1.385-3(b) is deemed to be exchanged under § 1.385-3(d)(2), in whole or in part, for a newly-issued debt instrument, the issue price of the newly-issued debt instrument is
determined under either section 1273(b)(4) or 1274, as applicable.

§ 1.385-3
Certain distributions of debt instruments and similar transactions.
(a)
Scope.
This section sets forth factors that control the determination of whether an interest is treated as stock or indebtedness. Specifically, this section addresses the issuance of a covered debt instrument to a related person as part of a transaction or series of transactions that does not result in new investment in the operations of the issuer. Paragraph (b) of this section sets forth rules for determining when these factors are present, such that a covered debt instrument is treated as stock under this section. Paragraph (c) of this section provides exceptions to the application of paragraph (b) of this section. Paragraph (d) of this section provides operating rules. Paragraph (e) of this section reserves on the affirmative use of this section. Paragraph (f) of this section provides rules for the aggregate treatment of controlled partnerships. Paragraph (g) of this section provides definitions. Paragraph (h) of this section provides examples illustrating the application of the rules of this section. Paragraph (j) of this section provides dates of applicability. For rules regarding the application of this section to members of a consolidated group, see generally § 1.385-4.
(b)
Covered debt instrument treated as stock
—(1)
Effect of characterization as stock.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(7) of this section, to the extent a covered debt instrument is treated as stock under paragraphs (b)(2), (3), or (4) of this section, it is treated as stock for all federal tax purposes.
(2)
General rule.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (c) and (e) of this section, a covered debt instrument is treated as stock to the extent the covered debt instrument is issued by a covered member to a member of the covered member's expanded group in one or more of the following transactions:
(i) In a distribution;
(ii) In exchange for expanded group stock, other than in an exempt exchange; or
(iii) In exchange for property in an asset reorganization, but only to the extent that, pursuant to the plan of reorganization, a shareholder in the transferor corporation that is a member of the issuer's expanded group immediately before the reorganization receives the covered debt instrument with respect to its stock in the transferor corporation.
(3)
Funding rule
—(i)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (c) and (e) of this section, a covered debt instrument that is not a qualified short-term debt instrument (as defined in paragraph (b)(3)(vii) of this section) is treated as stock to the extent that it is both issued by a covered member to a member of the covered member's expanded group in exchange for property and, pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(iii) or (b)(3)(iv) of this section, treated as funding a distribution or acquisition described in one or more of paragraphs (b)(3)(i)(A) through (C) of this section. A covered member that makes a distribution or acquisition described in paragraphs (b)(3)(i)(A) through (C) is referred to as a “funded member,” regardless of when it issues a covered debt instrument in exchange for property.
(A) A distribution of property by the funded member to a member of the funded member's expanded group, other than in an exempt distribution;
(B) An acquisition of expanded group stock, other than an exempt exchange, by the funded member from a member of the funded member's expanded group in exchange for property other than expanded group stock; or
(C) An acquisition of property by the funded member in an asset reorganization but only to the extent that, pursuant to the plan of reorganization, a shareholder in the transferor corporation that is a member of the funded member's expanded group immediately before the reorganization receives other property or money within the
meaning of section 356 with respect to its stock in the transferor corporation.
(ii)
Transactions described in more than one paragraph.
For purposes of this section, to the extent that a distribution or acquisition by a funded member is described in more than one of paragraphs (b)(3)(i)(A) through (C) of this section, the funded member is treated as making only a single distribution or acquisition described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section. In the case of an asset reorganization, to the extent an acquisition by the transferee corporation is described in paragraph (b)(3)(i)(C) of this section, a distribution or acquisition by the transferor corporation is not also described in paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) through (C) of this section. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(3)(ii), whether a distribution or acquisition is described in paragraphs (b)(3)(i)(A) through (C) of this section is determined without regard to paragraph (c) of this section.
(iii)
Per se funding rule
—(A)
In general.
A covered debt instrument is treated as funding a distribution or acquisition described in paragraphs (b)(3)(i)(A) through (C) of this section if the covered debt instrument is issued by a funded member during the period beginning 36 months before the date of the distribution or acquisition, and ending 36 months after the date of the distribution or acquisition (
per se period
).
(B)
Multiple interests.
If, pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, two or more covered debt instruments may be treated as stock by reason of this paragraph (b)(3), the covered debt instruments are tested under paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this section based on the order in which they are issued, with the earliest issued covered debt instrument tested first. See paragraph (h)(3) of this section,
Example 6,
for an illustration of this rule.
(C)
Multiple distributions or acquisitions.
If, pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, a covered debt instrument may be treated as funding more than one distribution or acquisition described in paragraphs (b)(3)(i)(A) through (C) of this section, the covered debt instrument is treated as funding one or more distributions or acquisitions based on the order in which the distributions or acquisitions occur, with the earliest distribution or acquisition treated as the first distribution or acquisition that is funded. See paragraph (h)(3) of this section,
Example 9,
for an illustration of this rule.
(D)
Transactions that straddle different expanded groups
—(

In general.
For purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, a covered debt instrument is not treated as issued by a funded member during the per se period with respect to a distribution or acquisition described in paragraphs (b)(3)(i)(A) through (C) of this section if all of the conditions described in paragraphs (b)(3)(iii)(D)(
1
)(
i
) through (
iii
) of this section are satisfied.
(
i
) The distribution or acquisition occurs prior to the issuance of the covered debt instrument by the funded member or, if the funded member is treated as making the distribution or acquisition of a predecessor or a successor, the predecessor or successor is not a member of the expanded group of which the funded member is a member on the date on which the distribution or the acquisition occurs.
(
ii
) The distribution or acquisition is made by the funded member when the funded member is a member of an expanded group that does not have an expanded group parent that is the funded member's expanded group parent when the covered debt instrument is issued. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a reference to an expanded group parent includes a reference to a predecessor or successor of the expanded group parent.
(
iii
) On the date of the issuance of the covered debt instrument, the recipient member (as defined in paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(D)(

) of this section) is neither a member nor a controlled partnership of an expanded group of which the funded member is a member.
(
2
)
Recipient member.
For purposes of this paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(D), the term

respect to its stock in the transferor corporation. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(D), a reference to the recipient member includes a predecessor or successor of the recipient member or one or more other entities that, in the aggregate, acquire substantially all of the property of the recipient member.

)
In general.
For purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, if a covered debt instrument is treated as exchanged for a modified covered debt instrument pursuant to § 1.1001-3(b), the modified covered debt instrument is treated as issued on the original issue date of the covered debt instrument.
(

)
Effect of certain modifications.
Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(E)(1) of this section, if a covered debt instrument is treated as exchanged for a modified covered debt instrument pursuant to § 1.1001-3(b) and the modification, or one of the modifications, that results in the deemed exchange includes the substitution of an obligor on the covered debt instrument, the addition or deletion of a co-obligor on the covered debt instrument, or the material deferral of scheduled payments due under the covered debt instrument, then the modified covered debt instrument is treated as issued on the date of the deemed exchange for purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this section.
(

)
Additional principal amount.
For purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, if the principal amount of a covered debt instrument is increased, the portion of the covered debt instrument attributable to such increase is treated as issued on the date of such increase.
(iv)
Principal purpose rule.
For purposes of this paragraph (b)(3), a covered debt instrument that is not issued by a funded member during the per se period with respect to a distribution or acquisition described in paragraphs (b)(3)(i)(A) through (C) of this section is treated as funding the distribution or acquisition to the extent that it is issued by a funded member with a principal purpose of funding a distribution or acquisition described in paragraphs (b)(3)(i)(A) through (C) of this section. Whether a covered debt instrument is issued with a principal purpose of funding a distribution or acquisition described in paragraphs (b)(3)(i)(A) through (C) of this section is determined based on all the facts and circumstances. A covered debt instrument may be treated as issued with a principal purpose of funding a distribution or acquisition described in paragraphs (b)(3)(i)(A) through (C) of this section regardless of whether it is issued before or after the distribution or acquisition.
(v)
Predecessors and successors
—(A)
In general.
Subject to the limitations in paragraph (b)(3)(v)(B) of this section, for purposes of this paragraph (b)(3), references to a funded member include references to any predecessor or successor of such member. See paragraph (h)(3) of this section,
Examples 9
and
10,
for illustrations of this rule.
(B)
Limitations to the application of the per se funding rule.
For purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, a covered debt instrument issued by a funded member that satisfies the condition described in paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) with respect to a distribution or acquisition described in paragraphs (b)(3)(i)(A) through (C) of this section made by a predecessor or successor of the funded member is not treated as issued during the per se period with respect to the distribution or acquisition unless the conditions described in paragraphs (b)(3)(v)(B)(

) The distribution or acquisition is made by the predecessor or successor during the period beginning 36 months before the date of the transaction in which the predecessor or successor becomes a predecessor or successor of the funded member and ending 36 months after the date of the transaction.
(vi)
Treatment of funded transactions.
When a covered debt instrument is treated as stock pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the distribution or acquisition described in paragraphs (b)(3)(i)(A) through (C) of this section
that is treated as funded by such covered debt instrument is not recharacterized as a result of the treatment of the covered debt instrument as stock.
(vii)
Qualified short-term debt instrument.

Maximum interest rate.
The rate of interest charged with respect to the covered debt instrument does not exceed an arm's length interest rate, as determined under section 482 and §§ 1.482-1 through 1.482-9, that would be charged with respect to a comparable debt instrument of the issuer with a term that does not exceed the longer of 90 days and the issuer's normal operating cycle.
(

Additionally, the amount owed by any issuer shall be reduced by the amount of the issuer's deposits with a qualified cash pool header, but only to the extent of amounts borrowed from the same qualified cash pool header that satisfy the requirements of paragraph (b)(3)(vii)(A)(
2
) (if the covered debt instrument was issued in a prior taxable year) or (b)(3)(vii)(A)(

normal operating cycle
means the issuer's normal operating cycle as determined under applicable accounting principles, except that if the issuer has no single clearly defined normal operating cycle, then the normal operating cycle is determined based on a reasonable analysis of the length of the operating cycles of the multiple businesses and their sizes relative to the overall size of the issuer.

(
v
)
Inadvertent error.
An issuer's failure to satisfy the 270-day test will be disregarded if the failure is reasonable in light of all the facts and circumstances and the failure is promptly cured upon discovery. A failure to satisfy the 270-day test will be considered reasonable if the taxpayer maintains due diligence procedures to prevent such failures, as evidenced by having written policies and operational procedures in place to monitor compliance with the 270-day test and management-level employees of the expanded group having undertaken reasonable efforts to establish, follow, and enforce such policies and procedures.

(viii)
Distributions or acquisitions occurring before April 5, 2016.
A distribution or acquisition that occurs before April 5, 2016, is not taken into account for purposes of applying this paragraph (b)(3).
(4)
Anti-abuse rule.
If a member of an expanded group enters into a transaction with a principal purpose of avoiding the purposes of this section or § 1.385-3, an interest issued or held by that member or another member of the member's expanded group may, depending on the relevant facts and circumstances, be treated as stock. Paragraphs (b)(4)(i) and (ii) of this section include a non-exhaustive list of transactions that could result in an interest being treated as stock under this paragraph (b)(4).
(i)
Interests.
An interest is treated as stock if it is issued with a principal purpose of avoiding the purposes of this section or § 1.385-3. Interests subject to this paragraph (b)(4)(i) may include:
(A) An interest that is not a covered debt instrument for purposes of this section (for example, a contract to which section 483 applies that is not otherwise a covered debt instrument or a non-periodic swap payment that is not otherwise a covered debt instrument).
(B) A covered debt instrument issued to a person that is not a member of the issuer's expanded group, if the covered debt instrument is later acquired by a member of the issuer's expanded group or such person later becomes a member of the issuer's expanded group.
(C) A covered debt instrument issued to an entity that is not taxable as a corporation for federal tax purposes.
(D) A covered debt instrument issued in connection with a reorganization or similar transaction.

(ii)
Other transactions.
A covered debt instrument is treated as stock if the funded member or any member of the expanded group engages in a transaction (including a distribution or acquisition) with a principal purpose of avoiding the purposes of this section or § 1.385-3. Transactions subject to this paragraph (b)(4)(ii) may include:
(A) A member of the issuer's expanded group is substituted as a new obligor or added as a co-obligor on an existing covered debt instrument.
(B) A covered debt instrument is transferred in connection with a reorganization or similar transaction.
(C) A covered debt instrument funds a distribution or acquisition where the distribution or acquisition is made by a member other than the funded member and the funded member acquires the assets of the other member in a transaction that does not make the other member a predecessor to the funded member.
(D) Members of a consolidated group engage in transactions as part of a plan or a series of transactions through the use of the consolidated group rules set forth in § 1.385-4, including through the use of the departing member rules.
(5)
Coordination between general rule and funding rule.
For purposes of this section, a distribution or acquisition described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section is not also described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section. In the
case of an asset reorganization, an acquisition described in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section by the transferee corporation is not also a distribution or acquisition described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section by the transferor corporation. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(5), whether a distribution or acquisition is described in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section is determined without regard to paragraph (c) of this section.
(6)
Non-duplication.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, to the extent a distribution or acquisition described in paragraphs (b)(3)(i)(A) through (C) of this section is treated as funded by a covered debt instrument under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the distribution or acquisition is not treated as funded by another covered debt instrument and the covered debt instrument is not treated as funding another distribution or acquisition for purposes of paragraph (b)(3).
(c)
Exceptions
—(1)
In general.
This paragraph (c) provides exceptions for purposes of applying paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section to a covered member. These exceptions are applied in the following order: First, paragraph (c)(2) of this section; second, paragraph (c)(3) of this section; and, third, paragraph (c)(4) of this section. The exceptions under § 1.385-3(c)(2) and (c)(3) apply to distributions and acquisitions that are otherwise described in paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(3)(i) of this section after applying paragraphs (b)(3)(ii) and (b)(5) of this section. Except as otherwise provided, the exceptions are applied by taking into account the aggregate treatment of controlled partnerships described in § 1.385-3(f).

An acquisition of expanded group stock (including by issuance) is not treated as described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) or (b)(3)(i)(B) of this section if, immediately after the acquisition, the covered member that acquires the expanded group stock (acquirer) controls the member of the expanded group from which the expanded group stock is acquired (seller), and the acquirer does not relinquish control of the seller pursuant to a plan that existed on the date of the acquisition, other than in a transaction in which the seller ceases to be a member of the expanded group of which the acquirer is a member. For purposes of the preceding sentence, an acquirer and seller do not cease to be members of the same expanded group by reason of a complete liquidation described in section 331.
(B)
Control.
For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2)(i) and paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(E) of this section, control of a corporation means the direct or indirect ownership of more than 50 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the corporation entitled to vote and more than 50 percent of the total value of the stock of the corporation. For purposes of the preceding sentence, indirect ownership is determined by applying the principles of section 958(a) without regard to whether an intermediate entity is foreign or domestic.
(C)
Rebuttable presumption.
For purposes of paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A) of this section, the acquirer is presumed to have a plan to relinquish control of the seller on the date of the acquisition if the acquirer relinquishes control of the seller within the 36-month period following the date of the acquisition. The presumption created by the previous sentence may be rebutted by facts and circumstances clearly establishing that the loss of control was not contemplated on the date of the acquisition and that the avoidance of the purposes of this section or § 1.385-3 was not a principal purpose for the subsequent loss of control.
(ii)
Exclusion for compensatory stock acquisitions.
An acquisition of expanded group stock is not treated as described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) or (b)(3)(i)(B) of this section if the expanded group stock is delivered to individuals that are employees, directors, or independent contractors in consideration for services rendered by such individuals to a member of the expanded group or a controlled partnership in which a member of the expanded group is an expanded group partner.
(iii)
Exclusion for distributions or acquisitions resulting from transfer pricing
adjustments.
A distribution or acquisition deemed to occur under § 1.482-1(g) (including adjustments made pursuant to Revenue Procedure 99-32, 1999-2 C.B. 296) is not treated as described in paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) or (B) of this section.
(iv)
Exclusion for acquisitions of expanded group stock by a dealer in securities.
An acquisition of expanded group stock by a dealer in securities (within the meaning of section 475(c)(1)), or by an expanded group partner treated as acquiring expanded group stock pursuant to § 1.385-3(f)(2) if the relevant controlled partnership is a dealer in securities, is not treated as described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) or (b)(3)(i)(B) of this section to the extent the expanded group stock is acquired in the ordinary course of the dealer's business of dealing in securities. The preceding sentence applies solely to the extent that—
(A) The dealer accounts for the stock as securities held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business;
(B) The dealer disposes of the stock within a period of time that is consistent with the holding of the stock for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business, taking into account the terms of the stock and the conditions and practices prevailing in the markets for similar stock during the period in which it is held; and
(C) The dealer does not sell or otherwise transfer the stock to a person in the same expanded group, other than in a sale to a dealer that in turn satisfies the requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section.
(v)
Exclusion for certain acquisitions of expanded group stock resulting from application of this section.
The following deemed acquisitions are not treated as acquisitions of expanded group stock described in paragraph (b)(3)(i)(B) of this section, provided that they are not part of a plan or arrangement to prevent the application of paragraph (b)(3)(i) to a covered debt instrument:
(A) An acquisition of a covered debt instrument that is treated as stock by means of paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
(B) An acquisition of stock of a regarded owner that is deemed to be issued under § 1.385-3(d)(4).
(C) An acquisition of deemed partner stock pursuant to a deemed transfer or a specified event described in § 1.385-3(f)(4) or (5).
(3)
Reductions for transactions described in paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(3)(i) of this section
—(i)
Reduction for expanded group earnings
—(A)
In general.
The aggregate amount of any distributions or acquisitions by a covered member described in paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(3)(i) of this section in a taxable year during the covered member's expanded group period is reduced by the covered member's expanded group earnings account (as defined in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(B) of this section) for the expanded group period as of the close of the taxable year. The reduction described in this paragraph (c)(3)(i)(A) applies to one or more distributions or acquisitions based on the order in which the distributions or acquisitions occur, regardless of whether any distribution or acquisition would be treated as funded by a covered debt instrument without regard to this paragraph (c)(3).
(B)
Expanded group earnings account.
The term
expanded group earnings account
means, with respect to a covered member and an expanded group period (as defined in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(E) of this section) of the covered member, the excess, if any, of the covered member's expanded group earnings (as defined in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(C) of this section) for the expanded group period over the covered member's expanded group reductions (as defined in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(D) of this section) for the expanded group period.
(C)
Expanded group earnings
—(
1
)
In general.
The term expanded group earnings means, with respect to a covered member and an expanded group period of the covered member, the earnings and profits accumulated by the covered member during the expanded group period, computed as of the close of the taxable year of the covered member, without diminution by reason of any distributions or acquisitions by the covered member described in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3)(i) of this section. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the expanded group earnings of a covered member do not include earnings and profits accumulated by
the covered member in any taxable year ending before April 5, 2016.
(
2
)
Special rule for change in expanded group within a taxable year.
For purposes of calculating a covered member's expanded group earnings for a taxable year that is not wholly included in an expanded group period, the covered member's expanded group earnings are ratably allocated among the portion of the taxable year included in the expanded group period and the portion of the taxable year not included in the expanded group period. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the expanded group period is determined by excluding the day on which the covered member becomes a member of an expanded group with the same expanded group parent and including the day on which the covered member ceases to be a member of an expanded group with the same expanded group parent.
(

)
Look-through rule for dividends
—(
i
)
In general.
For purposes of paragraph (c)(3)(i)(C)(
1
) of this section, a dividend from a member of the same expanded group (
distributing member
) is not taken into account for purposes of calculating a covered member's expanded group earnings, except to the extent the dividend is attributable to earnings and profits accumulated by the distributing member in a taxable year ending after April 4, 2016, during its expanded group period (
qualified earnings and profits
). For purposes of the preceding sentence, a dividend received from a member (
intermediate distributing member
) is not taken into account for purposes of calculating the qualified earnings and profits of a distributing member (or another intermediate distributing member), except to the extent the dividend is attributable to qualified earnings and profits of the intermediate distributing member. A dividend from a distributing member or an intermediate distributing member is considered to be attributable to qualified earnings and profits to the extent thereof. If the distributing member or the intermediate distributing member is not a covered member, the expanded group period of the member is determined under the principles of paragraph (c)(3)(i)(E) of this section. If a controlled partnership receives a dividend from a distributing member and a portion of the dividend is allocated (including through one or more partnerships) to a covered member, then, for purposes of this paragraph (c)(3)(i)(C)(
3
), the covered member is treated as receiving the dividend from the distributing member.
(
ii
)
Dividend.
For purposes of paragraph (c)(3)(i)(C)(
3
)(
i
) of this section, the term dividend has the meaning specified in section 316, including the portion of gain recognized under section 1248 that is treated as a dividend and deemed dividends under section 367(b) and the regulations thereunder. In addition, the term dividend includes inclusions with respect to stock (for example, inclusions under sections 951(a) and 1293).
(
4
)
Effect of interest deductions.
For purposes of calculating the expanded group earnings of a covered member for a taxable year, expanded group earnings are calculated without regard to the application of this section during the taxable year to a covered debt instrument issued by the covered member that was not treated as stock under paragraph (b) of this section as of the close of the preceding taxable year, or, if the covered member is an expanded group partner in a controlled partnership that is the issuer of a debt instrument, without regard to the application of § 1.385-3(f)(4)(i) during the taxable year with respect to the covered member's share of the debt instrument. To the extent that the application of this paragraph (c)(3)(i)(C)(
4
) reduces the expanded group earnings of the covered member for the taxable year, the expanded group earnings of the covered member are increased as of the beginning of the succeeding taxable year during the expanded group period.
(D)
Expanded group reductions.
The term expanded group reductions means, with respect to a covered member and an expanded group period of the covered member, the amounts by which acquisitions or distributions described in paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(3)(i) of this section were reduced by reason of paragraph (c)(3)(i)(A) of this section during the portion of the expanded group period preceding the taxable year.
(E)
Expanded group period
—(
1
)
In general.
For purposes of this paragraph (c)(3)(i) and paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, the term expanded group period means, with respect to a covered member, the period during which a covered member is a member of an expanded group with the same expanded group parent.
(
2
)
Mere change.
For purposes of paragraph (c)(3)(i)(E)(
1
) of this section, an expanded group parent that is a resulting corporation (within the meaning of § 1.368-2(m)(1)) in a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(F) is treated as the same expanded group parent as an expanded group parent that is a transferor corporation (within the meaning of § 1.368-2(m)(1)) in the same reorganization, provided that either—
(
i
) The transferor corporation is not a covered member; or
(
ii
) Both the transferor corporation and the resulting corporation are covered members.
(F)
Special rules for certain corporate transactions
—(

)
Reduction for expanded group earnings in an asset reorganization.
For purposes of applying paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, a distribution or acquisition described in paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(3)(i) of this section that occurs pursuant to a reorganization described in section 381(a)(2) is reduced solely by the expanded group earnings account of the acquiring member after taking into account the adjustment to its expanded group earnings account provided in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(F)(
2
)(
ii
) of this section.
(
2
)
Effect of certain corporate transactions on the calculation of expanded group earnings account
—(
i
)
In general.
Section 381 and § 1.312-10 are not taken into account for purposes of calculating a covered member's expanded group earnings account for an expanded group period. The expanded group earnings account that a covered member succeeds to under paragraphs (c)(3)(i)(F)(
2
)(
ii
) through (
iv
) of this section is attributed to the covered member's expanded group period as of the close of the date of the distribution or transfer.
(
ii
)
Section 381 transactions.
If a covered member (
acquiring member
) acquires the assets of another covered member (
acquired member
) in a transaction described in section 381(a), and, immediately before the transaction, both corporations are members of the same expanded group, then the acquiring member succeeds to the expanded group earnings account of the acquired member, if any, determined after application of paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section with respect to the final taxable year of the acquired member.
(
iii
)
Section 1.312-10(a) transactions.
If a covered member (
transferor member
) transfers property to another covered member (
transferee member
) in a transaction described in § 1.312-10(a), the expanded group earnings account of the transferor member is allocated between the transferor member and the transferee member in the same proportion as the earnings and profits of the transferor member are allocated between the transferor member and the transferee member under § 1.312-10(a).
(
iv
)
Section 1.312-10(b) transactions.
If a covered member (
distributing member
) distributes the stock of another covered member (
controlled member
) in a transaction described in § 1.312-10(b), the expanded group earnings account of the distributing member is decreased by the amount that the expanded group earnings account of the distributing member would have been decreased under paragraph (c)(3)(i)(F)(
2
)(
iii
) of this section if the distributing member had transferred the stock of the controlled member to a newly formed corporation in a transaction described in § 1.312-10(a). If the amount of the decrease described in the preceding sentence exceeds the expanded group earnings account of the controlled member immediately before the transaction described in § 1.312-10(b), then the expanded group earnings account of the controlled member after the transaction is equal to the amount of the decrease.
(G)
Overlapping expanded groups.
A covered member that is a member of two expanded groups at the same time has a single expanded group earnings account with respect to a single expanded group period. In this case, the expanded group period is determined by reference to the shorter of the two periods during which the covered member is a member of an expanded group with the same expanded group parent.
(ii)
Reduction for qualified contributions
—(A)
In general.
The amount of a distribution or acquisition by a covered member described in paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(3)(i) of this section is reduced by the aggregate fair market value of the stock issued by the covered member in one or more qualified contributions (as defined in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(B) of this section) during the qualified period (as defined in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(C) of this section), but only to the extent the qualified contribution or qualified contributions have not reduced another distribution or acquisition. The reduction described in this paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(A) applies to one or more distributions or acquisitions based on the order in which the distributions or acquisitions occur, regardless of whether any distribution or acquisition would be treated as funded by a covered debt instrument without regard to this paragraph (c)(3).
(B)
Qualified contribution.
The term
qualified contribution
means, with respect to a covered member, except as provided in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(E) of this section, a contribution of property, other than excluded property (defined in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(D) of this section), to the covered member by a member of the covered member's expanded group (or by a controlled partnership of the expanded group) in exchange for stock.
(C)
Qualified period.
The term
qualified period
means, with respect to a covered member, a qualified contribution, and a distribution or acquisition described in paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(3)(i) of this section, the period beginning on the later of the beginning of the periods described in paragraphs (c)(3)(ii)(C)(
1
) and (
2
) of this section, and ending on the earlier of the ending of the periods described in paragraphs (c)(3)(ii)(C)(
1
) and (
2
) of this section or the date described in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(C)(
3
) of this section.
(
1
) The period beginning 36 months before the date of the distribution or acquisition, and ending 36 months after the date of the distribution or acquisition.
(
2
) The covered member's expanded group period (as defined in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(E) of this section) that includes the distribution or acquisition.
(
3
) The last day of the first taxable year that a covered debt instrument issued by the covered member would, absent the application of this paragraph (c)(3)(ii) with respect to the distribution or acquisition, be treated, in whole or in part, as stock under paragraph (b) of this section or, in the case of a covered debt instrument issued by a controlled partnership in which the covered member is an expanded group partner, the covered debt instrument would be treated, in whole or in part, as a specified portion.
(D)
Excluded property.
The term
excluded property
means—
(
1
) Expanded group stock;
(
2
) Property acquired by the covered member in an asset reorganization from a member of the expanded group of which the covered member is a member;
(
3
) A covered debt instrument of any member of the same expanded group, including a covered debt instrument issued by the covered member;
(
4
) Property acquired by the covered member in exchange for a covered debt instrument issued by the covered member that is recharacterized under paragraph (b)(3) of this section;
(
5
) A debt instrument issued by a controlled partnership of the expanded group of which the covered member is a member, including the portion of such a debt instrument that is a deemed transferred receivable or a retained receivable; and
(
6
) Any other property acquired by the covered member with a principal purpose to avoid the purposes of this section or § 1.385-3, including a transaction involving an indirect transfer of property described in paragraphs (c)(3)(ii)(D)(
1
) through (
5
) of this section.
(E)
Excluded contributions
—(
1
)
Upstream contributions from certain subsidiaries.
For purposes of paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, a contribution of property from a corporation (
controlled member
) that the covered member controls, within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(i)(B) of this section, is not a qualified contribution.
(
2
)
Contributions to a predecessor or successor.
For purposes of paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, a contribution of property to a covered member
from a corporation of which the covered member is a predecessor or successor, or from a corporation controlled by that corporation within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(i)(B) of this section, is not a qualified contribution.
(
3
)
Contributions that do not increase fair market value.
A contribution of property to a covered member that is not described in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(E)(
1
) or (
2
) of this section is not a qualified contribution to the extent that the contribution does not increase the aggregate fair market value of the outstanding stock of the covered member immediately after the transaction and taking into account all related transactions, other than distributions and acquisitions described in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3)(i) of this section.
(
4
)
Contributions that become excluded contributions after the date of the contribution.
If a contribution of property described in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(E)(
1
) or (
2
) of this section occurs before the covered member acquires control of the controlled member described in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(E)(
1
) or before the transaction in which the corporation described in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(E)(
2
) becomes a predecessor or successor to the covered member, the contribution of property ceases to be a qualified contribution on the date that the covered member acquires control of the controlled member or on the date of the transaction in which the corporation becomes a predecessor or successor to the covered member (
transaction date
). If the contribution of property occurs within 36 months before the transaction date, the covered member is treated as making a distribution described in paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) of this section on the transaction date equal to the amount by which any distribution or acquisition described in paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(3)(i) of this section was reduced under paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(A) of this section because the contribution of property was treated as a qualified contribution.

)
Reduction for qualified contributions in an asset reorganization.
For purposes of applying paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, a distribution or acquisition described in paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(3)(i) of this section that occurs pursuant to a reorganization described in section 381(a)(2) is reduced solely by the qualified contributions of the acquiring member after taking into account the adjustment to its qualified contributions provided in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(F)(
2
) of this section.
(

)
Effect of certain corporate transactions on the calculation of qualified contributions
—(
i
)
In general.
This paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(F)(
2
) provides rules for allocating or reducing the qualified contributions of a covered member as a result of certain corporation transactions. For purposes of paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(C)(
1
) of this section, a qualified contribution that a covered member succeeds to under paragraphs (c)(3)(ii)(F)(
2
)(
ii
) and (
iii
) of this section is treated as made to the covered member on the date on which the qualified contribution was made to the covered member that received the qualified contribution. For purposes of paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(C)(
2
) of this section, a qualified contribution that a covered member succeeds to under paragraphs (c)(3)(ii)(F)(
2
)(
ii
) and (
iii
) of this section is attributed to the covered member's expanded group period as of the close of the date of the distribution or transfer. For purposes of paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(C)(
3
) of this section, a qualified contribution a covered member succeeds to under paragraphs (c)(3)(ii)(F)(
2
)(
ii
) and (
iii
) of this section is treated as made to the covered member as of the close of the date of the distribution or transfer.
(
ii
)
Section 381 transactions.
If a covered member (acquiring member) acquires the assets of another covered member (acquired member) in a transaction described in section 381(a), and, immediately before the transaction, both corporations are members of the same expanded group, the acquiring member succeeds to the qualified contributions of the acquired member, if any, adjusted for the application of paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(E)(
4
) of this section.
(
iii
)
Section 1.312-10(a) transactions.
If a covered member (transferor member) transfers property to another covered member (transferee member) in a transaction described in § 1.312-10(a), each qualified contribution of the
transferor member is allocated between the transferor member and the transferee member in the same proportion as the earnings and profits of the transferor member are allocated between the transferor member and the transferee member under § 1.312-10(a).
(
iv
)
Section 1.312-10(b) transactions.
If a covered member (distributing member) distributes the stock of another covered member (controlled member) in a transaction described in § 1.312-10(b), each qualified contribution of the distributing member is decreased by the amount that each qualified contribution of the distributing member would have been decreased under paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(F)(
2
)(
iii
) of this section if the distributing member had transferred the stock of the controlled member to a newly formed corporation in a transaction described in § 1.312-10(a). No amount of the qualified contributions of the distributing member is allocated to the controlled member.
(iii)
Predecessors and successors.
For purposes of this paragraph (c)(3), references to a covered member do not include references to any corporation of which the covered member is a predecessor or successor. Accordingly, a distribution or acquisition by a covered member described in paragraphs (b)(3)(i)(A) through (C) is reduced solely by the expanded group earnings account of the covered member (taking into account the application of paragraph (c)(3)(i)(F)(
2
) of this section) and the qualified contributions of the covered member (taking into account the application of paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(F)(
2
) of this section), notwithstanding that the distribution or acquisition is treated as made by a funded member of which the covered member is a predecessor or successor.
(iv)
Ordering rule.
The exceptions described in this paragraph (c)(3) are applied in the following order: First, paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section; and, second, paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section.
(4)
Threshold exception.
A covered debt instrument is not treated as stock under this section if, immediately after the covered debt instrument would be treated as stock under this section but for the application of this paragraph (c)(4), the aggregate adjusted issue price of covered debt instruments held by members of the issuer's expanded group that would be treated as stock under this section but for the application of this paragraph (c)(4) does not exceed $50 million. To the extent a debt instrument issued by a controlled partnership would be treated as a specified portion (as defined in paragraph (g)(23) of this section) but for the application of this paragraph (c)(4), the debt instrument is treated as a covered debt instrument described in the preceding sentence for purposes of this paragraph (c)(4). To the extent that, immediately after a covered debt instrument would be treated as stock under this section but for the application of this paragraph (c)(4), the aggregate adjusted issue price of covered debt instruments held by members of the issuer's expanded group that would be treated as stock under this section but for the application of this paragraph (c)(4) exceeds $50 million, only the amount of the covered debt instrument in excess of $50 million is treated as stock under this section. For purposes of this rule, any covered debt instrument that is not denominated in U.S. dollars is translated into U.S. dollars at the spot rate (as defined in § 1.988-1(d)) on the date that the covered debt instrument is issued.
(d)
Operating rules
—(1)
Timing.
This paragraph (d)(1) provides rules for determining when a covered debt instrument is treated as stock under paragraph (b) of this section. For special rules regarding the treatment of a deemed exchange of a covered debt instrument that occurs pursuant to paragraphs (d)(1)(ii), (d)(1)(iii), or (d)(1)(iv) of this section, see § 1.385-1(d).
(i)
General timing rule.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (d)(1), when paragraph (b) of this section applies to treat a covered debt instrument as stock, the covered debt instrument is treated as stock when the covered debt instrument is issued. When paragraph (b)(3) of this section applies to treat a covered debt instrument as stock when the covered debt instrument is issued, see also paragraph (b)(3)(vi) of this section.
(ii)
Exception when a covered debt instrument is treated as funding a distribution or acquisition that occurs after the
issuance of the covered debt instrument.
When paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section applies to treat a covered debt instrument as funding a distribution or acquisition described in paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) through (C) of this section that occurs after the covered debt instrument is issued, the covered debt instrument is deemed to be exchanged for stock on the date that the distribution or acquisition occurs. See paragraph (h)(3) of this section,
Examples 4
and
9,
for an illustration of this rule.
(iii)
Exception for certain predecessor and successor transactions.
To the extent that a covered debt instrument would not be treated as stock but for the fact that a funded member is treated as the predecessor or successor of another expanded group member under paragraph (b)(3)(v) of this section, the covered debt instrument is deemed to be exchanged for stock on the later of the date that the funded member completes the transaction causing it to become a predecessor or successor of the other expanded group member or the date that the covered debt instrument would be treated as stock under paragraph (d)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section.
(iv)
Exception when a covered debt instrument is re-tested under paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
When paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section applies to treat a covered debt instrument as funding a distribution or acquisition described in paragraphs (b)(3)(i)(A) through (C) of this section as a result of a re-testing described in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section that occurs in a taxable year subsequent to the taxable year in which the covered debt instrument is issued, the covered debt instrument is deemed to be exchanged for stock on the later of the date of the re-testing or the date that the covered debt instrument would be treated as stock under paragraph (d)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section. See paragraph (h)(3) of this section,
Example 7,
for an illustration of this rule.
(2)
Covered debt instrument treated as stock that leaves the expanded group
—(i)
Events that cause a covered debt instrument to cease to be treated as stock.
Subject to paragraph (b)(4) of this section, this paragraph (d)(2)(i) applies with respect to a covered debt instrument that is treated as stock under this section when the holder and issuer of a covered debt instrument cease to be members of the same expanded group, either because the covered debt instrument is transferred to a person that is not a member of the expanded group that includes the issuer or because the holder or the issuer ceases to be a member of the same expanded group, or in the case of a holder that is a controlled partnership, when the holder ceases to be a controlled partnership with respect to the expanded group of which the issuer is a member, either because the partnership ceases to be a controlled partnership or because the issuer ceases to be a member of the same expanded group with respect to which the holder is a controlled partnership. In such a case, the covered debt instrument ceases to be treated as stock under this section. For this purpose, immediately before the transaction that causes the holder and issuer of the covered debt instrument to cease to be members of the same expanded group, or, if the holder is a controlled partnership, that causes the holder to cease to be a controlled partnership with respect to the expanded group of which the issuer is a member, the issuer is deemed to issue a new covered debt instrument to the holder in exchange for the covered debt instrument that was treated as stock in a transaction that is disregarded for purposes of paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section.
(ii)
Re-testing of covered debt instruments and certain distributions and acquisitions
—(A)
General rule.
For purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section, when paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section or § 1.385-4(c)(2) causes a covered debt instrument that previously was treated as stock pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section to cease to be treated as stock, all other covered debt instruments of the issuer that are not treated as stock on the date that the transaction occurs that causes paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section to apply are re-tested to determine whether those other covered debt instruments are treated as funding the distribution or acquisition that previously was treated as funded by the covered debt instrument that ceases to
be treated as stock pursuant to paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section. In addition, a covered debt instrument that is issued after an application of paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section and within the per se period may also be treated as funding that distribution or acquisition. See paragraph (h)(3) of this section,
Example 7,
for an illustration of this rule.
(B)
Re-testing upon a specified event with respect to a debt instrument issued by a controlled partnership.
If, with respect to a covered member that is an expanded group partner and a debt instrument issued by the controlled partnership, there is reduction in the covered member's specified portion under § 1.385-3(f)(5)(i) by reason of a specified event, the covered member must re-test its debt instruments as described in paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(A) of this section.
(3)
Inapplicability of section 385(c)(1).
Section 385(c)(1) does not apply with respect to a covered debt instrument to the extent that it is treated as stock under this section.
(4)
Treatment of disregarded entities.
This paragraph (d)(4) applies to the extent that a covered debt instrument issued by a disregarded entity, the regarded owner of which is a covered member, would, absent the application of this paragraph (d)(4), be treated as stock under this section. In this case, rather than the covered debt instrument being treated as stock to such extent (applicable portion), the covered member that is the regarded owner of the disregarded entity is deemed to issue its stock in the manner described in this paragraph (d)(4). If the applicable portion otherwise would have been treated as stock under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, then the covered member is deemed to issue its stock to the expanded group member to which the covered debt instrument was, in form, issued (or transferred) in the transaction described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. If the applicable portion otherwise would have been treated as stock under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, then the covered member is deemed to issue its stock to the holder of the covered debt instrument in exchange for a portion of the covered debt instrument equal to the applicable portion. In each case, the covered member that is the regarded owner of the disregarded entity is treated as the holder of the applicable portion of the debt instrument issued by the disregarded entity, and the actual holder is treated as the holder of the remaining portion of the covered debt instrument and the stock deemed to be issued by the regarded owner. Under Federal tax principles, the applicable portion of the debt instrument issued by the disregarded entity generally is disregarded. This paragraph (d)(4) must be applied in a manner that is consistent with the principles of paragraph (f)(4) of this section. Thus, for example, stock deemed issued is deemed to have the same terms as the covered debt instrument issued by the disregarded entity, other than the identity of the issuer, and payments on the stock are determined by reference to payments made on the covered debt instrument issued by the disregarded entity. See § 1.385-4(b)(3) for additional rules that apply if the regarded owner of the disregarded entity is a member of a consolidated group. If the regarded owner of a disregarded entity is a controlled partnership, then paragraph (f) of this section applies as though the controlled partnership were the issuer in form of the debt instrument.
(5)
Payments with respect to partially recharacterized covered debt instruments
—(i)
General rule.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(5)(ii) of this section, a payment with respect to an instrument that is partially recharacterized as stock is treated as made pro rata to the portion treated as stock and to the portion treated as indebtedness.
(ii)
Special rule for payments not required pursuant to the terms of the instrument.
A payment with respect to an instrument that is partially recharacterized as stock and that is a payment that is not required to be made pursuant to the terms of the instrument (for example, a prepayment of principal) may be designated by the issuer and the holder as with respect to the portion treated as stock or to the portion treated as indebtedness, in whole or in part. In the absence of such designation, see paragraph (d)(5)(i) of this section.
(6)
Treatment of a general rule transaction to which an exception applies.
To the extent a covered member would, absent the application of paragraph (c)(2) or (c)(3) of this section, be treated as making a distribution or acquisition described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, then, solely for purposes of applying paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the covered member is treated as issuing the covered debt instrument issued in the distribution or acquisition to a member of the covered member's expanded group in exchange for property.
(7)
Treatment for purposes of section 1504(a)
—(i)
Debt instruments treated as stock.
A covered debt instrument that is treated as stock under paragraph (b)(2), (3), or (4) of this section and that is not described in section 1504(a)(4) is not treated as stock for purposes of determining whether the issuer is a member of an affiliated group (within the meaning of section 1504(a)).
(ii)
Deemed partner stock and stock deemed issued by a regarded owner.
If deemed partner stock or stock that is deemed issued by a regarded owner under § 1.385-3(d)(4) is not described in section 1504(a)(4), then that stock is not treated as stock for purposes of determining whether the issuer of the stock is a member of an affiliated group (within the meaning of section 1504(a)).
(e)
No affirmative use.
[Reserved]
(f)
Treatment of controlled partnerships
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of this section and § 1.385-4, a controlled partnership is treated as an aggregate of its partners in the manner described in this paragraph (f). Paragraph (f)(2) of this section sets forth rules concerning the aggregate treatment when a controlled partnership acquires property from a member of the expanded group. Paragraph (f)(3) of this section sets forth rules concerning the aggregate treatment when a controlled partnership issues a debt instrument. Paragraph (f)(4) of this section deems a debt instrument issued by a controlled partnership to be held by an expanded group partner rather than the holder-in-form in certain cases. Paragraph (f)(5) of this section sets forth the rules concerning events that cause the deemed results described in paragraph (f)(4) of this section to cease. Paragraph (f)(6) of this section exempts certain issuances of a controlled partnership's debt to a partner and a partner's debt to a controlled partnership from the application of this section. For definitions applicable for this section, see paragraph (g) of this section. For examples illustrating the application of this section, see paragraph (h) of this section.
(2)
Acquisitions of property by a controlled partnership
—(i)
Acquisitions of property when a member of the expanded group is a partner on the date of the acquisition
—(A)
Aggregate treatment.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (f)(2)(i)(C) and (f)(6) of this section, if a controlled partnership, with respect to an expanded group, acquires property from a member of the expanded group (transferor member), then, for purposes of this section, a member of the expanded group that is an expanded group partner on the date of the acquisition is treated as acquiring its share (as determined under paragraph (f)(2)(i)(B) of this section) of the property. The expanded group partner is treated as acquiring its share of the property from the transferor member in the manner (for example, in a distribution, in an exchange for property, or in an issuance), and on the date on which, the property is actually acquired by the controlled partnership from the transferor member. Accordingly, this section applies to a member's acquisition of property described in this paragraph (f)(2)(i)(A) in the same manner as if the member actually acquired the property from the transferor member, unless explicitly provided otherwise.
(B)
Expanded group partner's share of property.
For purposes of paragraph (f)(2)(i)(A) of this section, a partner's share of property acquired by a controlled partnership is determined in accordance with the partner's liquidation value percentage (as defined in paragraph (g)(17) of this section) with respect to the controlled partnership. The liquidation value percentage is determined on the date on which the controlled partnership acquires the property.
(C)
Exception if transferor member is an expanded group partner.
If a transferor
member is an expanded group partner in the controlled partnership, paragraph (f)(2)(i)(A) of this section does not apply to such partner.
(ii)
Acquisitions of expanded group stock when a member of the expanded group becomes a partner after the acquisition
—(A)
Aggregate treatment.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(C) of this section, if a controlled partnership, with respect to an expanded group, owns expanded group stock, and a member of the expanded group becomes an expanded group partner in the controlled partnership, then, for purposes of this section, the member is treated as acquiring its share (as determined under paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(B) of this section) of the expanded group stock owned by the controlled partnership. The member is treated as acquiring its share of the expanded group stock on the date on which the member becomes an expanded group partner. Furthermore, the member is treated as if it acquires its share of the expanded group stock from a member of the expanded group in exchange for property other than expanded group stock, regardless of the manner in which the partnership acquired the stock and in which the member acquires its partnership interest. Accordingly, this section applies to a member's acquisition of expanded group stock described in this paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(A) in the same manner as if the member actually acquired the stock from a member of the expanded group in exchange for property other than expanded group stock, unless explicitly provided otherwise.
(B)
Expanded group partner's share of expanded group stock.
For purposes of paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, a partner's share of expanded group stock owned by a controlled partnership is determined in accordance with the partner's liquidation value percentage with respect to the controlled partnership. The liquidation value percentage is determined on the date on which a member of the expanded group becomes an expanded group partner in the controlled partnership.
(C)
Exception if an expanded group partner acquires its interest in a controlled partnership in exchange for expanded group stock.
Paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(A) of this section does not apply to a member of an expanded group that acquires its interest in a controlled partnership either from another partner in exchange solely for expanded group stock or upon a partnership contribution to the controlled partnership comprised solely of expanded group stock.
(3)
Issuances of debt instruments by a controlled partnership to a member of an expanded group
—(i)
Aggregate treatment.
If a controlled partnership, with respect to an expanded group, issues a debt instrument to a member of the expanded group, then, for purposes of this section, a covered member that is an expanded group partner is treated as the issuer with respect to its share (as determined under paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of this section) of the debt instrument issued by the controlled partnership. This section applies to the portion of the debt instrument treated as issued by the covered member as described in this paragraph (f)(3)(i) in the same manner as if the covered member actually issued the debt instrument to the holder-in-form, unless otherwise provided. See paragraph (f)(4) of this section, which deems a debt instrument issued by a controlled partnership to be held by an expanded group partner rather than the holder-in-form in certain cases.
(ii)
Expanded group partner's share of a debt instrument issued by a controlled partnership
—(A)
General rule.
An expanded group partner's share of a debt instrument issued by a controlled partnership is determined on each date on which the partner makes a distribution or acquisition described in paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(3)(i) of this section (testing date). An expanded group partner's share of a debt instrument issued by a controlled partnership to a member of the expanded group is determined in accordance with the partner's issuance percentage (as defined in paragraph (g)(16) of this section) on the testing date. A partner's share determined under this paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(A) is adjusted as described in paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(B) of this section.
(B)
Additional rules if there is a specified portion with respect to a debt instrument
—(
1
) An expanded group partner's share (as determined under paragraph
(f)(3)(ii)(A) of this section) of a debt instrument issued by a controlled partnership is reduced, but not below zero, by the sum of all of the specified portions (as defined in paragraph (g)(23) of this section), if any, with respect to the debt instrument that correspond to one or more deemed transferred receivables (as defined in paragraph (g)(8) of this section) that are deemed to be held by the partner.
(
2
) If the aggregate of all of the expanded group partners' shares (as determined under paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(A) of this section and reduced under paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(B)(
1
) of this section) of the debt instrument exceeds the adjusted issue price of the debt, reduced by the sum of all of the specified portions with respect to the debt instrument that correspond to one or more deemed transferred receivables that are deemed to be held by one or more expanded group partners (excess amount), then each expanded group partner's share (as determined under paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(A) of this section and reduced under paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(B)(
1
) of this section) of the debt instrument is reduced. The amount of an expanded group partner's reduction is the excess amount multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the partner's share, and the denominator of which is the aggregate of all of the expanded group partners' shares.
(iii)
Qualified short-term debt instrument.
The determination of whether a debt instrument is a qualified short-term debt instrument for purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(vii) of this section is made at the partnership-level without regard to paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section.
(4)
Recharacterization when there is a specified portion with respect to a debt instrument issued by a controlled partnership
—(i)
General rule.
A specified portion, with respect to a debt instrument issued by a controlled partnership and an expanded group partner, is not treated as stock under paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(3)(i) of this section. Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (f)(4)(ii) and (iii) of this section, the holder-in-form (as defined in paragraph (g)(15) of this section) of the debt instrument is deemed to transfer a portion of the debt instrument (a deemed transferred receivable, as defined in paragraph (g)(8) of this section) with a principal amount equal to the adjusted issue price of the specified portion to the expanded group partner in exchange for stock in the expanded group partner (deemed partner stock, as defined in paragraph (g)(6) of this section) with a fair market value equal to the principal amount of the deemed transferred receivable. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (f)(4)(vi) of this section (concerning the treatment of a deemed transferred receivable for purposes of section 752) and paragraph (f)(5) of this section (concerning specified events subsequent to the deemed transfer), the deemed transfer described in this paragraph (f)(4)(i) is deemed to occur for all Federal tax purposes.
(ii)
Expanded group partner is the holder-in-form of a debt instrument.
If the specified portion described in paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section is with respect to an expanded group partner that is the holder-in-form of the debt instrument, then paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section will not apply with respect to that specified portion except that only the first sentence of paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section is applicable.
(iii)
Expanded group partner is a consolidated group member.
This paragraph (f)(4)(iii) applies when one or more expanded group partners is a member of a consolidated group that files (or is required to file) a consolidated U.S. Federal income tax return. In this case, notwithstanding § 1.385-4(b)(1) (which generally treats members of a consolidated group as one corporation for purposes of this section), the holder-in-form of the debt instrument issued by the controlled partnership is deemed to transfer the deemed transferred receivable or receivables to the expanded group partner or partners that are members of a consolidated group that make, or are treated as making under paragraph (f)(2) of this section, the regarded distributions or acquisitions (within the meaning of § 1.385-4(e)(5)) described in paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(3)(i) of this section in exchange for deemed partner stock in such partner or partners. To the extent those regarded distributions or acquisitions are made by
a member of the consolidated group that is not an expanded group partner (excess amount), the holder-in-form is deemed to transfer a portion of the deemed transferred receivable or receivables to each member of the consolidated group that is an expanded group partner in exchange for deemed partner stock in the expanded group partner. The portion is the excess amount multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the portion of the consolidated group's share (as determined under paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of this section) of the debt instrument issued by the controlled partnership that would have been the expanded group partner's share if the partner was not a member of a consolidated group, and the denominator of which is the consolidated group's share of the debt instrument issued by the controlled partnership.
(iv)
Rules regarding deemed transferred receivables and deemed partner stock
—(A)
Terms of deemed partner stock.
Deemed partner stock has the same terms as the deemed transferred receivable with respect to the deemed transfer, other than the identity of the issuer.
(B)
Treatment of payments with respect to a debt instrument for which there is one or more deemed transferred receivables.
When a payment is made with respect to a debt instrument issued by a controlled partnership for which there is one or more deemed transferred receivables, then, if the amount of the retained receivable (as defined in paragraph (g)(22) of this section) held by the holder-in-form is zero and a single deemed holder is deemed to hold all of the deemed transferred receivables, the entire payment is allocated to the deemed transferred receivables held by the single deemed holder. If the amount of the retained receivable held by the holder-in-form is greater than zero or there are multiple deemed holders of deemed transferred receivables, or both, the payment is apportioned among the retained receivable, if any, and each deemed transferred receivable in proportion to the principal amount of all the receivables. The portion of a payment allocated or apportioned to a retained receivable or a deemed transferred receivable reduces the principal amount of, or accrued interest with respect to, as applicable depending on the payment, the retained receivable or deemed transferred receivable. When a payment allocated or apportioned to a deemed transferred receivable reduces the principal amount of the receivable, the expanded group partner that is the deemed holder with respect to the deemed transferred receivable is deemed to redeem the same amount of deemed partner stock, and the specified portion with respect to the debt instrument is reduced by the same amount. When a payment allocated or apportioned to a deemed transferred receivable reduces accrued interest with respect to the receivable, the expanded group partner that is the deemed holder with respect to the deemed transferred receivable is deemed to make a matching distribution in the same amount with respect to the deemed partner stock. The controlled partnership is treated as the paying agent with respect to the deemed partner stock.
(v)
Holder-in-form transfers debt instrument in a transaction that is not a specified event.
If the holder-in-form transfers the debt instrument (which is disregarded for Federal tax purposes) to a member of the expanded group or a controlled partnership (and therefore the transfer is not a specified event described in paragraph (f)(5)(iii)(F) of this section), then, for Federal tax purposes, the holder-in-form is deemed to transfer the retained receivable and the deemed partner stock to the transferee.
(vi)
Allocation of deemed transferred receivable under section 752.
A partnership liability that is a debt instrument with respect to which there is one or more deemed transferred receivables is allocated for purposes of section 752 without regard to any deemed transfer.
(5)
Specified events affecting ownership following a deemed transfer
—(i)
General rule.
If a specified event (within the meaning of paragraph (f)(5)(iii) of this section) occurs with respect to a deemed transfer, then, immediately before the specified event, the expanded group partner that is both the issuer of the deemed partner stock and the
deemed holder of the deemed transferred receivable is deemed to distribute the deemed transferred receivable (or portion thereof, as determined under paragraph (f)(5)(iv) of this section) to the holder-in-form in redemption of the deemed partner stock (or portion thereof, as determined under paragraph (f)(5)(iv) of this section) deemed to be held by the holder-in-form. The deemed distribution is deemed to occur for all Federal tax purposes, except that the distribution is disregarded for purposes of paragraph (b) of this section. Except when the deemed transferred receivable (or portion thereof, as determined under paragraph (f)(5)(iv) of this section) is deemed to be retransferred under paragraph (f)(5)(ii) of this section, the principal amount of the retained receivable held by the holder-in-form is increased by the principal amount of the deemed transferred receivable, the deemed transferred receivable ceases to exist for Federal tax purposes, and the specified portion (or portion thereof) that corresponds to the deemed transferred receivable (or portion thereof) ceases to be treated as a specified portion for purposes of this section.
(ii)
New deemed transfer when a specified event involves a transferee that is a covered member that is an expanded group partner.
If the specified event is described in paragraph (f)(5)(iii)(E) of this section, the holder-in-form of the debt instrument is deemed to retransfer the deemed transferred receivable (or portion thereof, as determined under paragraph (f)(5)(iv) of this section) that the holder-in-form is deemed to have received pursuant to paragraph (f)(5)(i) of this section, to the transferee expanded group partner in exchange for deemed partner stock issued by the transferee expanded group partner with a fair market value equal to the principal amount of the deemed transferred receivable (or portion thereof) that is retransferred. For purposes of this section, this deemed transfer is treated in the same manner as a deemed transfer described in paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section.
(iii)
Specified events.
A specified event, with respect to a deemed transfer, occurs when, immediately after the transaction and taking into account all related transactions:
(A) The controlled partnership that is the issuer of the debt instrument either ceases to be a controlled partnership or ceases to have an expanded group partner that is a covered member.
(B) The holder-in-form is a member of the expanded group immediately before the transaction, and the holder-in-form and the deemed holder cease to be members of the same expanded group for the reasons described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
(C) The holder-in-form is a controlled partnership immediately before the transaction, and the holder-in-form ceases to be a controlled partnership.
(D) The expanded group partner that is both the issuer of deemed partner stock and the deemed holder transfers (directly or indirectly through one or more partnerships) all or a portion of its interest in the controlled partnership to a person that neither is a covered member nor a controlled partnership with an expanded group partner that is a covered member. If there is a transfer of only a portion of the interest, see paragraph (f)(5)(iv) of this section.
(E) The expanded group partner that is both the issuer of deemed partner stock and the deemed holder transfers (directly or indirectly through one or more partnerships) all or a portion of its interest in the controlled partnership to a covered member or a controlled partnership with an expanded group partner that is a covered member. If there is a transfer of only a portion of the interest, see paragraph (f)(5)(iv) of this section.
(F) The holder-in-form transfers the debt instrument (which is disregarded for Federal tax purposes) to a person that is neither a member of the expanded group nor a controlled partnership. See paragraph (f)(4)(v) of this section if the holder-in-form transfers the debt instrument to a member of the expanded group or a controlled partnership.
(iv)
Specified event involving a transfer of only a portion of an interest in a controlled partnership.
If, with respect to a specified event described in paragraph (f)(5)(iii)(D) or (E) of this section, an
expanded group partner transfers only a portion of its interest in a controlled partnership, then, only a portion of the deemed transferred receivable that is deemed to be held by the expanded group partner is deemed to be distributed in redemption of an equal portion of the deemed partner stock. The portion of the deemed transferred receivable referred to in the preceding sentence is equal to the product of the entire principal amount of the deemed transferred receivable deemed to be held by the expanded group partner multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the portion of the expanded group partner's capital account attributable to the interest that is transferred, and the denominator of which is the expanded group partner's capital account with respect to its entire interest, determined immediately before the specified event.
(6)
Issuance of a partnership's debt instrument to a partner and a partner's debt instrument to a partnership.
If a controlled partnership, with respect to an expanded group, issues a debt instrument to an expanded group partner, or if a covered member that is an expanded group partner issues a covered debt instrument to a controlled partnership, and in each case, no partner deducts or receives an allocation of expense with respect to the debt instrument, then this section does not apply to the debt instrument.

(8)
Deemed transferred receivable.
The term
deemed transferred receivable
means, with respect to a deemed transfer, the portion of the debt instrument described in paragraph (f)(4)(i) or (iii) or (f)(5)(ii) of this section. The deemed transferred receivable is reduced as described in paragraphs (f)(4)(iv)(B) and (f)(5)(i) of this section.
(9)
Distribution.
The term distribution means any distribution made by a corporation with respect to its stock.
(10)
Exempt distribution.
The term exempt distribution means either—
(i) A distribution of stock that is permitted to be received without the recognition of gain or income under section 354(a)(1) or 355(a)(1), or, if section 356 applies, that is not treated as other property or money described in section 356; or
(ii) A distribution of property in a complete liquidation under section 336(a) or 337(a).
(11)

(A) Section 361(a) or (b) applies to the transferor of the expanded group stock and the stock is not transferred by issuance; or
(B) Section 1032 or § 1.1032-2 applies to the transferor of the expanded group stock and the stock is distributed by the transferee pursuant to the plan of reorganization;
(ii) The transferor of the expanded group stock is a shareholder that receives property in a complete liquidation to which section 331 or 332 applies; or
(iii) The transferor of the expanded group stock is an acquiring entity that is deemed to issue the stock in exchange for cash from an issuing corporation in a transaction described in § 1.1032-3(b).
(12)
Expanded group partner.
The term expanded group partner means, with respect to a controlled partnership of an expanded group, a member of the expanded group that is a partner (directly or indirectly through one or more partnerships).
(13)
Expanded group stock.
The term expanded group stock means, with respect to a member of an expanded group, stock of a member of the same expanded group.
(14)
Funded member.
The term funded member has the meaning provided in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section.
(15)
Holder-in-form.
The term
holder-in-form
means, with respect to a debt instrument issued by a controlled partnership, the person that, absent the application of paragraph (f)(4) of this section, would be the holder of the debt instrument for Federal tax purposes. Therefore, the term holder-in-form does not include a deemed holder (as defined in paragraph (g)(5) of this section).
(16)
Issuance percentage.
The term
issuance percentage
means, with respect
to a controlled partnership and an expanded group partner, the ratio (expressed as a percentage) of the partner's reasonably anticipated distributive share of all the partnership's interest expense over a reasonable period, divided by all of the partnership's reasonably anticipated interest expense over that same period, taking into account any and all relevant facts and circumstances. The relevant facts and circumstances include, without limitation, the term of the debt instrument; whether the partnership anticipates issuing other debt instruments; and the partnership's anticipated section 704(b) income and expense, and the partners' respective anticipated allocation percentages, taking into account anticipated changes to those allocation percentages over time resulting, for example, from anticipated contributions, distributions, recapitalizations, or provisions in the controlled partnership agreement.
(17)
Liquidation value percentage.
The term
liquidation value percentage
means, with respect to a controlled partnership and an expanded group partner, the ratio (expressed as a percentage) of the liquidation value of the expanded group partner's interest in the partnership divided by the aggregate liquidation value of all the partners' interests in the partnership. The liquidation value of an expanded group partner's interest in a controlled partnership is the amount of cash the partner would receive with respect to the interest if the partnership (and any partnership through which the partner indirectly owns an interest in the controlled partnership) sold all of its property for an amount of cash equal to the fair market value of the property (taking into account section 7701(g)), satisfied all of its liabilities (other than those described in § 1.752-7), paid an unrelated third party to assume all of its § 1.752-7 liabilities in a fully taxable transaction, and then the partnership (and any partnership through which the partner indirectly owns an interest in the controlled partnership) liquidated.
(18)

The term member of a consolidated group means a corporation described in § 1.1502-1(b).
(19)
Per se period.
The term per se period has the meaning provided in paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this section.
(20)
Predecessor
—(i)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (g)(20)(ii) of this section, the term predecessor means, with respect to a corporation—
(A) The distributor or transferor corporation in a transaction described in section 381(a) in which the corporation is the acquiring corporation; or
(B) The distributing corporation in a distribution or exchange to which section 355 (or so much of section 356 that relates to section 355) applies in which the corporation is a controlled corporation.
(ii)
Predecessor ceasing to be a member of the same expanded group as corporation.
The term predecessor does not include the distributing corporation described in paragraph (g)(20)(i)(B) of this section from the date that the distributing corporation ceases to be a member of the expanded group of which the controlled corporation is a member.
(iii)
Multiple predecessors.
A corporation may have more than one predecessor, including by reason of a predecessor of the corporation having a predecessor or successor. Accordingly, references to a corporation also include references to a predecessor or successor of a predecessor of the corporation.
(21)
Property.
The term property has the meaning specified in section 317(a).
(22)
Retained receivable.
The term
retained receivable
means, with respect to a debt instrument issued by a controlled partnership, the portion of the debt instrument that is not transferred by the holder-in-form pursuant to one or more deemed transfers. The retained receivable is adjusted for decreases described in paragraph (f)(4)(iv)(B) of this section and increases described in paragraph (f)(5)(i) of this section.
(23)
Specified portion.
The term
specified portion
means, with respect to a debt instrument issued by a controlled partnership and a covered member that is an expanded group partner, the portion of the debt instrument that is treated under paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section as issued on a testing date (within the meaning of paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of this section) by the covered
member and that, absent the application of paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section, would be treated as stock under paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(3)(i) of this section on the testing date. A specified portion is reduced as described in paragraphs (f)(4)(iv)(B) and (f)(5)(i) of this section.
(24)
Successor
—(i)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (g)(24)(iii) of this section, the term successor means, with respect to a corporation—
(A) The acquiring corporation in a transaction described in section 381(a) in which the corporation is the distributor or transferor corporation;
(B) A controlled corporation in a distribution or exchange to which section 355 (or so much of section 356 that relates to section 355) applies in which the corporation is the distributing corporation; or
(C) Subject to the rules in paragraph (g)(24)(ii) of this section, a seller in an acquisition described in paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A) of this section in which the corporation is the acquirer.
(ii)
Special rules for certain acquisitions of subsidiary stock.
The following rules apply with respect to a successor described in paragraph (g)(24)(i)(C) of this section:
(A) The seller is a successor to the acquirer only to the extent of the value (adjusted as described in paragraph (g)(24)(ii)(C) of this section) of the expanded group stock acquired from the seller in exchange for property (other than expanded group stock) in the acquisition described in paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A) of this section.
(B) A distribution or acquisition by either the seller or a successor seller to or from either the acquirer, the seller, or a successor seller is not treated as described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section for purposes of applying paragraph (b)(3) of this section to a covered debt instrument of the acquirer. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term successor seller means a member of the expanded group that receives property (other than expanded group stock) in a distribution or acquisition from the seller or another successor seller and is controlled by the acquirer as determined under the principles of paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section. A successor seller is treated as a successor to the acquirer to the extent of the value of the property received in a distribution or acquisition described in the preceding sentence and, for purposes of applying this paragraph (g)(24)(ii)(B).
(C) To the extent that a covered debt instrument of the acquirer is treated as funding a distribution or acquisition by the seller or successor seller described in paragraphs (b)(3)(i)(A) through (C) of this section, or would be treated but for the exceptions described in paragraphs (c)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section, the value of the expanded group stock described in paragraph (g)(24)(ii)(A) of this section is reduced by an amount equal to the distribution or acquisition for purposes of any further application of paragraph (g)(24)(ii)(A) of this section with respect to the acquirer and seller.
(iii)
Successor ceasing to be a member of the same expanded group as corporation.
The term successor does not include a controlled corporation described in paragraph (g)(24)(i)(B) of this section with respect to a distributing corporation or a seller described in paragraph (g)(24)(i)(C) of this section with respect to an acquirer from the date that the controlled corporation or the seller ceases to be a member of the expanded group of which the controlled corporation or acquirer, respectively, is a member.
(iv)
Multiple successors.
A corporation may have more than one successor, including by reason of a successor of the corporation having a predecessor or successor. Accordingly, references to a corporation also include references to a predecessor or successor of a successor of the corporation.
(25)
Taxable year.
The term taxable year refers to the taxable year of the issuer of the covered debt instrument.
(h)
Examples
—(1)
Assumed facts.
Except as otherwise stated, the following facts are assumed for purposes of the examples in paragraph (h)(3) of this section:
(i) FP is a foreign corporation that owns 100% of the stock of USS1, a covered member, 100% of the stock of USS2, a covered member, and 100% of the stock of FS, a foreign corporation;
(ii) USS1 owns 100% of the stock of DS, a covered member, and CFC, which is a controlled foreign corporation within the meaning of section 957;
(iii) At the beginning of Year 1, FP is the common parent of an expanded group comprised solely of FP, USS1, USS2, FS, DS, and CFC (the FP expanded group);
(iv) The FP expanded group has more than $50 million of covered debt instruments described in paragraph (c)(4) of this section at all times;
(v) No issuer of a covered debt instrument has a positive expanded group earnings account within the meaning of paragraph (c)(3)(i)(B) of this section or has received qualified contributions within the meaning of paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section;
(vi) All notes are covered debt instruments (as defined in paragraph (g)(3) of this section) and are not qualified short-term debt instruments (as defined in paragraph (b)(3)(vii) of this section);
(vii) Each entity has as its taxable year the calendar year;
(viii) PRS is a partnership for federal income tax purposes;
(ix) No corporation is a member of a consolidated group;
(x) No domestic corporation is a United States real property holding corporation within the meaning of section 897(c)(2);
(xi) Each note is issued with adequate stated interest (as defined in section 1274(c)(2)); and
(xii) Each transaction occurs after January 19, 2017.
(2)
No inference.
Except as otherwise provided in this section, it is assumed for purposes of the examples in paragraph (h)(3) of this section that the form of each transaction is respected for federal tax purposes. No inference is intended, however, as to whether any particular note would be respected as indebtedness or as to whether the form of any particular transaction described in an example in paragraph (h)(3) of this section would be respected for federal tax purposes.
(3)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this section.
(i)
Example 1. Distribution of a covered debt instrument
—(A)
Facts.
On Date A in Year 1, FS lends $100x to USS1 in exchange for USS1 Note A. On Date B in Year 2, USS1 issues USS1 Note B, which is has a value of $100x, to FP in a distribution.
(B)
Analysis.
USS1 Note B is a covered debt instrument that is issued by USS1 to FP, a member of the expanded group of which USS1 is a member, in a distribution. Accordingly, USS1 Note B is treated as stock under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section. Under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section, USS1 Note B is treated as stock when it is issued by USS1 to FP on Date B in Year 2. Accordingly, USS1 is treated as distributing USS1 stock to its shareholder FP in a distribution that is subject to section 305. Under paragraph (b)(5) of this section, because the distribution of USS1 Note B is described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the distribution of USS1 Note B is not treated as a distribution of property described in paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) of this section. Accordingly, USS1 Note A is not treated as funding the distribution of USS1 Note B for purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) of this section.
(ii)
Example 2. Covered debt instrument issued for expanded group stock that is exchanged for stock in a corporation that is not a member of the same expanded group
—(A)
Facts.
UST is a publicly traded domestic corporation. On Date A in Year 1, USS1 issues USS1 Note to FP in exchange for FP stock. Subsequently, on Date B of Year 1, USS1 transfers the FP stock to UST's shareholders, which are not members of the FP expanded group, in exchange for all of the stock of UST.
(B)
Analysis.
(
1
) Because USS1 and FP are both members of the FP expanded group, USS1 Note is treated as stock when it is issued by USS1 to FP in exchange for FP stock on Date A in Year 1 under paragraphs (b)(2)(ii) and (d)(1)(i) of this section. This result applies even though, pursuant to the same plan, USS1 transfers the FP stock to persons that are not members of the FP expanded group. The exchange of USS1 Note for FP stock is not an exempt exchange within the meaning of paragraph (g)(11) of this section.
(
2
) Because USS1 Note is treated as stock for federal tax purposes when it is issued by USS1, pursuant to section
§ 1.367(b)-10(a)(3)(ii) (defining property for purposes of § 1.367(b)-10) there is no potential application of § 1.367(b)-10(a) to USS1's acquisition of the FP stock.
(iii)
Example 3. Issuance of a note in exchange for expanded group stock
—(A)
Facts.
On Date A in Year 1, USS1 issues USS1 Note to FP in exchange for 40% of the FS stock owned by FP.
(B)
Analysis.
(
1
) Because USS1 and FP are both members of the FP expanded group, USS1 Note is treated as stock when it is issued by USS1 to FP in exchange for FS stock on Date A in Year 1 under paragraphs (b)(2)(ii) and (d)(1)(i) of this section. The exchange of USS1 Note for FS stock is not an exempt exchange within the meaning of paragraph (g)(11) of this section.
(
2
) Because USS1 Note is treated as stock for federal tax purposes when it is issued by USS1, USS1 Note is not treated as property for purposes of section 304(a) because it is not property within the meaning specified in section 317(a). Therefore, USS1's acquisition of FS stock from FP in exchange for USS1 Note is not an acquisition described in section 304(a)(1).
(iv)
Example 4. Funding occurs in same taxable year as distribution
—(A)
Facts.
On Date A in Year 1, FP lends $200x to DS in exchange for DS Note A. On Date B in Year 1, DS distributes $400x of cash to USS1 in a distribution.
(B)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, DS Note A is treated as funding the distribution by DS to USS1 because DS Note A is issued to a member of the FP expanded group during the per se period with respect to DS's distribution to USS1. Accordingly, under paragraphs (b)(3)(i)(A) and (d)(1)(ii) of this section, DS Note A is treated as stock on Date B in Year 1.
(v)
Example 5. Additional funding
—(A)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (h)(3)(iv)(A) of this section (
Example 4
), except that, in addition, on Date C in Year 2, FP lends an additional $300x to DS in exchange for DS Note B.
(B)
Analysis.
The analysis is the same as in paragraph (h)(3)(iv)(B) of this section (
Example 4
) with respect to DS Note A. DS Note B is also issued to a member of the FP expanded group during the per se period with respect to DS's distribution to USS1. Under paragraphs (b)(3)(iii)(A) and (b)(6) of this section, DS Note B is treated as funding only the remaining portion of DS's distribution to USS1, which is $200x. Accordingly, $200x of DS Note B is treated as stock under paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) of this section. Under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section, $200x of DS Note B is treated as stock when it is issued by DS to FP on Date C in Year 2. The remaining $100x of DS Note B continues to be treated as indebtedness.
(vi)
Example 6. Funding involving multiple interests
—(A)
Facts.
On Date A in Year 1, FP lends $300x to USS1 in exchange for USS1 Note A. On Date B in Year 2, USS1 distributes $300x of cash to FP. On Date C in Year 3, FP lends another $300x to USS1 in exchange for USS1 Note B.
(B)
Analysis.
(
1
) Under paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B) of this section, USS1 Note A is tested under paragraph (b)(3) of this section before USS1 Note B is tested. USS1 Note A is issued during the per se period with respect to USS1's $300x distribution to FP and, therefore, is treated as funding the distribution under paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this section. Beginning on Date B in Year 2, USS1 Note A is treated as stock under paragraphs (b)(3)(i)(A) and (d)(1)(ii) of this section.
(
2
) Under paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B) of this section, USS1 Note B is tested under paragraph (b)(3) of this section after USS1 Note A is tested. Because USS1 Note A is treated as funding the entire $300x distribution by USS1 to FP, USS1 Note B will continue to be treated as indebtedness. See paragraph (b)(6) of this section.
(vii)
Example 7. Re-testing
—(A)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (h)(3)(vi)(A) of this section (
Example 6
), except that on Date D in Year 4, FP sells USS1 Note A to Bank.
(B)
Analysis.
(
1
) Under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, USS1 Note A ceases to be treated as stock when FP sells USS1 Note A to Bank on Date D in Year 4. Immediately before FP sells USS1 Note A to Bank, USS1 is deemed to issue a debt instrument to FP in exchange for USS1 Note A in a transaction that is disregarded for purposes of paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section.
(
2
) Under paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, after USS1 Note A is deemed exchanged for a new debt instrument, USS1's other covered debt instruments that are not treated as stock as of Date D in Year 4 (USS1 Note B) are re-tested for purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section to determine whether the instruments are treated as funding the $300x distribution by USS1 to FP on Date B in Year 2. USS1 Note B was issued by USS1 to FP during the per se period. Accordingly, USS1 Note B is re-tested under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section. Under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section, USS1 Note B is treated as funding the distribution on Date C in Year 3 and, accordingly, is treated as stock under paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) of this section. USS1 Note B is deemed to be exchanged for stock on Date D in Year 4, the re-testing date, under paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section. See § 1.385-1(d) for rules regarding the treatment of this deemed exchange.
(viii)
Example 8. Distribution of expanded group stock and covered debt instrument in a reorganization that qualifies under section 355
—(A)
Facts.
On Date A in Year 1, FP lends $200x to USS2 in exchange for USS2 Note. In a transaction that is treated as independent from the transaction on Date A in Year 1, on Date B in Year 2, USS2 transfers a portion of its assets to DS2, a newly formed domestic corporation, in exchange for all of the stock of DS2 and DS2 Note. Immediately afterwards, USS2 distributes all of the DS2 stock and the DS2 Note to FP with respect to FP's USS2 stock in a transaction that qualifies under section 355. USS2's transfer of a portion of its assets to DS2 qualifies as a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(D). The DS2 stock has a value of $150x and DS2 Note has a value of $50x. The DS2 stock is not non-qualified preferred stock as defined in section 351(g)(2). Absent the application of this section, DS2 Note would be treated by FP as other property within the meaning of section 356.
(B)
Analysis.
(
1
) The contribution and distribution transaction is a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(D) involving a transfer of property by USS2 to DS2 in exchange for DS2 stock and DS2 Note. The transfer of property by USS2 to DS2 is a contribution of excluded property described in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(D)(
2
) of this section and an excluded contribution described in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(E)(
2
) of this section. Accordingly, USS2's contribution of property to DS2 is not a qualified contribution described in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(B) of this section.
(
2
) DS2 Note is a covered debt instrument that is issued by DS2 to USS2, both members of the FP expanded group, in exchange for property of USS2 in an asset reorganization (as defined in paragraph (g)(1) of this section), and received by FP, another FP expanded group member immediately before the reorganization, as other property with respect to FP's USS2 stock. Accordingly, the transaction is described in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, and DS2 Note is treated as stock when it is issued by DS2 to USS2 on Date B in Year 2 pursuant to paragraphs (b)(2)(iii) and (d)(1)(i) of this section.
(
3
) Because the issuance of DS2 Note by DS2 in exchange for the property of USS2 in an asset reorganization is described in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, the distribution and acquisition of DS2 Note by USS2 is not treated as a distribution or acquisition described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section. Accordingly, USS2 Note is not treated as funding the distribution of DS2 Note for purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section.
(
4
) USS2's acquisition of DS2 stock is not an acquisition described in paragraph (b)(3)(i)(B) of this section because it is an exempt exchange (as defined in paragraph (g)(11) of this section). USS2's acquisition of DS2 stock is an exempt exchange because USS2 and DS2 are both parties to a reorganization that is an asset reorganization, section 1032 applies to DS2, the transferor of the expanded group stock, and the DS2 stock is distributed by USS2, the transferee of the expanded group stock, pursuant to the plan of reorganization.
(
5
) USS2's distribution of $150x of the DS2 stock is a distribution of stock that is permitted to be received by FP without recognition of gain under section 355(a)(1). Accordingly, USS2's distribution of the DS2 stock (other than
the DS2 Note) to FP is an exempt distribution, and is not described in paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) of this section.
(
6
) Because USS2 has not made a distribution or acquisition that is described in paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A), (B), or (C) of this section, USS2 Note is not treated as stock.
(ix)
Example 9. Funding a distribution by a successor to funded member
—(A)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in
Example 8
of this paragraph (h)(3), except that on Date C in Year 3, DS2 distributes $200x of cash to FP and, subsequently, on Date D in Year 3, USS2 distributes $100x of cash to FP.
(B)
Analysis.
(
1
) USS2 is a predecessor of DS2 under paragraph (g)(20)(i)(B) of this section and DS2 is a successor to USS2 under paragraph (g)(24)(i)(B) of this section because USS2 is the distributing corporation and DS2 is the controlled corporation in a distribution to which section 355 applies. Accordingly, under paragraph (b)(3)(v) of this section, a distribution by DS2 is treated as a distribution by USS2. Under paragraphs (b)(3)(iii)(A) and (b)(3)(v)(B) of this section, USS2 Note is treated as funding the distribution by DS2 to FP because USS2 Note was issued during the per se period with respect to DS2's $200x cash distribution, and because both the issuance of USS2 Note and the distribution by DS2 occur during the per se period with respect to the section 355 distribution. Accordingly, under paragraphs (b)(3)(i)(A) and (d)(1)(ii) of this section, USS2 Note is treated as stock beginning on Date C in Year 3. See § 1.385-1(d) for rules regarding the treatment of this deemed exchange.
(
2
) Because the entire amount of USS2 Note is treated as funding DS2's $200x distribution to FP, under paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(C) of this section, USS2 Note is not treated as funding the subsequent distribution by USS2 on Date D in Year 3.
(x)
Example 10. Asset reorganization; section 354 qualified property
—(A)
Facts.
On Date A in Year 1, FS lends $100x to USS2 in exchange for USS2 Note. On Date B in Year 2, in a transaction that qualifies as a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(D), USS2 transfers all of its assets to USS1 in exchange for stock of USS1 and the assumption by USS1 of all of the liabilities of USS2, and USS2 distributes to FP, with respect to FP's USS2 stock, all of the USS1 stock that USS2 receives. FP does not recognize gain under section 354(a)(1).
(B)
Analysis.
(
1
) USS1 is a successor to USS2 under paragraph (g)(24)(i)(A) of this section. For purposes of paragraph (b)(3) of this section, USS2 and, under paragraph (b)(3)(v)(A) of this section, its successor, USS1, are funded members with respect to USS2 Note. Although USS2, a funded member, distributes property (USS1 stock) to its shareholder, FP, pursuant to the reorganization, the distribution of USS1 stock is not described in paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) of this section because the stock is distributed in an exempt distribution (as defined in paragraph (g)(10) of this section). In addition, neither USS1's acquisition of the assets of USS2 nor USS2's acquisition of USS1 stock is described in paragraph (b)(3)(i)(C) of this section because FP does not receive other property within the meaning of section 356 with respect to its stock in USS2.
(
2
) USS2's acquisition of USS1 stock is not an acquisition described in paragraph (b)(3)(i)(B) of this section because it is an exempt exchange (as defined in paragraph (g)(11) of this section). USS2's acquisition of USS1 stock is an exempt exchange because USS1 and USS2 are both parties to an asset reorganization, section 1032 applies to USS1, the transferor of the USS1 stock, and the USS1 stock is distributed by USS2, the transferee, pursuant to the plan of reorganization. Furthermore, USS2's acquisition of its own stock from FS is not an acquisition described in paragraph (b)(3)(i)(B) of this section because USS2 acquires its stock in exchange for USS1 stock.
(
3
) Because neither USS1 nor USS2 has made a distribution or acquisition described in paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A), (B), or (C) of this section, USS2 Note is not treated as stock under paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this section.
(xi)
Example 11. Distribution of a covered debt instrument and issuance of a covered debt instrument with a principal purpose of avoiding the purposes of this section
—(A)
Facts.
On Date A in Year 1, USS1 issues USS1 Note A, which has a
value of $100x, to FP in a distribution. On Date B in Year 1, with a principal purpose of avoiding the purposes of this section, FP sells USS1 Note A to Bank for $100x of cash and lends $100x to USS1 in exchange for USS1 Note B.
(B)
Analysis.
USS1 Note A is a covered debt instrument that is issued by USS1 to FP, a member of USS1's expanded group, in a distribution. Accordingly, under paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (d)(1)(i) of this section, USS1 Note A is treated as stock when it is issued by USS1 to FP on Date A in Year 1. Accordingly, USS1 is treated as distributing USS1 stock to FP. Because the distribution of USS1 Note A is described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the distribution of USS1 Note A is not described in paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) of this section under paragraph (b)(5) of this section. Under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, USS1 Note A ceases to be treated as stock when FP sells USS1 Note A to Bank on Date B in Year 1. Immediately before FP sells USS1 Note A to Bank, USS1 is deemed to issue a debt instrument to FP in exchange for USS1 Note A in a transaction that is disregarded for purposes of paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3)(i) of this section. USS1 Note B is not treated as stock under paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) of this section because the funded member, USS1, has not made a distribution of property. However, because the transactions occurring on Date B of Year 1 were undertaken with a principal purpose of avoiding the purposes of this section, USS1 Note B is treated as stock on Date B of Year 1 under paragraph (b)(4) of this section.

Example 12: Distribution of a covered debt instrument to a controlled partnership
—(A)
Facts.
CFC and FS are equal partners in PRS. PRS owns 100% of the stock in X Corp, a domestic corporation. On Date A in Year 1, X Corp issues X Note to PRS in a distribution.
(B)
Analysis.
(
1
) Under § 1.385-1(c)(4), in determining whether X Corp is a member of the FP expanded group that includes CFC and FS, CFC and FS are each treated as owning 50% of the X Corp stock held by PRS. Accordingly, 100% of X Corp's stock is treated as owned by CFC and FS, and X Corp is a member of the FP expanded group.
(
2
) Together CFC and FS own 100% of the interests in PRS capital and profits, such that PRS is a controlled partnership under § 1.385-1(c)(1). CFC and FS are both expanded group partners on the date on which PRS acquired X Note. Therefore, pursuant to paragraph (f)(2)(i)(A) of this section, each of CFC and FS is treated as acquiring its share of X Note in the same manner (in this case, by a distribution of X Note), and on the date on which, PRS acquired X Note. Likewise, X Corp is treated as issuing to each of CFC and FS its share of X Note. Under paragraph (f)(2)(i)(B) of this section, each of CFC's and FS's share of X Note, respectively, is determined in accordance with its liquidation value percentage determined on Date A in Year 1, the date X Corp distributed X Note to PRS. On Date A in Year 1, pursuant to paragraph (g)(17) of this section, each of CFC's and FS's liquidation value percentages is 50%. Accordingly, on Date A in Year 1, under paragraph (f)(2)(i)(A) of this section, for purposes of this section, CFC and FS are each treated as acquiring 50% of X Note in a distribution.
(
3
) Under paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (d)(1)(i) of this section, X Note is treated as stock on the date of issuance, which is Date A in Year 1. Under paragraph (f)(2)(i)(A) of this section, each of CFC and FS are treated as acquiring 50% of X Note in a distribution for purposes of this section. Therefore, X Corp is treated as distributing its stock to PRS in a distribution described in section 305.

Example 13: Loan to a controlled partnership; proportionate distributions by expanded group partners
—(A)
Facts.
DS, USS2, and USP are partners in PRS. USP is a domestic corporation that is not a member of the FP expanded group. Each of DS and USS2 own 45% of the interests in PRS profits and capital, and USP owns 10% of the interests in PRS profits and capital. The PRS partnership agreement provides that all items of PRS income, gain, loss, deduction, and credit are allocated in accordance with the percentages in the preceding sentence. On Date A in Year 1, FP lends $200x to PRS in exchange for PRS Note with stated principal amount of $200x, which is payable at maturity. PRS Note also
provides for annual payments of interest that are qualified stated interest. PRS uses all $200x in its business and does not distribute any money or other property to a partner. Subsequently, on Date B in Year 1, DS distributes $90x to USS1, USS2 distributes $90x to FP, and USP distributes $20x to its shareholder. Each of DS's and USS2's issuance percentage is 45% on Date B in Year 1, the date of the distributions and therefore a testing date under paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(A) of this section.
(B)
Analysis.
(
1
) DS and USS2 together own 90% of the interests in PRS profits and capital and therefore PRS is a controlled partnership under § 1.385-1(c)(1). Under § 1.385-1(c)(2), each of DS and USS2 is a covered member.
(
2
) Under paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section, each of DS and USS2 is treated as issuing its share of PRS Note, and under paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, DS's and USS2's share is each $90x (45% of $200x). USP is not an expanded group partner and therefore has no issuance percentage and is not treated as issuing any portion of PRS Note.
(
3
) The $90x distributions made by DS to USS1 and by USS2 to FP are described in paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) of this section. Under paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, the portions of PRS Note treated as issued by each of DS and USS2 are treated as funding the distribution made by DS and USS2 because the distributions occurred within the per se period with respect to PRS Note. Under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, the portions of PRS Note treated as issued by each of DS and USS2 would, absent the application of paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section, be treated as stock of DS and USS2 on Date B in Year 1, the date of the distributions. See paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section. Under paragraph (g)(23) of this section, each of the $90x portions is a specified portion.
(
4
) Under paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section, the specified portions are not treated as stock under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section. Instead, FP is deemed to transfer a portion of PRS Note with a principal amount equal to $90x (the adjusted issue price of the specified portion with respect to DS) to DS in exchange for deemed partner stock in DS with a fair market value of $90x. Similarly, FP is deemed to transfer a portion of PRS Note with a principal amount equal to $90x (the adjusted issue price of the specified portion with respect to USS2) to USS2 in exchange for deemed partner stock in USS2 with a fair market value of $90x. The principal amount of the retained receivable held by FP is $20x ($200x−$90x−$90x).

(

) The $45x and $135x distributions made by DS to USS1 and by USS2 to FP, respectively, are described in paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) of this section. Under paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, the portion of PRS Note treated as issued by DS is treated as funding the distribution made by DS because the distribution occurred within the per se period with respect to PRS Note, but under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, only to the extent of DS's $45x distribution. USS2 is treated as issuing $90x of PRS Note, all of which is treated as funding $90x of USS2's $135x distribution under paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this section. Under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, absent the application of paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section, $45x of PRS Note would be treated as stock of DS and $90x of PRS Note would be treated as stock of USS2 on Date B in Year 1, the date of the distributions. See paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section. Under paragraph (g)(23) of this section, $45x of PRS Note is a specified portion with respect to DS and $90x of PRS Note is a specified portion with respect to USS2.
(
4
) Under paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section, the specified portions are not treated as stock under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section. Instead, FP is deemed to transfer a portion of PRS Note with a principal amount equal to
$45x (the adjusted issue price of the specified portion with respect to DS) to DS in exchange for stock of DS with a fair market value of $90x. Similarly, FP is deemed to transfer a portion of PRS Note with a principal amount equal to $90x (the adjusted issue price of the specified portion with respect to USS2) to USS2 in exchange for stock of USS2 with a fair market value of $90x. The principal amount of the retained receivable held by FP is $65x ($200x−$45x−$90x).

Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (h)(3)(xiii)(A) of this section (
Example 13
), except that USS2 does not distribute $90x to FP until Date C in Year 2, which is less than 36 months after Date A in Year 1. On Date C in Year 2, DS's, USS2's, and USP's issuance percentages under paragraph (g)(16) of this section are unchanged at 45%, 45%, and 10%, respectively.

Example 13
).
(
4
) With respect to the deemed transfer to DS, the analysis is the same as in paragraph (h)(3)(xiii)(B)(
4
) of this section (
Example 13
). Accordingly, the amount of the retained receivable held by FP as of Date B in Year 1 is $110x ($200x−$90x).
(
5
) Under paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, USS2's share of PRS Note is determined on Date C in Year 2. On Date C in Year 2, DS's, USS2's, and USP's respective shares of PRS Note under paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(A) of this section are $90x, $90x, and $20x. However, because DS is treated as the issuer with respect to a $90x specified portion of PRS Note, DS's share of PRS Note is reduced by $90x to $0 under paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(B)(
1
) of this section. No reduction to either of USS2's or USP's share of PRS Note is required under paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(B)(
2
) of this section because the aggregate of DS's, USS2's, and USP's shares of PRS Note as reduced is $110x (DS has a $0 share, USS2 has a $90x share, and USP has a $20x share), which does not exceed $110x (the $200x adjusted issue price of PRS Note reduced by the $90x specified portion with respect to DS). Under paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section, USS2 is treated as issuing its share of PRS Note.
(
6
) The $90x distribution made by USS2 to FP is described in paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) of this section. Under paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, the portion of PRS Note treated as issued by USS2 is treated as funding the distribution made by USS2, because the distribution occurred within the per se period with respect to PRS Note. Accordingly, the portion of PRS Note treated as issued by USS2 would, absent the application of paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section, be treated as stock of USS2 under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section on Date C in Year 2. See paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section. Under paragraph (g)(23) of this section, the $90x portion is a specified portion.
(
7
) Under paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section, the specified portion of PRS Note treated as issued by USS2 is not treated as stock under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section. Instead, on Date C in Year 2, FP is deemed to transfer a portion of PRS Note with a principal amount equal to $90x (the adjusted issue price of the specified portion with respect to USS2) to USS2 in exchange for stock in USS2 with a fair market value of $90x. The principal amount of the retained receivable held by FP is reduced from $110x to $20x.

Example 16: Loan to a controlled partnership; partnership ceases to be a controlled partnership
—(A)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (h)(3)(xiii)(A) of this section (
Example 13
), except that on Date C in Year 4, USS2 sells its entire interest in PRS to an unrelated person.
(B)
Analysis.
(
1
) On date C in Year 4, PRS ceases to be a controlled partnership with respect to the FP expanded group under § 1.385-1(c)(1). This is the case because DS, the only remaining partner that is a member of the FP expanded group, only owns 45% of the total interest in PRS profits and capital. Because PRS ceases to be a controlled partnership, a specified event (within the meaning of paragraph
(f)(5)(iii)(A) of this section) occurs with respect to the deemed transfers with respect to each of DS and USS2.
(
2
) Under paragraph (f)(5)(i) of this section, on Date C in Year 4, immediately before PRS ceases to be a controlled partnership, each of DS and USS2 is deemed to distribute its deemed transferred receivable to FP in redemption of FP's deemed partner stock in DS and USS2. The specified portion that corresponds to each of the deemed transferred receivables ceases to be treated as a specified portion. Furthermore, the deemed transferred receivables cease to exist, and the retained receivable held by FP increases from $20x to $200x.

Example 17: Transfer of an interest in a partnership to a covered member
—(A)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (h)(3)(xiii)(A) of this section (
Example 13
), except that on Date C in Year 4, USS2 sells its entire interest in PRS to USS1.
(B)
Analysis.
(
1
) After USS2 sells its interest in PRS to USS1, DS and USS1 together own 90% of the interests in PRS profits and capital and therefore PRS continues to be a controlled partnership under § 1.385-1(c)(1). A specified event (within the meaning of paragraph (f)(5)(iii)(E) of this section) occurs as result of the sale only with respect to the deemed transfer with respect to USS2.
(
2
) Under paragraph (f)(5)(i) of this section, on Date C in Year 4, immediately before USS2 sells its entire interest in PRS to USS1, USS2 is deemed to distribute its deemed transferred receivable to FP in redemption of FP's deemed partner stock in USS2. Because the specified event is described in paragraph (f)(5)(iii)(E) of this section, under paragraph (f)(5)(ii) of this section, FP is deemed to retransfer the deemed transferred receivable deemed received from USS2 to USS1 in exchange for deemed partner stock in USS1 with a fair market value equal to the principal amount of the deemed transferred receivable that is retransferred to USS1.
(xviii)
Example 18: Loan to partnership and all partners are members of a consolidated group
—(A)
Facts.
USS1 and DS are equal partners in PRS. USS1 and DS are members of a consolidated group, as defined in § 1.1502-1(h). The PRS partnership agreement provides that all items of PRS income, gain, loss, deduction, and credit are allocated equally between USS1 and DS. On Date A in Year 1, FP lends $200x to PRS in exchange for PRS Note. PRS uses all $200x in its business and does not distribute any money or other property to any partner. On Date B in Year 1, DS distributes $200x to USS1, and USS1 distributes $200x to FP. If neither of USS1 or DS were a member of the consolidated group, each would have an issuance percentage under paragraph (g)(16) of this section, determined as of Date A in Year 1, of 50%.
(B)
Analysis.
(
1
) Pursuant to § 1.385-4(b)(6), PRS is treated as a partnership for purposes of this section. Under § 1.385-4(b)(1), DS and USS1 are treated as one corporation for purposes of this section, and thus a single covered member under § 1.385-1(c)(2). For purposes of this section, the single covered member owns 100% of the PRS profits and capital and therefore PRS is a controlled partnership under § 1.385-1(c)(1). Under paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section, the single covered member is treated as issuing all $200x of PRS Note to FP, a member of the same expanded group as the single covered member. DS's distribution to USS1 is a disregarded distribution because it is a distribution between members of a consolidated group that is disregarded under the one-corporation rule described in § 1.385-4(b)(1). However, under paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, PRS Note, treated as issued by the single covered member, is treated as funding the distribution by USS1 to FP, which is described in paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) of this section and which is a regarded distribution. Accordingly, PRS Note, absent the application of paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section, would be treated as stock under paragraph (b) of this section on Date B in Year 1. Thus, pursuant to paragraph (g)(23) of this section, the entire PRS Note is a specified portion.
(
2
) Under paragraphs (f)(4)(i) and (iii) of this section, the specified portion is not treated as stock and, instead, FP is deemed to transfer PRS Note with a principal amount equal to $200x to USS1 in exchange for stock of USS1
with a fair market value of $200x. Under paragraph (f)(4)(iii) of this section, FP is deemed to transfer PRS Note to USS1 because only USS1 made a regarded distribution described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section.
(xix)
Example 19: Loan to a disregarded entity
—(A)
Facts.
DS owns DRE, a disregarded entity within the meaning of § 1.385-1(c)(3). On Date A in Year 1, FP lends $200x to DRE in exchange for DRE Note. Subsequently, on Date B in Year 1, DS distributes $100x of cash to USS1.
(B)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, $100x of DRE Note would be treated as funding the distribution by DS to USS1 because DRE Note is issued to a member of the FP expanded group during the per se period with respect to DS's distribution to USS1. Accordingly, under paragraphs (b)(3)(i)(A) and (d)(1)(ii) of this section, $100x of DRE Note would be treated as stock on Date B in Year 1. However, under paragraph (d)(4) of this section, DS, as the regarded owner, within the meaning of § 1.385-1(c)(5), of DRE is deemed to issue its stock to FP in exchange for a portion of DRE Note equal to the $100x applicable portion (as defined in paragraph (d)(4) of this section). Thus, DS is treated as the holder of $100x of DRE Note, which is disregarded, and FP is treated as the holder of the remaining $100x of DRE Note. The $100x of stock deemed issued by DS to FP has the same terms as DRE Note, other than the issuer, and payments on the stock are determined by reference to payments on DRE Note.

Transition rules
—(i)
Transition rule for covered debt instruments that would be treated as stock in taxable years ending before January 19, 2017.
If paragraphs (b) and (d)(1) of this section, taking into account §§ 1.385-1, 1.385-3, and 1.385-4, would have treated a covered debt instrument as stock in a taxable year ending before January 19, 2017 but for the application of paragraph (j)(1) of this section, to the extent that the covered debt instrument is held by a member of the expanded group of which the issuer is a member immediately after January 19, 2017, then the covered debt instrument is deemed to be exchanged for stock immediately after January 19, 2017.
(ii)
Transition rule for certain covered debt instruments treated as stock in taxable years ending on or after
January 19, 2017. If paragraphs (b) and (d)(1) of this section, taking into account §§ 1.385-1, 1.385-3, and 1.385-4, would treat a covered debt instrument as stock on or before January 19, 2017 but in a taxable year ending on or after January 19, 2017, that covered debt instrument is not treated as stock during the 90-day period after October 21, 2016. Instead, to the extent that the covered debt instrument is held by a member of the expanded group of which the issuer is a member immediately after January 19, 2017, the covered debt instrument is deemed to be exchanged for stock immediately after January 19, 2017.
(iii)
Transition funding rule.
When a covered debt instrument would be recharacterized as stock after April 4, 2016, and on or before January 19, 2017 (the
transition period
), but that covered debt instrument is not recharacterized as stock on such date due to the application of paragraph (j)(1), (j)(2)(i), or (j)(2)(ii) of this section, any payments made with respect to such covered debt instrument (other than stated interest), including pursuant to a refinancing, after the date that the covered debt instrument would have been recharacterized as stock and through the remaining portion of the transition period are treated as distributions for purposes of applying paragraph (b)(3) of this section for taxable years ending on or after January 19, 2017. In addition, to the extent that the holder and the issuer of the covered debt instrument cease to be members of the same expanded group during the transition period, the distribution or acquisition that would have caused the covered debt instrument to be treated as stock is available to be treated as funded by other covered debt instruments of the issuer for purposes of paragraph (b)(3) of this section (to the extent provided in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section).
The prior sentence is applied in a manner that is consistent with the rules set forth in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
(iv)
Coordination between the general rule and funding rule.
When a covered debt instrument would be recharacterized as stock pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section after April 4, 2016, and on or before January 19, 2017, but that covered debt instrument is not recharacterized as stock on such date due to the application of paragraph (j)(1), (j)(2)(i), or (j)(2)(ii) of this section, the issuance of such covered debt instrument is not treated as a distribution or acquisition described in § 1.385-3(b)(3)(i), but only to the extent that the covered debt instrument is held by a member of the expanded group of which the issuer is a member immediately after January 19, 2017.
(v)
Option to apply proposed regulations.
In lieu of applying §§ 1.385-1, 1.385-3, and 1.385-4, taxpayers may apply the provisions matching §§ 1.385-1, 1.385-3, and 1.385-4 from the Internal Revenue Bulletin (IRB) 2016-17 (
https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-irbs/irb16-17.pdf
) to all debt instruments issued by a particular issuer (and members of its expanded group that are covered members) after April 4, 2016, and before October 13, 2016, solely for purposes of determining whether a debt instrument is treated as stock, provided that those sections are consistently applied.

Paragraph (f)(4)(iii) of this section.
Paragraph (f)(4)(iii) of this section applies to taxable years for which the U.S. Federal income tax return is due, without extensions, after May 14, 2020. For taxable years ending on or after January 19, 2017, and for which the U.S. Federal income tax return is due, without extensions, on or before May 14, 2020, see § 1.385-3T(f)(4)(iii), as contained in 26 CFR in part 1 in effect on April 1, 2019. In the case of a taxable year that ends after October 13, 2019, and on or before May 14, 2020, a taxpayer may choose to apply paragraph (f)(4)(iii) of this section to the portion of the taxable year that occurs after the expiration of § 1.385-3T on October 13, 2019, provided that all members of the taxpayer's expanded group apply such paragraph.

§ 1.385-4
Treatment of consolidated groups.
(a)
Scope.
This section provides rules for applying § 1.385-3 to members of consolidated groups. Paragraph (b) of this section sets forth rules concerning the extent to which, solely for purposes of applying § 1.385-3, members of a consolidated group that file (or that are required to file) a consolidated U.S. Federal income tax return are treated as one corporation. Paragraph (c) of this section sets forth rules concerning the treatment of a debt instrument that ceases to be, or becomes, a consolidated group debt instrument. Paragraph (d) of this section provides rules for applying the funding rule of § 1.385-3(b)(3) to members that depart a consolidated group. For definitions applicable to this section, see paragraph (e) of this section and §§ 1.385-1(c) and 1.385-3(g). For examples illustrating the application of this section, see paragraph (f) of this section.
(b)
Treatment of consolidated groups
—(1)
Members treated as one corporation.
For purposes of this section and § 1.385-3, and except as otherwise provided in this section and § 1.385-3, all members of a consolidated group (as defined in § 1.1502-1(h)) that file (or that are required to file) a consolidated U.S. Federal income tax return are treated as one corporation. Thus, for example, when a member of a consolidated group issues a covered debt instrument that is not a consolidated group debt instrument, the consolidated group generally is treated as the issuer of the covered debt instrument for purposes of this section and § 1.385-3. Also, for example, when one member of a consolidated group issues a covered debt instrument that is not a consolidated group debt instrument and therefore is treated as issued by the consolidated group, and another member of the consolidated group makes a distribution or acquisition described in § 1.385-3(b)(3)(i)(A) through (C) with an expanded group member that is not a member of the
consolidated group, § 1.385-3(b)(3)(i) may treat the covered debt instrument as funding the distribution or acquisition made by the consolidated group. In addition, except as otherwise provided in this section, acquisitions and distributions described in § 1.385-3(b)(2) and (b)(3)(i) in which all parties to the transaction are members of the same consolidated group both before and after the transaction are disregarded for purposes of this section and § 1.385-3.
(2)
One-corporation rule inapplicable to expanded group member determination.
The one-corporation rule described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section does not apply in determining the members of an expanded group. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, an expanded group does not exist for purposes of this section and § 1.385-3 if it consists only of members of a single consolidated group.
(3)
Application of § 1.385-3 to debt instruments issued by members of a consolidated group
—(i)
Debt instrument treated as stock of the issuing member of a consolidated group.
If a covered debt instrument treated as issued by a consolidated group under the one-corporation rule described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section is treated as stock under § 1.385-3, the covered debt instrument is treated as stock in the member of the consolidated group that would be the issuer of such debt instrument without regard to this section. But see § 1.385-3(d)(7) (providing that a covered debt instrument that is treated as stock under § 1.385-3(b)(2), (3), or (4) and that is not described in section 1504(a)(4) is not treated as stock for purposes of determining whether the issuer is a member of an affiliated group (within the meaning of section 1504(a)).
(ii)
Application of the covered debt instrument exclusions.
For purposes of determining whether a debt instrument issued by a member of a consolidated group is a covered debt instrument, each test described in § 1.385-3(g)(3) is applied on a separate member basis without regard to the one-corporation rule described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(iii)
Qualified short-term debt instrument.
The determination of whether a member of a consolidated group has issued a qualified short-term debt instrument for purposes of § 1.385-3(b)(3)(vii) is made on a separate member basis without regard to the one-corporation rule described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(4)
Application of the reductions of § 1.385-3(c)(3) to members of a consolidated group
—(i)
Application of the reduction for expanded group earnings
—(A)
In general.
A consolidated group maintains one expanded group earnings account with respect to an expanded group period, and only the earnings and profits, determined in accordance with § 1.1502-33 (without regard to the application of § 1.1502-33(b)(2), (e), and (f)), of the common parent (within the meaning of section 1504) of the consolidated group are considered in calculating the expanded group earnings for the expanded group period of the consolidated group. Accordingly, a regarded distribution or acquisition made by a member of a consolidated group is reduced to the extent of the expanded group earnings account of the consolidated group.

Allocation of expanded group earnings to a departing member in a distribution described in section 355.
If a departing member leaves the consolidated group by reason of an exchange or distribution to which section 355 (or so much of section 356 that relates to section 355) applies, the expanded group earnings account of the consolidated group is allocated between the consolidated group and the departing member
in proportion to the earnings and profits of the consolidated group and the earnings and profits of the departing member immediately after the transaction.

Application of the reduction for qualified contributions
—(A)
In general.
For purposes of applying § 1.385-3(c)(3)(ii)(A) to a consolidated group—
(
1
) A qualified contribution to any member of a consolidated group that remains a member of the consolidated group immediately after the qualified contribution from a person other than a member of the same consolidated group is treated as made to the one corporation described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section;
(
2
) A qualified contribution that causes a member of a consolidated group to become a departing member of that consolidated group is treated as made to the departing member and not to the consolidated group of which the departing member was a member immediately prior to the qualified contribution; and

Allocation of qualified contributions to a departing member in a distribution described in section 355.
If a departing member leaves the consolidated group by reason of an exchange or distribution to which section 355 (or so much of section 356 that relates to section 355) applies, each qualified contribution of the consolidated group is allocated between the consolidated group and the departing member in proportion to the earnings and profits of the consolidated group and the earnings and profits of the departing member immediately after the transaction.
(5)
Order of operations.
For purposes of this section and § 1.385-3, the consequences of a transaction involving one or more members of a consolidated group are determined as provided in paragraphs (b)(5)(i) and (ii) of this section.
(i) First, determine the characterization of the transaction under Federal tax law without regard to the one-corporation rule described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(ii) Second, apply this section and § 1.385-3 to the transaction as characterized to determine whether to treat a debt instrument as stock, treating the consolidated group as one corporation under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, unless otherwise provided.
(6)
Partnership owned by a consolidated group.
For purposes of this section and § 1.385-3, and notwithstanding the one-corporation rule described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, a partnership that is wholly owned by members of a consolidated group is treated as a partnership. Thus, for example, if members of a consolidated group own all of the interests in a controlled partnership that issues a debt instrument to a member of the consolidated group, such debt instrument would be treated as a consolidated group debt instrument because, under § 1.385-3(f)(3)(i), for purposes of this section and § 1.385-3, a consolidated group member that is an expanded group partner is treated as the issuer with respect to its share of the debt instrument issued by the partnership.
(7)
Predecessor and successor
—(i)
In general.
Pursuant to paragraph (b)(5) of this section, the determination as to whether a member of an expanded group is a predecessor or successor of another member of the consolidated group is made without regard to paragraph (b)(1) of this section. For purposes of § 1.385-3(b)(3), if a consolidated group member is a predecessor or successor of a member of the same expanded group that is not a member of
the same consolidated group, the consolidated group is treated as a predecessor or successor of the expanded group member (or the consolidated group of which that expanded group member is a member). Thus, for example, a departing member that departs a consolidated group in a distribution or exchange to which section 355 applies is a successor to the consolidated group and the consolidated group is a predecessor of the departing member.
(ii)
Joining members.
For purposes of § 1.385-3(b)(3), the term
predecessor
also means, with respect to a consolidated group, a joining member and the term successor also means, with respect to a joining member, a consolidated group.
(c)
Consolidated group debt instruments
—(1)
Debt instrument ceases to be a consolidated group debt instrument but continues to be issued and held by expanded group members
—(i)
Consolidated group member leaves the consolidated group.
For purposes of this section and § 1.385-3, when a debt instrument ceases to be a consolidated group debt instrument as a result of a transaction in which the member of the consolidated group that issued the instrument (the issuer) or the member of the consolidated group holding the instrument (the holder) ceases to be a member of the same consolidated group but both the issuer and the holder continue to be members of the same expanded group, the issuer is treated as issuing a new debt instrument to the holder in exchange for property immediately after the debt instrument ceases to be a consolidated group debt instrument. To the extent the newly-issued debt instrument is a covered debt instrument that is treated as stock under § 1.385-3(b)(3), the covered debt instrument is then immediately deemed to be exchanged for stock of the issuer. For rules regarding the treatment of the deemed exchange, see § 1.385-1(d). For examples illustrating the rule in this paragraph (c)(1)(i), see paragraphs (f)(3)(iv) and (v) of this section (
Examples 4
and
5
).
(ii)
Consolidated group debt instrument that is transferred outside of the consolidated group.
For purposes of this section and § 1.385-3, when a member of a consolidated group that holds a consolidated group debt instrument transfers the debt instrument to an expanded group member that is not a member of the same consolidated group (transferee expanded group member), the debt instrument is treated as issued by the consolidated group to the transferee expanded group member immediately after the debt instrument ceases to be a consolidated group debt instrument. Thus, for example, for purposes of this section and § 1.385-3, the sale of a consolidated group debt instrument to a transferee expanded group member is treated as an issuance of the debt instrument by the consolidated group to the transferee expanded group member in exchange for property. To the extent the newly-issued debt instrument is a covered debt instrument that is treated as stock upon being transferred, the covered debt instrument is deemed to be exchanged for stock of the member of the consolidated group treated as the issuer of the debt instrument (determined under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section) immediately after the covered debt instrument is transferred outside of the consolidated group. For rules regarding the treatment of the deemed exchange, see § 1.385-1(d). For examples illustrating the rule in this paragraph (c)(1)(ii), see paragraphs (f)(3)(ii) and (iii) of this section (
Examples 2
and
3
).
(iii)
Overlap transactions.
If a debt instrument ceases to be a consolidated group debt instrument in a transaction to which both paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section apply, then only the rules of paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section apply with respect to such debt instrument.
(iv)
Subgroup exception.
A debt instrument is not treated as ceasing to be a consolidated group debt instrument for purposes of paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section if both the issuer and the holder of the debt instrument are members of the same consolidated group immediately after the transaction described in paragraph (c)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section.
(2)
Covered debt instrument treated as stock becomes a consolidated group debt instrument.
When a covered debt instrument that is treated as stock under § 1.385-3 becomes a consolidated group debt instrument, then immediately
after the covered debt instrument becomes a consolidated group debt instrument, the issuer is deemed to issue a new covered debt instrument to the holder in exchange for the covered debt instrument that was treated as stock. In addition, in a manner consistent with § 1.385-3(d)(2)(ii)(A), when the covered debt instrument that previously was treated as stock becomes a consolidated group debt instrument, other covered debt instruments issued by the issuer of that instrument (including a consolidated group that includes the issuer) that are not treated as stock when the instrument becomes a consolidated group debt instrument are re-tested to determine whether those other covered debt instruments are treated as funding the regarded distribution or acquisition that previously was treated as funded by the instrument (unless such distribution or acquisition is disregarded under paragraph (b)(1) of this section). Further, also in a manner consistent with § 1.385-3(d)(2)(ii)(A), a covered debt instrument that is issued by the issuer (including a consolidated group that includes the issuer) after the application of this paragraph (c)(2) and within the per se period may also be treated as funding that regarded distribution or acquisition.
(3)
No interaction with the intercompany obligation rules of § 1.1502-13(g).
The rules of this section do not affect the application of the rules of § 1.1502-13(g). Thus, any deemed satisfaction and reissuance of a debt instrument under § 1.1502-13(g) and any deemed issuance and deemed exchange of a debt instrument under this paragraph (c) that arise as part of the same transaction or series of transactions are not integrated. Rather, each deemed satisfaction and reissuance under the rules of § 1.1502-13(g), and each deemed issuance and exchange under the rules of this section, are respected as separate steps and treated as separate transactions.
(d)
Application of the funding rule of § 1.385-3(b)(3) to members departing a consolidated group.
This paragraph (d) provides rules for applying the funding rule of § 1.385-3(b)(3) when a departing member ceases to be a member of a consolidated group, but only if the departing member and the consolidated group are members of the same expanded group immediately after the deconsolidation.
(1)
Continued application of the one-corporation rule.
A disregarded distribution or acquisition by any member of the consolidated group continues to be disregarded when the departing member ceases to be a member of the consolidated group.
(2)
Continued recharacterization of a departing member's covered debt instrument as stock.
A covered debt instrument of a departing member that is treated as stock of the departing member under § 1.385-3(b) continues to be treated as stock when the departing member ceases to be a member of the consolidated group.
(3)
Effect of issuances of covered debt instruments that are not consolidated group debt instruments on the departing member and the consolidated group.
If a departing member has issued a covered debt instrument (determined without regard to the one-corporation rule described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section) that is not a consolidated group debt instrument and that is not treated as stock immediately before the departing member ceases to be a consolidated group member, then the departing member (and not the consolidated group) is treated as issuing the covered debt instrument on the date and in the manner the covered debt instrument was issued. If the departing member is not treated as the issuer of a covered debt instrument pursuant to the preceding sentence, then the consolidated group continues to be treated as issuing the covered debt instrument on the date and in the manner the covered debt instrument was issued.
(4)
Treatment of prior regarded distributions or acquisitions.
This paragraph (d)(4) applies when a departing member ceases to be a consolidated group member in a transaction other than a distribution to which section 355 (or so much of section 356 as relates to section 355) applies, and the consolidated group has made a regarded distribution or acquisition. In this case, to the extent the distribution or acquisition has not caused a covered debt instrument of the consolidated group to be treated as stock under § 1.385-3(b) on or before
the date the departing member leaves the consolidated group, then—
(i) If the departing member made the regarded distribution or acquisition (determined without regard to the one-corporation rule described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section), the departing member (and not the consolidated group) is treated as having made the regarded distribution or acquisition.
(ii) If the departing member did not make the regarded distribution or acquisition (determined without regard to the one-corporation rule described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section), then the consolidated group (and not the departing member) continues to be treated as having made the regarded distribution or acquisition.
(e)

(2)
Departing member.
The term
departing member
means a member of an expanded group that ceases to be a member of a consolidated group but continues to be a member of the same expanded group. In the case of multiple members leaving a consolidated group as a result of a single transaction that continue to be members of the same expanded group, if such members are treated as one corporation under paragraph (b)(1) of this section immediately after the transaction, that one corporation is a departing member with respect to the consolidated group.
(3)
Disregarded distribution or acquisition.
The term
disregarded distribution or acquisition
means a distribution or acquisition described in § 1.385-3(b)(2) or (b)(3)(i) between members of a consolidated group that is disregarded under the one-corporation rule described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(4)
Joining member.
The term
joining member
means a member of an expanded group that becomes a member of a consolidated group and continues to be a member of the same expanded group. In the case of multiple members joining a consolidated group as a result of a single transaction that continue to be members of the same expanded group, if such members were treated as one corporation under paragraph (b)(1) of this section immediately before the transaction, that one corporation is a joining member with respect to the consolidated group.
(5)
Regarded distribution or acquisition.
The term
regarded distribution or acquisition
means a distribution or acquisition described in § 1.385-3(b)(2) or (b)(3)(i) that is not disregarded under the one-corporation rule described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

Examples
—(1)
Assumed facts.
Except as otherwise stated, the following facts are assumed for purposes of the examples in paragraph (f)(3) of this section:
(i) FP is a foreign corporation that owns 100% of the stock of USS1, a covered member, and 100% of the stock of FS, a foreign corporation;
(ii) USS1 owns 100% of the stock of DS1 and DS3, both covered members;
(iii) DS1 owns 100% of the stock of DS2, a covered member;
(iv) FS owns 100% of the stock of UST, a covered member;
(v) At the beginning of Year 1, FP is the common parent of an expanded group comprised solely of FP, USS1, FS, DS1, DS2, DS3, and UST (the FP expanded group);
(vi) USS1, DS1, DS2, and DS3 are members of a consolidated group of which USS1 is the common parent (the USS1 consolidated group);
(vii) The FP expanded group has outstanding more than $50 million of debt instruments described in § 1.385-3(c)(4) at all times;
(viii) No issuer of a covered debt instrument has a positive expanded group earnings account, within the meaning of § 1.385-3(c)(3)(i)(B), or has received a qualified contribution, within the meaning of § 1.385-3(c)(3)(ii)(B);
(ix) All notes are covered debt instruments, within the meaning of § 1.385-3(g)(3), and are not qualified short-term debt instruments, within the meaning of § 1.385-3(b)(3)(vii);
(x) All notes between members of a consolidated group are intercompany obligations within the meaning of § 1.1502-13(g)(2)(ii);
(xi) Each entity has as its taxable year the calendar year;
(xii) No domestic corporation is a United States real property holding corporation within the meaning of section 897(c)(2);
(xiii) Each note is issued with adequate stated interest (as defined in section 1274(c)(2)); and
(xiv) Each transaction occurs after January 19, 2017.
(2)
No inference.
Except as otherwise provided in this section, it is assumed for purposes of the examples in paragraph (f)(3) of this section that the form of each transaction is respected for Federal tax purposes. No inference is intended, however, as to whether any particular note would be respected as indebtedness or as to whether the form of any particular transaction described in an example in paragraph (f)(3) of this section would be respected for Federal tax purposes.
(3)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this section.
(i)
Example 1: Order of operations
—(A)
Facts.
On Date A in Year 1, UST issues UST Note to USS1 in exchange for DS3 stock representing less than 20% of the value and voting power of DS3.
(B)
Analysis.
UST is acquiring the stock of DS3, the non-common parent member of a consolidated group. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section, the transaction is first analyzed without regard to the one-corporation rule described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and therefore UST is treated as issuing a covered debt instrument in exchange for expanded group stock. The exchange of UST Note for DS3 stock is not an exempt exchange within the meaning of § 1.385-3(g)(11) because UST and USS1 are not parties to an asset reorganization. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section, § 1.385-3 (including § 1.385-3(b)(2)(ii)) is then applied to the transaction, thereby treating UST Note as stock for Federal tax purposes when it is issued by UST to USS1. The UST Note is not treated as property for purposes of section 304(a) because it is not property within the meaning specified in section 317(a). Therefore, UST's acquisition of DS3 stock from USS1 in exchange for UST Note is not an acquisition described in section 304(a)(1).
(ii)
Example 2: Distribution of consolidated group debt instrument
—(A)
Facts.
On Date A in Year 1, DS1 issues DS1 Note to USS1 in a distribution. On Date B in Year 2, USS1 distributes DS1 Note to FP.
(B)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the USS1 consolidated group is treated as one corporation for purposes of § 1.385-3. Accordingly, when DS1 issues DS1 Note to USS1 in a distribution on Date A in Year 1, DS1 is not treated as issuing a debt instrument to another member of DS1's expanded group in a distribution for purposes of § 1.385-3(b)(2), and DS1 Note is not treated as stock under § 1.385-3. When USS1 distributes DS1 Note to FP, DS1 Note is deemed satisfied and reissued under § 1.1502-13(g)(3)(ii), immediately before DS1 Note ceases to be an intercompany obligation. Under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, when USS1 distributes DS1 Note to FP, the USS1 consolidated group is treated as issuing DS1 Note to FP in a distribution on Date B in Year 2. Accordingly, DS1 Note is treated as stock under § 1.385-3(b)(2)(i). Under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, DS1 Note is deemed to be exchanged for stock of the issuing member, DS1, immediately after DS1 Note is transferred outside of the USS1 consolidated group. Under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the deemed satisfaction and reissuance under § 1.1502-13(g)(3)(ii) and the deemed issuance and exchange under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, are respected as separate steps and treated as separate transactions.
(iii)
Example 3: Sale of consolidated group debt instrument
—(A)
Facts.
On Date A in Year 1, DS1 lends $200x of cash to USS1 in exchange for USS1 Note. On Date B in Year 2, USS1 distributes $200x of cash to FP. Subsequently, on Date C in Year 2, DS1 sells USS1 Note to FS for $200x.
(B)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the USS1 consolidated group is treated as one corporation for purposes of § 1.385-3. Accordingly, when USS1 issues USS1 Note to DS1 for property on Date A in Year 1, the USS1 consolidated group is not treated as a funded member, and when USS1 distributes $200x to FP on Date B in Year 2, that distribution is a transaction described in § 1.385-3(b)(3)(i)(A), but does
not cause USS1 Note to be recharacterized under § 1.385-3(b)(3). When DS1 sells USS1 Note to FS, USS1 Note is deemed satisfied and reissued under § 1.1502-13(g)(3)(ii), immediately before USS1 Note ceases to be an intercompany obligation. Under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, when the USS1 Note is transferred to FS for $200x on Date C in Year 2, the USS1 consolidated group is treated as issuing USS1 Note to FS in exchange for $200x on that date. Because USS1 Note is issued by the USS1 consolidated group to FS within the per se period as defined in § 1.385-3(g)(19) with respect to the distribution by the USS1 consolidated group to FP, USS1 Note is treated as funding the distribution under § 1.385-3(b)(3)(iii)(A) and, accordingly, is treated as stock under § 1.385-3(b)(3). Under § 1.385-3(d)(1)(i) and paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, USS1 Note is deemed to be exchanged for stock of the issuing member, USS1, immediately after USS1 Note is transferred outside of the USS1 consolidated group. Under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the deemed satisfaction and reissuance under § 1.1502-13(g)(3)(ii) and the deemed issuance and exchange under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section are respected as separate steps and treated as separate transactions.
(iv)
Example 4: Treatment of consolidated group debt instrument and departing member's regarded distribution or acquisition when the issuer of the instrument leaves the consolidated group
—(A)
Facts.
The facts are the same as provided in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, except that USS1 and FS own 90% and 10% of the stock of DS1, respectively. On Date A in Year 1, DS1 distributes $80x of cash and newly-issued DS1 Note, which has a value of $10x, to USS1. Also on Date A in Year 1, DS1 distributes $10x of cash to FS. On Date B in Year 2, FS purchases all of USS1's stock in DS1 (90% of the stock of DS1), resulting in DS1 ceasing to be a member of the USS1 consolidated group.
(B)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the USS1 consolidated group is treated as one corporation for purposes of § 1.385-3. Accordingly, DS1's distribution of $80x of cash to USS1 on Date A in Year 1 is a disregarded distribution or acquisition, and under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, continues to be a disregarded distribution or acquisition when DS1 ceases to be a member of the USS1 consolidated group. In addition, when DS1 issues DS1 Note to USS1 in a distribution on Date A in Year 1, DS1 is not treated as issuing a debt instrument to a member of DS1's expanded group in a distribution for purposes of § 1.385-3(b)(2)(i), and DS1 Note is not treated as stock under § 1.385-3(b)(2)(i). DS1's issuance of DS1 Note to USS1 is also a disregarded distribution or acquisition, and under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, continues to be a disregarded distribution or acquisition when DS1 ceases to be a member of the USS1 consolidated group. The distribution of $10x cash by DS1 to FS on Date A in Year 1 is a regarded distribution or acquisition. When FS purchases 90% of the stock of DS1's from USS1 on Date B in Year 2 and DS1 ceases to be a member of the USS1 consolidated group, DS1 Note is deemed satisfied and reissued under § 1.1502-13(g)(3)(ii), immediately before DS1 Note ceases to be an intercompany obligation. Under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, for purposes of § 1.385-3, DS1 is treated as issuing a new debt instrument to USS1 in exchange for property immediately after DS1 Note ceases to be a consolidated group debt instrument. Under paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section, the departing member, DS1 (and not the USS1 consolidated group) is treated as having distributed $10x to FS on Date A in Year 1 (a regarded distribution or acquisition) for purposes of applying § 1.385-3(b)(3) after DS1 ceases to be a member of the USS1 consolidated group. Because DS1 Note is reissued by DS1 to USS1 within the per se period (as defined in § 1.385-3(g)(19)) with respect to DS1's regarded distribution to FS, DS1 Note is treated as funding the distribution under § 1.385-3(b)(3)(iii)(A) and, accordingly, is treated as stock under § 1.385-3(b)(3). Under § 1.385-3(d)(1)(i) and paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, DS1 Note is immediately deemed to be exchanged for stock of DS1 on Date B in Year 2. Under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the deemed satisfaction and reissuance under § 1.1502-13(g)(3)(ii) and the deemed issuance and exchange under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section are
respected as separate steps and treated as separate transactions. Under § 1.385-3(d)(7)(i), after DS1 Note is treated as stock held by USS1, DS1 Note is not treated as stock for purposes of determining whether DS1 is a member of the USS1 consolidated group.
(v)
Example 5: Treatment of consolidated group debt instrument and consolidated group's regarded distribution or acquisition
—(A)
Facts.
On Date A in Year 1, DS1 issues DS1 Note to USS1. On Date B in Year 2, USS1 distributes $100x of cash to FP. On Date C in Year 3, USS1 sells all of its interest in DS1 to FS, resulting in DS1 ceasing to be a member of the USS1 consolidated group.
(B)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the USS1 consolidated group is treated as one corporation for purposes of § 1.385-3. Accordingly, when DS1 issues DS1 Note to USS1 in a distribution on Date A in Year 1, DS1 is not treated as issuing a debt instrument to a member of DS1's expanded group in a distribution for purposes of § 1.385-3(b)(2)(i), and DS1 Note is not treated as stock under § 1.385-3(b)(2)(i). DS1's issuance of DS1 Note to USS1 is also a disregarded distribution or acquisition, and under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, continues to be a disregarded distribution or acquisition when DS1 ceases to be a member of the USS1 consolidated group. The distribution of $100x cash by DS1 to USS1 on Date B in Year 2 is a regarded distribution or acquisition. When FS purchases all of the stock of DS1 from USS1 on Date C in Year 3 and DS1 ceases to be a member of the USS1 consolidated group, DS1 Note is deemed satisfied and reissued under § 1.1502-13(g)(3)(ii), immediately before DS1 Note ceases to be an intercompany obligation. Under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, for purposes of § 1.385-3, DS1 is treated as issuing a new debt instrument to USS1 in exchange for property immediately after DS1 Note ceases to be a consolidated group debt instrument. Under paragraph (d)(4)(ii) of this section, the USS1 consolidated group (and not DS1) is treated as having distributed $100x to FP on Date B in Year 2 (a regarded distribution or acquisition) for purposes of applying § 1.385-3(b)(3) after DS1 ceases to be a member of the USS1 consolidated group. Because DS1 has not engaged in a regarded distribution or acquisition that would have been treated as funded by the reissued DS1 Note, the reissued DS1 Note is not treated as stock.
(vi)
Example 6: Treatment of departing member's issuance of a covered debt instrument
—(A)
Facts.
On Date A in Year 1, FS lends $100x of cash to DS1 in exchange for DS1 Note. On Date B in Year 2, USS1 distributes $30x of cash to FP. On Date C in Year 2, USS1 sells all of its DS1 stock to FP, resulting in DS1 ceasing to be a member of the USS1 consolidated group.
(B)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the USS1 consolidated group is treated as one corporation for purposes of § 1.385-3. Accordingly, on Date A in Year 1, the USS1 consolidated group is treated as issuing DS1 Note to FS, and on Date B in Year 2, the USS1 consolidated group is treated as distributing $30x of cash to FP. Because DS1 Note is issued by the USS1 consolidated group to FS within the per se period as defined in § 1.385-3(g)(19) with respect to the distribution by the USS1consoldiated group of $30x cash to FP, $30x of DS1 Note is treated as funding the distribution under § 1.385-3(b)(3)(iii)(A), and, accordingly, is treated as stock on Date B in Year 2 under § 1.385-3(b)(3) and § 1.385-3(d)(1)(ii). Under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, DS1 (and not the USS1 consolidated group) is treated as the issuer of the remaining portion of DS1 Note for purposes of applying § 1.385-3(b)(3) after DS1 ceases to be a member of the USS1 consolidated group.
