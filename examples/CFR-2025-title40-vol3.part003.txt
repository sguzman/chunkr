§ 52.525
General requirements.
(a) The requirements of § 51.116(c) of this chapter are not met since the legal authority to provide for public availability of emission data is inadequate.
(b) Regulation for public availability of emission data. (1) Any person who cannot obtain emission data from the Agency responsible for making emission data available to the public, as specified in the applicable plan, concerning emissions from any source subject to emission limitations which are part of the approved plan may request that the appropriate Regional Administrator obtain and make public such data. Within 30 days after receipt of any such written request, the Regional Administrator shall require the owner or operator of any such source to submit information within 30 days on the nature and amounts of emissions from such source and any other information as may be deemed necessary by the Regional Administrator to determine whether such source is in compliance with applicable emission limitations or other control measures that are part of the applicable plan.
(2) Commencing after the initial notification by the Regional Administrator pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the owner or operator of the source shall maintain records of the nature and amounts of emissions from such source and any other information as may be deemed necessary by the Regional Administrator to determine whether such source is in compliance with applicable emission limitations or other control measures that are part of the plan. The information recorded shall be summarized and reported to the Regional Administrator, on forms furnished by the Regional Administrator, and shall be submitted within 45 days after the end of the reporting period. Reporting periods are January 1 to June 30 and July 1 to December 31.
(3) Information recorded by the owner or operator and copies of this summarizing report submitted to the Regional Administrator shall be retained by the owner or operator for 2 years after the date on which the pertinent report is submitted.
(4) Emission data obtained from owners or operators of stationary sources will be correlated with applicable emission limitations and other control measures that are part of the applicable plan and will be available at the appropriate regional office and at other locations in the state designated by the Regional Administrator.

§ 52.526
Legal authority.
(a) The requirements of § 51.230(f) of this chapter are not met, since section 403.111 of the Florida Statutes could, in some circumstances, prohibit the disclosure of emission data to the public. Therefore, section 403.111 is disapproved.

§ 52.528
Control strategy: Sulfur oxides and particulate matter.
(a) In a letter dated October 10, 1986, the Florida Department of Environmental Regulation certified that no emission limits in the State's plan are based on dispersion techniques not permitted by EPA's stack height rules.
(b) The variance granted to the Turkey Point and Port Everglades plants of Florida Power and Light Company from the particulate emission limits of the plan is disapproved because the relaxed limits would cause violation of the Class I increment for sulfur dioxide in the Everglades National Park. These plants must meet the 0.1#/MMBTU particulate limit of the plan.

§ 52.530
Significant deterioration of air quality.
(a) EPA approves the Florida Prevention of Significant Deterioration program, as incorporated into this chapter, for power plants subject to the Florida Power Plant Siting Act.
(b) Pursuant to part C, subpart 1 of the Clean Air Act, EPA is approving a December 19, 2013 SIP revision submitted by the State of Florida, through the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP), Division of Air Resource Management that establishes prevention of significant deterioration (PSD) applicability thresholds for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions at the same emissions thresholds and in the same timeframes as those specified by EPA in the GHG Tailoring Rule. This approval gives FDEP the authority to regulate GHG-emitting sources and issue GHG PSD permits. FDEP's December 19, 2013 SIP revision also includes a GHG PSD Permit Transition Plan which governs the transition from EPA administering GHG PSD permitting requirements for Florida sources under a Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) to the State administering GHG PSD permitting requirements under its approved SIP. Under this GHG PSD Permit Transition Plan, FDEP will administer and enforce GHG PSD permits issued by EPA to Florida sources under the GHG PSD FIP. FDEP's authority over these existing EPA-issued GHG PSD permits includes the authority for FDEP to conduct general administration of these existing permits, authority to process and issue any and all subsequent permit actions relating to such permits, and authority to enforce such permits.
(c) All applications and other information required pursuant to § 52.21 of this part from sources located in the State of Florida shall be submitted to the State agency, Florida Department of Environmental Protection, Division of Air Resources Management, 2600 Blair Stone Road, MS 5500, Tallahassee, Florida 32399-2400, rather than to EPA's Region 4 office.
(d) The requirements of sections 160 through 165 of the Clean Air Act are not met since the Florida plan, as submitted, does not apply to certain sources. Therefore, the provisions of § 52.21 except paragraph (a)(1) are hereby incorporated by reference and made a part of the Florida plan for:
(1) Sources proposing to locate on Indian reservations in Florida; and
(2) Permits issued by EPA prior to approval of the Florida PSD rule.

[47 FR 32116, July 26, 1982]
§ 52.534
Visibility protection.
(a) The requirements of section 169A of the Clean Air Act are not met because the plan does not include approvable procedures meeting the requirements of 40 CFR 51.305 and 51.307 for protection of visibility in mandatory Class I Federal areas.
(b) Regulations for visibility new source review. The provisions of § 52.28 are hereby incorporated and made part of the applicable plan for the State of Florida.

§ 52.623
Approval status.
(a) With the exceptions set forth in this subpart, the Administrator approves Hawaii's plan for attainment and maintenance of the national standards. The State included various provisions in its plan to provide for the attainment of the State ambient air quality standards. As described in the Governor's letters of January 28, May 8, and May 22, 1972, these provisions were included for information purposes only and were not to be considered a part of the plan to implement national standards. Accordingly, these additional provisions are not considered a part of the applicable plan.

(1) Any person who cannot obtain emission data from the Agency responsible for making emission data available to the public, as specified in the applicable plan, concerning emissions from any source subject to emission limitations which are part of the approved plan may request that the appropriate Regional Administrator obtain and make public such data. Within 30 days after receipt of any such written request, the Regional Administrator shall require the owner or operator of any such source to submit information within 30 days on the nature and amounts of emissions from such source and any other information as may be deemed necessary by the Regional Administrator to determine whether such source is in compliance with applicable emission limitations or other control measures that are part of the applicable plan.
(2) Commencing after the initial notification by the Regional Administrator pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the owner or operator of the source shall maintain records of the nature and amounts of emissions from such source and any other information as may be deemed necessary by the Regional Administrator to determine whether such source is in compliance with applicable emission limitations or other control measures that are part of the plan. The information recorded shall be summarized and reported to the Regional Administrator, on forms furnished by the Regional Administrator, and shall be submitted within 45 days after the end of the reporting period. Reporting periods are January 1 to June 30 and July 1 to December 31.
(3) Information recorded by the owner or operator and copies of this summarizing report submitted to the Regional Administrator shall be retained by the owner or operator for 2
years after the date on which the pertinent report is submitted.
(4) Emission data obtained from owners or operators of stationary sources will be correlated with applicable emission limitations and other control measures that are part of the applicable plan and will be available at the appropriate regional office and at other locations in the state designated by the Regional Administrator.

§ 52.722
Approval status.
(a) With the exceptions set forth in this subpart, the Administrator approved Illinois' plan for the attainment and maintenance of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards under section 110 of the Clean Air Act. Furthermore, the Administrator finds the plan
satisfies all requirements of part D, title I of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1977, except as noted below. In addition, continued satisfaction of the requirements of part D for the ozone portion of the SIP depends on the adoption and submittal of RACT requirements by July 1, 1980, for the sources covered by CTGs between January 1978 and January 1979 and adoption and submittal by each subsequent January of additional RACT requirements for sources covered by CTGs issued by the previous January.
(b) The Administrator finds that the transportation control plans for the East St. Louis and Chicago areas submitted on December 3, 1982, satisfy the related requirements of part D, title I of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1977.
(c) The Administrator finds that the carbon monoxide control strategy submitted on May 4, 1983, satisfies all requirements of part D, title I of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1977, except for section 172(b)(6).

§ 52.723
[Reserved]
§ 52.724
Control strategy: Sulfur dioxide.
(a) Part D—Conditional Approval—The Illinois plan is approved provided that the following condition is satisfied:
(1) The plan includes a reanalysis of the Pekin, Illinois area, a submittal of the analysis results to USEPA, the proposal of any additional regulations to the Illinois Pollution Control Board necessary to insure attainment and maintenance of the sulfur dioxide standard, and the promulgation of any necessary regulations. The State must complete the reanalysis, submit the results to USEPA and submit any necessary, additional regulations to the Illinois Pollution Control Board by September 30, 1980. Any necessary regulation must be finally promulgated by the State and submitted to USEPA by September 30, 1981.
(2) Extension of Condition—USEPA approves the date of July 1, 1984 for submitting the draft sulfur dioxide rule revisions and supporting documentation as required in (a)(1) for Peoria, Hollis and Groveland Townships in Illinois. The State must complete final rule adoption as expeditiously as possible but no later than December 31, 1985.
(b) Part D—Disapproval—USEPA disapproves Rules 204(c)(1)(B), Rule 204(c)(1)(C), Rule 204(e)(1) and Rule 204(e)(2) for those sources for which these rules represent a relaxation of the federally enforceable State Implementation Plan. Rule 204(c)(1)(B), Rule 204(c)(1)(C), Rule 204(e)(1) and Rule 204(e)(2) are approved as not representing relaxations of the State Implementation Plan for the following sources:
Sources of 10 Million Btu per Hour or More Not Increasing Allowable Sulfur Dioxide Emissions as a Result of Record Rules 204(
c

§ 52.725
Control strategy: Particulates.
(a) [Reserved]
(b) Part D—Disapproval. (1) U.S. EPA disapproves the provisions of Rule 203(f) which allow the use of an equivalent method without review and approval of that method. Any source subject to Rule 203(f) which chooses to use an equivalent method must have that equivalent method submitted to U.S. EPA and approved as a SIP revision.
(2) U.S. EPA disapproves the following portions of Rule 203(d)(5) which regulate the control of particulate matter from specific sources within the iron and steel industry: Rule 205(d)(5)(B)(ii), Rule 205(d)(5)(B)(iii), Rule 205(d)(5)(D), and Rule 205(d)(5)(K).
(3) USEPA disapproves a proposed SIP revision submitted by the State on May 12, 1982, in the form of a May 18,
1981 Consent Decree (Civil Action 81-3009) to which USEPA, Illinois Environmental Protection Agency and National Steel Corporation are parties and a draft Alternative Control Strategy Permit. This submission was modified by the State, September 30, 1982, with the submission of a separate document embodying the elements of the Alternative Control Strategy. This separate document was intended to become an enforceable part of the SIP.
(c) Approval—On September 28, 1988, the State of Illinois submitted a committal SIP for particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter equal to or less than 10 micrometers (PM
10
) for the Illinois Group II areas of concern in DuPage, Will, Rock Island, Macon, Randolph, and St. Clair Counties. The committal SIP contains all the requirements identified in the July 1, 1987, promulgation of the SIP requirements for PM
10
at 52 FR 24681.
(d) Approval—On June 2, 1995, and January 9, 1996, the State of Illinois submitted a maintenance plan for the particulate matter nonattainment portion of LaSalle County, and requested that it be redesignated to attainment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for particulate matter. The redesignation request and maintenance plan satisfy all applicable requirements of the Clean Air Act.
(e) Approval—On March 19, 1996, and October 15, 1996, Illinois submitted requests to redesignate the Granite City Particulate Matter (PM) nonattainment area to attainment status for the PM National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), as well as a maintenance plan for the Granite City area to ensure continued attainment of the NAAQS. The redesignation request and maintenance plan satisfy all applicable requirements of the Clean Air Act.
(f) On November 14, 1995, May 9, 1996, and June 14, 1996, the State of Illinois submitted State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision requests to meet commitments related to the conditional approval of Illinois' May 15, 1992, SIP submittal for the Lake Calumet (SE Chicago), McCook, and Granite City, Illinois, Particulate Matter (PM) nonattainment areas. The EPA is approving the SIP revision request as it applies to the McCook PM nonattainment area. For the McCook PM nonattainment area, all of the deficiencies of the May 15, 1992, submittal have been corrected.
(g) Approval—On May 5, 1992, November 14, 1995, May 9, 1996, June 14, 1996, February 3, 1997, October 16, 1997, October 21, 1997, February 1, 1999, and May 19, 1999, Illinois submitted SIP revision requests to meet the Part D particulate matter (PM) nonattainment plan requirements for the Lake Calumet, Granite City and McCook moderate PM nonattainment areas.

§ 52.726
Control strategy: Ozone.
(a) Part D—Conditional Approval—The Illinois plan is approved provided that the following conditions are satisfied:
(1) [Reserved]
(2) The State conducts a study to demonstrate that the 75 percent overall control efficiency requirement in Rule 205(n) represents RACT, submits the results of the study to USEPA, and submits any necessary regulations representing RACT to the Illinois Pollution Control Board. The State must comply with these conditions by February 28, 1981. Any necessary regulations must be finally promulgated by the State and submitted to USEPA by February 28, 1982.
(3) Extension of Condition—USEPA approves the date of July 31, 1984 for the State of Illinois to satisfy the condition of approval to the ozone State Implementation Plan listed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
(b) Disapproval—USEPA disapproves the compliance schedule in Rule 205(j) as it applies to loading rack controls for all emission sources subject to Rule 205(b)(1), as approved by USEPA on May 31, 1972 which were required to be in compliance by December 31, 1973. This disapproval does not in and of itself result in the growth restrictions of section 110(a)(2)(I).
(c)
Negative Declarations—Stationary Source Categories.
The State of Illinois has certified to the satisfaction of USEPA that no sources are located in the nonattainment areas of the State which are covered by the following Control Technique Guidelines:
(1) High density polyethylene and polypropylene manufacturers.
(2) Vegetable oil processing sources with volatile organic compound emissions equal to or greater than 100 tons per year.
(d) Part D Disapproval—The Administrator finds that Illinois' ozone plan for Cook, Lake, DuPage and Kane Counties, which was required to be submitted by July 1, 1982, does not satisfy all the requirements of Part D, Title I of the Clean Air Act and, thus, is disapproved. No major new stationary source, of major modification of a stationary source, or volatile organic compounds may be constructed in Cook, Lake, DuPage or Kane Counties, unless the construction permit application is complete on or before November 16, 1988. This disapproval does not affect USEPA's approval (or conditional approval) of individual parts of Illinois' ozone plan, and they remain approved.
(e) Disapproval—The Administrator finds that the following State rules have not been demonstrated to be consistent with the reasonably available control technology requirements of section 172 of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1977, and thus, are disapproved: subpart F, section 215.204(c); subpart F, section 215.206(b); subpart F, section 215.204(j)(4); subpart I; subpart AA; subpart PP; subpart QQ; subpart RR; subpart A, section 215.102; subpart T; subpart H, section 215.245; subpart F, section 215.207; and subpart A, section 215.107, all of title 35; Environmental Protection; subtitle B: Air Pollution; Chapter 1: Pollution Control Board of the Illinois Administrative Code (June 1989).
(f) On September 30, 1992, the State submitted rules regulating volatile organic compound emissions from gasoline dispensing facilities' motor vehicle fuel operations (Stage II vapor recovery rules) in the Chicago ozone nonattainment area. The Illinois Environmental Protection Agency Bureau of Air must as part of the program conduct inspections of facilities subject to this rule to ensure compliance with the applicable rules. These inspections will be conducted on an annual basis or an alternative schedule as approved in the USEPA Fiscal Year Inspection Program Plan.
(g) Approval—The Administrator approves the incorporation of the photochemical assessment ambient monitoring system submitted by Illinois on November 4, 1993, into the Illinois State Implementation Plan. This submittal satisfies 40 CFR 58.20(f) which requires the State to provide for the establishment and maintenance of photochemical assessment monitoring stations (PAMS) by November 12, 1993.
(h) Approval—On November 12, 1993, the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency submitted an ozone redesignation request and maintenance plan for Jersey County ozone nonattainment area and requested that Jersey County be redesignated to attainment for ozone. The redesignation request and maintenance plan meet the redesignation requirements in section 107(d)(3)(d) of the Act. The redesignation meets the Federal requirements of section 182(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act as a revision to the Illinois ozone State Implementation Plan for Jersey County.
(i) The base year (1990) ozone emission inventory requirement of section 182(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990, has been satisfied for the following Illinois ozone nonattainment areas: the Chicago nonattainment area—Cook, DuPage, Kane, Lake, Will and McHenry Counties, Aux Sable and Gooselake Townships in Grundy County, and Oswego Township in Kendall County; the Metro-East St. Louis nonattainment area—Madison, Monroe, and St. Clair Counties; and Jersey County.
(j) Approval—On July 14, 1994, Illinois submitted two of three elements required by section 182(d)(1)(A) of the Clean Air Amendments of 1990 to be incorporated as part of the vehicle miles traveled (VMT) State Implementation Plan intended to offset any growth in emissions from a growth in vehicle miles traveled. These elements are the offsetting of growth in emissions attributable to growth in VMT which was due November 15, 1992, and, transportation control measures (TCMs) required as part of Illinois' 15 percent reasonable further progress (RFP) plan which was due November 15, 1993. Illinois satisfied the first requirement by projecting emissions from mobile sources and demonstrating that no increase in emissions would take place. Illinois satisfied the second requirement by submitting the TCMs listed in Table 1 which are now approved into the Illinois SIP.

(k) Approval—EPA is approving the section 182(f) oxides of nitrogen (NO
X
) reasonably available control technology (RACT), new source review (NSR), vehicle inspection/maintenance (I/M), and general conformity exemptions for the Illinois portion of the Chicago-Gary-Lake County severe ozone nonattainment area as requested by the States of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, and Wisconsin in a July 13, 1994 submittal. This approval does not
cover the exemption of NO
X
transportation conformity requirements of section 176(c) for this area. Approval of these exemptions is contingent on the results of the final ozone attainment demonstration expected to be submitted in mid-1997. The approval will be modified if the final attainment demonstration demonstrates that NO
X
emission controls are needed in the nonattainment area to attain the ozone standard in the Lake Michigan Ozone Study modeling domain.
(l) Approval—The United States Environmental Protection Agency is approving under section 182(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act the exemption of the Chicago severe, ozone nonattainment area from the build/no-build and less than-1990 interim transportation conformity oxides of nitrogen requirements as requested by the State of Illinois in a June 20, 1995 submittal. In light of the modeling completed thus far and considering the importance of the OTAG process and attainment plan modeling efforts, USEPA grants this NO
X
waiver on a contingent basis. As the OTAG modeling results and control recommendations are completed in 1996, this information will be incorporated into attainment plans being developed by the LADCO States. When these attainment plans are submitted to USEPA in mid-1997, these new modeling analyses will be reviewed to determine if the NO
X
waiver should be continued, altered, or removed. USEPA's rulemaking action to reconsider the initial NO
X
waiver may occur simultaneously with rulemaking action on the attainment plans. The USEPA also reserves the right to require NO
X
emission controls for transportation sources under section 110(a)(2)(D) of the Act if future ozone modeling demonstrates that such controls are needed to achieve the ozone standard in downwind areas. The Chicago severe ozone nonattainment area includes the Counties of Cook, DuPage, Grundy (Aux Sable and Gooselake Townships), Kane, Kendall (Oswego Township), Lake, McHenry, and Will.
(m) [Reserved]
(n) Negative declaration—Shipbuilding and ship repair industry. On October 11, 1996, the State of Illinois certified to the satisfaction of the United States Environmental Protection Agency that no major sources categorized as part of the shipbuilding and ship repair industry are located in the Chicago, Illinois ozone nonattainment area which is comprised of Cook, DuPage, Kane, Lake, McHenry, Will Counties and Aux Sable and Goose Lake Townships in Grundy County and Oswego Township in Kendall County or the Metro-East, Illinois ozone nonattainment area which is comprised of Madison, Monroe, and St. Clair Counties.
(o) Negative declaration—Aerospace manufacturing and rework industry. On October 11, 1996, the State of Illinois certified to the satisfaction of the United States Environmental Protection Agency that no major sources categorized as part of the Aerospace Manufacturing and Rework Industry are located in the Chicago, Illinois ozone nonattainment area which is comprised of Cook, DuPage, Kane, Lake, McHenry, Will Counties and Aux Sable and Goose Lake Townships in Grundy County and Oswego Township in Kendall County or the Metro-East, Illinois ozone nonattainment area which is comprised of Madison, Monroe, and St. Clair Counties.

These plans satisfy sections 182(b)(1), 172(c)(9), and 182(c)(9) of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990.
(q) Approval—On November 15, 1993, Illinois submitted 15 percent rate-of-progress and 3 percent contingency plans for the Metro-East St. Louis ozone nonattainment area as a requested revision to the Illinois State Implementation Plan. These plans satisfy sections 182(b)(1) and 172(c)(9) of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990.
(r) Approval—On November 15, 1993, Illinois submitted the following transportation control measures as part of the 15 percent rate-of-progress and 3 percent contingency plans for the Metro-East ozone nonattainment area: Work trip reductions; transit improvements; and traffic flow improvements.
(s) On October 10, 1997, Illinois submitted a site-specific revision to the State Implementation Plan, in the form of a letter from Bharat Mathur, Chief, Bureau of Air, Illinois Environmental Protection Agency. This October 10, 1997, letter requests a change in regulatory status for Riverside Laboratories, Inc.'s Kane County facility, to reflect that the Federal site-specific rule for Riverside (40 CFR 52.741(e)(10)) has been superseded by the State of Illinois regulations, including the emission limits in 35 Illinois Administrative Code 218.204(c) and the associated control requirements, test methods and recordkeeping requirements in Part 218 and the associated definitions in part 211. These State regulations shall become the federally approved regulations applicable to Riverside on August 31, 1998. The site-specific rule, applicable to Riverside, promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency on August 21, 1995 (40 CFR 52.741(e)(10)), remains in effect and is enforceable after August 31, 1998 for the period before August 31, 1998.
(t) The Illinois volatile organic compound (VOC) rules that apply to the Stepan Company Millsdale Plant for volatile organic liquid storage (35 Ill. Admin. Code Part 218, Subpart B), batch processing (35 Ill. Admin. Code Parts 218 and 219, Subpart V) and continuous reactor and distillation processes (35 Ill. Admin. Code Part 218, Subpart Q) were approved by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) on August 8, 1996, April 2, 1996, and June 17, 1997, respectively. Because these rules have been approved into the State Implementation Plan and represent reasonably available control technology for VOC, USEPA revokes the June 29, 1990 Federal Implementation Plan as it applies to Stepan and replaces it with Illinois' volatile organic liquid storage, batch process, and continuous reactor and distillation process rules.

Capture system efficiency test protocols
—(A)
Applicability.
The requirements of paragraphs (a)(4)(iii)(B) of this section shall apply to all VOM emitting processes employing capture equipment (
e.g.,
hoods, ducts), except those cases noted below.
(
1
) If a source installs a permanent total enclosure (PTE) that meets USEPA specifications, and which directs all VOM to a control device, then the source is exempted from the requirements described in paragraph (B). The USEPA specifications to determine whether a structure is considered a PTE are given in Procedure T of appendix B of this section. In this instance, the capture efficiency is assumed to be 100 percent and the source
is still required to measure control efficiency using appropriate test methods as specified in (a)(4)(iv) of this section.
(
2
) If a source uses a control device designed to collect and recover VOM (
e.g.,
carbon adsorber), an explicit measurement of capture efficiency is not necessary provided that the conditions given below are met. The overall control of the system can be determined by directly comparing the input liquid VOM to the recovered liquid VOM. The general procedure for use in this situation is given in 40 CFR 60.433, with the following additional restrictions:
(
i
) The source must be able to equate solvent usage with solvent recovery on a 24-hour (daily) basis, rather than a 30-day weighted average, within 72 hours following the 24-hour period. In addition, one of the following two criteria must be met:
(
ii
) The solvent recovery system (i.e., capture and control system) must be dedicated to a single process line (
e.g.,
one process line venting to a carbon adsorber system), or
(
iii
) If the solvent recovery system controls multiple process lines, then the source must be able to demonstrate that the overall control (
i.e.,
the total recovered solvent VOM divided by the sum of liquid VOM input to all process lines venting to the control system) meets or exceeds the most stringent standard applicable for any process line venting to the control system.
(B)
Specific requirements.
The capture efficiency of a process line shall be measured using one of the four protocols given below. Any error margin associated with a test protocol may not be incorporated into the results of a capture efficiency test. If these techniques are not suitable for a particular process, then the source must present an alternative capture efficiency protocol and obtain approval for it by the Administrator as a SIP or FIP revisions.
(
1
) Gas/gas method using temporary total enclosure (TTE). The USEPA specifications to determine whether a temporary enclosure is considered a TTE are given in Procedure T of appendix B of this section. The capture efficiency equation to be used for this protocol is:
CE = Gw / (GW + Fw)
Where:
CE = capture efficiency, decimal fraction.
Gw = mass of VOM captured and delivered to control device using a TTE.
Fw = mass of fugitive VOM that escapes from a TTE.
Procedure G.2 contained in appendix B of this section is used to obtain Gw. Procedure F.1 in appendix B of this section is used to obtain Fw.
(
2
)
Liquid/gas method using TTE.

CE = (L − F) / L
Where:
CE = capture efficiency, decimal fraction.
L = mass of liquid VOM input to process.
Fw = mass of fugitive VOM that escapes from a TTE.
Procedure L contained in appendix B of this section is used to obtain L. Procedure F.1 in appendix B of this section is used to obtain Fw.
(
3
) Gas/gas method using the building or room (building or room enclosure) in which the affected source is located as the enclosure and in which “F” and “G” are measured while operating only the affected facility. All fans and blowers in the building or room must be operated as they would under normal production. The capture efficiency equation to be used for this protocol is:
CE = G / (G + F
B
)
Where:
CE = capture efficiency, decimal fraction.
G = mass of VOM captured and delivered to control device.
F
B
= mass of fugitive VOM that escapes from building enclosure.
Procedure G.2 contained in appendix B of this section is used to obtain G. Procedure F.2 in appendix B of this section is used to obtain F
B
.
(
4
) Liquid/gas method using the building or room (building or room enclosure) in which the affected source is located as the enclosure and in which
“F” and “L” are measured while operating only the affected facility. All fans and blowers in the building or room must be operated as they would under normal production. The capture efficiency equation to be used for this protocol is:
CE = (L − F
B
) / L
Where:
CE = capture efficiency, decimal fraction.
L = mass of liquid VOM input to process.
F
B
= mass of fugitive VOM that escapes from building enclosure.
Procedure L contained in appendix B of this section is used to obtain L. Procedure F.2 in appendix B of this section is used to obtain F
B
.
(C)
Recordkeeping and reporting.
(
1
) All affected facilities must maintain a copy of the capture efficiency protocol submitted to USEPA on file. All results of the appropriate test methods and capture efficiency protocols must be reported to USEPA within sixty (60) days of the test date. A copy of the results must be kept on file with the source for a period of three (3) years.
(
2
) If any changes are made to capture or control equipment, then the source is required to notify USEPA of these changes and a new test may be required by USEPA.
(
3
) The source must notify the Administrator 30 days prior to performing any capture efficiency or control test. At that time, the source must notify the Administrator which capture efficiency protocol and control device test methods will be used.
(
4
) Sources utilizing a PTE must demonstrate that this enclosure meets the requirement given in Procedure T (in appendix B of this section) for a PTE during any testing of their control device.
(
5
) Sources utilizing a TTE must demonstrate that their TTE meets the requirements given in Procedure T (in appendix B of this section) for a TTE during testing of their control device. The source must also provide documentation that the quality assurance criteria for a TTE have been achieved.
(iv)
Control device efficiency testing and monitoring.
(A) The control device efficiency shall be determined by simultaneously measuring the inlet and outlet gas phase VOM concentrations and gas volumetric flow rates in accordance with the gas phase test methods specified in paragraph (a)(4)(vi) of this section.
(B) Any owner or operator that uses an afterburner or carbon adsorber to comply with any paragraph of § 52.741 shall use USEPA approved continuous monitoring equipment which is installed, calibrated, maintained, and operated according to vendor specifications at all times the afterburner or carbon adsorber is in use. The continuous monitoring equipment must monitor the following parameters:
(
1
) Combustion chamber temperature of each afterburner.
(
2
) Temperature rise across each catalytic afterburner bed or VOM concentration of exhaust.
(
3
) The VOM concentration of each carbon adsorption bed exhaust.

2
) of this section for each solvent recovery system. In those cases in which the overall efficiency is being determined for an entire line, the capture efficiency used to calculate the product of the capture and control efficiency is the total capture efficiency over the entire line.
(B) For coating lines which are both chosen by the owner or operator to comply with paragraphs (e)(2)(ii), (e)(2)(iii), (e)(2)(iv), (e)(2)(v), or (e)(2)(vi) of this section by the alternative in paragraph (e)(2)(i)(B) of this section and meet the criteria allowing them to comply with paragraph (e)(2) of this section instead of paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the overall efficiency of the capture system and control device, as determined by the test methods and procedures specified in paragraphs (a)(4) (iii), (iv) and (v)(A) of this section, shall be no less than the equivalent overall efficiency which shall be calculated by the following equation:
E = ([VOM
a
− VOM
1
]/VOM
a
) × 100
Where:
E = Equivalent overall efficiency of the capture system and control device as a percentage,
VOM
a
= Actual VOM content of a coating, or the daily-weighted average VOM content of two or more coatings (if more than one coating is used), as applied to the subject coating line as determined by the applicable test methods and procedures specified in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section in units of kg VOM/l (lb VOM/gal) of coating solids as applied,

) and (
2
) of this section, the test shall consist of three separate runs, each lasting a minimum of 60 min, unless the Administrator determines that process variables dictate shorter sampling times.

(
2
) When the method is to be used to determine the efficiency of a carbon adsorption system with individual exhaust stacks for each adsorber vessel, each adsorber vessel shall be tested individually.

(2)
Alternative emission limitations.
Any owner or operator of a coating line subject to paragraph (e)(1) of this section may comply with this paragraph, rather than with paragraph (e)(1) of this section, if a capture system and control device are operated at all times and the owner or operator demonstrates compliance with paragraphs (e)(2) (ii), (iii), (iv), (v), (vi) or (vii) of this section (depending upon the source category) through the applicable coating analysis and capture system and control device efficiency test methods and procedures specified in paragraph (a)(4) of this section and the recordkeeping and reporting requirements specified in paragraph (e)(6)(iv) of this section; and the control device is equipped with the applicable monitoring equipment specified in paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of this section and the monitoring equipment is installed, calibrated, operated and maintained according to vendor specifications at all times the control device is in use. The use of a capture system and control device, which does not demonstrate compliance with paragraph (e)(2) (ii), (iii), (iv), (v), (vi), or (vii), may only be used as an alternative to compliance with paragraph (e)(1) of this section if approved as a FIP revision.
(i)
Alternative add-on control methodologies.
(A) The coating line is equipped with a capture system and control device that provides 81 percent reduction in the overall emissions of VOM from the coating line and the control device has a 90 percent efficiency, or
(B) The system used to control VOM from the coating line is demonstrated to have an overall efficiency sufficient to limit VOM emissions to no more than what is allowed under paragraph (e)(1) of this section. Use of any control system other than an afterburner, carbon absorption, condensation, or absorption scrubber system can only be allowed if approved by the Administrator as a SIP or FIP revision. Transfer efficiency credits can only be allowed if approved by the Administrator as a SIP or FIP revision. Baseline transfer efficiencies and transfer efficiency test methods must be approved by the Administrator.
Such overall efficiency is to be determined as follows:
(
1
) Obtain the emission limitation from the appropriate paragraph in (e)(1) of this section,
(
2
) Calculate “S” according to the equation in paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section,
(
3
) Calculate the overall efficiency required according to paragraph (a)(4)(v) of this section. For the purposes of calculating this value, according to the equation in (a)(4)(v)(B) of this section VOM
1
is equal to the value of “S” as determined above in (i)(B)(
2
).
(ii) No owner or operator of a coating line subject to only one of the emission limitations from among paragraph (e)(1)(i)(A)(
1
), (e)(1)(i)(A)(
2
), (e)(1)(i)(A)(

(iii) No owner or operator of a miscellaneous metal parts and products coating line which applies one or more coatings during the same day, all of which are subject to the same numerical emission limitation within paragraph (e)(1)(i)(J) of this section (e.g., all coatings used on the line are subject to 0.42 kg/l [3.5 lbs/gal]), and which is equipped with a capture system and
control device shall operate the subject coating line unless the requirements in paragraph (e)(2)(i) (A) or (B) of this section are met.
(iv) No owner or operator of a heavy off-highway vehicle products coating line which applies one or more coatings during the same day, all of which are subject to the same numerical emission limitation within paragraph (e)(1)(i)(K) of this section (e.g., all coatings used on the line are subject to 0.42 kg/l [3.5 lbs/gal]), and which is equipped with a capture system and control device shall operate the subject coating line unless the requirements in paragraph (e)(2)(i) (A) or (B) of this section are met.
(v) No owner or operator of an existing diesel-electric locomotive coating line in Cook County which applies one or more coatings during the same day, all of which are subject to the same numerical emission limitation within paragraph (e)(1)(i)(M) of this section (e.g., all coatings used on the line are subject to 0.42 kg/l [3.5 lbs/gals]), and which is equipped with a capture system and control device shall operate the subject coating line unless the requirements in paragraph (e)(2)(i) (A) or (B) of this section are met.
(vi) No owner or operator of a wood furniture coating line which applies one or more coatings during the same day, all of which are subject to the same numerical emission limitation within paragraph (e)(1)(i)(L) (
e.g.,
all coatings used on the line are subject to 0.67 kg/l [5.6 lbs/gal]), and which is equipped with a capture system and control device shall operate the subject coating line unless the requirements in paragraph (e)(2)(i) (A) or (B) of this section are met. If compliance is achieved by meeting the requirements in paragraph (e)(2)(i)(B) of this section, then the provisions in the note to paragraph (e)(1)(i)(L) of this section must also be met.
(vii) No owner or operator of a can coating facility and equipped with a capture system and control device shall operate the subject coating facility unless the requirements in paragraph (e)(2)(vii) (A) or (B) of this section are met.
(A) An alternative daily emission limitation shall be determined according to paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(C)(
2
) of this section. Actual daily emissions shall never exceed the alternative daily emission limitation and shall be calculated by use of the following equation:
EC07NO91.007
Where:
E
d
= Actual VOM emissions for the day in units of kg/day (lbs/day),
i = Subscript denoting the specific coating applied,
n = Total number of surface coatings as applied in the can coating operation,
V
i
= Volume of each coating as applied for the day in units of 1/day (gal/day) of coating (minus water and any compounds which are specifically exempted from the definition of VOM),
C
i
= The VOM content of each coating as applied in units of kg VOM/l (lbs VOM/gal) of coating (minus water and any compounds which are specifically exempted from the definition of VOM), and
F
i
= Fraction, by weight, of VOM emissions from the surface coating, reduced or prevented from being emitted to the ambient air. This is the overall efficiency of the capture system and control device.
(B) The coating line is equipped with a capture system and control device that provide 75 percent reduction in the overall emissions of VOM from the coating line and the control device has a 90 percent efficiency.
(3)
Exemptions from emission limitations
—(i)
Exemptions for all source categories except wood furniture coating.
The limitations of paragraph (e) of this section shall not apply to coating lines within a facility, that otherwise would be subject to the same subparagraph of paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section (because they belong to the same source category, e.g. can coating), provided that combined actual emissions of VOM from all lines at the facility subject to that subparagraph never exceed 6.8 kg/day (15 lbs/day) before the application of capture systems and control devices. (For example, can coating lines within a plant would not be subject to the limitations of subparagraph (e)(1)(i)(B) of this section if the combined actual emissions of VOM from the can coating lines never exceed 6.8
kg/day (15 lbs/day) before the application of capture systems and control devices.) Volatile organic material emissions from heavy off-highway vehicle products coating lines must be combined with VOM emissions from miscellaneous metal parts and products coating lines to determine applicability. Any owner or operator of a coating facility shall comply with the applicable coating analysis test methods and procedures specified in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section and the recordkeeping and reporting requirements specified in paragraph (e)(6)(i) of this section if total VOM emissions from the subject coating lines are always less than or equal to 6.8 kg/day (15 lbs/day) before the application of capture systems and control devices and, therefore, are not subject to the limitations of paragraph (e)(1) of this section. Once a category of coating lines at a facility is subject to the limitations in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the coating lines are always subject to the limitations in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
(ii)
Applicability for wood furniture coating.
(A) The limitations of paragraph (e) of this section shall apply to a plant's wood furniture coating lines if the plant contains process emission sources, not regulated by paragraphs (d), (e) (excluding paragraph (e)(1)(i)(L)), (h) (excluding paragraph (h)(5)), (i), (j), or (q)(1), or subparts B, Q (excluding sections 215.432 and 215.436), R (excluding sections 215.447, 215.450, and 215.452), S, V, X, Y (sections 215.582-215.584), or Z of 35 Ill. Adm. Code 215 (incorporated by reference as specified in 40 CFR 52.742), which as a group both:
(
1
) Have maximum theoretical emissions of 91 Mg (100 tons) or more per calendar year of VOM if no air pollution control equipment were used, and
(
2
) Are not limited to less than 91 Mg (100 tons) of VOM per calendar year if no air pollution control equipment were used, through production or capacity limitations contained in a federally enforceable construction permit or SIP or FIP version.
(B) If a plant ceases to fulfill the criteria of paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, the limitations of paragraph (e)(1)(i)(L) of this section shall continue to apply to any wood furniture coating line which was ever subject to the limitations of paragraph (e)(1)(i)(L) of this section.
(C) For the purposes of paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section, an emission source shall be considered regulated by a subpart (of the Illinois rules), section, or paragraph if it is subject to the limitations of that subpart (of the Illinois rules), section, or paragraph. An emission source is not considered regulated by a subpart (of the Illinois rules), section, or paragraph if its emissions are below the applicability cutoff level or if the source is covered by an exemption.
(D) Any owner or operator of a wood furniture coating line to which the limitations of paragraph (e) of this section are not applicable due to the criteria in paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section shall, upon request by the Administrator, submit records to the Administrator within 30 calendar days from the date of the request that document that the coating line is exempt from the limitations of paragraph (e) of this section.
(4)
Exemption from general rule on use of organic material.
No owner or operator of a coating line subject to the limitations of paragraph (e)(1) of this section is required to meet the limitations of subpart K (section 215.301 or 215.302) of 35 Ill. Adm. Code 215 (incorporated by reference as specified in 40 CFR 52.742), after the date by which the coating line is required to meet paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
(5)
Compliance schedule.
Except as specified in paragraph (e)(7) of this section, every owner or operator of a coating line (of a type included within paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section) shall comply with the requirements of paragraph (e)(1),(e)(2) or (e)(3) of this section and paragraph (e)(6) of this section in accordance with the appropriate compliance schedule as specified in paragraph (e)(5)(i),(ii),(iii) or (iv) of this section.

(12) The control and recordkeeping and reporting requirements, as well as the test methods in this paragraph, apply to the gravure and screen press operations at the Meyercord Corporation (Meyercord) in Carol Stream, Illinois, instead of the requirements in paragraphs (x)(1) through (x)(5) of this section.
(i) After July 1, 1991, no materials which contain volatile organic material (VOM), including coatings, inks, and cleaning material, may be used at any gravure or screen press unless the total VOM emissions remain below 100 tons of VOM for every consecutive 365-day period, or fraction thereof, starting on July 1, 1991. A new 365-day period starts on each day. The VOM emissions, which are to be calculated on a daily basis, are to be added to the VOM emissions for the prior 364 days (but not including any day prior to July 1, 1991). VOM emissions are based upon the VOM content of the material and the volume of material used. The effect of add-on control equipment is not considered in calculating VOM emissions; that is, the VOM emissions are to be determined as if the press(es) do(es) not have add-on control equipment. The applicable test methods and procedures specified in paragraph (a)(4) of this section are to be used in determining daily VOM emissions.
(ii) The VOM content of each coating, ink, and cleaning solution shall be determined by the applicable test methods and procedures specified in paragraph (a)(4) of this section to establish the records required under paragraph (x)(12)(ii) of this section. Beginning on July 1, 1991, the owner or operator of the subject presses shall collect and record all of the following information each day and maintain the information at the facility for 3 years:
(A) The name and identification number of each coating, ink, and cleaning solution as applied on any press.
(B) The pounds (lbs) of VOM per gallon of each coating, ink, and cleaning solution (minus water and any compounds which are specifically exempted from the definition of VOM) as applied on any press.
(C) The total gallons of each coating, ink, and cleaning solution (minus water and any compounds which are specifically exempted from the definition of VOM) used per day.
(D) The total lbs of VOM contained in the volume of each coating, ink, and cleaning solution used per day on any press. The lbs of VOM per day is to be calculated by multiplying the lbs of VOM per gallon (minus water and any compounds which are specifically exempted from the definition of VOM) times the gallons (minus water and any compounds which are specifically exempted from the definition of VOM) used per day.
(E) The total lbs of VOM per day from all coatings, inks, and cleaning solutions used on all presses. The total lbs of VOM per day is to be obtained by adding the lbs of VOM per day contained in all coatings, inks, and cleaning solutions.
(F) Within 7 days after each 365-day period, the VOM emissions (as calculated in paragraph (x)(12)(ii)(E)) of this section before add-on control, from the 365-day period, are to be determined.
Starting on July 7, 1992, VOM emissions are to be determined for the 365 days ending 7 days earlier. Each day concludes a new 365-day period. However, no VOM emissions are to be included for any days prior to July 1, 1991. For example, on July 17, 1991, the emissions from July 1, through July 10, 1991, are to be included, whereas on January 7, 1994, the emissions from January 1, 1993, through December 31, 1993, are to be included.

# Appendix B to § 52.741—VOM Measurement Techniques for Capture Efficiency

# Procedure G.1—Captured VOC Emissions

# 1. Introduction
1.1
Applicability.
This procedure is applicable for determining the volatile organic compounds (VOC) content of captured gas streams. It is intended to be used as a segment in the development of liquid/gas or gas/gas protocols for determining VOC capture efficiency (CE) for surface coating and printing operations. The procedure may not be acceptable in certain site-specific situations,
e.g.,
when: (1) Direct fired heaters or other circumstances affect the quantity of VOC at the control device inlet; and (2) particulate organic aerosols are formed in the process and are present in the captured emissions.
1.2
Principle.
The amount of VOC captured (G) is calculated as the sum of the products of the VOC content (C
Gj
), the flow rate (Q
Gj
), and the sample time (T
C
) from each captured emissions point.
1.3
Estimated measurement uncertainty.
The measurement uncertainties are estimated for each captured or fugitive emissions point as follows: Q
Gj
=±5.5 percent and C
Gj
=±5.0 percent. Based on these numbers, the probable uncertainty for G is estimated at about ±7.4 percent.
1.4
Sampling requirements.
A capture efficiency test shall consist of at least three sampling runs. The sampling time for each run should be at least 8 hours, unless otherwise approved.
1.5
Notes.
Because this procedure is often applied in highly explosive areas, caution and care should be exercised in choosing appropriate equipment and installing and using the equipment. Mention of trade names or company products does not constitute endorsement. All gas concentrations (percent, ppm) are by volume, unless otherwise noted.

# 2. Apparatus and Reagents
2.1
Gas VOC concentration.
A schematic of the measurement system is shown in Figure 1. The main components are described below:
2.1.1
Sample probe.
Stainless steel, or equivalent. The probe shall be heated to prevent VOC condensation.
2.1.2
Calibration valve assembly.
Three-way valve assembly at the outlet of sample probe to direct the zero and calibration gases to the analyzer. Other methods, such as quick-connect lines, to route calibration gases to the outlet of the sample probe are acceptable.
2.1.3
Sample line.
Stainless steel or Teflon tubing to transport the sample gas to the analyzer. The sample line must be heated to prevent condensation.
2.1.4
Sample pump.
A lead-free pump, to pull the sample gas through the system at a flow rate sufficient to minimize the response time of the measurement system. The components of the pump that contact the gas stream shall be constructed of stainless steel or Teflon. The sample pump must be heated to prevent condensation.
2.1.5
Sample flow rate control.
A sample flow rate control valve and rotameter, or equivalent, to maintain a constant sampling rate within 10 percent. The flow rate control valve and rotameter must be heated to prevent condensation. A control valve may also be located on the sample pump bypass loop to assist in controlling the sample pressure and flow rate.
2.1.6
Sample gas manifold.
Capable of diverting a portion of the sample gas stream to the flame ionization analyzer (FIA), and the remainder to the bypass discharge vent. The manifold components shall be constructed of stainless steel or Teflon. If captured or fugitive emissions are to be measured at multiple locations, the measurement system shall be designed to use separate sampling probes, lines, and pumps for each measurement location and a common sample gas manifold and FIA. The sample gas manifold and connecting lines to the FIA must be heated to prevent condensation.
2.1.7
Organic concentration analyzer.
An FIA with a span value of 1.5 times the expected concentration as propane; however, other span values may be used if it can be demonstrated that they would provide more accurate measurements.
The system shall be capable of meeting or exceeding the following specifications:
2.1.7.1
Zero drift.
Less than ±3.0 percent of the span value.
2.1.7.2
Calibration drift.
Less than ±3.0 percent of the span value.
2.1.7.3
Calibration error.
Less than ±5.0 percent of the calibration gas value.
2.1.7.4
Response time.
Less than 30 seconds.
2.1.8
Integrator/data acquisition system.
An analog or digital device or computerized
data acquisition system used to integrate the FIA response or compute the average response and record measurement data. The minimum data sampling frequency for computing average or integrated values is one measurement value every 5 seconds. The device shall be capable of recording average values at least once per minute.
2.1.9
Calibration and other gases.
Gases used for calibration, fuel, and combustion air (if required) are contained in compressed gas cylinders. All calibration gases shall be traceable to NIST standards and shall be certified by the manufacturer to ±1 percent of the tag value. Additionally, the manufacturer of the cylinder should provide a recommended shelf life for each calibration gas cylinder over which the concentration does not change more than ±2 percent from the certified value. For calibration gas values not generally available, alternative methods for preparing calibration gas mixtures, such as dilution systems, may be used with prior approval.
2.1.9.1
Fuel.
A 40 percent H

gas mixture is recommended to avoid an oxygen synergism effect that reportedly occurs when oxygen concentration varies significantly from a mean value.
2.1.9.2
Carrier gas.
High purity air with less than 1 ppm of organic material (as propane or carbon equivalent) or less than 0.1 percent of the span value, whichever is greater.
2.1.9.3
FIA Linearity calibration gases.
Low-, mid-, and high-range gas mixture standards with nominal propane concentrations of 20-30, 45-55, and 70-80 percent of the span value in air, respectively. Other calibration values and other span values may be used if it can be shown that more accurate measurements would be achieved.
2.1.10
Particulate filter.
An in-stack or an out-of-stack glass fiber filter is recommended if exhaust gas particulate loading is significant. An out-of-stack filter must be heated to prevent any condensation unless it can be demonstrated that no condensation occurs.
2.2
Captured emissions volumetric flow rate.
2.2.1
Method 2 or 2A apparatus.
For determining volumetric flow rate.
2.2.2
Method 3 apparatus and reagents.
For determining molecular weight of the gas stream. An estimate of the molecular weight of the gas stream may be used if it can be justified.
2.2.3
Method 4 apparatus and reagents.
For determining moisture content, if necessary.

# 3. Determinations of Volumetric Flow Rate of Captured Emissions
3.1 Locate all points where emissions are captured from the affected facility. Using Method 1, determine the sampling points. Be sure to check each site for cyclonic or swirling flow.
3.2 Measure the velocity at each sampling site at least once every hour during each sampling run using Method 2 or 2A.

# 4. Determinations of VOC Content of Captured Emissions
4.1
Analysis duration.
Measure the VOC responses at each captured emissions point during the entire test run or, if applicable, while the process is operating. If there are multiple captured emission locations, design a sampling system to allow a single FIA to be used to determine the VOC responses at all sampling locations.
4.2
Gas VOC concentration.
4.2.1 Assemble the sample train as shown in Figure 1. Calibrate the FIA according to the procedure in section 5.1.
4.2.2 Conduct a system check according to the procedure in section 5.3.
4.2.3 Install the sample probe so that the probe is centrally located in the stack, pipe, or duct, and is sealed tightly at the stack port connection.
4.2.4 Inject zero gas at the calibration valve assembly. Allow the measurement system response to reach zero. Measure the system response time as the time required for the system to reach the effluent concentration after the calibration valve has been returned to the effluent sampling position.
4.2.5 Conduct a system check before and a system check after each sampling run according to the procedures in sections 5.2 and 5.3. If the drift check following a run indicates unacceptable performance, the run is not valid. The tester may elect to perform system drift checks during the run not to exceed one drift check per hour.
4.2.6 Verify that the sample lines, filter, and pump temperatures are 120 ±5 °C.
4.2.7 Begin sampling at the start of the test period and continue to sample during the entire run. Record the starting and ending times and any required process information as appropriate. If multiple captured emission locations are sampled using a single FIA, sample at each location for the same amount of time (
e.g.,
2 minutes) and continue to switch from one location to another for the entire test run. Be sure that total sampling time at each location is the same at the end of the test run. Collect at least 4 separate measurements from each sample point during each hour of testing. Disregard the measurements at each sampling location until two times the response time of the measurement system has elapsed. Continue sampling for at least 1 minute and record the concentration measurements.
4.3
Background concentration.
4.3.1 Locate all NDO's of the TTE. A sampling point shall be centrally located outside of the TTE at 4 equivalent diameters from
each NDO, if possible. If there are more than 6 NDO's, choose 6 sampling points evenly spaced among the NDO's.
4.3.2 Assemble the sample train as shown in Figure 2. Calibrate the FIA and conduct a system check according to the procedures in sections 5.1 and 5.3.

# Note:
This sample train shall be a separate sampling train from the one to measure the captured emissions.
4.3.3 Position the probe at the sampling location.
4.3.4 Determine the response time, conduct the system check and sample according to the procedures described in sections 4.2.4 to 4.2.7.
4.4
Alternative procedure.
The direct interface sampling and analysis procedure described in section 7.2 of Method 18 may be used to determine the gas VOC concentration. The system must be designed to collect and analyze at least one sample every 10 minutes.

# 5. Calibration and Quality Assurance
5.1
FIA calibration and linearity check.
Make necessary adjustments to the air and fuel supplies for the FIA and ignite the burner. Allow the FIA to warm up for the period recommended by the manufacturer. Inject a calibration gas into the measurement system and adjust the back-pressure regulator to the value required to achieve the flow rates specified by the manufacturer. Inject the zero- and the high-range calibration gases and adjust the analyzer calibration to provide the proper responses. Inject the low- and mid-range gases and record the responses of the measurement system. The calibration and linearity of the system are acceptable if the responses for all four gases are within 5 percent of the respective gas values. If the performance of the system is not acceptable, repair or adjust the system and repeat the linearity check. Conduct a calibration and linearity check after assembling the analysis system and after a major change is made to the system.
5.2
Systems drift checks.
Select the calibration gas that most closely approximates the concentration of the captured emissions for conducting the drift checks. Introduce the zero and calibration gas at the calibration valve assembly and verify that the appropriate gas flow rate and pressure are present at the FIA. Record the measurement system responses to the zero and calibration gases. The performance of the system is acceptable if the difference between the drift check measurement and the value obtained in section 5.1 is less than 3 percent of the span value. Conduct the system drift checks at the end of each run.
5.3
System check.
Inject the high range calibration gas at the inlet to the sampling probe while the dilution air is turned off. Record the response. The performance of the system is acceptable if the measurement system response is within 5 percent of the value obtained in section 5.1 for the high range calibration gas. Conduct a system check before and after each test run.
5.4
Analysis audit.
Immediately before each test analyze an audit cylinder as described in section 5.2. The analysis audit must agree with the audit cylinder concentration within 10 percent.

# Procedure G.2—Captured VOC Emissions (Dilution Technique)

# 1. Introduction
1.1
Applicability.
This procedure is applicable for determining the volatile organic compounds (VOC) content of captured gas streams. It is intended to be used as a segment in the development of a gas/gas protocol in which fugitive emissions are measured for determining VOC capture efficiency (CE) for surface coating and printing operations. A dilution system is used to reduce the VOC concentration of the captured emission to about the same concentration as the fugitive emission. The procedure may not be acceptable in certain site-specific situations,
e.g.,
when: (1) Direct fired heaters or other circumstances affect the quantity of VOC at the control device inlet; and (2) particulate organic aerosols are formed in the process and are present in the captured emissions.
1.2
Principle.
The amount of VOC captured (G) is calculated as the sum of the products of the VOC content (C
Gj
), the flow rate (Q
Gj
), and the sampling time (T
C
) from each captured emissions point.

# 3. Determination of Volumetric Flow Rate of Fugitive Emissions
3.1
Preliminary determinations.
The purpose of this exercise is to determine which exhaust points should be measured for volumetric flow rates and VOC concentrations.
3.1.1
Forced draft openings.
Identify all forced draft openings. Determine the volumetric flow rate according to Method 2.
3.1.2
NDO's exhaust points.
The NDO's in the roof of a facility are considered to be exhaust points. Determine volumetric flow rate from these NDO's. Divide the cross-sectional area according to Method 1 using 12 equal areas. Use the appropriate velocity measurement devices,
e.g.,
propeller anemometers.
3.1.3
Other NDO's.
3.1.3.1 This step is optional. Determine the exhaust flow rate, including that of the control device, from the enclosure and the intake air flow rate. If the exhaust flow rate divided by the intake air flow rate is greater than 1.1, then all other NDO's are not considered to be significant exhaust points.
3.1.3.2 If the option above is not taken, identify all other NDO's and other potential points through which fugitive emissions may escape the enclosure. Then use the following criteria to determine whether flow rates and VOC concentrations need to be measured:
3.1.3.2.1 Using the appropriate flow direction indicator, determine the flow direction. An NDO with zero or inward flow is not an exhaust point.
3.1.3.2.2 Measure the outward volumetric flow rate from the remainder of the NDO's. If the collective flow rate is 2 percent, or less, of the flow rate from sections 3.1.1 and 3.1.2, then these NDO's, except those within two equivalent diameters (based on NDO opening) from VOC sources, may be considered to be non-exhaust points.
3.1.3.2.3 If the percentage calculated in section 3.1.3.2.2 is greater than 2 percent, those NDO's (except those within two equivalent diameters from VOC sources) whose volumetric flow rate totals 2 percent of the flow rate from sections 3.1.1 and 3.1.2 may be considered as non-exhaust points. All remaining NDO's shall be measured for volumetric flow rate and VOC concentrations during the CE test.
3.1.3.2.4 The tester may choose to measure VOC concentrations at the forced exhaust points and the NDO's. If the total VOC emissions from the NDO's are less than 2 percent of the emissions from the forced draft and roof NDO's, then these NDO's may be eliminated from further consideration.
3.2
Determination of flow rates.
3.2.1 Measure the volumetric flow rate at all locations identified as exhaust points in section 3.1. Divide each exhaust opening into 9 equal areas for rectangular openings and 8 for circular openings.
3.2.2 Measure the velocity at each site at least once every hour during each sampling run using Method 2 or 2A, if applicable, or using the low velocity instruments in section 2.2.2.

# 4. Determination of VOC Content of Fugitive Emissions

4.2.2 Install the sample probe so that the probe is centrally located in the stack, pipe, or duct, and is sealed tightly at the stack port connection.
4.2.3 Inject zero gas at the calibration valve assembly. Allow the measurement system response to reach zero. Measure the system response time as the time required for the system to reach the effluent concentration after the calibration valve has been returned to the effluent sampling position.
4.2.4 Conduct a system check before and a system drift check after each sampling run according to the procedures in sections 5.2 and 5.3. If the drift check following a run indicates unacceptable performance, the run is not valid. The tester may elect to perform drift checks during the run not to exceed one drift check per hour.
4.2.5 Verify that the sample lines, filter, and pump temperatures are 120 ±5 °C.
4.2.6 Begin sampling at the start of the test period and continue to sample during the entire run. Record the starting and ending times and any required process information as appropriate. If multiple emission locations are sampled using a single FIA, sample at each location for the same amount of time (

Continue sampling for at least 1 minute and record the concentration measurements.

# 3. Determination of Volumetric Flow Rate of Fugitive Emissions
3.1 Locate all points where emissions are exhausted from the TTE. Using Method 1, determine the sampling points. Be sure to check each site for cyclonic or swirling flow.
3.2 Measure the velocity at each sampling site at least once every hour during each sampling run using Method 2 or 2A.

# 4. Determination of VOC Content of Fugitive Emissions
4.1
Analysis duration.
Measure the VOC responses at each fugitive emission point during the entire test run or, if applicable, while the process is operating. If there are multiple emission locations, design a sampling system to allow a single FIA to be used to determine the VOC responses at all sampling locations.
4.2
Gas VOC concentration.
4.2.1 Assemble the sample train as shown in Figure 1. Calibrate the FIA and conduct a system check according to the procedures in sections 5.1 and 5.3, respectively.
4.2.2 Install the sample probe so that the probe is centrally located in the stack, pipe, or duct, and is sealed tightly at the stack port connection.
4.2.3 Inject zero gas at the calibration valve assembly. Allow the measurement system response to reach zero. Measure the system response time as the time required for the system to reach the effluent concentration after the calibration valve has been returned to the effluent sampling position.
4.2.4 Conduct a system check before and a system drift check after each sampling run according to the procedures in sections 5.2 and 5.3. If the drift check following a run indicates unacceptable performance, the run is not valid. The tester may elect to perform system drift checks during the run not to exceed one drift check per hour.
4.2.5 Verify that the sample lines, filter, and pump temperatures are 120 ±5 °C.
4.2.6 Begin sampling at the start of the test period and continue to sample during the entire run. Record the starting and ending times and any required process information as appropriate. If multiple emission locations are sampled using a single FIA, sample at each location for the same amount of time (
e.g.,
2 minutes) and continue to switch from one location to another for the entire test run. Be sure that total sampling time at each location is the same at the end of the test run. Collect at least 4 separate measurements from each sample point during each hour of testing. Disregard the response measurements at each sampling location until two times the response time of the measurement system has elapsed. Continue sampling for at least 1 minute and record the concentration measurements.
4.3

Determination of VOC background concentration.
4.3.1.1 Locate all NDO's of the TTE. A sampling point shall be centrally located outside of the TTE at 4 equivalent diameters from each NDO, if possible. If there are more than 6 NDO's, choose 6 sampling points evenly spaced among the NDO's.
4.3.1.2 Assemble the sample train as shown in Figure 2. Calibrate the FIA and conduct a system check according to the procedures in sections 5.1 and 5.3.
4.3.1.3 Position the probe at the sampling location.
4.3.1.4 Determine the response time, conduct the system check and sample according to the procedures described in sections 4.2.3 to 4.2.6.
4.4

# 5. Calibration and Quality Assurance
5.1
FIA calibration and linearity check.
Make necessary adjustments to the air and fuel supplies for the FIA and ignite the burner. Allow the FIA to warm up for the period recommended by the manufacturer. Inject a calibration gas into the measurement system and adjust the back-pressure regulator to the value required to achieve the flow rates specified by the manufacturer. Inject the zero- and the high-range calibration gases and adjust the analyzer calibration to provide the proper responses. Inject the low- and mid-range gases and record the responses of the measurement system. The calibration and linearity of the system are acceptable if the responses for all four gases are within 5 percent of the respective gas values. If the performance of the system is not acceptable, repair or adjust the system and repeat the linearity check. Conduct a calibration and linearity check after assembling the analysis system and after a major change is made to the system.
5.2
Systems drift checks.
Select the calibration gas concentration that most closely approximates that of the fugitive gas emissions to conduct the drift checks. Introduce the zero and calibration gas at the calibration valve assembly and verify that the appropriate gas flow rate and pressure are present at the FIA. Record the measurement system responses to the zero and calibration gases. The performance of the system is acceptable if the difference between the drift check measurement and the value obtained in section 5.1 is less than 3 percent of the span value. Conduct a system drift check at the end of each run.
5.3
System check.
Inject the high range calibration gas at the inlet of the sampling probe and record the response. The performance of the system is acceptable if the measurement system response is within 5 percent of the value obtained in section 5.1 for the high range calibration gas. Conduct a system check before each test run.
5.4
Analysis audit.
Immediately before each test analyze an audit cylinder as described in section 5.2. The analysis audit must agree with the audit cylinder concentration within 10 percent.

# Procedure L—VOC Input

# 1. Introduction
1.1
Applicability.
This procedure is applicable for determining the input of volatile organic compounds (VOC). It is intended to be used as a segment in the development of liquid/gas protocols for determining VOC capture efficiency (CE) for surface coating and printing operations.
1.2
Principle.
The amount of VOC introduced to the process (L) is the sum of the products of the weight (W) of each VOC containing liquid (ink, paint, solvent, etc.) used and its VOC content (V). A sample of each
VOC containing liquid is analyzed with a flame ionization analyzer (FIA) to determine V.
1.3
Estimated measurement uncertainty.
The measurement uncertainties are estimated for each VOC containing liquid as follows: W=±2.0 percent and V=±12.0 percent. Based on these numbers, the probable uncertainty for L is estimated at about ±12.2 percent for each VOC containing liquid.
1.4
Sampling requirements.
A capture efficiency test shall consist of at least three sampling runs. The sampling time for each run should be at least 8 hours, unless otherwise approved.
1.5
Notes.
Because this procedure is often applied in highly explosive areas, caution and care should be exercised in choosing appropriate equipment and installing and using the equipment. Mention of trade names or company products does not constitute endorsement. All gas concentrations (percent, ppm) are by volume, unless otherwise noted.

# 3. Determination of Liquid Input Weight
3.1
Weight difference.
Determine the amount of material introduced to the process as the weight difference of the feed material before and after each sampling run. In determining the total VOC containing liquid usage, account for: (a) The initial (beginning) VOC containing liquid mixture; (b) any solvent added during the test run; (c) any coating added during the test run; and (d) any residual VOC containing liquid mixture remaining at the end of the sample run.
3.1.1 Identify all points where VOC containing liquids are introduced to the process. To obtain an accurate measurement of VOC containing liquids, start with an empty fountain (if applicable). After completing the run, drain the liquid in the fountain back into the liquid drum (if possible), and weigh the drum again. Weigh the VOC containing liquids to ±0.5 percent of the total weight (full) or ±0.1 percent of the total weight of VOC containing liquid used during the sample run, whichever is less. If the residual liquid cannot be returned to the drum, drain the fountain into a preweighted empty drum to determine the final weight of the liquid.
3.1.2 If it is not possible to measure a single representative mixture, then weigh the various components separately (
e.g.,
if solvent is added during the sampling run, weigh the solvent before it is added to the mixture). If a fress drum of VOC containing liquid is needed during the run, then weigh both the empty drum and fresh drum.
3.2
Volume measurement (alternative).
If direct weight measurements are not feasible, the tester may use volume meters and flow rate meters (and density measurements) to determine the weight of liquids used if it can be demonstrated that the technique produces results equivalent to the direct weight measurements. If a single representative mixture cannot be measured, measure the components separately.

# 4. Determination of VOC Content in Input Liquids
4.1
Collection of liquid samples.
4.1.1 Collect a 100-ml or larger sample of the VOC containing liquid mixture at each application location at the beginning and end of each test run. A separate sample should be taken of each VOC containing liquid added to the application mixture during the test run. If a fresh drum is needed during the sampling run, then obtain a sample from the fresh drum.
4.1.2 When collecting the sample, ground the sample container to the coating drum. Fill the sample container as close to the rim as possible to minimize the amount of headspace.
4.1.3 After the sample is collected, seal the container so the sample cannot leak out or evaporate.
4.1.4 Label the container to identify clearly the contents.
4.2
Liquid sample VOC content.
4.2.1 Assemble the liquid VOC content analysis system as shown in Figure 1.
4.2.2 Permanently identify all of the critical orifices that may be used. Calibrate each critical orifice under the expected operating conditions (i.e., sample vacuum and temperature) against a volume meter as described in section 5.3.
4.2.3 Label and tare the sample vessels (including the stoppers and caps) and the syringes.
4.2.4 Install an empty sample vessel and perform a leak test of the system. Close the carrier gas valve and atmospheric vent and evacuate the sample vessel to 250 mm (10 in.) Hg absolute or less using the aspirator. Close
the toggle valve at the inlet to the aspirator and observe the vacuum for at least one minute. If there is any change in the sample pressure, release the vacuum, adjust or repair the apparatus as necessary and repeat the leak test.
4.2.5 Perform the analyzer calibration and linearity checks according to the procedure in section 5.1. Record the responses to each of the calibration gases and the back-pressure setting of the FIA.
4.2.6 Establish the appropriate dilution ratio by adjusting the aspirator air supply or substituting critical orifices. Operate the aspirator at a vacuum of at least 25 mm (1 in.) Hg greater than the vacuum necessary to achieve critical flow. Select the dilution ratio so that the maximum response of the FIA to the sample does not exceed the high-range calibration gas.
4.2.7 Perform system calibration checks at two levels by introducing compressed gases at the inlet to the sample vessel while the aspirator and dilution devices are operating. Perform these checks using the carrier gas (zero concentration) and the system calibration gas. If the response to the carrier gas exceeds ±0.5 percent of span, clean or repair the apparatus and repeat the check. Adjust the dilution ratio as necessary to achieve the correct response to the upscale check, but do not adjust the analyzer calibration. Record the identification of the orifice, aspirator air supply pressure, FIA back-pressure, and the responses of the FIA to the carrier and system calibration gases.
4.2.8 After completing the above checks, inject the system calibration gas for approximately 10 minutes. Time the exact duration of the gas injection using a stopwatch. Determine the area under the FIA response curve and calculate the system response factor based on the sample gas flow rate, gas concentration, and the duration of the injection as compared to the integrated response using Equations 2 and 3.
4.2.9 Verify that the sample oven and sample line temperatures are 120 ±5 °C and that the water bath temperature is 100 ±5 °C.
4.2.10 Fill a tared syringe with approximately 1 g of the VOC containing liquid and weigh it. Transfer the liquid to a tared sample vessel. Plug the sample vessel to minimize sample loss. Weigh the sample vessel containing the liquid to determine the amount of sample actually received. Also, as a quality control check, weigh the empty syringe to determine the amount of material delivered. The two coating sample weights should agree within ±0.02 g. If not, repeat the procedure until an acceptable sample is obtained.
4.2.11 Connect the vessel to the analysis system. Adjust the aspirator supply pressure to the correct value. Open the valve on the carrier gas supply to the sample vessel and adjust it to provide a slight excess flow to the atmospheric vent. As soon as the initial response of the FIA begins to decrease, immerse the sample vessel in the water bath. (Applying heat to the sample vessel too soon may cause the FID response to exceed the calibrated range of the instrument, and thus invalidate the analysis.)
4.2.12 Continuously measure and record the response of the FIA until all of the volatile material has been evaporated from the sample and the instrument response has returned to the baseline (i.e., response less than 0.5 percent of the span value). Observe the aspirator supply pressure, FIA back-pressure, atmospheric vent, and other system operating parameters during the run; repeat the analysis procedure if any of these parameters deviate from the values established during the system calibration checks in Section 4.2.7. After each sample perform the drift check described in Section 5.2. If the drift check results are acceptable, calculate the VOC content of the sample using the equations in Section 7. Integrate the area under the FIA response curve, or determine the average concentration response and the duration of sample analysis.

# 5. Calibration and Quality Assurance
5.1
FIA calibration and linearity check.
Make necessary adjustments to the air and fuel supplies for the FIA and ignite the burner. Allow the FIA to warm up for the period recommended by the manufacturer. Inject a calibration gas into the measurement system and adjust the back-pressure regulator to the value required to achieve the flow rates specified by the manufacturer. Inject the zero- and the high-range calibration gases and adjust the analyzer calibration to provide the proper responses. Inject the low- and mid-range gases and record the responses of the measurement system. The calibration and linearity of the system are acceptable if the responses for all four gases are within 5 percent of the respective gas values. If the performance of the system is not acceptable, repair or adjust the system and repeat the linearity check. Conduct a calibration and linearity check after assembling the analysis system and after a major change is made to the system.
5.2
Systems drift checks.
After each sample, repeat the system calibration checks in Section 4.2.7 before any adjustments to the FIA or measurement system are made. If the zero or calibration drift exceeds ±3 percent of the span value, discard the result and repeat the analysis.
5.3
Critical orifice calibration.
5.3.1 Each critical orifice must be calibrated at the specific operating conditions that it will be used. Therefore, assemble all components of the liquid sample analysis system as shown in Figure 3. A stopwatch is also required.
5.3.2 Turn on the sample oven, sample line, and water bath heaters and allow the system to reach the proper operating temperature. Adjust the aspirator to a vacuum of 380 mm (15 in.) Hg vacuum. Measure the time required for one soap bubble to move a known distance and record barometric pressure.
5.3.3 Repeat the calibration procedure at a vacuum of 406 mm (16 in.) Hg and at 25-mm (1-in.) Hg intervals until three consecutive determinations provide the same flow rate. Calculate the critical flow rate for the orifice in ml/min at standard conditions. Record the vacuum necessary to achieve critical flow.

# Procedure T—Criteria for and Verification of a Permanent or Temporary Total Enclosure

# 1. Introduction
1.1
Applicability.
This procedure is used to determine whether a permanent or temporary enclosure meets the criteria of a total enclosure.
1.2
Principle.
An enclosure is evaluated against a set of criteria. If the criteria are met and if all the exhaust gases are ducted to a control device, then the volatile organic compounds (VOC) capture efficiency (CE) is assumed to be 100 percent and CE need not be measured. However, if part of the exhaust gas stream is not ducted to a control device, CE must be determined.

# 2. Definitions
2.1
Natural Draft Opening (NDO)
—Any permanent opening in the enclosure that remains open during operation of the facility and is not connected to a duct in which a fan is installed.
2.2
Permanent Total Enclosure (PTE)
—A permanently installed enclosure that completely surrounds a source of emissions such that all VOC emissions are captured and contained for discharge through a control device.
2.3
Temporary Total Enclosure (TTE)
—A temporarily installed enclosure that completely surrounds a source of emissions such that all VOC emissions are captured and contained for discharge through ducts that allow for the accurate measurement of VOC rates.

# 3. Criteria of a Temporary Total Enclosure
3.1 Any NDO shall be at least 4 equivalent opening diameters from each VOC emitting point.
3.2 Any exhaust point from the enclosure shall be at least 4 equivalent duct or hood diameters from each NDO.
3.3 The total area of all NDO's shall not exceed 5 percent of the surface area of the enclosure's four walls, floor, and ceiling.
3.4 The average facial velocity (FV) of air through all NDO's shall be at least 3,600 m/hr (200 fpm). The direction of air through all NDO's shall be into the enclosure.
3.5 All access doors and windows whose areas are not included in section 3.3 and are not included in the calculation in section 3.4 shall be closed during routine operation of the process.

# 4. Criteria of a Permanent Total Enclosure
4.1 Same as sections 3.1 and 3.3-3.5.
4.2 All VOC emissions must be captured and contained for discharge through a control device.

# 5. Procedure
5.1 Determine the equivalent diameters of the NDO's and determine the distances from each VOC emitting point to all NDO's. Determine the equivalent diameter of each exhaust duct or hood and its distance to all NDO's. Calculate the distances in terms of equivalent diameters. The number of equivalent diameters shall be at least 4.
5.2 Measure the total area (A
t
) of the enclosure and the total area (A
N
) of all NDO's of the enclosure. Calculate the NDO to enclosure area ratio (NEAR) as follows:
NEAR = A
N
/A
t
The NEAR must be ≤0.05.
5.3 Measure the volumetric flow rate, corrected to standard conditions, of each gas stream exiting the enclosure through an exhaust duct or hood using EPA Method 2. In some cases (
e.g.,
when the building is the enclosure), it may be necessary to measure the volumetric flow rate, corrected to standard conditions, of each gas stream entering the enclosure through a forced makeup air duct using Method 2. Calculate FV using the following equation:
FV=[Q
O
−Q
I
]/A
N
Where:
Q
O
= the sum of the volumetric flow from all gas streams exiting the enclosure through an exhaust duct or hood.
Q
I
= the sum of the volumetric flow from all gas streams into the enclosure through a forced makeup air duct; zero, if there is no forced makeup air into the enclosure.

= total area of all NDO's in enclosure.
The FV shall be at least 3,600 m/hr (200 fpm).
5.4 Verify that the direction of air flow through all NDO's is inward. Use streamers, smoke tubes, tracer gases, etc. Strips of plastic wrapping film have been found to be effective. Monitor the direction of air flow at intervals of at least 10 minutes for at least 1 hour.

# 6. Quality Assurance
6.1 The success of this protocol lies in designing the TTE to simulate the conditions that exist without the TTE, i.e., the effect of the TTE on the normal flow patterns around the affected facility or the amount of fugitive VOC emissions should be minimal. The TTE must enclose the application stations, coating reservoirs, and all areas from the application station to the oven. The oven does not have to be enclosed if it is under negative pressure. The NDO's of the temporary enclosure and a fugitive exhaust fan must be properly sized and placed.
6.2 Estimate the ventilation rate of the TTE that best simulates the conditions that exist without the TTE, i.e., the effect of the TTE on the normal flow patterns around the affected facility or the amount of fugitive
VOC emissions should be minimal. Figure 1 may be used as an aid. Measure the concentration (C
G
) and flow rate (Q
G
) of the captured gas stream, specify a safe concentration (C
F
) for the fugitive gas stream, estimate the CE, and then use the plot in Figure 1 to determine the volumetric flowrate of the fugitive gas stream (Q
F
). A fugitive VOC emission exhaust fan that has a variable flow control is desirable.
6.2.1 Monitor the concentration of VOC into the capture device without the TTE. To minimize the effect of temporal variation on the captured emissions, the baseline measurement should be made over as long a time period as practical. However, the process conditions must be the same for the measurement in section 6.2.3 as they are for this baseline measurement. This may require short measuring times for this quality control check before and after the construction of the TTE.
6.2.2 After the TTE is constructed, monitor the VOC concentration inside the TTE. This concentration shall continue to increase and must not exceed the safe level according to OSHA requirements for permissible exposure limits. An increase in VOC concentration indicates poor TTE design or poor capture efficiency.
6.2.3 Monitor the concentration of VOC into the capture device with the TTE. To limit the effect of the TTE on the process, the VOC concentration with and without the TTE must be within ±10 percent. If the measurements do not agree, adjust the ventilation rate from the TTE until they agree within 10 percent.

§ 52.743
Continuous monitoring.
(a) Alternative monitoring requirements established under Section 201.402 of Title 35, IAC must be either: Incorporated into a federally enforceable operating permit or construction permit or submitted to USEPA for approval as
a revision to the Illinois State Implementation Plan (SIP). Illinois shall set forth alternative emissions monitoring and reporting requirements to satisfy the intent of 40 CFR part 51, appendix P whenever Illinois exempts any source subject to Section 201.401 from installing continuous emission monitoring systems. Illinois may exempt a source if the source cannot install a continuous emission monitoring system because of physical plant limitations or extreme economic reasons, according to the criteria of Section 201.402.
(b) As codified at 40 CFR 52.737 (USEPA's approval of the Illinois operating permit program for the purpose of issuing federally enforceable construction and operating permits), USEPA reserves the right to deem an operating permit not federally enforceable. Such a determination will be made according to appropriate procedures including operating permit requirements promulgated at 54 FR 27274 (June 28, 1989) and will be based upon either; the permit, permit approval procedures or state or local permit requirements which do not conform with the operating permit program requirements or the requirements of USEPA's underlying regulations. Among other things, underlying requirements include 40 CFR 51.214 and part 51, appendix P and Illinois' approved SIP, 40 CFR part 52. Should USEPA deem an operating or construction permit containing alternative monitoring requirements not federally enforceable, the underlying continuous monitoring requirements at Section 201.401 of the State rule would be the Federal requirements contained in the SIP to which the source would be subject. This interpretation of the impact of an operating permit deemed not federally enforceable by USEPA on a source to which it was issued was acknowledged by the State in a March 3, 1993, letter from Bharat Mathur, Chief, Bureau of Air, Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, to Stephen Rothblatt, Chief, Regulation Development Branch, Region 5, USEPA.

(105) On February 7, 1994, the State submitted revisions intended to create a permit program for small sources. The purpose of these revisions is to lessen the permitting burden on small sources and the permitting authority by reducing the frequency and/or the requirement of operating permit renewal for sources emitting a total of less than 25 tons per year of regulated air pollutants. A permit obtained through these procedures is intended to continue as a legally binding State document until the source modifies its operations, withdraws its permit or becomes subject to a new applicable requirement. At that time, the State will determine whether the small source procedures continue to be appropriate and issue a revised small source permit or direct the source in following the correct permit procedures. Since small source permits are not subject to a public comment period or review by USEPA, they are not federally enforceable and cannot be used to limit sources' potential to emit and thereby exempt them from the requirements of the title v operating permit program.
