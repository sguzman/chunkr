# Explanation
The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
Title 1 through Title 16
as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27
as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41
as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50
as of October 1
The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.

# LEGAL STATUS
The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

# HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, April 1, 2025), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

# EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.

# OMB CONTROL NUMBERS
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request.
Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.

# PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.

# “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.

# INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
What is incorporation by reference?
Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
What is a proper incorporation by reference?
The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
(b) The matter incorporated is adequately summarized in the preamble of the final rule and is available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?
If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or email fr.inspection@nara.gov.

# CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES
A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR
Index and Finding Aids.
This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.
An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

# REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

# GAIN OR LOSS ON DISPOSITION OF PROPERTY

# Determination of Amount of and Recognition of Gain or Loss
§ 1.1001-1
Computation of gain or loss.
(a)
General rule.
Except as otherwise provided in subtitle A of the Code, the gain or loss realized from the conversion of property into cash, or from the exchange of property for other property differing materially either in kind or in extent, is treated as income or as loss sustained. The amount realized from a sale or other disposition of property is the sum of any money received plus the fair market value of any property (other than money) received. The fair market value of property is a question of fact, but only in rare and extraordinary cases will property be considered to have no fair market value. The general method of computing such gain or loss is prescribed by section 1001 (a) through (d) which contemplates that from the amount realized upon the sale or exchange there shall be withdrawn a sum sufficient to restore the adjusted basis prescribed by section 1011 and the regulations thereunder (i.e., the cost or other basis adjusted for receipts, expenditures, losses, allowances, and other items chargeable against and applicable to such cost or other basis). The amount which remains after the adjusted basis has been restored to the taxpayer constitutes the realized gain. If the amount realized upon the sale or exchange is insufficient to restore to the
taxpayer the adjusted basis of the property, a loss is sustained to the extent of the difference between such adjusted basis and the amount realized. The basis may be different depending upon whether gain or loss is being computed. For example, see section 1015(a) and the regulations thereunder. Section 1001(e) and paragraph (f) of this section prescribe the method of computing gain or loss upon the sale or other disposition of a term interest in property the adjusted basis (or a portion) of which is determined pursuant, or by reference, to section 1014 (relating to the basis of property acquired from a decedent), section 1015 (relating to the basis of property acquired by gift or by a transfer in trust), or section 1022 (relating to the basis of property acquired from certain decedents who died in 2010). For rules determining the amount realized for purposes of computing the gain or loss upon the sale, exchange, or other disposition of digital assets, as defined in § 1.6045-1(a)(19), other than a digital asset not required to be reported as a digital asset pursuant to § 1.6045-1(c)(8)(ii), (iii), or (iv),
see
§ 1.1001-7.
(b)
Real estate taxes as amounts received.
(1) Section 1001(b) and section 1012 state rules applicable in making an adjustment upon a sale of real property with respect to the real property taxes apportioned between seller and purchaser under section 164(d). Thus, if the seller pays (or agrees to pay) real property taxes attributable to the real property tax year in which the sale occurs, he shall not take into account, in determining the amount realized from the sale under section 1001(b), any amount received as reimbursement for taxes which are treated under section 164(d) as imposed upon the purchaser. Similarly, in computing the cost of the property under section 1012, the purchaser shall not take into account any amount paid to the seller as reimbursement for real property taxes which are treated under section 164(d) as imposed upon the purchaser. These rules apply whether or not the contract of sale calls for the purchaser to reimburse the seller for such real property taxes paid or to be paid by the seller.
(2) On the other hand, if the purchaser pays (or is to pay) an amount representing real property taxes which are treated under section 164(d) as imposed upon the seller, that amount shall be taken into account both in determining the amount realized from the sale under section 1001(b) and in computing the cost of the property under section 1012. It is immaterial whether or not the contract of sale specifies that the sale price has been reduced by, or is in any way intended to reflect, the taxes allocable to the seller. See also paragraph (b) of § 1.1012-1.
(3) Subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall not apply to a seller who, in a taxable year prior to the taxable year of sale, pays an amount representing real property taxes which are treated under section 164(d) as imposed on the purchaser, if such seller has elected to capitalize such amount in accordance with section 266 and the regulations thereunder (relating to election to capitalize certain carrying charges and taxes).
(4) The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Assume that the contract price on the sale of a parcel of real estate is $50,000 and that real property taxes thereon in the amount of $1,000 for the real property tax year in which occurred the date of sale were previously paid by the seller. Assume further that $750 of the taxes are treated under section 164(d) as imposed upon the purchaser and that he reimburses the seller in that amount in addition to the contract price. The amount realized by the seller is $50,000. Similarly, $50,000 is the purchaser's cost. If, in this example, the purchaser made no payment other than the contract price of $50,000, the amount realized by the seller would be $49,250, since the sales price would be deemed to include $750 paid to the seller in reimbursement for real property taxes imposed upon the purchaser. Similarly, $49,250 would be the purchaser's cost.

# Example 2.
Assume that the purchaser in example (1), above, paid all of the real property taxes. Assume further that $250 of the taxes are treated under section 164(d) as imposed upon the seller. The amount realized by the seller is $50,250. Similarly, $50,250 is the purchaser's cost, regardless of the taxable year in which the purchaser makes actual payment of the taxes.

# Example 3.
Assume that the seller described in the first part of example (1), above, paid the real property taxes of $1,000 in the taxable year prior to the taxable year of sale
and elected under section 266 to capitalize the $1,000 of taxes. In such a case, the amount realized is $50,750. Moreover, regardless of whether the seller elected to capitalize the real property taxes, the purchaser in that case could elect under section 266 to capitalize the $750 of taxes treated under section 164(d) as imposed upon him, in which case his adjusted basis would be $50,750 (cost of $50,000 plus capitalized taxes of $570).
(c)
Other rules.
(1) Even though property is not sold or otherwise disposed of, gain is realized if the sum of all the amounts received which are required by section 1016 and other applicable provisions of subtitle A of the Code to be applied against the basis of the property exceeds such basis. Except as otherwise provided in section 301(c)(3)(B) with respect to distributions out of increase in value of property accrued prior to March 1, 1913, such gain is includible in gross income under section 61 as “income from whatever source derived”. On the other hand, a loss is not ordinarily sustained prior to the sale or other disposition of the property, for the reason that until such sale or other disposition occurs there remains the possibility that the taxpayer may recover or recoup the adjusted basis of the property. Until some identifiable event fixes the actual sustaining of a loss and the amount thereof, it is not taken into account.
(2) The provisions of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example:
A, an individual on a calendar year basis, purchased certain shares of stock subsequent to February 28, 1913, for $10,000. On January 1, 1954, A's adjusted basis for the stock had been reduced to $1,000 by reason of receipts and distributions described in sections 1016(a)(1) and 1016(a)(4). He received in 1954 a further distribution of $5,000, being a distribution covered by section 1016(a)(4), other than a distribution out of increase of value of property accrued prior to March 1, 1913. This distribution applied against the adjusted basis as required by section 1016(a)(4) exceeds that basis by $4,000. The $4,000 excess is a gain realized by A in 1954 and is includible in gross income in his return for that calendar year. In computing gain from the stock, as in adjusting basis, no distinction is made between items of receipts or distributions described in section 1016. If A sells the stock in 1955 for $5,000, he realizes in 1955 a gain of $5,000, since the adjusted basis of the stock for the purpose of computing gain or loss from the sale is zero.
(d)
Installment sales.
In the case of property sold on the installment plan, special rules for the taxation of the gain are prescribed in section 453.
(e)
Transfers in part a sale and in part a gift.
(1) Where a transfer of property is in part a sale and in part a gift, the transferor has a gain to the extent that the amount realized by him exceeds his adjusted basis in the property. However, no loss is sustained on such a transfer if the amount realized is less than the adjusted basis. For the determination of basis of property in the hands of the transferee, see § 1.1015-4. For the allocation of the adjusted basis of property in the case of a bargain sale to a charitable organization, see § 1.1011-2.
(2)
Examples.
The provisions of subparagraph (1) may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
A transfers property to his son for $60,000. Such property in the hands of A has an adjusted basis of $30,000 (and a fair market value of $90,000). A's gain is $30,000, the excess of $60,000, the amount realized, over the adjusted basis, $30,000. He has made a gift of $30,000, the excess of $90,000, the fair market value, over the amount realized, $60,000.

# Example 2.
A transfers property to his son for $30,000. Such property in the hands of A has an adjusted basis of $60,000 (and a fair market value of $90,000). A has no gain or loss, and has made a gift of $60,000, the excess of $90,000, the fair market value, over the amount realized, $30,000.

# Example 3.
A transfers property to his son for $30,000. Such property in A's hands has an adjusted basis of $30,000 (and a fair market value of $60,000). A has no gain and has made a gift of $30,000, the excess of $60,000, the fair market value, over the amount realized, $30,000.

# Example 4.
A transfers property to his son for $30,000. Such property in A's hands has an adjusted basis of $90,000 (and a fair market value of $60,000). A has sustained no loss, and has made a gift of $30,000, the excess of $60,000, the fair market value, over the amount realized, $30,000.
(f)
Sale or other disposition of a term interest in property
—(1)
General rule.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (f)(3) of this section, for purposes of determining gain or loss from the sale or other disposition after October 9, 1969, of a term interest in property (as defined in paragraph (f)(2) of this section), a taxpayer shall not take into account that portion of the adjusted
basis of such interest that is determined pursuant, or by reference, to section 1014 (relating to the basis of property acquired from a decedent), section 1015 (relating to the basis of property acquired by gift or by a transfer in trust), or section 1022 (relating to the basis of property acquired from certain decedents who died in 2010) to the extent that such adjusted basis is a portion of the adjusted uniform basis of the entire property (as defined in § 1.1014-5). Where a term interest in property is transferred to a corporation in connection with a transaction to which section 351 applies and the adjusted basis of the term interest:
(i) Is determined pursuant to sections 1014, 1015, or 1022; and
(ii) Is also a portion of the adjusted uniform basis of the entire property, a subsequent sale or other disposition of such term interest by the corporation will be subject to the provisions of section 1001(e) and this paragraph (f) to the extent that the basis of the term interest so sold or otherwise disposed of is determined by reference to its basis in the hands of the transferor as provided by section 362(a). See paragraph (f)(2) of this section for rules relating to the characterization of stock received by the transferor of a term interest in property in connection with a transaction to which section 351 applies. That portion of the adjusted uniform basis of the entire property that is assignable to such interest at the time of its sale or other disposition shall be determined under the rules provided in § 1.1014-5. Thus, gain or loss realized from a sale or other disposition of a term interest in property shall be determined by comparing the amount of the proceeds of such sale with that part of the adjusted basis of such interest that is not a portion of the adjusted uniform basis of the entire property.
(2)
Term interest defined.
For purposes of section 1001(e) and this paragraph, a
term interest in property
means—
(i) A life interest in property,
(ii) An interest in property for a term of years, or
(iii) An income interest in a trust.
Generally, subdivisions (i), (ii), and (iii) refer to an interest, present or future, in the income from property or the right to use property which will terminate or fail on the lapse of time, on the occurrence of an event or contingency, or on the failure of an event or contingency to occur. Such divisions do not refer to remainder or reversionary interests in the property itself or other interests in the property which will ripen into ownership of the entire property upon termination or failure of a preceding term interest. A
term interest in property
also includes any property received upon a sale or other disposition of a life interest in property, an interest in property for a term of years, or an income interest in a trust by the original holder of such interest, but only to the extent that the adjusted basis of the property received is determined by reference to the adjusted basis of the term interest so transferred.
(3)
Exception.
Paragraph (1) of section 1001(e) and subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall not apply to a sale or other disposition of a term interest in property as a part of a single transaction in which the entire interest in the property is transferred to a third person or to two or more other persons, including persons who acquire such entire interest as joint tenants, tenants by the entirety, or tenants in common. See § 1.1014-5 for computation of gain or loss upon such a sale or other disposition where the property has been acquired from a decedent or by gift or transfer in trust.
(4)
Illustrations.
For examples illustrating the application of this paragraph, see paragraph (d) of § 1.1014-5.
(g)
Debt instruments issued in exchange for property
—(1)
In general.
If a debt instrument is issued in exchange for property, the amount realized attributable to the debt instrument is the issue price of the debt instrument as determined under § 1.1273-2 or § 1.1274-2, whichever is applicable. If, however, the issue price of the debt instrument is determined under section 1273(b)(4), the amount realized attributable to the debt instrument is its stated principal amount reduced by any unstated interest (as determined under section 483).
(2)
Certain debt instruments that provide for contingent payments
—(i)
In general.
Paragraph (g)(1) of this section does not apply to a debt instrument
subject to either § 1.483-4 or § 1.1275-4(c) (certain contingent payment debt instruments issued for nonpublicly traded property).
(ii)
Special rule to determine amount realized.
If a debt instrument subject to § 1.1275-4(c) is issued in exchange for property, and the income from the exchange is not reported under the installment method of section 453, the amount realized attributable to the debt instrument is the issue price of the debt instrument as determined under § 1.1274-2(g), increased by the fair market value of the contingent payments payable on the debt instrument. If a debt instrument subject to § 1.483-4 is issued in exchange for property, and the income from the exchange is not reported under the installment method of section 453, the amount realized attributable to the debt instrument is its stated principal amount, reduced by any unstated interest (as determined under section 483), and increased by the fair market value of the contingent payments payable on the debt instrument. This paragraph (g)(2)(ii), however, does not apply to a debt instrument if the fair market value of the contingent payments is not reasonably ascertainable. Only in rare and extraordinary cases will the fair market value of the contingent payments be treated as not reasonably ascertainable.
(3)
Coordination with section 453.
If a debt instrument is issued in exchange for property, and the income from the exchange is not reported under the installment method of section 453, this paragraph (g) applies rather than § 15a.453-1(d)(2) to determine the taxpayer's amount realized attributable to the debt instrument.
(4)
Effective date.
This paragraph (g) applies to sales or exchanges that occur on or after August 13, 1996.
(h)
Severances of trusts
—(1)
In general.
The severance of a trust (including without limitation a severance that meets the requirements of § 26.2642-6 or of § 26.2654-1(b) of this chapter) is not an exchange of property for other property differing materially either in kind or in extent if—
(i) An applicable state statute or the governing instrument authorizes or directs the trustee to sever the trust; and
(ii) Any non-pro rata funding of the separate trusts resulting from the severance (including non-pro rata funding as described in § 26.2642-6(d)(4) or § 26.2654-1(b)(1)(ii)(C) of this chapter), whether mandatory or in the discretion of the trustee, is authorized by an applicable state statute or the governing instrument.
(2)
Effective/applicability date.
This paragraph (h) applies to severances occurring on or after August 2, 2007. Taxpayers may apply this paragraph (h) to severances occurring on or after August 24, 2004, and before August 2, 2007.
(i)
Effective/applicability date.
Except as provided in paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section, this section applies on and after January 19, 2017. For rules before January 19, 2017, see § 1.1001-1 as contained in 26 CFR part 1 revised as of April 1, 2016.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11910, Nov. 26, 1960, as amended by T.D. 7142, 36 FR 18950, Sept. 24, 1971; T.D. 7207, 37 FR 20797, Oct. 5, 1972; T.D. 7213, 37 FR 21992, Oct. 18, 1972; T.D. 8517, 59 FR 4807, Feb. 2, 1994; T.D. 8674, 61 FR 30139, June 14, 1996; T.D. 9348, 72 FR 42293, Aug. 2, 2007; T.D. 9729, 80 FR 48250, Aug. 12, 2015; T.D. 9811, 82 FR 6240, Jan. 19, 2017; T.D. 10000, 89 FR 56543, July 9, 2024]
§ 1.1001-2
Discharge of liabilities.
(a)
Inclusion in amount realized
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (a) (2) and (3) of this section, the amount realized from a sale or other disposition of property includes the amount of liabilities from which the transferor is discharged as a result of the sale or disposition.
(2)
Discharge of indebtedness.
The amount realized on a sale or other disposition of property that secures a recourse liability does not include amounts that are (or would be if realized and recognized) income from the discharge of indebtedness under section 61(a)(12). For situations where amounts arising from the discharge of indebtedness are not realized and recognized, see section 108 and § 1.61-12(b)(1).
(3)
Liability incurred on acquisition.
In the case of a liability incurred by reason of the acquisition of the property, this section does not apply to the extent that such liability was not taken into account in determining the transferor's basis for such property.
(4)
Special rules.
For purposes of this section—
(i) The sale or other disposition of property that secures a nonrecourse liability discharges the transferor from the liability;
(ii) The sale or other disposition of property that secures a recourse liability discharges the transferor from the liability if another person agrees to pay the liability (whether or not the transferor is in fact released from liability);
(iii) A disposition of property includes a gift of the property or a transfer of the property in satisfaction of liabilities to which it is subject;
(iv) Contributions and distributions of property between a partner and a partnership are not sales or other dispositions of property; and
(v) The liabilities from which a transferor is discharged as a result of the sale or disposition of a partnership interest include the transferor's share of the liabilities of the partnership.
(b)
Effect of fair market value of security.
The fair market value of the security at the time of sale or disposition is not relevant for purposes of determining under paragraph (a) of this section the amount of liabilities from which the taxpayer is discharged or treated as discharged. Thus, the fact that the fair market value of the property is less than the amount of the liabilities it secures does not prevent the full amount of those liabilities from being treated as money received from the sale or other disposition of the property. However, see paragraph (a)(2) of this section for a rule relating to certain income from discharge of indebtedness.
(c)
Examples.
The provisions of this section may be illustrated by the following examples. In each example assume the taxpayer uses the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting, makes a return on the basis of the calendar year, and sells or disposes of all property which is security for a given liability.

# Example 1.
In 1976 A purchases an asset for $10,000. A pays the seller $1,000 in cash and signs a note payable to the seller for $9,000. A is personally liable for repayment with the seller having full recourse in the event of default. In addition, the asset which was purchased is pledged as security. During the years 1976 and 1977, A takes depreciation deductions on the asset in the amount of $3,100. During this same time period A reduces the outstanding principal on the note to $7,600. At the beginning of 1978 A sells the asset. The buyer pays A $1,600 in cash and assumes personal liability for the $7,600 outstanding liability. A becomes secondarily liable for repayment of the liability. A's amount realized is $9,200 ($1,600 + $7,600). Since A's adjusted basis in the asset is $6,900 ($10,000 − $3,100) A realizes a gain of $2,300 ($9,200 − $6,900).

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in example (1) except that A is not personally liable on the $9,000 note given to the seller and in the event of default the seller's only recourse is to the asset. In addition, on the sale of the asset by A, the purchaser takes the asset subject to the liability. Nevertheless, A's amount realized is $9,200 and A's gain realized is $2,300 on the sale.

# Example 3.
In 1975 L becomes a limited partner in partnership GL. L contributes $10,000 in cash to GL and L's distributive share of partnership income and loss is 10 percent. L is not entitled to receive any guaranteed payments. In 1978 M purchases L's entire interest in partnership GL. At the time of the sale L's adjusted basis in the partnership interest is $20,000. At that time L's proportionate share of liabilities, of which no partner has assumed personal liability, is $15,000. M pays $10,000 in cash for L's interest in the partnership. Under section 752(d) and this section, L's share of partnership liabilities, $15,000, is treated as money received. Accordingly, L's amount realized on the sale of the partnership interest is $25,000 ($10,000 + $15,000). L's gain realized on the sale is $5,000 ($25,000 − $20,000).

# Example 4.
In 1976 B becomes a limited partner in partnership BG. In 1978 B contributes B's entire interest in BG to a charitable organization described in section 170(c). At the time of the contribution all of the partnership liabilities are liabilities for which neither B nor G has assumed any personal liability and B's proportionate share of which is $9,000. The charitable organization does not pay any cash or other property to B, but takes the partnership interest subject to the $9,000 of liabilities. Assume that the contribution is treated as a bargain sale to a charitable organization and that under section 1011(b) $3,000 is determined to be the portion of B's basis in the partnership interest allocable to the sale. Under section 752(d) and this section, the $9,000 of liabilities is treated by B as money received, thereby making B's amount realized $9,000. B's gain realized is $6,000 ($9,000 − $3,000).

# Example 5.
In 1975 C, an individual, creates T, an irrevocable trust. Due to certain powers expressly retained by C, T is a “grantor trust” for purposes of subpart E of part 1 of subchapter J of the code and therefore C is
treated as the owner of the entire trust. T purchases an interest in P, a partnership. C, as owner of T, deducts the distributive share of partnership losses attributable to the partnership interest held by T. In 1978, when the adjusted basis of the partnership interest held by T is $1,200, C renounces the powers previously and expressly retained that initially resulted in T being classified as a grantor trust. Consequently, T ceases to be a grantor trust and C is no longer considered to be the owner of the trust. At the time of the renunciation all of P's liabilities are liabilities on which none of the partners have assumed any personal liability and the proportionate share of which of the interest held by T is $11,000. Since prior to the renunciation C was the owner of the entire trust, C was considered the owner of all the trust property for Federal income tax purposes, including the partnership interest. Since C was considered to be the owner of the partnership interest, C not T, was considered to be the partner in P during the time T was a “grantor trust”. However, at the time C renounced the powers that gave rise to T's classification as a grantor trust, T no longer qualified as a grantor trust with the result that C was no longer considered to be the owner of the trust and trust property for Federal income tax purposes. Consequently, at that time, C is considered to have transferred ownership of the interest in P to T, now a separate taxable entity, independent of its grantor C. On the transfer, C's share of partnership liabilities ($11,000) is treated as money received. Accordingly, C's amount realized is $11,000 and C's gain realized is $9,800 ($11,000 − $1,200).

# Example 6.
In 1977 D purchases an asset for $7,500. D pays the seller $1,500 in cash and signs a note payable to the seller for $6,000. D is not personally liable for repayment but pledges as security the newly purchased asset. In the event of default, the seller's only recourse is to the asset. During the years 1977 and 1978 D takes depreciation deductions on the asset totaling $4,200 thereby reducing D's basis in the asset to $3,300 ($7,500 − $4,200). In 1979 D transfers the asset to a trust which is not a “grantor trust” for purposes of subpart E of part 1 of subchapter J of the Code. Therefore D is not treated as the owner of the trust. The trust takes the asset subject to the liability and in addition pays D $750 in cash. Prior to the transfer D had reduced the amount outstanding on the liability to $4,700. D's amount realized on the transfer is $5,450 ($4,700 + $750). Since D's adjusted basis is $3,300, D's gain realized is $2,150 ($5,450 − $3,300).

# Example 7.
In 1974 E purchases a herd of cattle for breeding purposes. The purchase price is $20,000 consisting of $1,000 cash and a $19,000 note. E is not personally liable for repayment of the liability and the seller's only recourse in the event of default is to the herd of cattle. In 1977 E transfers the herd back to the original seller thereby satisfying the indebtedness pursuant to a provision in the original sales agreement. At the time of the transfer the fair market value of the herd is $15,000 and the remaining principal balance on the note is $19,000. At that time E's adjusted basis in the herd is $16,500 due to a deductible loss incurred when a portion of the herd died as a result of disease. As a result of the indebtedness being satisfied, E's amount realized is $19,000 notwithstanding the fact that the fair market value of the herd was less than $19,000. E's realized gain is $2,500 ($19,000 − $16,500).

# Example 8.
In 1980, F transfers to a creditor an asset with a fair market value of $6,000 and the creditor discharges $7,500 of indebtedness for which F is personally liable. The amount realized on the disposition of the asset is its fair market value ($6,000). In addition, F has income from the discharge of indebtedness of $1,500 ($7,500 − $6,000).

§ 1.1001-3
Modifications of debt instruments.
(a)
Scope
—(1)
In general.
This section provides rules for determining whether a modification of the terms of a debt instrument results in an exchange for purposes of § 1.1001-1(a). This section applies to any modification of a debt instrument, regardless of the form of the modification. For example, this section applies to an exchange of a new instrument for an existing debt instrument, or to an amendment of an existing debt instrument. This section also applies to a modification of a debt instrument that the issuer and holder accomplish indirectly through one or more transactions with third parties. This section, however, does not apply to exchanges of debt instruments between holders.
(2)
Tax-exempt bonds.
For special rules governing whether tax-exempt bonds are retired for purposes of sections 103 and 141 through 150 of the Internal Revenue Code,
see
§ 1.150-3.
(b)
General rule.
For purposes of § 1.1001-1(a), a significant modification of a debt instrument, within the meaning of this section, results in an exchange of the original debt instrument for a modified instrument that differs materially either in kind or in extent. A modification that is not a significant modification is not an exchange for purposes of § 1.1001-1(a). Paragraphs (c)
and (d) of this section define the term
modification
and contain examples illustrating the application of the rule. Paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section provide rules for determining when a modification is a significant modification. Paragraph (f) of this section also provides rules for determining whether the modified instrument received in an exchange will be classified as an instrument or property right that is not debt for federal income tax purposes. Paragraph (g) of this section contains examples illustrating the application of the rules in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section.
(c)
Modification defined
—(1)
In general
—(i)
Alteration of terms.
A
modification
means any alteration, including any deletion or addition, in whole or in part, of a legal right or obligation of the issuer or a holder of a debt instrument, whether the alteration is evidenced by an express agreement (oral or written), conduct of the parties, or otherwise.
(ii)
Alterations occurring by operation of the terms of a debt instrument.
Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, an alteration of a legal right or obligation that occurs by operation of the terms of a debt instrument is not a modification. An alteration that occurs by operation of the terms may occur automatically (for example, an annual resetting of the interest rate based on the value of an index or a specified increase in the interest rate if the value of the collateral declines from a specified level) or may occur as a result of the exercise of an option provided to an issuer or a holder to change a term of a debt instrument.
(2)
Exceptions.
The alterations described in this paragraph (c)(2) are modifications, even if the alterations occur by operation of the terms of a debt instrument.
(i)
Change in obligor or nature of instrument.
An alteration that results in the substitution of a new obligor, the addition or deletion of a co-obligor, or a change (in whole or in part) in the recourse nature of the instrument (from recourse to nonrecourse or from nonrecourse to recourse) is a modification.
(ii)
Property that is not debt.
An alteration that results in an instrument or property right that is not debt for Federal income tax purposes is a modification unless the alteration occurs pursuant to a holder's option under the terms of the instrument to convert the instrument into equity of the issuer (notwithstanding paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section). The rules of paragraph (f)(7) of this section apply to determine whether an alteration or modification results in an instrument or property right that is not debt.
(iii)
Certain alterations resulting from the exercise of an option.
An alteration that results from the exercise of an option provided to an issuer or a holder to change a term of a debt instrument is a modification unless—
(A) The option is unilateral (as defined in paragraph (c)(3) of this section); and
(B) In the case of an option exercisable by a holder, the exercise of the option does not result in (or, in the case of a variable or contingent payment, is not reasonably expected to result in) a deferral of, or a reduction in, any scheduled payment of interest or principal.
(3)
Unilateral option.
For purposes of this section, an option is unilateral only if, under the terms of an instrument or under applicable law—
(i) There does not exist at the time the option is exercised, or as a result of the exercise, a right of the other party to alter or terminate the instrument or put the instrument to a person who is related (within the meaning of section 267(b) or section 707(b)(1)) to the issuer;
(ii) The exercise of the option does not require the consent or approval of—
(A) The other party;
(B) A person who is related to that party (within the meaning of section 267(b) or section 707(b)(1)), whether or not that person is a party to the instrument; or
(C) A court or arbitrator; and
(iii) The exercise of the option does not require consideration (other than incidental costs and expenses relating to the exercise of the option), unless, on the issue date of the instrument, the consideration is a de minimis amount, a specified amount, or an amount that is based on a formula that uses objective financial information (as defined in § 1.446-3(c)(4)(ii)).
(4)
Failure to perform
—(i)
In general.
The failure of an issuer to perform its obligations under a debt instrument is not itself an alteration of a legal right or obligation and is not a modification.
(ii)
Holder's temporary forbearance.
Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1) of this section, absent a written or oral agreement to alter other terms of the debt instrument, an agreement by the holder to stay collection or temporarily waive an acceleration clause or similar default right (including such a waiver following the exercise of a right to demand payment in full) is not a modification unless and until the forbearance remains in effect for a period that exceeds—
(A) Two years following the issuer's initial failure to perform; and
(B) Any additional period during which the parties conduct good faith negotiations or during which the issuer is in a title 11 or similar case (as defined in section 368(a)(3)(A)).
(5)
Failure to exercise an option.
If a party to a debt instrument has an option to change a term of an instrument, the failure of the party to exercise that option is not a modification.
(6)
Time of modification
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in this paragraph (c)(6), an agreement to change a term of a debt instrument is a modification at the time the issuer and holder enter into the agreement, even if the change in the term is not immediately effective.
(ii)
Closing conditions.
If the parties condition a change in a term of a debt instrument on reasonable closing conditions (for example, shareholder, regulatory, or senior creditor approval, or additional financing), a modification occurs on the closing date of the agreement. Thus, if the reasonable closing conditions do not occur so that the change in the term does not become effective, a modification does not occur.
(iii)
Bankruptcy proceedings.
If a change in a term of a debt instrument occurs pursuant to a plan of reorganization in a title 11 or similar case (within the meaning of section 368(a)(3)(A)), a modification occurs upon the effective date of the plan. Thus, unless the plan becomes effective, a modification does not occur.
(d)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section:

# Example 1. Reset bond.
A bond provides for the interest rate to be reset every 49 days through an auction by a remarketing agent. The reset of the interest rate occurs by operation of the terms of the bond and is not an alteration described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Thus, the reset of the interest rate is not a modification.

# Example 2. Obligation to maintain collateral.
The original terms of a bond provide that the bond must be secured by a certain type of collateral having a specified value. The terms also require the issuer to substitute collateral if the value of the original collateral decreases. Any substitution of collateral that is required to maintain the value of the collateral occurs by operation of the terms of the bond and is not an alteration described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Thus, such a substitution of collateral is not a modification.

# Example 3. Alteration contingent on an act of a party.
The original terms of a bond provide that the interest rate is 9 percent. The terms also provide that, if the issuer files an effective registration statement covering the bonds with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the interest rate will decrease to 8 percent. If the issuer registers the bond, the resulting decrease in the interest rate occurs by operation of the terms of the bond and is not an alteration described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Thus, such a decrease in the interest rate is not a modification.

# Example 4. Substitution of a new obligor occurring by operation of the terms of the debt instrument.
Under the original terms of a bond issued by a corporation, an acquirer of substantially all of the corporation's assets may assume the corporation's obligations under the bond. Substantially all of the corporation's assets are acquired by another corporation and the acquiring corporation becomes the new obligor on the bond. Under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, the substitution of a new obligor, even though it occurs by operation of the terms of the bond, is a modification.

# Example 5. Defeasance with release of covenants.
(i) A corporation issues a 30-year, recourse bond. Under the terms of the bond, the corporation may secure a release of the financial and restrictive covenants by placing in trust government securities as collateral that will provide interest and principal payments sufficient to satisfy all scheduled payments on the bond. The corporation remains obligated for all payments, including the contribution of additional securities to the trust if necessary to provide sufficient amounts to satisfy the payment obligations. Under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the
option to defease the bond is a unilateral option.
(ii) The alterations occur by operation of the terms of the debt instrument and are not described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Thus, such a release of the covenants is not a modification.

# Example 6. Legal defeasance.
Under the terms of a recourse bond, the issuer may secure a release of the financial and restrictive covenants by placing in trust government securities that will provide interest and principal payments sufficient to satisfy all scheduled payments on the bond. Upon the creation of the trust, the issuer is released from any recourse liability on the bond and has no obligation to contribute additional securities to the trust if the trust funds are not sufficient to satisfy the scheduled payments on the bond. The release of the issuer is an alteration described in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, and thus is a modification.

# Example 7. Exercise of an option by a holder that reduces amounts payable.
(i) A financial institution holds a residential mortgage. Under the original terms of the mortgage, the financial institution has an option to decrease the interest rate. The financial institution anticipates that, if market interest rates decline, it may exercise this option in lieu of the mortgagor refinancing with another lender.
(ii) The financial institution exercises the option to reduce the interest rate. The exercise of the option results in a reduction in scheduled payments and is an alteration described in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section. Thus, the change in interest rate is a modification.

# Example 8. Conversion of adjustable rate to fixed rate mortgage.
(i) The original terms of a mortgage provide for a variable interest rate, reset annually based on the value of an objective index. Under the terms of the mortgage, the mortgagor may, upon the payment of a fee equal to a specified percentage of the outstanding principal amount of the mortgage, convert to a fixed rate of interest as determined based on the value of a second objective index. The exercise of the option does not require the consent or approval of any person or create a right of the holder to alter the terms of, or to put, the instrument.
(ii) Because the required consideration to exercise the option is a specified amount fixed on the issue date, the exercise of the option is unilateral as defined in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. The conversion to a fixed rate of interest is not an alteration described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Thus, the change in the type of interest rate occurs by operation of the terms of the instrument and is not a modification.

# Example 9. Holder's option to increase interest rate.
(i) A corporation issues an 8-year note to a bank in exchange for cash. Under the terms of the note, the bank has the option to increase the rate of interest by a specified amount if certain covenants in the note are breached. The bank's right to increase the interest rate is a unilateral option as described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
(ii) A covenant in the note is breached. The bank exercises its option to increase the rate of interest. The increase in the rate of interest occurs by operation of the terms of the note and does not result in a deferral or a reduction in the scheduled payments or any other alteration described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Thus, the change in interest rate is not a modification.
(iii)
Applicability date.
This
Example 9
applies to modifications occurring on or after July 6, 2011.

# Example 10. Issuer's right to defer payment of interest.
A corporation issues a 5-year note. Under the terms of the note, interest is payable annually at the rate of 10 percent. The corporation, however, has an option to defer any payment of interest until maturity. For any payments that are deferred, interest will compound at a rate of 12 percent. The exercise of the option, which results in the deferral of payments, does not result from the exercise of an option by the holder. The exercise of the option occurs by operation of the terms of the debt instrument and is not a modification.

# Example 11. Holder's option to grant deferral of payment.
(i) A corporation issues a 10-year note to a bank in exchange for cash. Interest on the note is payable semi-annually. Under the terms of the note, the bank may grant the corporation the right to defer all or part of the interest payments. For any payments that are deferred, interest will compound at a rate 150 basis points greater than the stated rate of interest.
(ii) The corporation encounters financial difficulty and is unable to satisfy its obligations under the note. The bank exercises its option under the note and grants the corporation the right to defer payments. The exercise of the option results in a right of the corporation to defer scheduled payments and, under paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, is not a unilateral option. Thus, the alteration is described in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section and is a modification.

# Example 12. Alteration requiring consent.
The original terms of a bond include a provision that the issuer may extend the maturity of the bond with the consent of the holder. Because any extension pursuant to this term requires the consent of both parties, such an extension does not occur by the exercise of a unilateral option (as defined in paragraph (c)(3) of this section) and is a modification.

# Example 13. Waiver of an acceleration clause.
Under the terms of a bond, if the issuer fails to make a scheduled payment, the full principal amount of the bond is due and payable immediately. Following the issuer's failure
to make a scheduled payment, the holder temporarily waives its right to receive the full principal for a period ending one year from the date of the issuer's default to allow the issuer to obtain additional financial resources. Under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, the temporary waiver in this situation is not a modification. The result would be the same if the terms provided the holder with the right to demand the full principal amount upon the failure of the issuer to make a scheduled payment and, upon such a failure, the holder exercised that right and then waived the right to receive the payment for one year.
(e)
Significant modifications.
Whether the modification of a debt instrument is a significant modification is determined under the rules of this paragraph (e). Paragraph (e)(1) of this section provides a general rule for determining the significance of modifications not otherwise addressed in this paragraph (e). Paragraphs (e) (2) through (6) of this section provide specific rules for determining the significance of certain types of modifications. Paragraph (f) of this section provides rules of application, including rules for modifications that are effective on a deferred basis or upon the occurrence of a contingency.
(1)
General rule.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (e)(2) through (e)(6) of this section, a modification is a significant modification only if, based on all facts and circumstances, the legal rights or obligations that are altered and the degree to which they are altered are economically significant. In making a determination under this paragraph (e)(1), all modifications to the debt instrument (other than modifications subject to paragraphs (e) (2) through (6) of this section) are considered collectively, so that a series of such modifications may be significant when considered together although each modification, if considered alone, would not be significant.
(2)
Change in yield
—(i)
Scope of rule.
This paragraph (e)(2) applies to debt instruments that provide for only fixed payments, debt instruments with alternative payment schedules subject to § 1.1272-1(c), debt instruments that provide for a fixed yield subject to § 1.1272-1(d) (such as certain demand loans), and variable rate debt instruments. Whether a change in the yield of other debt instruments (for example, a contingent payment debt instrument) is a significant modification is determined under paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
(ii)
In general.
A change in the yield of a debt instrument is a significant modification if the yield computed under paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section varies from the annual yield on the unmodified instrument (determined as of the date of the modification) by more than the greater of—
(A)
1/4
of one percent (25 basis points); or
(B) 5 percent of the annual yield of the unmodified instrument (.05 × annual yield).
(iii)
Yield of the modified instrument
—(A)
In general.
The yield computed under this paragraph (e)(2)(iii) is the annual yield of a debt instrument with—
(
1
) An issue price equal to the adjusted issue price of the unmodified instrument on the date of the modification (increased by any accrued but unpaid interest and decreased by any accrued bond issuance premium not yet taken into account, and increased or decreased, respectively, to reflect payments made to the issuer or to the holder as consideration for the modification); and
(
2
) Payments equal to the payments on the modified debt instrument from the date of the modification.
(B)
Prepayment penalty.
For purposes of this paragraph (e)(2)(iii), a commercially reasonable prepayment penalty for a pro rata prepayment (as defined in § 1.1275-2(f)) is not consideration for a modification of a debt instrument and is not taken into account in determining the yield of the modified instrument.
(iv)
Variable rate debt instruments.
For purposes of this paragraph (e)(2), the annual yield of a variable rate debt instrument is the annual yield of the equivalent fixed rate debt instrument (as defined in § 1.1275-5(e)) which is constructed based on the terms of the instrument (either modified or unmodified, whichever is applicable) as of the date of the modification.
(3)
Changes in timing of payments
—(i)
In general.
A modification that changes the timing of payments (including any
resulting change in the amount of payments) due under a debt instrument is a significant modification if it results in the material deferral of scheduled payments. The deferral may occur either through an extension of the final maturity date of an instrument or through a deferral of payments due prior to maturity. The materiality of the deferral depends on all the facts and circumstances, including the length of the deferral, the original term of the instrument, the amounts of the payments that are deferred, and the time period between the modification and the actual deferral of payments.
(ii)
Safe-harbor period.
The deferral of one or more scheduled payments within the safe-harbor period is not a material deferral if the deferred payments are unconditionally payable no later than at the end of the safe-harbor period. The safe-harbor period begins on the original due date of the first scheduled payment that is deferred and extends for a period equal to the lesser of five years or 50 percent of the original term of the instrument. For purposes of this paragraph (e)(3)(ii), the term of an instrument is determined without regard to any option to extend the original maturity and deferrals of de minimis payments are ignored. If the period during which payments are deferred is less than the full safe-harbor period, the unused portion of the period remains a safe-harbor period for any subsequent deferral of payments on the instrument.
(4)
Change in obligor or security
—(i)
Substitution of a new obligor on recourse debt instruments
—(A)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (e)(4)(i) (B), (C), or (D) of this section, the substitution of a new obligor on a recourse debt instrument is a significant modification.
(B)
Section 381(a) transaction.
The substitution of a new obligor is not a significant modification if the acquiring corporation (within the meaning of section 381) becomes the new obligor pursuant to a transaction to which section 381(a) applies, the transaction does not result in a change in payment expectations, and the transaction (other than a reorganization within the meaning of section 368(a)(1)(F)) does not result in a significant alteration.
(C)
Certain asset acquisitions.
The substitution of a new obligor is not a significant modification if the new obligor acquires substantially all of the assets of the original obligor, the transaction does not result in a change in payment expectations, and the transaction does not result in a significant alteration.
(D)
Tax-exempt bonds.
The substitution of a new obligor on a tax-exempt bond is not a significant modification if the new obligor is a related entity to the original obligor as defined in section 168(h)(4)(A) and the collateral securing the instrument continues to include the original collateral.
(E)
Significant alteration.
For purposes of this paragraph (e)(4), a significant alteration is an alteration that would be a significant modification but for the fact that the alteration occurs by operation of the terms of the instrument.
(F)
Section 338 election.
For purposes of this section, an election under section 338 following a qualified stock purchase of an issuer's stock does not result in the substitution of a new obligor.
(G)
Bankruptcy proceedings.
For purposes of this section, the filing of a petition in a title 11 or similar case (as defined in section 368(a)(3)(A)) by itself does not result in the substitution of a new obligor.
(ii)
Substitution of a new obligor on nonrecourse debt instruments.
The substitution of a new obligor on a nonrecourse debt instrument is not a significant modification.
(iii)
Addition or deletion of co-obligor.
The addition or deletion of a co-obligor on a debt instrument is a significant modification if the addition or deletion of the co-obligor results in a change in payment expectations. If the addition or deletion of a co-obligor is part of a transaction or series of related transactions that results in the substitution of a new obligor, however, the transaction is treated as a substitution of a new obligor (and is tested under paragraph (e)(4)(i)) of this section rather than as an addition or deletion of a co-obligor.
(iv)
Change in security or credit enhancement
—(A)
Recourse debt instruments.
A modification that releases, substitutes, adds or otherwise alters the collateral for, a guarantee on, or other form of credit enhancement for a recourse debt instrument is a significant modification if the modification results in a change in payment expectations.
(B)
Nonrecourse debt instruments.
(
1
) A modification that releases, substitutes, adds or otherwise alters a substantial amount of the collateral for, a guarantee on, or other form of credit enhancement for a nonrecourse debt instrument is a significant modification. A substitution of collateral is not a significant modification, however, if the collateral is fungible or otherwise of a type where the particular units pledged are unimportant (for example, government securities or financial instruments of a particular type and credit quality). In addition, the substitution of a similar commercially available credit enhancement contract is not a significant modification, and an improvement to the property securing a nonrecourse debt instrument does not result in a significant modification.
(
2
)
Applicability date.
Paragraph (e)(4)(iv)(B)(
1
) of this section applies to modifications occurring on or after July 6, 2011.
(v)
Change in priority of debt.
A change in the priority of a debt instrument relative to other debt of the issuer is a significant modification if it results in a change in payment expectations.
(vi)
Change in payment expectations
—(A)
In general.
For purposes of this section, a change in payment expectations occurs if, as a result of a transaction—
(
1
) There is a substantial enhancement of the obligor's capacity to meet the payment obligations under a debt instrument and that capacity was primarily speculative prior to the modification and is adequate after the modification; or
(
2
) There is a substantial impairment of the obligor's capacity to meet the payment obligations under a debt instrument and that capacity was adequate prior to the modification and is primarily speculative after the modification.
(B)
Obligor's capacity.
The obligor's capacity includes any source for payment, including collateral, guarantees, or other credit enhancement.
(5)
Changes in the nature of a debt instrument
—(i)
Property that is not debt.
A modification of a debt instrument that results in an instrument or property right that is not debt for Federal income tax purposes is a significant modification. The rules of paragraph (f)(7) of this section apply to determine whether a modification results in an instrument or property right that is not debt.
(ii)
Change in recourse nature
—(A)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (e)(5)(ii)(B) of this section, a change in the nature of a debt instrument from recourse (or substantially all recourse) to nonrecourse (or substantially all nonrecourse) is a significant modification. Thus, for example, a legal defeasance of a debt instrument in which the issuer is released from all liability to make payments on the debt instrument (including an obligation to contribute additional securities to a trust if necessary to provide sufficient funds to meet all scheduled payments on the instrument) is a significant modification. Similarly, a change in the nature of the debt instrument from nonrecourse (or substantially all nonrecourse) to recourse (or substantially all recourse) is a significant modification. If an instrument is not substantially all recourse or not substantially all nonrecourse either before or after a modification, the significance of the modification is determined under paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
(B)
Exceptions
—(
1
)
Defeasance of tax-exempt bonds.
A defeasance of a tax-exempt bond is not a significant modification even if the issuer is released from any liability to make payments under the instrument if the defeasance occurs by operation of the terms of the original bond and the issuer places in trust government securities or tax-exempt government bonds that are reasonably expected to provide interest and principal payments sufficient to satisfy the payment obligations under the bond.
(
2
)
Original collateral.
(
i
) A modification that changes a recourse debt instrument to a nonrecourse debt instrument is not a significant modification if the instrument continues to be secured only by the original collateral and the modification does not result in a change in payment expectations. For this purpose, if the original collateral is fungible or otherwise of a type where the particular units pledged are unimportant (for example, government securities or financial instruments of a particular type and credit quality), replacement of some or all units of the original collateral with other units of the same or similar type and aggregate value is not considered a change in the original collateral.
(
ii
)
Applicability date.
Paragraph (e)(5)(ii)(B)(
2
)(
i
) of this section applies to modifications occurring on or after July 6, 2011.
(6)
Accounting or financial covenants.
A modification that adds, deletes, or alters customary accounting or financial covenants is not a significant modification.
(f)
Rules of application
—(1)
Testing for significance
—(i)
In general.
Whether a modification of any term is a significant modification is determined under each applicable rule in paragraphs (e) (2) through (6) of this section and, if not specifically addressed in those rules, under the general rule in paragraph (e)(1) of this section. For example, a deferral of payments that changes the yield of a fixed rate debt instrument must be tested under both paragraphs (e) (2) and (3) of this section.
(ii)
Contingent modifications.
If a modification described in paragraphs (e) (2) through (5) of this section is effective only upon the occurrence of a substantial contingency, whether or not the change is a significant modification is determined under paragraph (e)(1) of this section rather than under paragraphs (e) (2) through (5) of this section.
(iii)
Deferred modifications.
If a modification described in paragraphs (e) (4) and (5) of this section is effective on a substantially deferred basis, whether or not the change is a significant modification is determined under paragraph (e)(1) of this section rather than under paragraphs (e) (4) and (5) of this section.
(2)
Modifications that are not significant.
If a rule in paragraphs (e) (2) through (4) of this section prescribes a degree of change in a term of a debt instrument that is a significant modification, a change of the same type but of a lesser degree is not a significant modification under that rule. For example, a 20 basis point change in the yield of a fixed rate debt instrument is not a significant modification under paragraph (e)(2) of this section. Likewise, if a rule in paragraph (e)(4) of this section requires a change in payment expectations for a modification to be significant, a modification of the same type that does not result in a change in payment expectations is not a significant modification under that rule.
(3)
Cumulative effect of modifications.
Two or more modifications of a debt instrument over any period of time constitute a significant modification if, had they been done as a single change, the change would have resulted in a significant modification under paragraph (e) of this section. Thus, for example, a series of changes in the maturity of a debt instrument constitutes a significant modification if, combined as a single change, the change would have resulted in a significant modification. The significant modification occurs at the time that the cumulative modification would be significant under paragraph (e) of this section. In testing for a change of yield under paragraph (e)(2) of this section, however, any prior modification occurring more than 5 years before the date of the modification being tested is disregarded.
(4)
Modifications of different terms.
Modifications of different terms of a debt instrument, none of which separately would be a significant modification under paragraphs (e) (2) through (6) of this section, do not collectively constitute a significant modification. For example, a change in yield that is not a significant modification under paragraph (e)(2) of this section and a substitution of collateral that is not a significant modification under paragraph (e)(4)(iv) of this section do not together result in a significant modification. Although the significance of
each modification is determined independently, in testing a particular modification it is assumed that all other simultaneous modifications have already occurred.
(5)
Definitions.
For purposes of this section:
(i)
Issuer
and
obligor
are used interchangeably and mean the issuer of a debt instrument or a successor obligor.
(ii)
Variable rate debt instrument
and
contingent payment debt instrument
have the meanings given those terms in section 1275 and the regulations thereunder.
(iii)
Tax-exempt bond
means a state or local bond that satisfies the requirements of section 103(a).
(iv)
Conduit loan
and
conduit borrower
have the same meanings as in § 1.150-1(b).
(6)
Certain rules for tax-exempt bonds
—(i)
Conduit loans.
For purposes of this section, the obligor of a tax-exempt bond is the entity that actually issues the bond and not a conduit borrower of bond proceeds. In determining whether there is a significant modification of a tax-exempt bond, however, transactions between holders of the tax-exempt bond and a borrower of a conduit loan may be an indirect modification under paragraph (a)(1) of this section. For example, a payment by the holder of a tax-exempt bond to a conduit borrower to waive a call right may result in an indirect modification of the tax-exempt bond by changing the yield on that bond.
(ii)
Recourse nature
—(A)
In general.
For purposes of this section, a tax-exempt bond that does not finance a conduit loan is a recourse debt instrument.
(B)
Proceeds used for conduit loans.
For purposes of this section, a tax-exempt bond that finances a conduit loan is a recourse debt instrument unless both the bond and the conduit loan are nonrecourse instruments.
(C)
Government securities as collateral.
Notwithstanding paragraphs (f)(6)(ii) (A) and (B) of this section, for purposes of this section a tax-exempt bond that is secured only by a trust holding government securities or tax-exempt government bonds that are reasonably expected to provide interest and principal payments sufficient to satisfy the payment obligations under the bond is a nonrecourse instrument.
(7)
Rules for determining whether an alteration or modification results in an instrument or property right that is not debt
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (f)(7)(ii) of this section, the determination of whether an instrument resulting from an alteration or modification of a debt instrument will be recharacterized as an instrument or property right that is not debt for Federal income tax purposes shall take into account all of the factors relevant to such a determination.
(ii)
Financial condition of the obligor
—(A)
Deterioration in financial condition of the obligor generally disregarded.
Except as provided in paragraph (f)(7)(ii)(B) of this section, in making a determination as to whether an instrument resulting from an alteration or modification of a debt instrument will be recharacterized as an instrument or property right that is not debt, any deterioration in the financial condition of the obligor between the issue date of the debt instrument and the date of the alteration or modification (as it relates to the obligor's ability to repay the debt instrument) is not taken into account. For example, any decrease in the fair market value of a debt instrument (whether or not the debt instrument is publicly traded) between the issue date of the debt instrument and the date of the alteration or modification is not taken into account to the extent that the decrease in fair market value is attributable to the deterioration in the financial condition of the obligor and not to a modification of the terms of the instrument.
(B)
Substitution of a new obligor; addition or deletion of co-obligor.
If there is a substitution of a new obligor or the addition or deletion of a co-obligor, the rules in paragraph (f)(7)(ii)(A) of this section do not apply.
(g)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the provisions of paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section:

# Example 1. Modification of call right.
(i) Under the terms of a 30-year, fixed-rate bond, the issuer can call the bond for 102 percent of par at the end of ten years or for 101 percent of par at the end of 20 years. At the end of the eighth year, the holder of the bond pays the issuer to waive the issuer's right to call the bond at the end of the tenth year. On the
date of the modification, the issuer's credit quality is approximately the same as when the bond was issued, but market rates of interest have declined from that date.
(ii) The holder's payment to the issuer changes the yield on the bond. Whether the change in yield is a significant modification depends on whether the yield on the modified bond varies from the yield on the original bond by more than the change in yield as described in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section.
(iii) If the change in yield is not a significant modification, the elimination of the issuer's call right must also be tested for significance. Because the specific rules of paragraphs (e)(2) through (e)(6) of this section do not address this modification, the significance of the modification must be determined under the general rule of paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
(iv)
Applicability date.
This
Example 1
applies to modifications occurring on or after July 6, 2011.

# Example 2. Extension of maturity and change in yield.
(i) A zero-coupon bond has an original maturity of ten years. At the end of the fifth year, the parties agree to extend the maturity for a period of two years without increasing the stated redemption price at maturity (i.e., there are no additional payments due between the original and extended maturity dates, and the amount due at the extended maturity date is equal to the amount due at the original maturity date).
(ii) The deferral of the scheduled payment at maturity is tested under paragraph (e)(3) of this section. The safe-harbor period under paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section starts with the date the payment that is being deferred is due. For this modification, the safe-harbor period starts on the original maturity date, and ends five years from this date. All payments deferred within this period are unconditionally payable before the end of the safe-harbor period. Thus, the deferral of the payment at maturity for a period of two years is not a material deferral under the safe-harbor rule of paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section and thus is not a significant modification.
(iii) Even though the extension of maturity is not a significant modification under paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section, the modification also decreases the yield of the bond. The change in yield must be tested under paragraph (e)(2) of this section.

# Example 3. Change in yield resulting from reduction of principal.
(i) A debt instrument issued at par has an original maturity of ten years and provides for the payment of $100,000 at maturity with interest payments at the rate of 10 percent payable at the end of each year. At the end of the fifth year, and after the annual payment of interest, the issuer and holder agree to reduce the amount payable at maturity to $80,000. The annual interest rate remains at 10 percent but is payable on the reduced principal.
(ii) In applying the change in yield rule of paragraph (e)(2) of this section, the yield of the instrument after the modification (measured from the date that the parties agree to the modification to its final maturity date) is computed using the adjusted issue price of $100,000. With four annual payments of $8,000, and a payment of $88,000 at maturity, the yield on the instrument after the modification for purposes of determining if there has been a significant modification under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section is 4.332 percent. Thus, the reduction in principal is a significant modification.

# Example 4. Deferral of scheduled interest payments.
(i) A 20-year debt instrument issued at par provides for the payment of $100,000 at maturity with annual interest payments at the rate of 10 percent. At the beginning of the eleventh year, the issuer and holder agree to defer all remaining interest payments until maturity with compounding. The yield of the modified instrument remains at 10 percent.
(ii) The safe-harbor period of paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section begins at the end of the eleventh year, when the interest payment for that year is deferred, and ends at the end of the sixteenth year. However, the payments deferred during this period are not unconditionally payable by the end of that 5-year period. Thus, the deferral of the interest payments is not within the safe-harbor period.
(iii) This modification materially defers the payments due under the instrument and is a significant modification under paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section.

# Example 5. Assumption of mortgage with increase in interest rate.
(i) A recourse debt instrument with a 9 percent annual yield is secured by an office building. Under the terms of the instrument, a purchaser of the building may assume the debt and be substituted for the original obligor if the purchaser is equally or more creditworthy than the original obligor and if the interest rate on the instrument is increased by one-half percent (50 basis points). The building is sold, the purchaser assumes the debt, and the interest rate increases by 50 basis points.
(ii) If the purchaser's acquisition of the building does not satisfy the requirements of paragraph (e)(4)(i)(B) or paragraph (e)(4)(i)(C) of this section, the substitution of the purchaser as the obligor is a significant modification under paragraph (e)(4)(i)(A) of this section.
(iii) If the purchaser acquires substantially all of the assets of the original obligor, the assumption of the debt instrument will not result in a significant modification if there is not a change in payment expectations and the assumption does not result in a significant alteration.
(iv) The change in the interest rate, if tested under the rules of paragraph (e)(2) of this
section, would result in a significant modification. The change in interest rate that results from the transaction is a significant alteration. Thus, the transaction does not meet the requirements of paragraph (e)(4)(i)(C) of this section and is a significant modification under paragraph (e)(4)(i)(A) of this section.
(v)
Applicability date.
This
Example 5
applies to modifications occurring on or after July 6, 2011.

# Example 6. Assumption of mortgage.
(i) A recourse debt instrument is secured by a building. In connection with the sale of the building, the purchaser of the building assumes the debt and is substituted as the new obligor on the debt instrument. The purchaser does not acquire substantially all of the assets of the original obligor.
(ii) The transaction does not satisfy any of the exceptions set forth in paragraph (e)(4)(i) (B) or (C) of this section. Thus, the substitution of the purchaser as the obligor is a significant modification under paragraph (e)(4)(i)(A) of this section.
(iii) Section 1274(c)(4), however, provides that if a debt instrument is assumed in connection with the sale or exchange of property, the assumption is not taken into account in determining if section 1274 applies to the debt instrument unless the terms and conditions of the debt instrument are modified in connection with the sale or exchange. Because the purchaser assumed the debt instrument in connection with the sale of property and the debt instrument was not otherwise modified, the debt instrument is not retested to determine whether it provides for adequate stated interest.

# Example 7. Substitution of a new obligor in section 381(a) transaction.
(i) The interest rate on a 30-year debt instrument issued by a corporation provides for a variable rate of interest that is reset annually on June 1st based on an objective index.
(ii) In the tenth year, the issuer merges (in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies) into another corporation that becomes the new obligor on the debt instrument. The merger occurs on June 1st, at which time the interest rate is also reset by operation of the terms of the instrument. The new interest rate varies from the previous interest rate by more than the greater of 25 basis points and 5 percent of the annual yield of the unmodified instrument. The substitution of a new obligor does not result in a change in payment expectations.
(iii) The substitution of the new obligor occurs in a section 381(a) transaction and does not result in a change in payment expectations. Although the interest rate changed by more than the greater of 25 basis points and 5 percent of the annual yield of the unmodified instrument, this alteration did not occur as a result of the transaction and is not a significant alteration under paragraph (e)(4)(i)(E) of this section. Thus, the substitution meets the requirements of paragraph (e)(4)(i)(B) of this section and is not a significant modification.

# Example 8. Substitution of credit enhancement contract.
(i) Under the terms of a recourse debt instrument, the issuer's obligations are secured by a letter of credit from a specified bank. The debt instrument does not contain any provision allowing a substitution of a letter of credit from a different bank. The specified bank, however, encounters financial difficulty. The issuer and holder agree that the issuer will substitute a letter of credit from another bank.
(ii) Under paragraph (e)(4)(iv)(A) of this section, the substitution of a different credit enhancement contract is not a significant modification of a recourse debt instrument unless the substitution results in a change in payment expectations. While the substitution of a new letter of credit by a different bank does not itself result in a change in payment expectations, such a substitution may result in a change in payment expectations under certain circumstances (for example, if the obligor's capacity to meet payment obligations is dependent on the letter of credit and the substitution substantially enhances that capacity from primarily speculative to adequate).
(iii)
Applicability date.
This
Example 8
applies to modifications occurring on or after July 6, 2011.

# Example 9. Improvement to collateral securing nonrecourse debt.
A parcel of land and its improvements, a shopping center, secure a nonrecourse debt instrument. The obligor expands the shopping center with the construction of an additional building on the same parcel of land. After the construction, the improvements that secure the nonrecourse debt include the new building. The building is an improvement to the property securing the nonrecourse debt instrument and its inclusion in the collateral securing the debt is not a significant modification under paragraph (e)(4)(iv)(B) of this section.
(h)
Effective/applicability date
—(1)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (h)(2) of this section, this section applies to alterations of the terms of a debt instrument on or after September 24, 1996. Taxpayers, however, may rely on this section for alterations of the terms of a debt instrument after December 2, 1992, and before September 24, 1996.
(2)
Exception.
Paragraph (f)(7) of this section applies to an alteration of the terms of a debt instrument on or after January 7, 2011. A taxpayer, however, may rely on paragraph (f)(7) of this section for alterations of the terms of a
debt instrument occurring before that date.

§ 1.1001-4
Modifications of certain derivative contracts.
(a)
Certain assignments.
For purposes of § 1.1001-1(a), the transfer or assignment of a derivative contract is not treated by the nonassigning counterparty as a deemed exchange of the original contract for a modified contract that differs materially either in kind or in extent if—
(1) Both the party transferring or assigning its rights and obligations under the derivative contract and the party to which the rights and obligations are transferred or assigned are either a dealer or a clearinghouse;
(2) The terms of the derivative contract permit the transfer or assignment of the contract, whether or not the consent of the nonassigning counterparty is required for the transfer or assignment to be effective; and
(3) The terms of the derivative contract are not otherwise modified in a manner that results in a taxable exchange under section 1001.
(b)
Definitions
—(1)
Dealer.
For purposes of this section, a
dealer
is a taxpayer who meets the definition of a dealer in securities in section 475(c)(1) or is a dealer in commodities derivative contracts.
(2)
Clearinghouse.
For purposes of this section, a
clearinghouse
is a derivatives clearing organization (as such term is defined in section 1a of the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 1a)) or a clearing agency (as such term is defined in section 3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78c(a))) that is registered, or exempt from registration, under each respective Act.
(3)
Derivative contract.
For purposes of this section, a
derivative contract
is a contract described in—
(i) Section 475(c)(2)(D), 475(c)(2)(E), or 475(c)(2)(F) without regard to the last sentence of section 475(c)(2) referencing section 1256;
(ii) Section 475(e)(2)(B), 475(e)(2)(C), or 475(e)(2)(D); or
(iii) Section 1.446-3(c)(1).
(c)
Consideration for the assignment.
Any payment between a party transferring or assigning its rights and obligations under the contract and the party to which the rights and obligations are transferred or assigned pursuant to a transfer or assignment described in paragraph (a) of this section will not affect the treatment of the nonassigning counterparty for purposes of this section. A payment described in the preceding sentence made or received to transfer or assign rights and obligations under a notional principal contract (as defined in § 1.446-3(c)(1)) is not subject to § 1.446-3(g)(4).
(d)
Effective/applicability date.
This section applies to transfers or assignments of derivative contracts on or after July 22, 2011.
[T.D. 9639, 78 FR 66640, Nov. 6, 2013]
§ 1.1001-5
European Monetary Union (conversion to the euro).
(a)
Conversion of currencies.
For purposes of § 1.1001-1(a), the conversion to the euro of legacy currencies (as defined in § 1.985-8(a)(1)) is not the exchange of property for other property differing materially in kind or extent.
(b)
Effect of currency conversion on other rights and obligations.
For purposes of § 1.1001-1(a), if, solely as the result of the conversion of legacy currencies to the euro, rights or obligations denominated in a legacy currency become rights or obligations denominated in the euro, that event is not the exchange of property for other property differing materially in kind or extent. Thus, for example, when a debt instrument that requires payments of amounts denominated in a legacy currency becomes a debt instrument requiring payments of euros, that alteration is not a modification within the meaning of § 1.1001-3(c).
(c)
Effective date.
This section applies to tax years ending after July 29, 1998.
[T.D. 8927, 66 FR 2218, Jan. 11, 2001]
§ 1.1001-6
Transition from certain interbank offered rates.
(a)
In general.
This section provides rules relating to the modification of the terms of a contract as part of the transition away from the London
Interbank Offered Rate and certain other interbank offered rates. In general, paragraphs (b) through (g) of this section provide the operative rules for a covered modification. Paragraph (h) of this section defines certain terms that are used in these operative rules, such as
covered modification, qualified rate, discontinued IBOR, associated modification,
and
qualified one-time payment.
Paragraph (j) of this section describes certain modifications that are not covered modifications and provides examples that illustrate the operation of the rules in paragraph (j) of this section. For rules regarding original issue discount on certain debt instruments that provide for a rate referencing a discontinued IBOR, see § 1.1275-2(m). For rules regarding certain interests in a REMIC that provide for a rate referencing a discontinued IBOR, see § 1.860G-1(e).
(b)
Treatment under section 1001
—(1)
Covered modifications.
A covered modification of a contract is not treated as the exchange of property for other property differing materially in kind or in extent for purposes of § 1.1001-1(a). For example, if the terms of a debt instrument that pays interest at a rate referencing the U.S.-dollar London Interbank Offered Rate (USD LIBOR) are modified to provide that the debt instrument pays interest at a qualified rate referencing the Secured Overnight Financing Rate published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (SOFR) and the modification is not described in paragraph (j) of this section, the modification is not treated as the exchange of property for other property differing materially in kind or in extent for purposes of § 1.1001-1(a).
(2)
Contemporaneous noncovered modifications.
If a covered modification is made at the same time as a noncovered modification, § 1.1001-1(a) or § 1.1001-3, as appropriate, applies to determine whether the noncovered modification results in the exchange of property for other property differing materially in kind or in extent. In applying § 1.1001-1(a) or § 1.1001-3 for this purpose, the covered modification is treated as part of the terms of the contract prior to the noncovered modification. For example, if the parties to a debt instrument modify the interest rate in a manner that is a covered modification and contemporaneously extend the final maturity date of the debt instrument, which is a noncovered modification, only the extension of the final maturity date is analyzed under § 1.1001-3 and, for purposes of that analysis, the modified interest rate is treated as a term of the instrument prior to the extension of the final maturity date.
(c)
Effect of a covered modification on integrated transactions and hedging transactions
—(1)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the rules in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section determine the effect of a covered modification on an integrated transaction under § 1.1275-6, a qualified hedging transaction under § 1.988-5(a), a hedging transaction under § 1.446-4, or a qualified hedging transaction under § 1.148-4(h).
(i) A covered modification of one or more contracts that are part of an integrated transaction under § 1.1275-6 is treated as not legging out of the integrated transaction, provided that, no later than the end of the 90-day period beginning on the date of the first covered modification of any such contract, the financial instrument that results from any such covered modifications satisfies the requirements to be a § 1.1275-6 hedge (as defined in § 1.1275-6(b)(2)) with respect to the qualifying debt instrument that results from any such covered modification. If a taxpayer enters into a financial instrument intended to mitigate the economic effect of a temporary mismatch of the legs of the integrated transaction during that 90-day period (a
§ 1.1275-6 interim hedge
), the integration of the § 1.1275-6 interim hedge with the other components of the integrated transaction during the 90-day period is treated as not legging into a new integrated transaction and the termination of the § 1.1275-6 interim hedge before the end of the 90-day period is treated as not legging out of the existing integrated transaction.
(ii) A covered modification of one or more contracts that are part of a qualified hedging transaction under § 1.988-5(a) is treated as not legging out of the qualified hedging transaction, provided that, no later than the end of the 90-
day period beginning on the date of the first covered modification of any such contract, the financial instrument or series or combination of financial instruments that results from any such covered modifications satisfies the requirements to be a § 1.988-5(a) hedge (as defined in § 1.988-5(a)(4)) with respect to the qualifying debt instrument that results from any such covered modification. If a taxpayer enters into a financial instrument intended to mitigate the economic effect of a temporary mismatch of the legs of the qualified hedging transaction during that 90-day period (a
§ 1.988-5(a) interim hedge
), the integration of the § 1.988-5(a) interim hedge with the other components of the qualified hedging transaction during the 90-day period is treated as not legging into a new qualified hedging transaction and the termination of the § 1.988-5(a) interim hedge before the end of the 90-day period is treated as not legging out of the existing qualified hedging transaction.
(iii) A covered modification of one leg of a transaction subject to the hedge accounting rules in § 1.446-4 is not treated as a disposition or termination (within the meaning of § 1.446-4(e)(6)) of either leg of the transaction.
(iv) A covered modification of a qualified hedge or of the tax-advantaged bonds with which the qualified hedge is integrated under § 1.148-4(h)(1) is treated as not terminating the qualified hedge under § 1.148-4(h)(3)(iv)(B), provided that, no later than the end of the 90-day period beginning on the date of the first covered modification of either the qualified hedge or the hedged bonds, the qualified hedge that results from any such covered modification satisfies the requirements to be a qualified hedge (determined by applying the special rules for certain modifications of qualified hedges under § 1.148-4(h)(3)(iv)(C)) with respect to the hedged bonds that result from any such covered modification. Solely for purposes of determining whether the qualified hedge that results from a covered modification satisfies the requirements to be a qualified hedge with respect to the hedged bonds that result from any such covered modification in the preceding sentence, a qualified one-time payment with respect to the hedge or the hedged bonds (or both) is allocated in a manner consistent with the allocation of a termination payment for a variable yield issue under § 1.148-4(h)(3)(iv)(H) and treated as a series of periodic payments. This paragraph (c)(1)(iv) does not apply if, prior to any covered modifications, the qualified hedge and the tax-advantaged bond are integrated under § 1.148-4(h)(4).
(2)
Fallback rates.
If a covered modification of a contract that is part of an integrated transaction under § 1.1275-6 is described in paragraph (h)(1)(ii) or (iii) of this section, that covered modification is treated as not legging out of the integrated transaction. If a covered modification of a contract that is part of a qualified hedging transaction under § 1.988-5(a) is described in paragraph (h)(1)(ii) or (iii) of this section, that covered modification is treated as not legging out of the qualified hedging transaction. If a covered modification of a qualified hedge or of the tax-advantaged bonds with which the qualified hedge is integrated under § 1.148-4(h) is described in paragraph (h)(1)(ii) or (iii) of this section, that covered modification is treated as not terminating the qualified hedge under § 1.148-4(h)(3)(iv)(B).
(d)
Coordination with provision for existing obligations under chapter 4.
A modification of a contract is not a material modification of that contract for purposes of § 1.1471-2(b)(2)(iv) to the extent the modification is a covered modification. See paragraph (b)(2) of this section for rules that apply for purposes of § 1.1471-2(b)(2)(iv) when a modification to a contract includes both a covered modification and a contemporaneous noncovered modification.
(e)
Coordination with fast-pay stock rules.
A covered modification of stock is not a significant modification in the terms of the stock or the related agreements or a significant change in the relevant facts and circumstances for purposes of § 1.7701(l)-3(b)(2)(ii). If a covered modification is made at the same time as, or as part of a plan that includes, a noncovered modification and the noncovered modification is a significant modification in the terms of the stock or the related agreements
or a significant change in the relevant facts and circumstances, then § 1.7701(l)-3(b)(2)(ii) applies to determine whether the stock is fast-pay stock, taking into account all the facts and circumstances (including both the covered and noncovered modification).
(f)
Coordination with rules for investment trusts.
A covered modification of a contract held by an investment trust does not manifest a power to vary the investment of the certificate holders for purposes of § 301.7701-4(c)(1) of this chapter. Further, a covered modification of an ownership interest in an investment trust does not manifest a power to vary the investment of the certificate holder for purposes of § 301.7701-4(c)(1) of this chapter.
(g) [Reserved]

Definitions
—(1)
Covered modification.
A
covered modification
is a modification or portion of a modification of the terms of a contract that is described in one or more of paragraphs (h)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section and that is not described in any of paragraphs (j)(1) through (5) of this section. Any modification of the terms of a contract described in section 4.02 of Rev. Proc. 2020-44, 2020-45 I.R.B. 991, or described in other guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin that supplements the list of modifications described in section 4.02 of Rev. Proc. 2020-44 or the definitions on which that section relies (see § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(a) of this chapter) is treated as a covered modification. For purposes of this section, a modification of the terms of a contract includes any modification of the terms of the contract, regardless of the form of the modification (for example, a modification may be an exchange of one contract for another, an amendment to the existing contract, or a modification accomplished indirectly through one or more transactions with third parties) and regardless of whether the modification is evidenced by an express agreement (oral or written), conduct of the parties, or otherwise. For purposes of this section, a contract includes but is not limited to a debt instrument, a derivative contract, stock, an insurance contract, and a lease agreement.
(i) The terms of the contract are modified to replace an operative rate that references a discontinued IBOR with a qualified rate, to add an obligation for one party to make a qualified one-time payment (if any), and to make associated modifications (if any).
(ii) The terms of the contract are modified to include a qualified rate as a fallback to an operative rate that references a discontinued IBOR and to make associated modifications (if any).
(iii) The terms of the contract are modified to replace a fallback rate that references a discontinued IBOR with a qualified rate and to make associated modifications (if any).
(2)
Noncovered modification.
A
noncovered modification
is any modification or portion of a modification of the terms of a contract that is not a covered modification.
(3)
Qualified rate
—(i)
In general.
A
qualified rate
is any of the rates described in paragraph (h)(3)(ii) of this section, provided that the interest rate benchmark to which the rate refers and the discontinued IBOR identified in paragraph (h)(1)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section are based on transactions conducted in the same currency or are otherwise reasonably expected to measure contemporaneous variations in the cost of newly borrowed funds in the same currency. For purposes of paragraphs (h)(1)(ii) and (iii) of this section, a single qualified rate may be comprised of one or more fallback rates (for example, a waterfall of fallback rates). Paragraph (h)(3)(iii) of this section provides additional rules for determining whether one or more fallback rates constitute a qualified rate, and paragraph (h)(3)(iv) of this section provides examples illustrating the operation of those rules.
(ii)
Rates.
The following rates are described in this paragraph (h)(3)(ii):
(A) A qualified floating rate, as defined in § 1.1275-5(b), but without regard to the limitations on multiples set forth in § 1.1275-5(b) (examples of qualified floating rates generally include SOFR, the Sterling Overnight Index Average, the Tokyo Overnight Average Rate, the Swiss Average Rate Overnight, and the euro short-term rate administered by the European Central Bank);
(B) An alternative, substitute, or successor rate selected, endorsed, or recommended by the central bank, reserve bank, monetary authority, or similar institution (including any committee or working group thereof) as a replacement for a discontinued IBOR or its local currency equivalent in that jurisdiction;
(C) A rate selected, endorsed, or recommended by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee as a replacement for USD LIBOR, provided that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is an ex officio member of the Alternative Reference Rates Committee at the time of the selection, endorsement, or recommendation;
(D) A rate that is determined by reference to a rate described in paragraph (h)(3)(ii)(A), (B), or (C) of this section, including a rate determined by adding or subtracting a specified number of basis points to or from the rate or by multiplying the rate by a specified number; and
(E) A rate identified for purposes of this section as a qualified rate in guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(a) of this chapter).
(iii)
Rules for fallback rates
—(A)
Multiple fallback rates.
If the rate being tested as a qualified rate is comprised of more than one fallback rate, the rate is a qualified rate only if each individual fallback rate separately satisfies the requirements to be a qualified rate.
(B)
Indeterminable fallback rate.
Except as provided in paragraph (h)(3)(iii)(C) of this section, if it is not possible to determine at the time of the modification being tested as a covered modification whether a fallback rate satisfies the requirements set forth in the first sentence of paragraph (h)(3)(i) of this section (for example, the calculation agent will determine the fallback rate at the time that the fallback rate is triggered based on factors that are not guaranteed to produce a rate described in paragraph (h)(3)(ii) of this section), the fallback rate is treated as not satisfying the requirements to be a qualified rate.
(C)
Fallback rate is a remote contingency.
If the likelihood that any value will ever be determined under the contract by reference to a fallback rate is remote (determined at the time of the modification being tested as a covered modification), that fallback rate is treated as satisfying the requirements to be a qualified rate.
(iv)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of the rules in paragraphs (h)(3)(i) through (iii) of this section to qualified rates comprised of one or more fallback rates.
(A)
Example 1: Addition of a single fallback rate
—(
1
)
Facts.
B is the issuer and L is the holder of a debt instrument that pays interest semiannually in U.S. dollars at a rate of six-month USD LIBOR and that contains no fallback provisions to address the pending discontinuation of six-month USD LIBOR. On July 1, 2022, B and L modify the debt instrument to add such fallback provisions (the
new fallbacks
). The new fallbacks provide that, upon the discontinuation of six-month USD LIBOR, six-month USD LIBOR will be replaced by a fallback rate equal to CME Group's forward-looking SOFR term rate of a six-month tenor (
six-month CME Term SOFR
) plus a fixed spread that will be determined at the time of six-month USD LIBOR's discontinuation. Six-month USD LIBOR will be discontinued on June 30, 2023.
(

)
Analysis.
The fallback rate is a qualified floating rate and is, therefore, described in paragraph (h)(3)(ii)(A) of this section. Moreover, because both six-month USD LIBOR and six-month CME Term SOFR are based on transactions conducted in U.S. dollars, the fallback rate satisfies the currency requirement in paragraph (h)(3)(i) of this section. As further provided in paragraph (h)(3)(i) of this section, B and L must also apply the rules in paragraph (h)(3)(iii)(A), (B), and (C) of this section to determine if the fallback rate is a qualified rate. Because the rate being tested as a qualified rate (
i.e.,
the fallback rate) is comprised of only one fallback rate, paragraph (h)(3)(iii)(A) of this section has no effect. As discussed elsewhere in this paragraph (h)(3)(iv)(A)(
2
), it is evident at the time of the fallback rate's addition that the fallback rate satisfies the requirements set forth in the first sentence of paragraph (h)(3)(i) of this section, so paragraph (h)(3)(iii)(B) of this
section has no effect. Because it appears likely at the time of the modification that the fallback rate will be used to determine interest on the debt instrument, paragraph (h)(3)(iii)(C) of this section has no effect. In summary, the fallback rate is described in paragraph (h)(3)(ii)(A) of this section and satisfies the currency requirement in paragraph (h)(3)(i) of this section, and none of the rules in paragraph (h)(3)(iii) of this section affect the analysis. Therefore, the fallback rate is a qualified rate.
(B)
Example 2: Addition of a single indeterminable fallback rate
—(
1
)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (h)(3)(iv)(A)(
1
) of this section (
Example 1
), except that the new fallbacks provide that, upon the discontinuation of six-month USD LIBOR, B will select a replacement for six-month USD LIBOR based on the industry standard at the time of selection.
(
2
)
Analysis.
As provided in paragraph (h)(3)(i) of this section, B and L must apply the rule in paragraph (h)(3)(iii)(B) of this section to determine whether the fallback rate is a qualified rate. Because it is not possible to determine at the time of the fallback rate's addition in 2022 whether the fallback rate (
i.e.,
the replacement rate that B will select in 2023) satisfies the requirements set forth in the first sentence of paragraph (h)(3)(i) of this section, the fallback rate is treated as not satisfying the requirements to be a qualified rate under paragraph (h)(3)(iii)(B) of this section. Therefore, the fallback rate is not a qualified rate.
(C)
Example 3: Addition of a fallback waterfall that is a qualified rate
—(
1
)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (h)(3)(iv)(A)(
1
) of this section (
Example 1
), except that the new fallbacks provide for a fallback waterfall. The first tier of the fallback waterfall provides that, upon the discontinuation of six-month USD LIBOR, six-month USD LIBOR will be replaced by a fallback rate equal to six-month CME Term SOFR plus a fixed spread that will be determined at the time of six-month USD LIBOR's discontinuation. The second tier of the fallback waterfall provides that, upon the discontinuation of six-month CME Term SOFR, B will select a replacement for the fallback rate in the first tier of the fallback waterfall based on the industry standard at the time of selection. At the time of the fallback waterfall's addition, the likelihood that six-month CME Term SOFR will be discontinued is remote.
(

)
Analysis of the fallback waterfall.
As provided in paragraph (h)(3)(i) of this section, B and L must apply the rules in paragraphs (h)(3)(iii)(A), (B) and (C) of this section to determine whether the fallback waterfall is a qualified rate. Under paragraph (h)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, because the rate being tested as a qualified rate (
i.e.,
the fallback waterfall) is comprised of more than one fallback rate, the fallback waterfall is a qualified rate only if each individual fallback rate (
i.e.,
fallback rates in the first and second tiers of the fallback waterfall) separately satisfies the requirements to be a qualified rate. As concluded in paragraphs (h)(3)(iv)(C)(
3
) and (
4
) of this section, the fallback rates in the first and second tiers of the fallback waterfall separately satisfy the requirements to be a qualified rate. Therefore, the fallback waterfall is a qualified rate.
(
3
)
Analysis of the first tier of the fallback waterfall.
Because the fallback rate in the first tier of the fallback waterfall is the same as the fallback rate in paragraph (h)(3)(iv)(A)(
1
) of this section (
Example 1
), the analysis of the fallback rate in the first tier of the fallback waterfall is the same as the analysis of the fallback rate in paragraph (h)(3)(iv)(A)(
2
) of this section (
Example 1
). Accordingly, the fallback rate in the first tier of the fallback waterfall separately satisfies the requirements to be a qualified rate.
(
4
)
Analysis of the second tier of the fallback waterfall.
The fallback rate in the second tier of the fallback waterfall is the same as the fallback rate in paragraph (h)(3)(iv)(B)(
1
) of this section (
Example 2
). However, unlike the fallback rate in paragraph (h)(3)(iv)(B)(
1
) of this section (
Example 2
), the likelihood that the amount of interest on the debt instrument will ever be determined by reference to the fallback rate in the second tier of the fallback waterfall is remote. Accordingly, under paragraph (h)(3)(iii)(C) of this section,
the fallback rate in the second tier of the fallback waterfall is treated as satisfying the requirements to be a qualified rate.
(D)
Example 4: Addition of a fallback waterfall that is not a qualified rate
—(
1
)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (h)(3)(iv)(A)(
1
) of this section (
Example 1
), except that the new fallbacks provide for a fallback waterfall. The first tier of the fallback waterfall provides that, upon the discontinuation of six-month USD LIBOR, six-month USD LIBOR will be replaced by a stated fallback rate (
Fallback Rate X
). Fallback Rate X, which is equal to an interest rate benchmark (
Benchmark X
) plus a fixed spread, satisfies the requirements set forth in the first sentence of paragraph (h)(3)(i) of this section. The second tier of the fallback waterfall provides that, upon the discontinuation of Benchmark X, B will select a replacement for Fallback Rate X based on the industry standard at the time of selection. At the time of the fallback waterfall's addition, the likelihood that Benchmark X will be discontinued is not remote.
(
2
)
Analysis of the fallback waterfall.
As provided in paragraph (h)(3)(i) of this section, B and L must apply the rules in paragraphs (h)(3)(iii)(A), (B) and (C) of this section to determine whether the fallback waterfall is a qualified rate. Under paragraph (h)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, because the rate being tested as a qualified rate (
i.e.,
the fallback waterfall) is comprised of more than one fallback rate, the fallback waterfall is a qualified rate only if each individual fallback rate (
i.e.,
the fallback rates in the first and second tiers of the fallback waterfall) separately satisfies the requirements to be a qualified rate. As concluded in paragraph (h)(3)(iv)(D)(
3
) of this section, the fallback rate in the second tier of the fallback waterfall is treated as not satisfying the requirements to be a qualified rate. Therefore, the fallback waterfall is not a qualified rate.
(
3
)
Analysis of the second tier of the fallback waterfall.
As provided in paragraphs (h)(3)(i) and (h)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, B and L must apply the rules in paragraphs (h)(3)(iii)(B) and (C) of this section to determine whether the fallback rate in the second tier of the fallback waterfall is a qualified rate. Because the likelihood that Benchmark X will be discontinued is not remote, paragraph (h)(3)(iii)(C) of this section has no effect on the analysis of the fallback rate in the second tier of the fallback waterfall. Under paragraph (h)(3)(iii)(B) of this section, because it is not possible to determine at the time of the fallback waterfall's addition in 2022 whether the fallback rate in the second tier of the fallback waterfall (
i.e.,
the replacement rate that B will select in 2023) satisfies the requirements set forth in the first sentence of paragraph (h)(3)(i) of this section, the fallback rate in the second tier of the fallback waterfall is treated as not satisfying the requirements to be a qualified rate.
(4)
Discontinued IBOR.
A
discontinued IBOR
is any interbank offered rate described in paragraph (h)(4)(i) or (ii) of this section but only during the period beginning on the date of the announcement described in paragraph (h)(4)(i) or (ii) of this section and ending on the date that is one year after the date on which the administrator of the interbank offered rate ceases to provide the interbank offered rate.
(i) The administrator of the interbank offered rate announces that the administrator has ceased or will cease to provide the interbank offered rate permanently or indefinitely, and no successor administrator is expected as of the time of the announcement to continue to provide the interbank offered rate; or
(ii) The regulatory supervisor for the administrator of the interbank offered rate, the central bank for the currency of the interbank offered rate, an insolvency official with jurisdiction over the administrator for the interbank offered rate, a resolution authority with jurisdiction over the administrator for the interbank offered rate, a court, or an entity with similar insolvency or resolution authority over the administrator for the interbank offered rate announces that the administrator of the interbank offered rate has ceased or will cease to provide the interbank offered rate permanently or indefinitely, and no successor administrator
is expected as of the time of the announcement to continue to provide the interbank offered rate.
(5)
Associated modification.
An
associated modification
is a modification of the technical, administrative, or operational terms of a contract that is reasonably necessary to adopt or to implement the modifications described in paragraph (h)(1)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section other than associated modifications. An associated modification also includes an incidental cash payment intended to compensate a counterparty for small valuation differences resulting from a modification of the administrative terms of a contract, such as the valuation differences resulting from a change in observation period. Examples of associated modifications include a change to the definition of interest period or a change to the timing and frequency of determining rates and making payments of interest (for example, delaying payment dates on a debt instrument by two days to allow sufficient time to compute and pay interest at a qualified rate computed in arrears).
(6)
Qualified one-time payment.
A
qualified one-time payment
is a single cash payment that is intended to compensate the other party or parties for all or part of the basis difference between the discontinued IBOR identified in paragraph (h)(1)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section and the interest rate benchmark to which the qualified rate refers.
(i) [Reserved]
(j)
Modifications excluded from the definition of covered modification.
A modification or portion of a modification described in any of paragraphs (j)(1) through (5) of this section is excluded from the definition of covered modification in paragraph (h)(1) of this section and therefore is a noncovered modification.
(1) The terms of the contract are modified to change the amount or timing of contractual cash flows and that change is intended to induce one or more parties to perform any act necessary to consent to a modification to the contract described in paragraph (h)(1)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section. See paragraph (j)(6)(iii) of this section (
Example 3
).
(2) The terms of the contract are modified to change the amount or timing of contractual cash flows and that change is intended to compensate one or more parties for a modification to the contract not described in paragraph (h)(1)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section. See paragraph (j)(6)(v) of this section (
Example 5
).
(3) The terms of the contract are modified to change the amount or timing of contractual cash flows and that change is either a concession granted to a party to the contract because that party is experiencing financial difficulty or a concession secured by a party to the contract to account for the credit deterioration of another party to the contract. See paragraph (j)(6)(vi) of this section (
Example 6
).
(4) The terms of the contract are modified to change the amount or timing of contractual cash flows and that change is intended to compensate one or more parties for a change in rights or obligations that are not derived from the contract being modified. See paragraph (j)(6)(vii) of this section (
Example 7
). If each contract in a given portfolio of contracts has the same parties, those parties modify more than one contract in the portfolio (each such contract is a
modified portfolio contract
), and those modifications provide for a single, aggregate qualified one-time payment with respect to all modified portfolio contracts, then the portion of the qualified one-time payment allocable to any one modified portfolio contract is treated for purposes of this paragraph (j)(4) as not intended to compensate for a change in rights or obligations derived from any other modified portfolio contract.
(5) The terms of the contract are modified to change the amount or timing of contractual cash flows and the modification is identified for purposes of this paragraph (j)(5) in guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(a) of this chapter) as having a principal purpose of achieving a result that is unreasonable in light of the purpose of this section.
(6)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the operation of the rules in paragraphs (j)(1) through (4) of this section.
(i)
Example 1: Covered modification
—(A)
Facts.
B is the issuer and L is the holder of a debt instrument that pays interest semiannually at a rate of six-month USD LIBOR plus 100 basis points. On July 1, 2022, B and L modify the debt instrument to replace that original rate with CME Group's forward-looking SOFR term rate of a six-month tenor (
six-month CME Term SOFR
) plus an adjustment spread of 42.826 basis points plus 100 basis points (the whole modification is the
LIBOR replacement modification with basis adjustment spread
). B and L chose the adjustment spread of 42.826 basis points because that is the adjustment spread used or recommended by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association and the Alternative Reference Rates Committee for similar substitutions or replacements of six-month USD LIBOR with a tenor-adjusted variant of SOFR.
(B)
Analysis.
The parties have modified the terms of the debt instrument to replace a rate referencing a discontinued IBOR (
i.e.,
six-month USD LIBOR plus 100 basis points) with a qualified rate (
i.e.,
six-month CME Term SOFR plus 142.826 basis points). The LIBOR replacement modification with basis adjustment spread is described in paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section and not described in any of paragraphs (j)(1) through (5) of this section. Therefore, the LIBOR replacement modification with basis adjustment spread is a covered modification of the debt instrument.
(ii)
Example 2: Covered modification with qualified one-time payment
—(A)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (j)(6)(i)(A) of this section (
Example 1
), except that, instead of the LIBOR replacement modification with basis adjustment spread, B and L modify the debt instrument by replacing the original rate of six-month USD LIBOR plus 100 basis points with six-month CME Term SOFR plus 100 basis points and by obligating B to make a cash payment to L equal to the present value of the adjustment spread of 42.826 basis points with respect to the debt instrument (this payment is the
basis adjustment payment,
and the whole modification is the
LIBOR replacement modification with basis adjustment payment
).
(B)
Analysis.
The parties have modified the terms of the debt instrument to replace a rate referencing a discontinued IBOR (
i.e.,
six-month USD LIBOR plus 100 basis points) with a qualified rate (
i.e.,
six-month CME Term SOFR plus 100 basis points) and have added an obligation for B to make the basis adjustment payment, which is a single cash payment that is intended to compensate L for the basis difference between the discontinued IBOR identified in paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section (
i.e.,
six-month USD LIBOR) and the interest rate benchmark to which the qualified rate refers (
i.e.,
six-month CME Term SOFR). Accordingly, the basis adjustment payment is a qualified one-time payment as defined in paragraph (h)(6) of this section, and the LIBOR replacement modification with basis adjustment payment is described in paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section. Because it is described in paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section and not described in any of paragraphs (j)(1) through (5) of this section, the LIBOR replacement modification with basis adjustment payment is a covered modification of the debt instrument.
(iii)
Example 3: Inducement spread
—(A)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (j)(6)(i)(A) of this section (
Example 1
), except that the debt instrument is part of a widely held issue of debt with identical terms. Under the trust indenture applicable to the debt instrument, if B proposes a modification of the terms of the debt and all holders of the debt consent to that modification, the terms of the debt are modified as B proposed. In accordance with the trust indenture, B proposes the LIBOR replacement modification with basis adjustment spread on January 1, 2022. To induce holders such as L to perform the acts necessary to consent to the LIBOR replacement modification with basis adjustment spread, B also proposes to increase the interest rate paid to each consenting holder by an additional spread of 10 basis points (the
inducement spread
). All holders, including L, consent to B's proposed modifications by June 1, 2022. On July 1, 2022, the debt instrument is modified
to implement the LIBOR replacement modification with basis adjustment spread and to increase the interest rate by the inducement spread. Once all modifications are effective, the debt instrument pays interest at a rate of six-month CME Term SOFR plus 152.826 basis points.
(B)
Analysis.
As concluded in paragraph (j)(6)(i)(B) of this section (
Example 1
), the portion of these modifications that implements the LIBOR replacement modification with basis adjustment spread is a covered modification of L's debt instrument. However, the portion of these modifications that increases the interest rate by the inducement spread changes the amount of cash flows on L's debt instrument, and that change is intended to induce L to perform the acts necessary to consent to a modification to the debt instrument described in paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section (
i.e.,
the LIBOR replacement modification with basis adjustment spread). Therefore, the portion of the modification that increases the interest rate by the inducement spread is described in paragraph (j)(1) of this section and, consequently, is a noncovered modification of L's debt instrument. See paragraph (b)(2) of this section for the treatment of a contemporaneous noncovered modification.
(iv)
Example 4: Consent fee
—(A)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (j)(6)(iii)(A) of this section (
Example 3
), except that, instead of proposing to increase the interest rate paid to each consenting holder by the inducement spread, B proposes to make a cash payment to each consenting holder (the
consent fee
) at the time of the modification. Thus, when the proposed modification occurs on July 1, 2022, B pays all holders, including L, the consent fee. Once all modifications are effective, the debt instrument pays interest at a rate of six-month CME Term SOFR plus 142.826 basis points.
(B)
Analysis.
As concluded in paragraph (j)(6)(i)(B) of this section (
Example 1
), the LIBOR replacement modification with basis adjustment spread is a covered modification of L's debt instrument. However, B's obligation to pay the consent fee is also a modification of L's debt instrument but is not a covered modification because it is not described in paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section. In particular, B's obligation to pay the consent fee is not an associated modification because it is not a modification of the technical, administrative, or operational terms of L's debt instrument and is not intended to compensate for valuation differences resulting from a modification of the administrative terms of L's contract. Nor is the consent fee a qualified one-time payment because it is not intended to compensate L for any part of the basis difference between the discontinued IBOR identified in paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section (
i.e.,
six-month USD LIBOR) and the interest rate benchmark to which the qualified rate refers (
i.e.,
six-month CME Term SOFR). See paragraph (b)(2) of this section for the treatment of a contemporaneous noncovered modification.
(v)
Example 5: Compensation for a modification to a customary financial covenant
—(A)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (j)(6)(i)(A) of this section (
Example 1
), except that, at the same time as and for reasons unrelated to the LIBOR replacement modification with basis adjustment spread, B and L also modify customary financial covenants in the debt instrument in a manner that benefits B. In exchange for the modification of customary financial covenants, B agrees to add another 30 basis points to the rate such that, once all modifications are effective, the debt instrument pays interest at a rate of six-month CME Term SOFR plus 172.826 basis points.
(B)
Analysis.
As concluded in paragraph (j)(6)(i)(B) of this section (
Example 1
), the portion of these modifications that implements the LIBOR replacement modification with basis adjustment spread is a covered modification of the debt instrument. However, the portion of these modifications that modifies customary financial covenants is not related to the replacement of LIBOR and, therefore, is not described in any of paragraphs (h)(1)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section and, therefore, is a noncovered modification of the debt instrument. Moreover, the portion of these modifications that adds 30 basis points to the rate changes the amount of cash flows on the debt
instrument, and the parties intend that change to compensate L for a modification to the debt instrument not described in paragraph (h)(1)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section (
i.e.,
the modification of customary financial covenants). Therefore, the portion of these modifications that adds those 30 basis points to the rate is described in paragraph (j)(2) of this section and, consequently, is a noncovered modification of the debt instrument. See paragraph (b)(2) of this section for the treatment of a contemporaneous noncovered modification.
(vi)
Example 6: Workout of distressed debt
—(A)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (j)(6)(i)(A) of this section (
Example 1
), except that B's financial condition has deteriorated since the issue date of the debt instrument and, to decrease the risk of B's default or bankruptcy, L agrees to subtract 50 basis points from the rate such that, once all modifications are effective, the debt instrument pays interest at a rate of six-month CME Term SOFR plus 92.826 basis points.
(B)
Analysis.
As concluded in paragraph (j)(6)(i)(B) of this section (
Example 1
), the portion of these modifications that implements the LIBOR replacement modification with basis adjustment spread is a covered modification of the debt instrument. However, the portion of these modifications that subtracts 50 basis points from the rate changes the amount of cash flows on the debt instrument, and that change is a concession granted to B because B is experiencing financial difficulty. Therefore, the portion of these modifications that subtracts those 50 basis points from the rate is described in paragraph (j)(3) of this section and, consequently, is a noncovered modification of the debt instrument. See paragraph (b)(2) of this section for the treatment of a contemporaneous noncovered modification.
(vii)
Example 7: Change in rights or obligations not derived from the modified contract
—(A)
Facts.
B is the issuer and L is the holder of a debt instrument (
Debt X
) with respect to which the facts are the same as in paragraph (j)(6)(i)(A) of this section (
Example 1
). In addition, B and L are the issuer and holder, respectively, of a second debt instrument (
Debt Y
). At the same time that the LIBOR replacement modification with basis adjustment spread occurs with respect to Debt X, B and L also modify customary financial covenants in Debt Y in a manner that benefits B. In exchange for the modification of customary financial covenants in Debt Y, B agrees to add another 30 basis points to the rate on Debt X such that, once all modifications are effective, Debt X pays interest at a rate of six-month CME Term SOFR plus 172.826 basis points.
(B)
Analysis.
As concluded in paragraph (j)(6)(i)(B) of this section (
Example 1
), the portion of these modifications that implements the LIBOR replacement modification with basis adjustment spread is a covered modification of Debt X. However, the portion of these modifications that adds 30 basis points to the rate on Debt X changes the amount of cash flows on Debt X, and the parties intend that change to compensate L for a change in rights or obligations that are not derived from Debt X (
i.e.,
the modification of customary financial covenants in Debt Y). Therefore, the portion of these modifications that adds those 30 basis points to the rate on Debt X is described in paragraph (j)(4) of this section and, consequently, is a noncovered modification of Debt X. See paragraph (b)(2) of this section for the treatment of a contemporaneous noncovered modification.
(k)
Applicability date.
This section applies to a modification of the terms of a contract that occurs on or after March 7, 2022. A taxpayer may choose to apply this section to modifications of the terms of contracts that occur before March 7, 2022, provided that the taxpayer and all related parties (within the meaning of section 267(b) or section 707(b)(1) or within the meaning of § 1.150-1(b) for a taxpayer that is a State or local governmental unit (as defined in § 1.103-1(a)) or a 501(c)(3) organization (as defined in section 150(a)(4))) apply this section to all modifications of the terms of contracts that occur before that date. See section 7805(b)(7).

§ 1.1001-7
Computation of gain or loss for digital assets.
(a)
In general.
This section provides rules to determine the amount realized for purposes of computing the gain or loss upon the sale, exchange, or other disposition of digital assets, as defined in § 1.6045-1(a)(19) other than a digital asset not required to be reported as a digital asset pursuant to § 1.6045-1(c)(8)(ii), (iii), or (iv).
(b)
Amount realized in a sale, exchange, or other disposition of digital assets for cash, other property, or services
—(1)
Computation of amount realized
—(i)
In general.
If digital assets are sold or otherwise disposed of for cash, other property differing materially in kind or in extent, or services, the amount realized is the excess of:
(A) The sum of:
(
1
) Any cash received;
(
2
) The fair market value of any property received or, in the case of a debt instrument described in paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section, the amount determined under paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section; and
(
3
) The fair market value of any services received; reduced by
(B) The amount of digital asset transaction costs, as defined in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, allocable to the sale or disposition of the transferred digital asset, as determined under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section.
(ii)
Digital assets used to pay digital asset transaction costs.
If digital assets are used or withheld to pay digital asset transaction costs, as defined in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, such use or withholding is a disposition of the digital assets for services.
(iii)
Application of general rule to certain sales, exchanges, or other dispositions of digital assets.
The following paragraphs (b)(1)(iii)(A) through (C) of this section apply the rules of this section to certain sales, exchanges, or other dispositions of digital assets.
(A)
Sales or other dispositions of digital assets for cash.
The amount realized from the sale of digital assets for cash is the sum of the amount of cash received plus the fair market value of services received as described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, reduced by the amount of digital asset transaction costs allocable to the disposition of the transferred digital assets, as determined under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section.
(B)
Exchanges or other dispositions of digital assets for services, or certain property.
The amount realized on the exchange or other disposition of digital assets for services or property differing materially in kind or in extent, other than digital assets or debt instruments described in paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section, is the sum of the fair market value of such property and services received (including services received as described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section), reduced by the amount of digital asset transaction costs allocable to the disposition of the transferred digital assets, as determined under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section.
(C)
Exchanges of digital assets.
The amount realized on the exchange of one digital asset for another digital asset differing materially in kind or in extent is the sum of the fair market value of the digital asset received plus the fair market value of services received as described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, reduced by the amount of digital asset transaction costs allocable to the disposition of the transferred digital asset, as determined under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section.
(iv)
Debt instrument issued in exchange for digital assets.
For purposes of this section, if a debt instrument is issued in exchange for digital assets and the debt instrument is subject to § 1.1001-1(g), the amount attributable to the debt instrument is determined under § 1.1001-1(g) (in general, the issue price of the debt instrument).
(2)
Digital asset transaction costs
—(i)
Definition.
The term
digital asset transaction costs
means the amounts paid in cash or property (including digital assets) to effect the sale, disposition or acquisition of a digital asset. Digital asset transaction costs include transaction fees, transfer taxes, and commissions.
(ii)
Allocation of digital asset transaction costs.
This paragraph (b)(2)(ii) provides the rules for allocating digital asset transaction costs to the sale or disposition of a digital asset. Accordingly, any other allocation or specific
assignment of digital asset transaction costs is disregarded.
(A)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, the total digital asset transaction costs paid by the taxpayer in connection with the sale or disposition of digital assets are allocable to the sale or disposition of the digital assets.
(B)
Special rule for allocation of certain cascading digital asset transaction costs.
This paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) provides a special rule in the case of a transaction described in paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(C) of this section (original transaction) and for which digital assets are withheld from digital assets acquired in the original transaction to pay the digital asset transaction costs to effect the original transaction. The total digital asset transaction costs paid by the taxpayer to effect both the original transaction and any disposition of the withheld digital assets are allocable exclusively to the disposition of digital assets in the original transaction.
(3)
Time for determining fair market value of digital assets.
Generally, the fair market value of a digital asset is determined as of the date and time of the sale or disposition of the digital asset.
(4)
Special rule when the fair market value of property or services cannot be determined.
If the fair market value of the property (including digital assets) or services received in exchange for digital assets cannot be determined with reasonable accuracy, the fair market value of such property or services must be determined by reference to the fair market value of the digital assets transferred as of the date and time of the exchange. This paragraph (b)(4), however, does not apply to a debt instrument described in paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section.
(5)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section. Unless the facts specifically state otherwise, the transactions described in the following examples occur after the applicability date set forth in paragraph (c) of this section. For purposes of the examples under this paragraph (b)(5), assume that TP is a digital asset investor, and each unit of digital asset A, B, and C is materially different in kind or in extent from the other units.
See
§ 1.1012-1(h)(4) for examples illustrating the determination of basis of digital assets.
(i)
Example 1: Exchange of digital assets for services
—(A)
Facts.
TP owns a total of 20 units of digital asset A, and each unit has an adjusted basis of $0.50. X, an unrelated person, agrees to perform cleaning services for TP in exchange for 10 units of digital asset A, which together have a fair market value of $10. The fair market value of the services performed by X also equals $10. X then performs the services, and TP transfers 10 units of digital asset A to X. Additionally, TP pays $1 in cash of transaction fee to dispose of digital asset A.
(B)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, TP has a disposition of 10 units of digital asset A for services received. Under paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, TP has digital asset transaction costs of $1, which must be allocated to the disposition of digital asset A. Under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, TP's amount realized on the disposition of the units of digital asset A is $9, which is the fair market value of the services received, $10, reduced by the digital asset transaction costs allocated to the disposition of digital asset A, $1. TP recognizes a gain of $4 on the exchange ($9 amount realized reduced by $5 adjusted basis in 10 units).
(ii)
Example 2: Digital asset transaction costs paid in cash in an exchange of digital assets
—(A)
Facts.
TP owns a total of 10 units of digital asset A, and each unit has an adjusted basis of $0.50. TP uses BEX, an unrelated third party, to effect the exchange of 10 units of digital asset A for 20 units of digital asset B. At the time of the exchange, each unit of digital asset A has a fair market value of $2 and each unit of digital asset B has a fair market value of $1. BEX charges $2 per transaction, which BEX requires its customers to pay in cash. At the time of the transaction, TP pays BEX $2 in cash.
(B)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, TP has digital asset transaction costs of $2. Under paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, TP must allocate such costs ($2) to the disposition of the 10 units of digital asset A. Under paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (b)(3)
of this section, TP's amount realized from the exchange is $18, which is the fair market value of the 20 units of digital asset B received ($20) as of the date and time of the transaction, reduced by the digital asset transaction costs allocated to the disposition of digital asset A ($2). TP recognizes a gain of $13 on the exchange ($18 amount realized reduced by $5 adjusted basis in the 10 units of digital asset A).
(iii)
Example 3: Digital asset transaction costs paid with other digital assets
—(A)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(A) of this section (the facts in
Example 2
), except that BEX requires its customers to pay transaction fees using units of digital asset C. TP has an adjusted basis in each unit of digital asset C of $0.50. TP transfers 2 units of digital asset C to BEX to effect the exchange of digital asset A for digital asset B. TP also pays to BEX an additional unit of digital asset C for services rendered by BEX to effect the disposition of digital asset C for payment of the transaction costs. The fair market value of each unit of digital asset C is $1.
(B)
Analysis.
TP disposes of 3 units of digital asset C for services described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section. Therefore, under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, TP has digital asset transaction costs of $3. Under paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, TP must allocate $2 of such costs to the disposition of the 10 units of digital asset A. TP must also allocate $1 of such costs to the disposition of the 3 units of digital asset C. None of the digital asset transaction costs are allocable to the acquired units of digital asset B. Under paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (b)(3) of this section, TP's amount realized on the disposition of digital asset A is $18, which is the excess of the fair market value of the 20 units of digital asset B received ($20) as of the date and time of the transaction over the allocated digital asset transaction costs ($2). Also, under paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (b)(3) of this section, TP's amount realized on the disposition of the 3 units of digital asset C is $2, which is the excess of the gross proceeds determined as of the date and time of the transaction over the allocated digital asset transaction costs of $1. TP recognizes a gain of $13 on the disposition of 10 units of digital asset A ($18 amount realized over $5 adjusted basis) and a gain of $0.50 on the disposition of the 3 units of digital asset C ($2 amount realized over $1.50 adjusted basis).
(iv)
Example 4: Digital asset transaction costs withheld from the transferred digital assets in an exchange of digital assets
—(A)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(A) of this section (the facts in
Example 2
), except that BEX requires its payment be withheld from the units of the digital asset transferred. At the time of the transaction, BEX withholds 1 unit of digital asset A. TP exchanges the remaining 9 units of digital asset A for 18 units of digital asset B.
(B)
Analysis.
The withholding of 1 unit of digital asset A is a disposition of a digital asset for services within the meaning of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section. Under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, TP has digital asset transaction costs of $2. Under paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, TP must allocate such costs to the disposition of the 10 units of digital asset A. Under paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (b)(3) of this section, TP's amount realized on the 10 units of digital asset A is $18, which is the excess of the fair market value of the 18 units of digital asset B received ($18) and the fair market value of services received ($2) as of the date and time of the transaction over the allocated digital asset transaction costs ($2). TP recognizes a gain on the 10 units of digital asset A transferred of $13 ($18 amount realized reduced by $5 adjusted basis in the 10 units).
(v)
Example 5: Digital asset transaction fees withheld from the acquired digital assets in an exchange of digital assets
—(A)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (b)(5)(iv)(A) of this section (the facts in
Example 4
), except that BEX requires its payment be withheld from the units of the digital asset acquired. At the time of the transaction, BEX withholds 3 units of digital asset B, 2 units of which effect the exchange of digital asset A for digital asset B and 1 unit of which effects the disposition of digital asset B for payment of the transaction fees. TP does not make an identification to BEX identifying other units of B as the units disposed.
(B)
Analysis.
The withholding of 3 units of digital asset B is a disposition of digital assets for services within the meaning of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section. Under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, TP has digital asset transaction costs of $3. Under paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, TP must allocate such costs to the disposition of the 10 units of digital asset A in the original transaction. Under paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (b)(3) of this section, TP's amount realized on the 10 units of digital asset A is $17, which is the excess of the fair market value of the 20 units of digital asset B received ($20) as of the date and time of the transaction over the allocated digital asset transaction costs ($3). TP's amount realized on the disposition of the 3 units of digital asset B used to pay digital asset transaction costs is $3, which is the fair market value of services received at the time of the transaction. TP recognizes a gain on the 10 units of digital asset A transferred of $12 ($17 amount realized reduced by $5 adjusted basis in the 10 units). TP recognizes $0 in gain or loss on the 3 units of digital asset B withheld ($3 amount realized reduced by $3 (adjusted basis in the 3 units)).
See
§ 1.1012-1(j)(3)(iii) for the special rule for identifying the basis and holding period of the 3 units withheld.
(c)
Applicability date.
This section applies to all sales, exchanges, and dispositions of digital assets on or after January 1, 2025.
[T.D. 10000, 89 FR 56543, July 9, 2024]
§ 1.1002-1
Sales or exchanges.
(a)
General rule.
The general rule with respect to gain or loss realized upon the sale or exchange of property as determined under section 1001 is that the entire amount of such gain or loss is recognized except in cases where specific provisions of subtitle A of the code provide otherwise.
(b)
Strict construction of exceptions from general rule.
The exceptions from the general rule requiring the recognition of all gains and losses, like other exceptions from a rule of taxation of general and uniform application, are strictly construed and do not extend either beyond the words or the underlying assumptions and purposes of the exception. Nonrecognition is accorded by the Code only if the exchange is one which satisfies both (1) the specific description in the Code of an excepted exchange, and (2) the underlying purpose for which such exchange is excepted from the general rule. The exchange must be germane to, and a necessary incident of, the investment or enterprise in hand. The relationship of the exchange to the venture or enterprise is always material, and the surrounding facts and circumstances must be shown. As elsewhere, the taxpayer claiming the benefit of the exception must show himself within the exception.
(c)
Certain exceptions to general rule.
Exceptions to the general rule are made, for example, by sections 351(a), 354, 361(a), 371(a)(1), 371(b)(1), 721, 1031, 1035 and 1036. These sections describe certain specific exchanges of property in which at the time of the exchange particular differences exist between the property parted with and the property acquired, but such differences are more formal than substantial. As to these, the Code provides that such differences shall not be deemed controlling, and that gain or loss shall not be recognized at the time of the exchange. The underlying assumption of these exceptions is that the new property is substantially a continuation of the old investment still unliquidated; and, in the case of reorganizations, that the new enterprise, the new corporate structure, and the new property are substantially continuations of the old still unliquidated.
(d)
Exchange.
Ordinarily, to constitute an exchange, the transaction must be a reciprocal transfer of property, as distinguished from a transfer of property for a money consideration only.

# Basis Rules of General Application
§ 1.1011-1
Adjusted basis.
The adjusted basis for determining the gain or loss from the sale or other disposition of property is the cost or other basis prescribed in section 1012 or other applicable provisions of subtitle A of the code, adjusted to the extent provided in sections 1016, 1017, and 1018 or as otherwise specifically provided
for under applicable provisions of internal revenue laws.
§ 1.1011-2
Bargain sale to a charitable organization.
(a)
In general.
(1) If for the taxable year a charitable contributions deduction is allowable under section 170 by reason of a sale or exchange of property, the taxpayer's adjusted basis of such property for purposes of determining gain from such sale or exchange must be computed as provided in section 1011(b) and paragraph (b) of this section. If after applying the provisions of section 170 for the taxable year, including the percentage limitations of section 170(b), no deduction is allowable under that section by reason of the sale or exchange of the property, section 1011(b) does not apply and the adjusted basis of the property is not required to be apportioned pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section. In such case the entire adjusted basis of the property is to be taken into account in determining gain from the sale or exchange, as provided in § 1.1011-1(e). In ascertaining whether or not a charitable contributions deduction is allowable under section 170 for the taxable year for such purposes, that section is to be applied without regard to this section and the amount by which the contributed portion of the property must be reduced under section 170(e)(1) is the amount determined by taking into account the amount of gain which would have been ordinary income or long-term capital gain if the contributed portion of the property had been sold by the donor at its fair market value at the time of the sale or exchange.
(2) If in the taxable year there is a sale or exchange of property which gives rise to a charitable contribution which is carried over under section 170(b)(1)(D)(ii) or section 170(d) to a subsequent taxable year or is postponed under section 170(a)(3) to a subsequent taxable year, section 1011(b) and paragraph (b) of this section must be applied for purposes of apportioning the adjusted basis of the property for the year of the sale or exchange, whether or not such contribution is allowable as a deduction under section 170 in such subsequent year.
(3) If property is transferred subject to an indebtedness, the amount of the indebtedness must be treated as an amount realized for purposes of determining whether there is a sale or exchange to which section 1011(b) and this section apply, even though the transferee does not agree to assume or pay the indebtedness.
(4)(i) Section 1011(b) and this section apply where property is sold or exchanged in return for an obligation to pay an annuity and a charitable contributions deduction is allowable under section 170 by reason of such sale or exchange.
(ii) If in such case the annuity received in exchange for the property is nonassignable, or is assignable but only to the charitable organization to which the property is sold or exchanged, and if the transferor is the only annuitant or the transferor and a designated survivor annuitant or annuitants are the only annuitants, any gain on such exchange is to be reported as provided in example (8) in paragraph (c) of this section. In determining the period over which gain may be reported as provided in such example, the life expectancy of the survivor annuitant may not be taken into account. The fact that the transferor may retain the right to revoke the survivor's annuity or relinquish his own right to the annuity will not be considered, for purposes of this subdivision, to make the annuity assignable to someone other than the charitable organization. Gain on an exchange of the type described in this subdivision pursuant to an agreement which is entered into after December 19, 1969, and before May 3, 1971, may be reported as provided in example (8) in paragraph (c) of this section, even though the annuity is assignable.
(iii) In the case of an annuity to which subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph applies, the gain unreported by the transferor with respect to annuity payments not yet due when the following events occur is not required to be included in gross income of any person where—
(
a
) The transferor dies before the entire amount of gain has been reported and there is no surviving annuitant, or
(
b
) The transferor relinquishes the annuity to the charitable organization.
If the transferor dies before the entire amount of gain on a two-life annuity has been reported, the unreported gain is required to be reported by the surviving annuitant or annuitants with respect to the annuity payments received by them.
(b)
Apportionment of adjusted basis.
For purposes of determining gain on a sale or exchange to which this paragraph applies, the adjusted basis of the property which is sold or exchanged shall be that portion of the adjusted basis of the entire property which bears the same ratio to the adjusted basis as the amount realized bears to the fair market value of the entire property. The amount of such gain which shall be treated as ordinary income (or long-term capital gain) shall be that amount which bears the same ratio to the ordinary income (or long-term capital gain) which would have been recognized if the entire property had been sold by the donor at its fair market value at the time of the sale or exchange as the amount realized on the sale or exchange bears to the fair market value of the entire property at such time. The terms
ordinary income
and
long-term capital gain,
as used in this section, have the same meaning as they have in paragraph (a) of § 1.170A-4. For determining the portion of the adjusted basis, ordinary income, and long- term capital gain allocated to the contributed portion of the property for purposes of applying section 170(e)(1) and paragraph (a) of § 1.170A-4 to the contributed portion of the property, and for determining the donee's basis in such contributed portion, see paragraph (c) (2) and (4) of § 1.170A-4. For determining the holding period of such contributed portion, see section 1223(2) and the regulations thereunder.
(c)
Illustrations.
The application of this section may be illustrated by the following examples, which are supplemented by other examples in paragraph (d) of § 1.170A-4:

# Example 1.
In 1970, A, a calendar-year individual taxpayer, sells to a church for $4,000 stock held for more than 6 months which has an adjusted basis of $4,000 and a fair market value of $10,000. A's contribution base for 1970, as defined in section 170(b)(1)(F), is $100,000, and during that year he makes no other charitable contributions. Thus, A makes a charitable contribution to the church of $6,000 ($10,000 value −$4,000 amount realized). Without regard to this section, A is allowed a deduction under section 170 of $6,000 for his charitable contribution to the church, since there is no reduction under section 170(e)(1) with respect to the long-term capital gain. Accordingly, under paragraph (b) of this section the adjusted basis for determining gain on the bargain sale is $1,600 ($4,000 adjusted basis × $4,000 amount realized / $10,000 value of property). A has recognized long-term capital gain of $2,400 ($4,000 amount realized − $1,600 adjusted basis) on the bargain sale.

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in example (1) except that A also makes a charitable contribution in 1970 of $50,000 cash to the church. By reason of section 170(b)(1)(A), the deduction allowed under section 170 for 1970 is $50,000 for the amount of cash contributed to the church; however, the $6,000 contribution of property is carried over to 1971 under section 170(d). Under paragraphs (a)(2) and (b) of this section the adjusted basis for determining gain for 1970 on the bargain sale in that year is $1,600 ($4,000 × $4,000 / $10,000). A has a recognized long-term capital gain for 1970 of $2,400 ($4,000 − $1,600) on the sale.

# Example 3.
In 1970, C, a calendar-year individual taxpayer, makes a charitable contribution of $50,000 cash to a church. In addition, he sells for $4,000 to a private foundation not described in section 170(b)(1)(E) stock held for more than 6 months which has an adjusted basis of $4,000 and a fair market value of $10,000. Thus, C makes a charitable contribution of $6,000 of such property to the private foundation ($10,000 value − $4,000 amount realized). C's contribution base for 1970, as defined in section 170(b)(1)(F), is $100,000, and during that year he makes no other charitable contributions. By reason of section 170(b)(1)(A), the deduction allowed under section 170 for 1970 is $50,000 for the amount of cash contributed to the church. Under section 170(e)(1)(B)(ii) and paragraphs (a)(1) and (c)(2)(i) of § 1.170A-4, the $6,000 contribution of stock is reduced to $4,800 ($6,000 − [50% × ($6,000 value of contributed portion of stock − $3,600 adjusted basis)]). However, by reason of section 170(b)(1)(B)(ii), applied without regard to section 1011(b), no deduction is allowed under section 170 for 1970 or any other year for the reduced contribution of $4,800 to the private foundation. Accordingly, paragraph (b) of this section does not apply for purposes of apportioning the adjusted basis of the stock sold to the private foundation, and under section 1.1011-1(e) the recognized gain on the bargain sale is $0 ($4,000 amount realized − $4,000 adjusted basis).

# Example 4.
In 1970, B, a calendar-year individual taxpayer, sells to a church for $2,000 stock held for not more than 6 months which has an adjusted basis of $4,000 and a fair market value of $10,000. B's contribution base for
1970, as defined in section 170(b)(1)(F), is $20,000 and during such year B makes no other charitable contributions. Thus, he makes a charitable contribution to the church of $8,000 ($10,000 value − $2,000 amount realized). Under paragraph (b) of this section the adjusted basis for determining gain on the bargain sale is $800 ($4,000 adjusted basis × $2,000 amount realized / $10,000 value of stock). Accordingly, B, has a recognized short-term capital gain of $1,200 ($2,000 amount realized − $800 adjusted basis) on the bargain sale. After applying section 1011(b) and paragraphs (a)(1) and (c)(2)(i) of § 1.170A-4, B is allowed a charitable contributions deduction for 1970 of $3,200 ($8,000 value of gift − [$8,000 − ($4,000 adjusted basis of property × $8,000 value of gift / $10,000 value of property)]).

# Example 5.
The facts are the same as in Example 4 except that B sells the property to the church for $4,000. Thus, B makes a charitable contribution to the church of $6,000 ($10,000 value −$4,000 amount realized). Under paragraph (b) of this section the adjusted basis for determining gain on the bargain sale is $1,600 ($4,000 adjusted basis × $4,000 amount realized / $10,000 value of stock). Accordingly, B has a recognized short-term capital gain of $2,400 ($4,000 amount realized − $1,600 adjusted basis) on the bargain sale. After applying section 1011(b) and paragraphs (a)(1) and (c)(2)(i) of § 1.170A-4, B is allowed a charitable contributions deduction for 1970 of $2,400 ($6,000 value of gift − [$6,000 − ($4,000 adjusted basis of property × $6,000 value of gifts / $10,000 value of property)]).

# Example 6.
The facts are the same as in Example 4 except that B sells the property to the church for $6,000. Thus, B makes a charitable contribution to the church of $4,000 ($10,000 value −$6,000 amount realized). Under paragraph (b) of this section the adjusted basis for determining gain on the bargain sale is $2,400 ($4,000 adjusted basis × $6,000 amount realized/$10,000 value of stock). Accordingly, B has a recognized short-term capital gain of $3,600 ($6,000 amount realized −$2,400 adjusted basis) on the bargain sale. After applying section 1011(b) and paragraphs (a)(1) and (c)(2)(i) of § 1.170A-4, B is allowed a charitable contributions deduction for 1970 of $1,600 ($4,000 value of gift −[$4,000 −($4,000 adjusted basis of property × $4,000 value of gift/$10,000 value of property]).

# Example 7.
In 1970, C, a calendar-year individual taxpayer, sells to a church for $4,000 tangible personal property used in his business for more than 6 months which has an adjusted basis of $4,000 and a fair market value of $10,000. Thus, C makes a charitable contribution to the church of $6,000 ($10,000 value −$4,000 adjusted basis). C's contribution base for 1970, as defined in section 170(b)(1)(F) is $100,000 and during such year he makes no other charitable contributions. If C had sold the property at its fair market value at the time of its contribution, it is assumed that under section 1245 $4,000 of the gain of $6,000 ($10,000 value −$4,000 adjusted basis) would have been treated as ordinary icome. Thus, there would have been long-term capital gain of $2,000. It is also assumed that the church does not put the property to an unrelated use, as defined in paragraph (b)(3) of § 1.170A-4. Under paragraph (b) of this section the adjusted basis for determining gain on the bargain sale is $1,600 ($4,000 adjusted basis × $4,000 amount realized/$10,000 value of property). Accordingly, C has a recognized gain of $2,400 ($4,000 amount realized −$1,600 adjusted basis) on the bargain sale, consisting of ordinary income of $1,600 ($4,000 ordinary income × $4,000 amount realized/$10,000 value of property) and of long-term capital gain of $800 ($2,000 long-term gain × $4,000 amount realized/$10,000 value of property). After applying section 1011(b) and paragraphs (a) and (c)(2)(i) of § 1.170A-4, C is allowed a charitable contributions deduction for 1970 of $3,600 ($6,000 gift −[$4,000 ordinary income × $6,000 value of gift/$10,000 value of property]).

# Example 8.
(a) On January 1, 1970, A, a male of age 65, transfers capital assets consisting of securities held for more than 6 months to a church in exchange for a promise by the church to pay A a nonassignable annuity of $5,000 per year for life. The annuity is payable monthly with the first payment to be made on February 1, 1970. A's contribution base for 1970, as defined in section 170(b)(1)(F), is $200,000, and during that year he makes no other charitable contributions. On the date of transfer the securities have a fair market value of $100,000 and an adjusted basis to A of $20,000.
(b) The present value of the right of a male age 65 to receive a life annuity of $5,000 per annum, payable in equal installments at the end of each monthly period, is $59,755 ($5,000 × [11.469 + 0.482]), determined in accordance with section 101(b) of the Code, paragraph (e)(1)(iii)(b)(2) of § 1.101-2, and section 3 of Rev. Rul. 62-216, C.B. 1962-2, 30. Thus, A makes a charitable contribution to the church of $40,245 ($100,000 −$59,755). See Rev. Rul. 84-162, 1984-2 C.B. 200, for transfers for which the valuation date falls after November 23, 1984. (See § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(

(c) Under paragraph (b) of this section, the adjusted basis for determining gain on the bargain sale is $11,951 ($20,000 × $59,755 / $100,000). Accordingly, A has a recognized long-term capital gain of $47,804 ($59,755 − $11,951) on the bargain sale. Such gain is to be reported by A ratably over the period of
years measured by the expected return multiple under the contract, but only from that portion of the annual payments which is a return of his investment in the contract under section 72 of the Code. For such purposes, the investment in the contract is $59,755, that is, the present value of the annuity.
(d) The computation and application of the exclusion ratio, the gain, and the ordinary annuity income are as follows, determined by using the expected return multiple of 15.0 applicable under table I of § 1.72-9:
A's expected return (annual payments of $5,000 × 15)
$75,000.00
Exclusion ratio ($59,755 investment in contract divided by expected return of $75,000)
79.7%
Annual exclusion (annual payments of $5,000 × 79.7%)
$3,985.00
Ordinary annuity income ($5,000−$3,985)
$1,015.00
Long-term capital gain per year ($47,804/15) with respect to the annual exclusion
$3,186.93
(e) The exclusion ratio of 79.7 percent applies throughout the life of the contract. During the first 15 years of the annuity, A is required to report ordinary income of $1,015 and long-term capital gain of $3,186.93 with respect to the annuity payments he receives. After the total long-term capital gain of $47,804 has been reported by A, he is required to report only ordinary income of $1,015.00 per annum with respect to the annuity payments he receives.

§ 1.1012-1
Basis of property.
(a)
General rule.
In general, the basis of property is the cost thereof. The cost is the amount paid for such property in cash or other property. This general rule is subject to exceptions stated in subchapter O (relating to gain or loss on the disposition of property), subchapter C (relating to corporate distributions and adjustments), subchapter K (relating to partners and partnerships), and subchapter P (relating to capital gains and losses), chapter 1 of the code.
(b)
Real estate taxes as part of cost.
In computing the cost of real property, the purchaser shall not take into account any amount paid to the seller as reimbursement for real property taxes which are treated under section 164(d) as imposed upon the purchaser. This rule applies whether or not the contract of sale calls for the purchaser to reimburse the seller for such real estate taxes paid or to be paid by the seller. On the other hand, where the purchaser pays (or assumes liability for) real estate taxes which are treated under section 164(d) as imposed upon the seller, such taxes shall be considered part of the cost of the property. It is immaterial whether or not the contract of sale specifies that the sale price has been reduced by, or is in any way intended to reflect, real estate taxes allocable to the seller under section 164(d). For illustrations of the application of this paragraph, see paragraph (b) of § 1.1001-1.
(c)
Sale of stock
—(1)
In general.
(i) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section (dealing with stock for which the average basis method is permitted), if a taxpayer sells or transfers shares of stock in a corporation that the taxpayer purchased or acquired on different dates or at different prices and the taxpayer does not adequately identify the lot from which the stock is sold or transferred, the stock sold or transferred is charged against the earliest lot the taxpayer purchased or acquired to determine the basis and holding period of the stock. If the earliest lot purchased or acquired is held in a stock certificate that represents multiple lots of stock, and the taxpayer does not adequately identify the lot from which the stock is sold or transferred, the stock sold or transferred is charged against the earliest lot included in the certificate. See paragraphs (c)(2), (c)(3), and (c)(4) of this section for rules on what constitutes an adequate identification.
(ii) A taxpayer must determine the basis of identical stock (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(4) of this section) by averaging the cost of each share if the stock is purchased at separate times on the same calendar day in executing a single trade order and the broker executing the trade provides a single confirmation that reports an aggregate total cost or an average cost per share. However, the taxpayer may
determine the basis of the stock by the actual cost per share if the taxpayer notifies the broker in writing of this intent. The taxpayer must notify the broker by the earlier of the date of the sale of any of the stock for which the taxpayer received the confirmation or one year after the date of the confirmation. A broker may extend the one-year period but the taxpayer must notify the broker no later than the date of sale of any of the stock.
(2)
Identification of stock.
An adequate identification is made if it is shown that certificates representing shares of stock from a lot which was purchased or acquired on a certain date or for a certain price were delivered to the taxpayer's transferee. Except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (3) or (4) of this paragraph, such stock certificates delivered to the transferee constitute the stock sold or transferred by the taxpayer. Thus, unless the requirements of subparagraph (3) or (4) of this paragraph are met, the stock sold or transferred is charged to the lot to which the certificates delivered to the transferee belong, whether or not the taxpayer intends, or instructs his broker or other agent, to sell or transfer stock from a lot purchased or acquired on a different date or for a different price.
(3)
Identification on confirmation document.
(i) Where the stock is left in the custody of a broker or other agent, an adequate identification is made if—
(
a
) At the time of the sale or transfer, the taxpayer specifies to such broker or other agent having custody of the stock the particular stock to be sold or transferred, and
(
b
) Within a reasonable time thereafter, confirmation of such specification is set forth in a written document from such broker or other agent.
Stock identified pursuant to this subdivision is the stock sold or transferred by the taxpayer, even though stock certificates from a different lot are delivered to the taxpayer's transferee.
(ii) Where a single stock certificate represents stock from different lots, where such certificate is held by the taxpayer rather than his broker or other agent, and where the taxpayer sells a part of the stock represented by such certificate through a broker or other agent, an adequate identification is made if—
(
a
) At the time of the delivery of the certificate to the broker or other agent, the taxpayer specifies to such broker or other agent the particular stock to be sold or transferred, and
(
b
) Within a reasonable time thereafter, confirmation of such specification is set forth in a written document from such broker or agent.
Where part of the stock represented by a single certificate is sold or transferred directly by the taxpayer to the purchaser or transferee instead of through a broker or other agent, an adequate identification is made if the taxpayer maintains a written record of the particular stock which he intended to sell or transfer.
(4)
Stock held by a trustee, executor, or administrator.
(i) A trustee or executor or administrator of an estate holding stock (not left in the custody of a broker) makes an adequate identification if the trustee, executor, or administrator—
(
a
) Specifies in writing in the books and records of the trust or estate the particular stock to be sold, transferred, or distributed;
(
b
) In the case of a distribution, furnishes the distributee with a written document identifying the particular stock distributed; and
(
c
) In the case of a sale or transfer through a broker or other agent, specifies to the broker or agent the particular stock to be sold or transferred, and within a reasonable time thereafter the broker or agent confirms the specification in a written document.
(ii) The stock the trust or estate identifies under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section is the stock treated as sold, transferred, or distributed, even if the trustee, executor, or administrator delivers stock certificates from a different lot.
(5)
Subsequent sales.
If stock identified under subparagraph (3) or (4) of this paragraph as belonging to a particular lot is sold, transferred, or distributed, the stock so identified shall be deemed to have been sold, transferred, or distributed, and such sale, transfer, or distribution will be taken into consideration in identifying the
taxpayer's remaining stock for purposes of subsequent sales, transfers, or distributions.
(6)
Bonds.
Paragraphs (1) through (5), (8), and (9) of this section apply to the sale or transfer of bonds.
(7)
Book-entry securities.
(i) In applying the provisions of subparagraph (3)(i)(
a
) of this paragraph in the case of a sale or transfer of a book-entry security (as defined in subdivision (iii) (
a
) of this subparagraph) which is made after December 31, 1970, pursuant to a written instruction by the taxpayer, a specification by the taxpayer of the unique lot number which he has assigned to the lot which contains the securities being sold or transferred shall constitute specification as required by such subparagraph. The specification of the lot number shall be made either—
(
a
) In such written instruction, or
(
b
) In the case of a taxpayer in whose name the book entry by the Reserve Bank is made, in a list of lot numbers with respect to all book-entry securities on the books of the Reserve Bank sold or transferred on that date by the taxpayer, provided such list is mailed to or received by the Reserve Bank on or before the Reserve Bank's next business day.
This subdivision shall apply only if the taxpayer assigns lot numbers in numerical sequence to successive purchases of securities of the same loan title (series) and maturity date, except that securities of the same loan title (series) and maturity date which are purchased at the same price on the same date may be included within the same lot.
(ii) In applying paragraph (c)(3)(i)(
b
) of this section to a sale or transfer of a book-entry security pursuant to a taxpayer's written instruction, a confirmation is made by furnishing to the taxpayer a written advice of transaction from the Reserve Bank or other person through whom the taxpayer sells or transfers the securities. The confirmation document must describe the securities and specify the date of the transaction and amount of securities sold or transferred.
(iii) For purposes of this paragraph (c)(7):
(
a
) The term
book-entry security
means a transferable Treasury bond, note, certificate of indebtedness, or bill issued under the Second Liberty Bond Act (31 U.S.C. 774(2)), as amended, or other security of the United States (as defined in paragraph (c)(7)(iii)(
b
) of this section) in the form of an entry made as prescribed in 31 CFR Part 306, or other comparable Federal regulations, on the records of a Reserve Bank.
(
b
) The term
other security of the United States
means a bond, note, certificate of indebtedness, bill, debenture, or similar obligation which is subject to the provisions of 31 CFR part 306 or other comparable Federal regulations and which is issued by (
1
) any department or agency of the Government of the United States, or (
2
) the Federal National Mortgage Association, the Federal Home Loan Banks, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, the Federal Land Banks, the Federal Intermediate Credit Banks, the Banks for Cooperatives, or the Tennessee Valley Authority;
(
c
) The term
serially-numbered advice of transaction
means the confirmation (prescribed in 31 CFR 306.116) issued by the Reserve Bank which is identifiable by a unique number and indicates that a particular written instruction to the Reserve Bank with respect to the deposit or withdrawal of a specified book-entry security (or securities) has been executed; and
(
d
) The term
Reserve Bank
means a Federal Reserve Bank and its branches acting as Fiscal Agent of the United States.
(8)
Time for making identification.
For purposes of this paragraph (c), an adequate identification of stock is made at the time of sale, transfer, delivery, or distribution if the identification is made no later than the earlier of the settlement date or the time for settlement required by Rule 15c6-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 17 CFR 240.15c6-1 (or its successor). A standing order or instruction for the specific identification of stock is treated as an adequate identification made at the time of sale, transfer, delivery, or distribution.
(9)
Method of writing.
(i) A written confirmation, record, document, instruction, notification, or advice includes a writing in electronic format.
(ii) A broker or agent may include the written confirmation required under this paragraph (c) in an account statement or other document the broker or agent periodically provides to the taxpayer if the broker or agent provides the statement or other document within a reasonable time after the sale or transfer.
(10)
Method for determining basis of stock.
A method of determining the basis of stock, including a method of identifying stock sold under this paragraph (c) and the average basis method described in paragraph (e) of this section, is not a method of accounting. Therefore, a change in a method of determining the basis of stock is not a change in method of accounting to which sections 446 and 481 apply.
(11)
Effective/applicability date.
Paragraphs (c)(1), (c)(4), (c)(6), (c)(7)(ii), (c)(7)(iii)(
a
), (c)(8), (c)(9), and (c)(10) of this section apply for taxable years beginning after October 18, 2010.
(d)
Obligations issued as part of an investment unit.
For purposes of determining the basis of the individual elements of an investment unit (as defined in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(
a
) of § 1.1232-3) consisting of an obligation and an option (which is not an excluded option under paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(
c
) of § 1.1232-3), security, or other property, the cost of such investment unit shall be allocated to such individual elements on the basis of their respective fair market values. In the case of the initial issuance of an investment unit consisting of an obligation and an option, security, or other property, where neither the obligation nor the option, security, or other property has a readily ascertainable fair market value, the portion of the cost of the unit which is allocable to the obligation shall be an amount equal to the issue price of the obligation as determined under paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(
a
) of § 1.1232-3.
(e)
Election to use average basis method
—(1)
In general.
Notwithstanding paragraph (c) of this section, and except as provided in paragraph (e)(8) of this section, a taxpayer may use the average basis method described in paragraph (e)(7) of this section to determine the cost or other basis of identical shares of stock if—
(i) The taxpayer leaves shares of stock in a regulated investment company (as defined in paragraph (e)(5) of this section) or shares of stock acquired after December 31, 2010, in connection with a dividend reinvestment plan (as defined in paragraph (e)(6) of this section) with a custodian or agent in an account maintained for the acquisition or redemption, sale, or other disposition of shares of the stock; and
(ii) The taxpayer acquires identical shares of stock at different prices or bases in the account.
(2)
Determination of method.
(i) If a taxpayer places shares of stock described in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section acquired on or after January 1, 2012, in the custody of a broker (as defined by section 6045(c)(1)), including by transfer from an account with another broker, the basis of the shares is determined in accordance with the broker's default method, unless the taxpayer notifies the broker that the taxpayer elects another permitted method. The taxpayer must report gain or loss using the method the taxpayer elects or, if the taxpayer fails to make an election, the broker's default method.
See
paragraphs (e)(9)(i) and (e)(9)(v),
Example 2,
of this section.
(ii) The provisions of this paragraph (e)(2) are illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
(i) In connection with a dividend reinvestment plan, Taxpayer B acquires 100 shares of G Company in 2012 and 100 shares of G Company in 2013, in an account B maintains with R Broker. B notifies R in writing that B elects to use the average basis method to compute the basis of the shares of G Company. In 2014, B transfers the shares of G Company to an account with S Broker. B does not notify S of the basis determination method B chooses to use for the shares of G Company, and S's default method is first-in, first-out. In 2015, B purchases 200 shares of G Company in the account with S. In 2016, B instructs S to sell 150 shares of G Company.
(ii) Because B does not notify S of a basis determination method for the shares of G Company, under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, the basis of the 150 shares of G Company S sells for B in 2016 must be determined under S's default method, first-in, first-out.
(3)
Shares of stock.
For purposes of this paragraph (e), securities issued by unit investment trusts described in paragraph (e)(5) of this section are treated as shares of stock and the term
share
or
shares
includes fractions of a share.
(4)
Identical stock.
For purposes of this paragraph (e),
identical shares of stock
means stock with the same Committee on Uniform Security Identification Procedures (CUSIP) number or other security identifier number as permitted in published guidance of general applicability,
see
§ 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter.
(5)
Regulated investment company.
(i) For purposes of this paragraph, a
regulated investment company
means any domestic corporation (other than a personal holding company as defined in section 542) which meets the limitations of section 851(b) and § 1.851-2, and which is registered at all times during the taxable year under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (15 U.S.C. 80a-1 to 80b-2), either as a management company, or as a unit investment trust.
(ii) Notwithstanding subdivision (i), this paragraph shall not apply in the case of a unit investment trust unless it is one—
(
a
) Substantially all of the assets of which consist (
1
) of securities issued by a single management company (as defined in such Act) and securities acquired pursuant to subdivision (
b
) of this subdivision (ii), or (
2
) securities issued by a single other corporation, and
(
b
) Which has no power to invest in any other securities except securities issued by a single other management company, when permitted by such Act or the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
(6)
Dividend reinvestment plan
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of this paragraph (e), the term
dividend reinvestment plan
means any written plan, arrangement, or program under which at least 10 percent of every dividend (within the meaning of section 316) on any share of stock is reinvested in stock identical to the stock on which the dividend is paid. A plan is a dividend reinvestment plan if the plan documents require that at least 10 percent of any dividend paid is reinvested in identical stock even if the plan includes stock on which no dividends have ever been declared or paid or on which an issuer ceases paying dividends. A plan that holds one or more different stocks may permit a taxpayer to reinvest a different percentage of dividends in the stocks held. A dividend reinvestment plan may reinvest other distributions on stock, such as capital gain distributions, non-taxable returns of capital, and cash in lieu of fractional shares. The term dividend reinvestment plan includes both issuer administered dividend reinvestment plans and non-issuer administered dividend reinvestment plans.
(ii)
Acquisition of stock.
Stock is acquired in connection with a dividend reinvestment plan if the stock is acquired under that plan, arrangement, or program, or if the dividends and other distributions paid on the stock are subject to that plan, arrangement, or program. Shares of stock acquired in connection with a dividend reinvestment plan include the initial purchase of stock in the dividend reinvestment plan, transfers of identical stock into the dividend reinvestment plan, additional periodic purchases of identical stock in the dividend reinvestment plan, and identical stock acquired through reinvestment of the dividends or other distributions paid on the stock held in the plan.
(iii)
Dividends and other distributions paid after reorganization.
For purposes of this paragraph (e)(6), dividends and other distributions declared or announced before or pending a corporate action (such as a merger, consolidation, acquisition, split-off, or spin-off) involving the issuer and subsequently paid and reinvested in shares of stock in the successor entity or entities are treated as reinvested in shares of stock identical to the shares of stock of the issuer.
(iv)
Withdrawal from or termination of plan.
If a taxpayer withdraws stock from a dividend reinvestment plan or the plan administrator terminates the dividend reinvestment plan, the shares of identical stock the taxpayer acquires after the withdrawal or termination are not acquired in connection with a dividend reinvestment plan. The taxpayer may not use the average basis method after the withdrawal or termination but may use any other permissible basis determination method. See paragraph (e)(7)(v) of this section for
the basis of the shares after withdrawal or termination.
(7)
Computation of average basis
—(i)
In general.
Average basis is determined by averaging the basis of all shares of identical stock in an account regardless of holding period. However, for this purpose, shares of stock in a dividend reinvestment plan are not identical to shares of stock with the same CUSIP number that are not in a dividend reinvestment plan. The basis of each share of identical stock in the account is the aggregate basis of all shares of that stock in the account divided by the aggregate number of shares. Unless a single-account election is in effect, see paragraph (e)(11) of this section, a taxpayer may not average together the basis of identical stock held in separate accounts that the taxpayer sells, exchanges, or otherwise disposes of on or after January 1, 2012.
(ii)
Order of disposition of shares sold or transferred.
In the case of the sale or transfer of shares of stock to which the average basis method election applies, shares sold or transferred are deemed to be the shares first acquired. Thus, the first shares sold or transferred are those with a holding period of more than 1 year (long-term shares) to the extent that the account contains long-term shares. If the number of shares sold or transferred exceeds the number of long-term shares in the account, the excess shares sold or transferred are deemed to be shares with a holding period of 1 year or less (short-term shares). Any gain or loss attributable to shares held for more than 1 year constitutes long-term gain or loss, and any gain or loss attributable to shares held for 1 year or less constitutes short-term gain or loss. For example, if a taxpayer sells 50 shares from an account containing 100 long-term shares and 100 short-term shares, the shares sold or transferred are all long-term shares. If, however, the account contains 40 long-term shares and 100 short-term shares, the taxpayer has sold 40 long-term shares and 10 short-term shares.
(iii)
Transition rule from double-category method.
This paragraph (e)(7)(iii) applies to stock for which a taxpayer uses the double-category method under § 1.1012-1(e)(3) (April 1, 2010), that the taxpayer acquired before April 1, 2011, and that the taxpayer sells, exchanges, or otherwise disposes of on or after that date. The taxpayer must calculate the average basis of this stock by averaging together all identical shares of stock in the account on April 1, 2011, regardless of holding period.
(iv)
Wash sales.
A taxpayer must apply section 1091 and the associated regulations (dealing with wash sales of substantially identical securities) in computing average basis regardless of whether the stock or security sold or otherwise disposed of and the stock acquired are in the same account or in different accounts.
(v)
Basis after change from average basis method.
Unless a taxpayer revokes an average basis method election under paragraph (e)(9)(iii) of this section, if a taxpayer changes from the average basis method to another basis determination method (including a change resulting from a withdrawal from or termination of a dividend reinvestment plan), the basis of each share of stock immediately after the change is the same as the basis immediately before the change.
See
paragraph (e)(9)(iv) of this section for rules for changing from the average basis method.
(vi) The provisions of this paragraph (e)(7) are illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
(i) In 2011, Taxpayer C acquires 100 shares of H Company and enrolls them in a dividend reinvestment plan administered by T Custodian. C elects to use the average basis method for the shares of H Company enrolled in the dividend reinvestment plan. T also acquires for C's account 50 shares of H Company and does not enroll these shares in the dividend reinvestment plan.
(ii) Under paragraph (e)(7)(i) of this section, the 50 shares of H Company not in the dividend reinvestment plan are not identical to the 100 shares of H Company enrolled in the dividend reinvestment plan, even if they have the same CUSIP number. Accordingly, under paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(7)(i) of this section, C may not average the basis of the 50 shares of H Company with the basis of the 100 shares of H Company. Under paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, C may not use the average basis method for the 50 shares of H Company because the shares are not acquired in connection with a dividend reinvestment plan.

# Example 2.
(i) Taxpayer D enters into an agreement with W Custodian establishing an account for the periodic acquisition of shares
of L Company, a regulated investment company. W acquires for D's account shares of L Company stock on the following dates and amounts:
Date
Number of shares
Cost
January 8, 2010
25
$200
February 8, 2010
24
200
March 8, 2010
20
200
April 8, 2010
20
200
(ii) At D's direction, W sells 40 shares from the account on January 15, 2011, for $10 per share or a total of $400. D elects to use the average basis method for the shares of L Company. The average basis for the shares sold on January 15, 2011, is $8.99 (total cost of shares, $800, divided by the total number of shares, 89).
(iii) Under paragraph (e)(7)(ii) of this section, the shares sold are the shares first acquired. Thus, D realizes $25.25 ($1.01 * 25) long-term capital gain for the 25 shares acquired on January 8, 2010, and $15.15 ($1.01 * 15) short-term capital gain for 15 of the shares acquired on February 8, 2010.

# Example 3.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 2,
except that on February 8, 2011, D changes to the first-in, first-out basis determination method. W purchases 25 shares of L Company for D on March 8, 2011, at $12 per share. D sells 40 shares on May 8, 2011, and 34 shares on July 8, 2012.
(ii) Because D uses the first-in, first-out method, the 40 shares sold on May 8, 2011 are 9 shares purchased on February 8, 2010, 20 shares purchased on March 8, 2010, and 11 shares purchased on April 8, 2010. Because, under paragraph (e)(7)(v) of this section, the basis of the shares D owns when D changes from the average basis method remains the same, the basis of the shares sold on May 8, 2011, is $8.99 per share, not the original cost of $8.33 per share for the shares purchased on February 8, 2010, or $10 per share for the shares purchased on March 8, 2010, and April 8, 2010. The basis of the shares sold on July 8, 2012, is $8.99 per share for 9 shares purchased on April 8, 2010, and $12 per share for 25 shares purchased on March 8, 2011.

# Example 4.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 2,
except that D uses the first-in, first-out method for the 40 shares sold on January 15, 2011. W purchases 25 shares of L Company for D on March 8, 2011, at $12 per share. D sells 40 shares on May 8, 2011, and elects the average basis method.
(ii) Because D uses the first-in, first-out method for the sale on January 15, 2011, the 40 shares sold are the 25 shares acquired on January 8, 2010, for $200 (basis $8 per share) and 15 of the 24 shares purchased on February 8, 2010, for $200 (basis $8.33 per share).
(iii) Under paragraph (e)(7)(i) of this section, under the average basis method, the basis of all of the shares of identical stock in D's account is averaged. Thus, the basis of each share D sells on May 8, 2011, after electing the average basis method, is $10.47. This figure is the total cost of the shares in D's account ($74.97 for the 9 shares acquired on February 8, 2010, $200 for the 20 shares acquired on March 8, 2010, $200 for the 20 shares acquired on April 8, 2010, and $300 for the 25 shares acquired on March 8, 2011) divided by 74, the total number of shares ($774.97/74).
(8)
Limitation on use of average basis method for certain gift shares.
(i) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(8)(ii) of this section, a taxpayer may not use the average basis method for shares of stock a taxpayer acquires by gift after December 31, 1920, if the basis of the shares (adjusted for the period before the date of the gift as provided in section 1016) in the hands of the donor or the last preceding owner by whom the shares were not acquired by gift was greater than the fair market value of the shares at the time of the gift. This paragraph (e)(8)(i) does not apply to shares the taxpayer acquires as a result of a taxable dividend or capital gain distribution on the gift shares.
(ii) Notwithstanding paragraph (e)(8)(i) of this section, a taxpayer may use the average basis method if the taxpayer states in writing that the taxpayer will treat the basis of the gift shares as the fair market value of the shares at the time the taxpayer acquires the shares. The taxpayer must provide this statement when the taxpayer makes the election under paragraph (e)(9) of this section or when transferring the shares to an account for which the taxpayer has made this election, whichever occurs later. The statement must be effective for any gift shares identical to the gift shares to which the average basis method election applies that the taxpayer acquires at any time and must remain in effect as long as the election remains in effect.
(iii) The provisions of this paragraph (e)(8) are illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
(i) Taxpayer E owns an account for the periodic acquisition of shares of M Company, a regulated investment company. On April 15, 2010, E acquires identical shares of M Company by gift and transfers those shares into the account. These shares had an adjusted basis in the hands of the donor that was greater than the fair market value of
the shares on that date. On June 15, 2010, E sells shares from the account and elects to use the average basis method.
(ii) Under paragraph (e)(8)(ii) of this section, E may elect to use the average basis method for shares sold or transferred from the account if E includes a statement with E's election that E will treat the basis of the gift shares in the account as the fair market value of the shares at the time E acquired them.
See
paragraph (e)(9)(ii) of this section.

# Example 2.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except E acquires the gift shares on April 15, 2012, transfers those shares into the account, and used the average basis method for sales of shares of M Company before acquiring the gift shares. E sells shares of M Company on June 15, 2012.
(ii) Under paragraph (e)(8)(ii) of this section, the basis of the gift shares may be averaged with the basis of the other shares of M Company in E's account if, when E transfers the gift shares to the account, E provides a statement to E's broker that E will treat the basis of the gift shares in the account as the fair market value of the shares at the time E acquired them.
See
paragraph (e)(9)(i) of this section.

Time and manner for making the average basis method election
—(i)
In general.
A taxpayer makes an election to use the average basis method for shares of stock described in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section that are covered securities (within the meaning of section 6045(g)(3)) by notifying the custodian or agent in writing by any reasonable means. For purposes of this paragraph (e), a writing may be in electronic format. A taxpayer has not made an election within the meaning of this section if the taxpayer fails to notify a broker of the taxpayer's basis determination method and basis is determined by the broker's default method under paragraph (e)(2) of this section. A taxpayer may make the average basis method election at any time, effective for sales or other dispositions of stock occurring after the taxpayer notifies the custodian or agent. The election must identify each account with that custodian or agent and each stock in that account to which the election applies. The election may specify that it applies to all accounts with a custodian or agent, including accounts the taxpayer later establishes with the custodian or agent. If the election applies to gift shares, the taxpayer must provide the statement required by paragraph (e)(8)(ii) of this section, if applicable, to the custodian or agent with the taxpayer's election.
(ii)
Average basis method election for securities that are noncovered securities.
A taxpayer makes an election to use the average basis method for shares of stock described in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section that are noncovered securities (as described in § 1.6045-1(a)(16)) on the taxpayer's income tax return for the first taxable year for which the election applies. A taxpayer may make the election on an amended return filed no later than the time prescribed (including extensions) for filing the original return for the taxable year for which the election applies. The taxpayer must indicate on the return that the taxpayer used the average basis method in reporting gain or loss on the sale or other disposition. A taxpayer must attach to the return the statement described in paragraph (e)(8)(ii) of this section, if applicable. A taxpayer making the election must maintain records necessary to substantiate the average basis reported.
(iii)
Revocation of election.
A taxpayer may revoke an election under paragraph (e)(9)(i) of this section by the earlier of one year after the taxpayer makes the election or the date of the first sale, transfer, or disposition of that stock following the election. A custodian or agent may extend the one-year period but a taxpayer may not revoke an election after the first sale, transfer, or disposition of the stock. A revocation applies to all stock the taxpayer holds in an account that is identical to the shares of stock for which the taxpayer revokes the election. A revocation is effective when the taxpayer notifies, in writing by any reasonable means, the custodian or agent holding the stock to which the revocation applies. After revocation, the taxpayer's basis in the shares of stock to which the revocation applies is the basis before averaging.
(iv)
Change from average basis method.
A taxpayer may change basis determination methods from the average basis method to another method prospectively at any time. A change from the average basis method applies to all identical stock the taxpayer sells or otherwise disposes of before January 1, 2012, that was held in any account. A
change from the average basis method applies on an account by account basis (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(10) of this section) to all identical stock the taxpayer sells or otherwise disposes of on or after January 1, 2012. The taxpayer must notify, in writing by any reasonable means, the custodian or agent holding the stock to which the change applies. Unless paragraph (e)(9)(iii) of this section applies, the basis of each share of stock to which the change applies remains the same as the basis immediately before the change.
See
paragraph (e)(7)(v) of this section.
(v)
Examples.
The provisions of this paragraph (e)(9) are illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
(i) Taxpayer F enters into an agreement with W Custodian establishing an account for the periodic acquisition of shares of N Company, a regulated investment company. W acquires for F's account shares of N Company on the following dates and amounts:
Date
Number of shares
Cost
January 8, 2012
25
$200
February 8, 2012
24
200
March 8, 2012
20
200
(ii) F notifies W that F elects, under paragraph (e)(9)(i) of this section, to use the average basis method for the shares of N Company. On May 8, 2012, under paragraph (e)(9)(iii) of this section, F notifies W that F revokes the average basis method election. On June 1, 2012, F sells 60 shares of N Company using the first-in, first-out basis determination method.
(iii) Under paragraph (e)(9)(iii) of this section, the basis of the N Company shares upon revocation, and for purposes of determining gain on the sale, is $8.00 per share for each of the 25 shares purchased on January 8, 2012, $8.34 per share for each of the 24 shares purchased on February 8, 2012, and $10 per share for the remaining 11 shares purchased on March 8, 2012.

# Example 2.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except that F does not notify W that F elects a basis determination method. W's default basis determination method is the average basis method and W maintains an averaged basis for F's shares of N Company on W's books and records.
(ii) F has not elected the average basis method under paragraph (e)(9)(i) of this section. Therefore, F's notification to W on May 8, 2012, is not an effective revocation under paragraph (e)(9)(iii) of this section. F's attempted revocation is, instead, notification of a change from the average basis method under paragraph (e)(9)(iv) of this section. Accordingly, the basis of each share of stock F sells on June 1, 2012, is the basis immediately before the change, $8.70 (total cost of shares, $600, divided by the total number of shares, 69).
(10)
Application of average basis method account by account
—(i)
In general.
For sales, exchanges, or other dispositions on or after January 1, 2012, of stock described in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, the average basis method applies on an account by account basis. A taxpayer may use the average basis method for stock in a regulated investment company or stock acquired in connection with a dividend reinvestment plan in one account but use a different basis determination method for identical stock in a different account. If a taxpayer uses the average basis method for a stock described in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, the taxpayer must use the average basis method for all identical stock within that account. The taxpayer may use different basis determination methods for stock within an account that is not identical. Except as provided in paragraph (e)(10)(ii) of this section, a taxpayer must make separate elections to use the average basis method for stock held in separate accounts.
(ii)
Account rule for stock sold before 2012.
A taxpayer's election to use the average basis method for shares of stock described in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section that a taxpayer sells, exchanges, or otherwise disposes of before January 1, 2012, applies to all identical shares of stock the taxpayer holds in any account.
(iii)
Separate account.
Unless the single-account election described in paragraph (e)(11)(i) of this section applies, stock described in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section that is a covered security (within the meaning of section 6045(g)(3)) is treated as held in a separate account from stock that is a noncovered security (as described in § 1.6045-1(a)(16)), regardless of when acquired.
(iv)
Examples.
The provisions of this paragraph (e)(10) are illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
(i) In 2012, Taxpayer G enters into an agreement with Y Broker establishing three accounts (G-1, G-2, and G-3) for the periodic acquisition of shares of P Company, a regulated investment company. Y makes periodic purchases of P Company for each of G's accounts. G elects to use the average basis method for account G-1. On July 1, 2013, G sells shares of P Company from account G-1.
(ii) G is not required to use the average basis method for the shares of P Company that G holds in accounts G-2 and G-3 because, under paragraph (e)(10)(i) of this section, the average basis method election applies to shares sold after 2011 on an account by account basis.

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except that G also instructs Y to acquire shares of Q Company, a regulated investment company, for account G-1. Under paragraph (e)(10)(i) of this section, G may use any permissible basis determination method for the shares of Q Company because, under paragraph (e)(4) of this section, the shares of Q Company are not identical to the shares of P Company.

# Example 3.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except that G establishes the accounts in 2011 and Y sells shares of P Company from account G-1 on July 1, 2011.
(ii) For sales before 2012, under paragraph (e)(10)(ii) of this section, G's election applies to all accounts in which G holds identical stock. G must average together the basis of the shares in all accounts to determine the basis of the shares sold from account G-1.

# Example 4.
(i) In 2011, Taxpayer H acquires 80 shares of R Company and enrolls them in R Company's dividend reinvestment plan. In 2012, H acquires 50 shares of R Company in the dividend reinvestment plan. H elects to use the average basis method for the shares of R Company in the dividend reinvestment plan. R Company does not make the single-account election under paragraph (e)(11)(i) of this section.
(ii) Under section 6045(g)(3) and § 1.6045-1(a)(16), the 80 shares acquired in 2011 are noncovered securities and the 50 shares acquired in 2012 are covered securities. Therefore, under paragraph (e)(10)(iii) of this section, the 80 shares are treated as held in a separate account from the 50 shares. H must make a separate average basis method election for each account and must average the basis of the shares in each account separately from the shares in the other account.

# Example 5.
(i) B Broker maintains an account for Taxpayer J for the periodic acquisition of shares of S Company, a regulated investment company. In 2013, B purchases shares of S Company for J's account that are covered securities within the meaning of section 6045(g)(3). On April 15, 2014, J inherits shares of S Company that are noncovered securities and transfers the shares into the account with B.
(ii) Under paragraph (e)(10)(iii) of this section, J must treat the purchased shares and the inherited shares of S Company as held in separate accounts. J may elect to apply the average basis method to all the shares of S Company, but must make a separate election for each account, and must average the basis of the shares in each account separately from the shares in the other account.

# Example 6.
(i) In 2010, Taxpayer K purchases stock in T Company in an account with C Broker. In 2012, K purchases additional T Company stock and enrolls that stock in a dividend reinvestment plan maintained by C. K elects the average basis method for the T Company stock. In 2013, K transfers the T Company stock purchased in 2010 into the dividend reinvestment plan.
(ii) Under paragraphs (e)(1)(i) and (e)(6)(ii) of this section, the stock purchased in 2010 is not stock acquired after December 31, 2010, in connection with a dividend reinvestment plan before transfer into the dividend reinvestment plan. Therefore, the stock is not eligible for the average basis method at that time.
(iii) Once transferred into the dividend reinvestment plan in 2013, the stock K purchased in 2010 is acquired after December 31, 2010, in connection with a dividend reinvestment plan within the meaning of paragraph (e)(6)(ii) of this section and is eligible for the average basis method. Because stock purchased in 2010 is a noncovered security under § 1.6045-1(a)(16), under paragraph (e)(10)(iii) of this section, the 2010 stock and the 2012 stock must be treated as held in separate accounts. Under paragraph (e)(7)(i) of this section, the basis of the 2010 shares may not be averaged with the basis of the 2012 shares.

# Example 7.
The facts are the same as in
Example 6,
except that K purchases the initial T Company stock in January 2011. Because this stock is a covered security under section 6045(g)(3) and § 1.6045-1(a)(15)(iv)(A), the 2011 stock and the 2012 stock are not required under paragraph (e)(10)(iii) of this section to be treated as held in separate accounts. Under paragraph (e)(7)(i) of this section, the basis of the 2011 shares must be averaged with the basis of the 2012 shares.

# Example 8.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 7,
except that K purchases the additional T Company stock and enrolls in the dividend reinvestment plan in March 2011. In September 2011, K transfers the T Company stock purchased in January 2011 into the dividend reinvestment plan. K sells some of the T Company stock in 2012.
(ii) Under section 6045(g)(3) and § 1.6045-1(a)(16), the stock K purchases in January 2011 is a covered security at the time of purchase but the stock K purchases and enrolls in the dividend reinvestment plan in March 2011 is a noncovered security. However,
under § 1.6045-1(a)(15)(iv)(A), the stock purchased in January 2011 becomes a noncovered security after it is transferred to the dividend reinvestment plan. Because all the shares in the dividend reinvestment plan in September 2011 are noncovered securities, when K sells stock in 2012, the January 2011 stock and the March 2011 stock are not required under paragraph (e)(10)(iii) of this section to be treated as held in separate accounts. Under paragraph (e)(7)(i) of this section, the basis of the January 2011 shares must be averaged with the basis of the March 2011 shares.
(11)
Single-account election
—(i)
In general.
Paragraph (e)(10)(iii) of this section does not apply if a regulated investment company or dividend reinvestment plan elects to treat all identical shares of stock described in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section as held in a single account (single-account election). The single-account election applies only to stock for which a taxpayer elects to use the average basis method that is held in separate accounts or treated as held in separate accounts maintained for the taxpayer and only to accounts with the same ownership. If a broker (as defined by section 6045(c)(1)) holds the stock as a nominee, the broker, and not the regulated investment company or dividend reinvestment plan, makes the election. The single-account election is irrevocable, but is void if the taxpayer revokes the average basis election under paragraph (e)(9)(iii) of this section.
(ii)
Scope of election.
A company, plan, or broker may make a single-account election for one or more taxpayers for which it maintains an account, and for one or more stocks it holds for a taxpayer. The company, plan, or broker may make the election only for the shares of stock for which it has accurate basis information. A company, plan, or broker has accurate basis information if the company, plan, or broker neither knows nor has reason to know that the basis information is inaccurate.
See
also section 6724 and the associated regulations regarding standards for relief from information reporting penalties. Stock for which accurate basis information is unavailable may not be included in the single-account election and must be treated as held in a separate account.
(iii)
Effect of single-account election.
If a company, plan, or broker makes the single-account election, the basis of all identical shares of stock to which the election applies must be averaged together regardless of when the taxpayer acquires the shares, and all the shares are treated as covered securities. The single-account election applies to all identical stock a taxpayer later acquires in the account that is a covered security (within the meaning of section 6045(g)(3)). A company, plan, or broker may make another single-account election if, for example, the broker later acquires accurate basis information for a stock, or a taxpayer acquires identical stock in the account that is a noncovered security (as described in § 1.6045-1(a)(16)) for which the company, plan, or broker has accurate basis information.
(iv)
Time and manner for making the single-account election.
A company, plan, or broker makes the single-account election by clearly noting it on its books and records. The books and records must reflect the date of the election; the taxpayer's name, account number, and taxpayer identification number; the stock subject to the election; and the taxpayer's basis in the stock. The company, plan, or broker must provide copies of the books and records regarding the election to the taxpayer upon request. A company, plan, or broker may make the single-account election at any time.
(v)
Notification to taxpayer.
A company, plan, or broker making the single-account election must use reasonable means to notify the taxpayer of the election. Reasonable means include mailings, circulars, or electronic mail sent separately to the taxpayer or included with the taxpayer's account statement, or other means reasonably calculated to provide actual notice to the taxpayer. The notice must identify the securities subject to the election and advise the taxpayer that the securities will be treated as covered securities regardless of when acquired.
(vi)
Examples.
The provisions of this paragraph (e)(11) are illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
(i) E Broker maintains Accounts A and B for Taxpayer M for the acquisition and disposition of shares of T Company, a
regulated investment company. In 2011, E purchases 100 shares of T Company for M's Account A. E has accurate basis information for these shares. In 2012, E purchases 150 shares of T Company for M's Account A and 80 shares of T Company for M's Account B. M elects to use the average basis method for all shares of T Company. E makes a single-account election for M's T Company stock.
(ii) The shares of T Company in Accounts A and B are held in separate accounts. Under section 6045(g)(3) and § 1.6045-1(a)(16), of the shares purchased in Account A, the 100 shares purchased in 2011 are noncovered securities and the 150 shares purchased in 2012 are covered securities. Under paragraph (e)(10)(iii) of this section, the 100 shares are treated as held in a separate account from the 150 shares. Under paragraph (e)(11)(i) of this section, the single-account election applies to all 330 shares of T Company in Accounts A and B. Thus, under paragraph (e)(11)(iii) of this section, the basis of the 330 shares of stock is averaged together and all the shares are treated as covered securities.

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except that M owns Account B jointly with Taxpayer N. E may make a single-account election for the 250 shares of stock in M's Account A. However, under paragraph (e)(11)(i) of this section, E may not make a single-account election for Accounts A and B because the accounts do not have the same ownership.

# Example 3.
(i) C Broker maintains an account for Taxpayer K for the acquisition and disposition of shares of T Company, a regulated investment company, and shares of V Company that K enrolls in C's dividend reinvestment plan. In 2011, C purchases for K's account 100 shares of T Company in multiple lots and 80 shares of V Company in multiple lots that are enrolled in the dividend reinvestment plan. C has accurate basis information for all 100 shares of T Company and 80 shares of V Company. In 2012, C acquires for K's account 150 shares of T Company and 160 shares of V Company that are enrolled in the dividend reinvestment plan. K elects to use the average basis method for all the shares of T Company and V Company.
(ii) Under paragraphs (e)(11)(i) and (ii) of this section, C may make a single-account election for the T Company stock or the V Company stock, or both. After making a single-account election for each stock, under paragraph (e)(11)(iii) of this section, the basis of all T Company stock is averaged together and the basis of all V Company stock is averaged together, regardless of when acquired, and all the shares of T Company and V Company are treated as covered securities.

# Example 4.
The facts are the same as in
Example 3,
except that K transfers the 100 shares of T Company acquired in 2011 from an account with another broker into K's account with C. C does not have accurate basis information for 30 of the 100 shares of T Company, which K had acquired in two lots. Under paragraph (e)(11)(ii) of this section, C may make the single-account election only for the 70 shares of T Company stock for which C has accurate basis information. C must treat the 30 shares of T Company for which C does not have accurate basis information as held in a separate account. K may use the average basis method for the 30 shares of T Company, but must make a separate average basis method election for these shares and must average the basis of these shares separately from the 70 shares subject to C's single-account election.

# Example 5.
The facts are the same as in
Example 3,
except that C has made the single-account election and in 2013 K acquires additional shares of T Company that are covered securities in K's account with C. Under paragraph (e)(11)(iii) of this section, these shares of T Company are subject to C's single-account election.

# Example 6.
The facts are the same as in
Example 3,
except that C has made the single-account election and in 2013 K inherits shares of T Company that are noncovered securities and transfers the shares into the account with C. C has accurate basis information for these shares. Under paragraph (e)(11)(iii) of this section, C may make a second single-account election to include the inherited T Company shares.

# Example 7.
(i) Between 2002 and 2011, Taxpayer L acquires 1,500 shares of W Company, a regulated investment company, in an account with D Broker, for which L uses the average basis method, and sells 500 shares. On January 5, 2012, based on accurate basis information, the averaged basis of L's remaining 1,000 shares of W Company is $24 per share. On January 5, 2012, L acquires 100 shares of W Company for $28 per share and makes an average basis election for those shares under paragraph (e)(9)(i) of this section.
(ii) On February 1, 2012, D makes a single-account election that includes all 1,100 of L's shares in W Company. Thereafter, the basis of L's shares of W Company is $24.36 per share (($24,000 + $2,800)/1,100). On September 12, 2012, under paragraph (e)(9)(iii) of this section, L revokes the average basis election for the 100 shares acquired on January 5, 2012.
(iii) Under paragraph (e)(11)(i) of this section, D's single-account election is void. Therefore, the basis of the 1,000 shares of W Company that L acquires before 2012 is $24 per share and the basis of the 100 shares of W Company that L acquires in 2012 is $28 per share.
(12)
Effective/applicability date.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (e)(1), (e)(2), (e)(7), (e)(9), and (e)(10) of this section, this paragraph (e) applies
for taxable years beginning after October 18, 2010.
(f)
Special rules.
For special rules for determining the basis for gain or loss in the case of certain vessels acquired through the Maritime Commission (or its successors) or pursuant to an agreement with the Secretary of Commerce, see sections 510, 511, and 607 of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended (46 U.S.C. 1160, 1161) and parts 2 and 3 of this chapter. For special rules for determining the unadjusted basis of property recovered in respect of war losses, see section 1336. For special rules with respect to taxable years beginning before January 1, 1964, for determining the basis for gain or loss in the case of a disposition of a share of stock acquired pursuant to the timely exercise of a restricted stock option where the option price was between 85 percent and 95 percent of the fair market value of the stock at the time the option was granted, see paragraph (b) of § 1.421-5. See section 423(c)(1) or 424(c)(1), whichever is applicable, for special rules with respect to taxable years ending after December 31, 1963, for determining the basis for gain or loss in the case of the disposition of a share of stock acquired pursuant to the timely exercise of a stock option described in such sections. See section 422(c)(1) for special rules with respect to taxable years ending after December 31, 1963, for determining the basis for gain or loss in the case of an exercise of a qualified stock option.
(g)
Debt instruments issued in exchange for property
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, if a debt instrument is issued in exchange for property, the cost of the property that is attributable to the debt instrument is the issue price of the debt instrument as determined under § 1.1273-2 or § 1.1274-2, whichever is applicable. If, however, the issue price of the debt instrument is determined under section 1273(b)(4), the cost of the property attributable to the debt instrument is its stated principal amount reduced by any unstated interest (as determined under section 483).
(2)
Certain tax-exempt obligations.
This paragraph (g)(2) applies to a tax-exempt obligation (as defined in section 1275(a)(3)) that is issued in exchange for property and that has an issue price determined under § 1.1274-2(j) (concerning tax-exempt contingent payment obligations and certain tax-exempt variable rate debt instruments subject to section 1274). Notwithstanding paragraph (g)(1) of this section, if this paragraph (g)(2) applies to a tax-exempt obligation, for purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the cost of the property that is attributable to the obligation is the sum of the present values of the noncontingent payments (as determined under § 1.1274-2(c)).
(3)
Effective date.
This paragraph (g) applies to sales or exchanges that occur on or after August 13, 1996.
(h)
Determination of basis of digital assets
—(1)
Overview and general rule.
This paragraph (h) provides rules to determine the basis of digital assets, as defined in § 1.6045-1(a)(19) other than a digital asset not required to be reported as a digital asset pursuant to § 1.6045-1(c)(8)(ii), (iii), or (iv), received in a purchase for cash, a transfer in connection with the performance of services, an exchange for digital assets or other property differing materially in kind or in extent, an exchange for a debt instrument described in paragraph (h)(1)(v) of this section, or in a part sale and part gift transfer described in paragraph (h)(1)(vi) of this section. Except as provided in paragraph (h)(1)(ii), (v), and (vi) of this section, the basis of digital assets received in a purchase or exchange is generally equal to the cost thereof at the date and time of the purchase or exchange, plus any allocable digital asset transaction costs as determined under paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of this section.
(i)
Basis of digital assets purchased for cash.
The basis of digital assets purchased for cash is the amount of cash used to purchase the digital assets plus any allocable digital asset transaction costs as determined under paragraph (h)(2)(ii)(A) of this section.
(ii)
Basis of digital assets received in connection with the performance of services.
For rules regarding digital assets received in connection with the performance of services,
see
§§ 1.61-2(d)(2) and 1.83-4(b).
(iii)
Basis of digital assets received in exchange for property other than digital
assets.
The basis of digital assets received in exchange for property differing materially in kind or in extent, other than digital assets or debt instruments described in paragraph (h)(1)(v) of this section, is the cost as described in paragraph (h)(3) of this section of the digital assets received plus any allocable digital asset transaction costs as determined under paragraph (h)(2)(ii)(A) of this section.
(iv)
Basis of digital assets received in exchange for other digital assets.
The basis of digital assets received in an exchange for other digital assets differing materially in kind or in extent is the cost as described in paragraph (h)(3) of this section of the digital assets received.
(v)
Basis of digital assets received in exchange for the issuance of a debt instrument.
If a debt instrument is issued in exchange for digital assets, the cost of the digital assets attributable to the debt instrument is the amount determined under paragraph (g) of this section, plus any allocable digital asset transaction costs as determined under paragraph (h)(2)(ii)(A) of this section.
(vi)
Basis of digital assets received in a part sale and part gift transfer.
To the extent digital assets are received in a transfer, which is in part a sale and in part a gift,
see
§ 1.1012-2.
(2)
Digital asset transaction costs
—(i)
Definition.
The term
digital asset transaction costs
under this paragraph (h) has the same meaning as in § 1.1001-7(b)(2)(i).
(ii)
Allocation of digital asset transaction costs.
This paragraph (h)(2)(ii) provides the rules for allocating digital asset transaction costs, as defined in paragraph (h)(2)(i) of this section, for transactions described in paragraph (h)(1) of this section. Any other allocation or specific assignment of digital asset transaction costs is disregarded.
(A)
Allocation of digital asset transaction costs on a purchase or exchange for digital assets.
Except as provided in paragraphs (h)(2)(ii)(B) and (C) of this section, the total digital asset transaction costs paid by the taxpayer in connection with an acquisition of digital assets are allocable to the digital assets received.
(B)
Special rule for the allocation of digital asset transaction costs paid to effect an exchange of digital assets for other digital assets.
Except as provided in paragraph (h)(2)(ii)(C) of this section, the total digital asset transaction costs paid by the taxpayer, to effect an exchange described in paragraph (h)(1)(iv) of this section are allocable exclusively to the disposition of the transferred digital assets.
(C)
Special rule for allocating certain cascading digital asset transaction costs.
This paragraph (h)(2)(ii)(C) provides a special rule for an exchange described in paragraph (h)(1)(iv) of this section (original transaction) and for which digital assets are withheld from digital assets acquired in the original transaction to pay the digital asset transaction costs to effect the original transaction. The total digital asset transaction costs paid by the taxpayer, to effect both the original transaction and any disposition of the withheld digital assets, are allocable exclusively to the disposition of digital assets in the original transaction.
(3)
Determining the cost of the digital assets received.
In the case of an exchange described in either paragraph (h)(1)(iii) or (iv) of this section, the cost of the digital assets received is the same as the fair market value used in determining the amount realized on the sale or disposition of the transferred property for purposes of section 1001 of the Code. Generally, the cost of a digital asset received is determined at the date and time of the exchange. The special rule in § 1.1001-7(b)(4) also applies in this section for purposes of determining the fair market value of a received digital asset when it cannot be determined with reasonable accuracy.
(4)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of paragraphs (h)(1) through (3) of this section. Unless the facts specifically state otherwise, the transactions described in the following examples occur after the applicability date set forth in paragraph (h)(5) of this section. For purposes of the examples under this paragraph (h)(4), assume that TP is a digital asset investor, and that digital assets A, B, and C are materially different in kind or in extent from each other.
See
§ 1.1001-7(b)(5) for examples illustrating
the determination of the amount realized and gain or loss in a sale or disposition of a digital asset for cash, other property differing materially in kind or in extent, or services.
(i)
Example 1: Transaction fee paid in cash
—(A)
Facts.
TP uses BEX, an unrelated third party, to exchange 10 units of digital asset A for 20 units of digital asset B. At the time of the exchange, a unit of digital asset A has a fair market value of $2, and a unit of digital asset B has a fair market value of $1. BEX charges TP a transaction fee of $2, which TP pays to BEX in cash at the time of the exchange.
(B)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (h)(2)(i) of this section, TP has digital asset transaction costs of $2. Under paragraph (h)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, TP allocates the digital asset transaction costs ($2) to the disposition of the 10 units of digital asset A. Under paragraphs (h)(1)(iv) and (h)(3) of this section, TP's basis in the 20 units of digital asset B received is $20, which is the sum of the fair market value of the 20 units of digital asset B received ($20).
(ii)
Example 2: Transaction fee paid in other property
—(A)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (h)(4)(i)(A) of this section (the facts in
Example 1
), except that BEX requires its customers to pay transaction fees using units of digital asset C. TP pays the transaction fees using 2 units of digital asset C that TP holds. At the time TP pays the transaction fees, each unit of digital asset C has a fair market value of $1. TP acquires 20 units of digital asset B with a fair market value of $20 in the exchange.
(B)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (h)(2)(i) of this section, TP has digital asset transaction costs of $2. Under paragraph (h)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, TP must allocate the digital asset transaction costs ($2) to the disposition of the 10 units of digital asset A. Under paragraphs (h)(1)(iv) and (h)(3) of this section, TP's basis in the 20 units of digital asset B is $20, which is the sum of the fair market value of the 20 units of digital asset B received ($20).
(iii)
Example 3: Digital asset transaction costs withheld from the transferred digital assets
—(A)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (h)(4)(i)(A) of this section (the facts in
Example 1
), except that BEX withholds 1 unit of digital asset A in payment of the transaction fees and TP receives 18 units of digital asset B.
(B)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (h)(2)(i) of this section, TP has digital asset transaction costs of $2. Under paragraph (h)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, TP must allocate the digital asset transaction costs ($2) to the disposition of the 10 units of digital asset A. Under paragraphs (h)(1)(iv) and (h)(3) of this section, TP's total basis in the digital asset B units is $18, which is the sum of the fair market value of the 18 units of digital asset B received ($18).
(5)
Applicability date.
This paragraph (h) is applicable to all acquisitions and dispositions of digital assets on or after January 1, 2025.
(i) [Reserved]
(j)
Sale, disposition, or transfer of digital assets.
Paragraphs (j)(1) and (2) of this section apply to digital assets not held in the custody of a broker, such as digital assets that are held in an unhosted wallet. Paragraph (j)(3) of this section applies to digital assets held in the custody of a broker. For the definitions of the terms
wallet, hosted wallet,
unhosted wallet,
and
held in a wallet or account,
as used in this paragraph (j),
see
§ 1.6045-1(a)(25)(i) through (iv). For the definition of the term
broker, see
§ 1.6045-1(a)(1). For the definition of the term
digital asset, see
§ 1.6045-1(a)(19); however, a digital asset not required to be reported as a digital asset pursuant to § 1.6045-1(c)(8)(ii), (iii), or (iv) is not subject to the rules of this section.
(1)
Digital assets not held in the custody of a broker.
If a taxpayer sells, disposes of, or transfers less than all units of the same digital asset not held in the custody of the broker, such as in a single unhosted wallet or in a hosted wallet provided by a person other than a broker, the basis and holding period of the units sold, disposed of, or transferred are determined by making a specific identification of the units in the wallet that are sold, disposed of, or transferred, as provided in paragraph (j)(2) of this section. If a specific identification is not made, the basis and holding period of the units sold, disposed of, or transferred are determined by treating the units not held in the
custody of a broker as sold, disposed of, or transferred in order of time from the earliest date on which units of the same digital asset not held in the custody of a broker were acquired by the taxpayer. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the date any units were transferred into the taxpayer's wallet is disregarded.
(2)
Specific identification of digital assets not held in the custody of a broker.
A specific identification of the units of a digital asset sold, disposed of, or transferred is made if, no later than the date and time of the sale, disposition, or transfer, the taxpayer identifies on its books and records the particular units to be sold, disposed of, or transferred by reference to any identifier, such as purchase date and time or the purchase price for the unit, that is sufficient to identify the units sold, disposed of, or transferred. A specific identification can be made only if adequate records are maintained for the unit of a specific digital asset not held in the custody of a broker to establish that a unit sold, disposed of, or transferred is removed from the wallet.
(3)
Digital assets held in the custody of a broker.
This paragraph (j)(3) applies to digital assets held in the custody of a broker.
(i)
Unit of a digital asset sold, disposed of, or transferred.
Except as provided in paragraph (j)(3)(iii) of this section, where multiple units of the same digital asset are held in the custody of a broker, as defined in § 1.6045-1(a)(1), and the taxpayer does not provide the broker with an adequate identification of which units are sold, disposed of, or transferred by the date and time of the sale, disposition, or transfer, as provided in paragraph (j)(3)(ii) of this section, the basis and holding period of the units sold, disposed of, or transferred are determined by treating the units held in the custody of the broker as sold, disposed of, or transferred in order of time from the earliest date on which units of the same digital asset held in the custody of a broker were acquired by the taxpayer. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the date any units were transferred into the custody of the broker is disregarded.
(ii)
Adequate identification of units held in the custody of a broker.
Except as provided in paragraph (j)(3)(iii) of this section, where multiple units of the same digital asset are held in the custody of a broker, as defined in § 1.6045-1(a)(1), an adequate identification occurs if, no later than the date and time of the sale, disposition, or transfer, the taxpayer specifies to the broker having custody of the digital assets the particular units of the digital asset to be sold, disposed of, or transferred by reference to any identifier, such as purchase date and time or purchase price, that the broker designates as sufficiently specific to identify the units sold, disposed of, or transferred. The taxpayer is responsible for maintaining records to substantiate the identification. A standing order or instruction for the specific identification of digital assets is treated as an adequate identification made at the time of sale, disposition, or transfer. In addition, a taxpayer's election to use average basis for a covered security for which average basis reporting is permitted and that is also a digital asset is also an adequate identification. In the case of a broker offering only one method of making a specific identification, such method is treated as a standing order or instruction.
(iii)
Special rule for the identification of certain units withheld.
Notwithstanding paragraph (j)(3)(i) or (ii) of this section, in the case of a transaction described in paragraph (h)(1)(iv) of this section (digital assets exchanged for different digital assets) and for which the broker withholds units of the same digital asset received for either the broker's backup withholding obligations under section 3406 of the Code, or for payment of services described in § 1.1001-7(b)(1)(ii) (digital asset transaction costs), the taxpayer is deemed to have made an adequate identification, within the meaning of paragraph (j)(3)(ii) of this section, for such withheld units regardless of any other adequate identification within the meaning of paragraph (j)(3)(ii) of this section designating other units of the same digital asset as the units sold, disposed of, or transferred.
(4)
Method for specifically identifying units of a digital asset.
A method of specifically identifying the units of a digital asset sold, disposed of, or transferred under this paragraph (j), for example, by the earliest acquired, the latest acquired, or the highest basis, is not a method of accounting. Therefore, a change in the method of specifically identifying the digital asset sold, disposed of, or transferred, for example, from the earliest acquired to the latest acquired, is not a change in method of accounting to which sections 446 and 481 of the Code apply.
(5)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of paragraphs (j)(1) through (j)(3) of this section. Unless the facts specifically state otherwise, the transactions described in the following examples occur after the applicability date set forth in paragraph (j)(6) of this section. For purposes of the examples under this paragraph (j)(5), assume that TP is a digital asset investor and that the units of digital assets in the examples are the only digital assets owned by TP.
(i)
Example 1: Identification of digital assets not held in the custody of a broker
—(A)
Facts.
On September 1, Year 2, TP transfers two lots of digital asset DE to a new digital asset address generated and controlled by an unhosted wallet, as defined in § 1.6045-1(a)(25)(iii). The first lot transferred into TP's wallet consists of 10 units of digital asset DE, with a purchase date of January 1, Year 1, and a basis of $2 per unit. The second lot transferred into TP's wallet consists of 20 units of digital asset DE, with a purchase date of January 1, Year 2, and a basis of $5 per unit. On September 2, Year 2, when the DE units have a fair market value of $10 per unit, TP purchases $100 worth of consumer goods from Merchant M. To make payment, TP transfers 10 units of digital asset DE from TP's wallet to CPP, a processor of digital asset payments as defined in § 1.6045-1(a)(22), that then pays $100 to M, in a transaction treated as a sale by TP of the 10 units of digital asset DE. Prior to making the transfer to CPP, TP keeps a record that the 10 units of DE sold in this transaction were from the second lot of units transferred into TP's wallet.
(B)
Analysis.
Under the facts in paragraph (j)(5)(i)(A) of this section, TP's notation in its records on the date of sale, prior to the time of the sale, specifying that the 10 units sold were from the 20 units TP acquired on January 1, Year 2, is a specific identification within the meaning of paragraph (j)(2) of this section. TP's notation is sufficient to identify the 10 units of digital asset DE sold. Accordingly, TP has identified the units disposed of for purposes of determining the basis ($5 per unit) and holding period (one year or less) of the units sold in order to purchase the merchandise.
(ii)
Example 2: Identification of digital assets not held in the custody of a broker
—(A)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (j)(5)(i)(A) of this section (the facts in
Example 1
), except in making the transfer to CPP, TP did not keep a record at or prior to the time of the sale of the specific 10 units of digital asset DE that TP intended to sell.
(B)
Analysis.
TP did not make a specific identification within the meaning of paragraph (j)(2) of this section for the 10 units of digital asset DE that were sold. Pursuant to the ordering rule provided in paragraph (j)(1) of this section, the units disposed of are determined by treating the units held in the unhosted wallet as disposed of in order of time from the earliest date on which units of the same digital asset held in the unhosted wallet were acquired by the taxpayer. Accordingly, TP must treat the 10 units sold as the 10 units with a purchase date of January 1, Year 1, and a basis of $2 per unit, transferred into the wallet.
(iii)
Example 3: Identification of digital assets held in the custody of a broker
—(A)
Facts.
On August 1, Year 1, TP opens a custodial account at CRX, a broker within the meaning of § 1.6045-1(a)(1), and purchases through CRX 10 units of digital asset DE for $9 per unit. On January 1, Year 2, TP opens a custodial account at BEX, an unrelated broker, and purchases through BEX 20 units of digital asset DE for $5 per unit. On August 1, Year 3, TP transfers the digital assets TP holds with CRX into TP's custodial account with BEX. BEX has a policy that purchase or transfer date and time, if necessary, is a sufficiently
specific identifier for customers to determine the units sold, disposed of, or transferred. On September 1, Year 3, TP directs BEX to sell 10 units of digital asset DE for $10 per unit and specifies that BEX sell the units that were purchased on January 1, Year 2. BEX effects the sale.
(B)
Analysis.
No later than the date and time of the sale, TP specified to BEX the particular units of digital assets to be sold. Accordingly, under paragraph (j)(3)(ii) of this section, TP provided an adequate identification of the 10 units of digital asset DE sold. Accordingly, the 10 units of digital asset DE that TP sold are the 10 units that TP purchased on January 1, Year 2.
(iv)
Example 4: Identification of digital assets held in the custody of a broker
—(A)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (j)(5)(iii)(A) of this section (the facts in
Example 3
) except that TP directs BEX to sell 10 units of digital asset DE but does not make any identification of which units to sell. Additionally, TP does not provide purchase date information to BEX with respect to the units transferred into TP's account with BEX.
(B)
Analysis.
Because TP did not specify to BEX no later than the date and time of the sale the particular units of digital assets to be sold, TP did not make an adequate identification within the meaning of paragraph (j)(3)(ii) of this section. Thus, the ordering rule provided in paragraph (j)(3)(i) of this section applies to determine the units of digital asset DE sold. Pursuant to this rule, the units sold must be determined by treating the units held in the custody of the broker as disposed of in order of time from the earliest date on which units of the same digital asset held in the custody of a broker were acquired by the taxpayer. The 10 units of digital asset DE sold must be attributed to the 10 units of digital asset DE acquired on August 1, Year 1, which are the earliest units of digital asset DE acquired by TP that are held in TP's account with BEX. In addition, because TP did not provide to BEX customer-provided acquisition information as defined in § 1.6045-1(d)(2)(ii)(B)(
4
) with respect to the units transferred into TP's account with BEX (or adopt a standing order to follow the ordering rule applicable to BEX under § 1.6045-1(d)(2)(ii)(B)(
2
)), the units determined as sold by BEX under § 1.6045-1(d)(2)(ii)(B)(
1
) and that BEX will report as sold under § 1.6045-1 are not the same units that TP must treat as sold under this section.
See
§ 1.6045-1(d)(2)(vii)(C) (
Example 3
).
(v)
Example 5: Identification of the digital asset used to pay certain digital asset transaction costs
—(A)
Facts.
On January 1, Year 1, TP purchases 10 units of digital asset AB and 30 units of digital asset CD in a custodial account with DRX, a broker within the meaning of § 1.6045-1(a)(1). DRX has a policy that purchase or transfer date and time, if necessary, is a sufficiently specific identifier by which its customers may identify the units sold, disposed of, or transferred. On June 30, Year 2, TP directs DRX to purchase 10 additional units of digital asset AB with 10 units of digital asset CD. DRX withholds one unit of the digital asset AB received for transaction fees. TP does not make any identification of the 1 unit of digital asset AB withheld by DRX. TP engages in no other transactions.
(B)
Analysis.
DRX's withholding of 1 unit of digital asset AB from the 10 units acquired by TP is a disposition by TP of the 1 unit as of June 30, Year 2.
See
§§ 1.1001-7 and 1.1012-1(h) for determining the amount realized and basis of the disposed unit, respectively. Despite TP not making an adequate identification, within the meaning of paragraph (j)(3)(ii) of this section to DRX of the 1 unit withheld, under the special rule of paragraph (j)(3)(iii) of this section, the withheld unit of AB must be attributed to the units of AB acquired on June 30, Year 2 and held in TP's account with DRX.
(vi)
Example 6: Identification of the digital asset used to pay certain digital asset transaction costs
—(A)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (j)(5)(v)(A) of this section (the facts in
Example 5
) except that TP has a standing order with BEX to treat the earliest unit purchased in TP's account as the unit sold, disposed of, or transferred.
(B)
Analysis.
The transaction is an exchange of digital assets for different digital assets and for which the broker
withholds units of the same digital asset received in order to pay digital asset transaction costs. Accordingly, although TP's standing order to treat the earliest unit purchased in TP's account (that is, the units purchased by TP on January 1, Year 1) as the units sold is an adequate identification under paragraph (j)(3)(ii) of this section, TP is deemed to have made an adequate identification for such withheld units pursuant to paragraph (j)(3)(iii) of this section regardless of TP's adequate identification designating other units as the units sold. Thus, the results are the same as provided in paragraph (j)(5)(v)(B) of this section (the analysis in
Example 5
).
(6)
Applicability date.
This paragraph (j) is applicable to all acquisitions and dispositions of digital assets on or after January 1, 2025.

§ 1.1014-1
Basis of property acquired from a decedent.
(a)
General rule.
The purpose of section 1014 is, in general, to provide a basis for property acquired from a decedent that is equal to the value placed upon such property for purposes of the federal estate tax. Accordingly, the general rule is that the basis of property acquired from a decedent is the fair market value of such property at the date of the decedent's death, or, if the decedent's executor so elects, at the alternate valuation date prescribed in section 2032, or in section 811(j) of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) of 1939. However, the basis of property acquired from certain decedents who died in 2010 is determined under section 1022, if the decedent's executor made an election under section 301(c) of the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010, Public Law 111-312 (124 Stat. 3296, 3300 (2010)). See section 1022. Property acquired from a decedent includes, principally, property acquired by bequest, devise, or inheritance, and, in the case of decedents dying after December 31, 1953, property required to be included in determining the value of the decedent's gross estate under any provision of the Code of 1954 or the Code of 1939. For certain property acquired from a decedent, the initial basis of the property must not exceed the property's final value for Federal estate tax purposes.
See
section 1014(f) and § 1.1014-10 for rules relating to the consistent basis requirement. The general rule governing basis of property acquired from a decedent, as well as other rules prescribed elsewhere in this section, shall have no application if the property is sold, exchanged, or otherwise disposed of before the decedent's death by the person who acquired the property from the decedent. For general rules on the applicable valuation date where the executor of a decedent's estate elects under section 2032, or under section 811(j) of the Code of 1939, to value the decedent's gross estate at the alternate valuation date prescribed in such sections, see § 1.1014-3(e).
(b)
Scope and application.
With certain limitations, the general rule described in paragraph (a) of this section is applicable to the classes of property described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of § 1.1014-2, including stock in a DISC or former DISC. In the case of stock in a DISC or former DISC, the provisions of this section and §§ 1.1014-2 through 1.1014-8 are applicable, except as provided in § 1.1014-9. Special basis rules with respect to the basis of certain other property acquired from a decedent are set forth in paragraph (c) of § 1.1014-2. These special rules concern certain stock or securities of a foreign personal holding company and the surviving spouse's one-half share of community property held with a decedent dying after October 21, 1942, and on or before December 31, 1947. In §§ 1.1014-1 to 1.1014-6, inclusive, and § 1.1014-10, whenever the words
property acquired from a decedent
are used, they also mean
property passed from a decedent,
and the phrase
person who acquired it from the decedent
includes the
person to whom it passed from the decedent.
The consistent basis rules in § 1.1014-10 apply to property subject to the consistent basis requirement, as described in § 1.1014-10(c)(1). For property subject to the consistent basis requirement, the rules in § 1.1014-10 modify the rules set forth in paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section and in §§ 1.1014-2 through 1.1014-9.
(c)
Property to which section 1014 does not apply.
Section 1014 has no application to property that constitutes a right to receive an item of income in respect of a decedent under section 691.
(d)
Applicability date.
This section applies after September 17, 2024. For rules on and before September 17, 2024,

[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11910, Nov. 26, 1960, as amended by T.D. 6527, 26 FR 413, Jan. 19, 1961; T.D. 6887, 31 FR 8812, June 24, 1966; T.D. 7283, 38 FR 20825, Aug. 3, 1973; T.D. 9811, 82 FR 6240, Jan. 19, 2017; T.D. 9991, 89 FR 76375, Sept. 17, 2024]
§ 1.1014-2
Property acquired from a decedent.
(a)
In general.
The following property, except where otherwise indicated, is considered to have been acquired from a decedent and the basis thereof is determined in accordance with the general rule in § 1.1014-1:
(1) Without regard to the date of the decedent's death, property acquired by bequest, devise, or inheritance, or by the decedent's estate from the decedent, whether the property was acquired under the decedent's will or under the law governing the descent and distribution of the property of decedents. However, see paragraph (c)(1) of this section if the property was acquired by bequest or inheritance from a decedent dying after August 26, 1937, and if such property consists of stock or securities of a foreign personal holding company.
(2) Without regard to the date of the decedent's death, property transferred by the decedent during his lifetime in trust to pay the income for life to or on the order or direction of the decedent, with the right reserved to the decedent at all times before his death to revoke the trust.
(3) In the case of decedents dying after December 31, 1951, property transferred by the decedent during his lifetime in trust to pay the income for life to or on the order or direction of the decedent with the right reserved to the decedent at all times before his death to make any change in the enjoyment thereof through the exercise of a power to alter, amend, or terminate the trust.
(4) Without regard to the date of the decedent's death, property passing without full and adequate consideration under a general power of appointment exercised by the decedent by will. (See section 2041(b) for definition of general power of appointment.)
(5) In the case of decedents dying after December 31, 1947, property which represents the surviving spouse's one-half share of community property held by the decedent and the surviving spouse under the community property laws of any State, Territory, or possession of the United States or any foreign country, if at least one-half of the whole of the community interest in that property was includible in determining the value of the decedent's gross estate under part III, chapter 11 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (relating to the estate tax) or section 811 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939. It is not necessary for the application of this subparagraph that an estate tax return be required to be filed for the estate of the decedent or that an estate tax be payable.
(6) In the case of decedents dying after December 31, 1950, and before January 1, 1954, property which represents the survivor's interest in a joint and survivor's annuity if the value of any part of that interest was required to be included in determining the value of the decedent's gross estate under section 811 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939. It is necessary only that the value of a part of the survivor's interest in the annuity be includible in the gross estate under section 811. It is not necessary for the application of this subparagraph that an estate tax return be required to be filed for the estate of the decedent or that an estate tax be payable.
(b)
Property acquired from a decedent dying after December 31, 1953
—(1)
In general.
In addition to the property described in paragraph (a) of this section, and except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph, in the case of a decedent dying after December 31, 1953, property shall also be considered to have been acquired from the decedent to the extent that both of the following conditions are met: (i) The property was acquired from the decedent by reason of death, form of ownership, or other conditions (including property acquired through the exercise or non-exercise of a power of appointment), and (ii) the property is includible in the decedent's gross estate under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, or the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, because of such acquisition. The basis of such property in the hands of the person who acquired it from the decedent shall be determined in accordance with the general rule in § 1.1014-1. See, however, § 1.1014-6 for special adjustments if such property is acquired before the death of the decedent. See also subparagraph (3) of this paragraph for a description of property not within the scope of this paragraph.
(2)
Rules for the application of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph.
Except as provided in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph, this paragraph generally includes all property acquired from a decedent, which is includible in the gross estate of the decedent if the decedent died after December 31, 1953. Except as provided in § 1.1014-10, it is not necessary for the application of this paragraph (b)(2) that an estate tax return be required to be filed for the estate of the decedent or that an estate tax be payable. Property acquired prior to the death of a decedent which is includible in the decedent's gross estate, such as property transferred by a decedent in contemplation of death, and property held by a taxpayer and the decedent as joint tenants or as tenants by the entireties is within the scope of this paragraph. Also, this paragraph includes property acquired through the exercise or nonexercise of a power of appointment where such property is includible in the decedent's gross estate. It does not include property not includible in the decedent's gross estate such as property not situated in the United States acquired from a nonresident who is not a citizen of the United States.
(3)
Exceptions to application of this paragraph.
The rules in this paragraph are not applicable to the following property:
(i) Annuities described in section 72;
(ii) Stock or securities of a foreign personal holding company as described in section 1014(b)(5) (see paragraph (c)(1) of this section);
(iii) Property described in any paragraph other than paragraph (9) of section 1014(b). See paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section.
In illustration of subdivision (ii), assume that A acquired by gift stock of a character described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section from a donor and upon the death of the donor the stock was includible in the donor's estate as being a gift in contemplation of death. A's basis in the stock would not be determined by reference to its fair market value at the donor's death under the general rule in section 1014(a). Furthermore, the special basis rules prescribed in paragraph (c)(1) of this section are not applicable to such property acquired by gift in contemplation of death. It will be necessary to refer to the rules in section 1015(a) to determine the basis.
(c)
Special basis rules with respect to certain property acquired from a decedent
—(1)
Stock or securities of a foreign personal holding company.
The basis of certain stock or securities of a foreign corporation which was a foreign personal holding company with respect to its taxable year next preceding the date of the decedent's death is governed by a special rule. If such stock was acquired from a decedent dying after August 26, 1937, by bequest or inheritance, or by the decedent's estate from the decedent, the basis of the property in the hands of the person who so acquired it (notwithstanding any other provision of section 1014) shall be the fair market value of such property at the date of the decedent's death or the adjusted basis of the stock in the hands of the decedent, whichever is lower.
(2)
Spouse's interest in community property of decedent dying after October 21, 1942, and on or before December 31, 1947.
In the case of a decedent dying after October 21, 1942, and on or before December 31, 1947, a special rule is provided for determining the basis of such part of any property, representing the surviving spouse's one-half share of property held by the decedent and the surviving spouse under the community property laws of any State, Territory, or possession of the United States or any foreign country, as was included in determining the value of the decedent's gross estate, if a tax under chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 was payable upon the decedent's net estate. In such case the basis shall be the fair market value of such part of the property at the date of death (or the optional valuation elected under section 811(j) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939) or the adjusted basis of the property determined without regard to this subparagraph, whichever is the higher.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11910, Nov. 26, 1960, as amended by T.D. 9991, 89 FR 76375, Sept. 17, 2024]
§ 1.1014-3
Other basis rules.
(a)
Fair market value.
For purposes of this section and § 1.1014-1, the value of property as of the date of the decedent's death as appraised for the purpose of the Federal estate tax or the alternate value as appraised for such purpose, whichever is applicable, shall be deemed to be its fair market value. If no estate tax return is required to be filed under section 6018 (or under section 821 or 864 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939), the value of the property appraised as of the date of the decedent's death for the purpose of State inheritance or transmission taxes shall be deemed to be its fair market value and no alternate valuation date shall be applicable.
(b)
Property acquired from a decedent dying before March 1, 1913.
If the decedent died before March 1, 1913, the fair market value on that date is taken in lieu of the fair market value on the date of death, but only to the same extent and for the same purposes as the fair market value on March 1, 1913, is taken under section 1053.
(c)
Reinvestments by a fiduciary.
The basis of property acquired after the death of the decedent by a fiduciary as an investment is the cost or other basis of such property to the fiduciary, and not the fair market value of such property at the death of the decedent. For example, the executor of an estate purchases stock of X company at a price of $100 per share with the proceeds of the sale of property acquired from a decedent. At the date of the decedent's death the fair market value of such stock was $98 per share. The basis of such stock to the executor or to a legatee, assuming the stock is distributed, is $100 per share.
(d)
Reinvestments of property transferred during life.
Where property is transferred by a decedent during life and the property is sold, exchanged, or otherwise disposed of before the decedent's death by the person who acquired the property from the decedent, the general rule stated in paragraph (a) of § 1.1014-1 shall not apply to such property. However, in such a case, the basis of any property acquired by such donee in exchange for the original property, or of any property acquired by the donee through reinvesting the proceeds of the sale of the original property, shall be the fair market value of the property thus acquired at the date of the decedent's death (or applicable alternate valuation date) if the property thus acquired is properly included in the decedent's gross estate for Federal estate tax purposes. These rules also apply to property acquired by the donee in any further exchanges or in further reinvestments. For example, on January 1, 1956, the decedent made a gift of real property to a trust for the benefit of his children, reserving to himself the power to revoke the trust at will. Prior to the decedent's death, the trustee sold the real property and invested the proceeds in stock of the Y company at $50 per share. At the time of the decedent's death, the value of such stock was $75 per share. The corpus of the trust was required to be included in the decedent's gross estate owing to his reservation of the power of revocation. The basis of the Y company stock following the decedent's death is $75 per share. Moreover, if the trustee sold the Y Company
stock before the decedent's death for $65 a share and reinvested the proceeds in Z company stock which increased in value to $85 per share at the time of the decedent's death, the basis of the Z company stock following the decedent's death would be $85 per share.
(e)
Alternate valuation dates.
Section 1014(a) provides a special rule applicable in determining the basis of property described in § 1.1014-2 where—
(1) The property is includible in the gross estate of a decedent who died after October 21, 1942, and
(2) The executor elects for estate tax purposes under section 2032, or section 811(j) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, to value the decedent's gross estate at the alternate valuation date prescribed in such sections.
In those cases, the value applicable in determining the basis of the property is not the value at the date of the decedent's death but (with certain limitations) the value at the date one year after his death if not distributed, sold, exchanged, or otherwise disposed of in the meantime. If such property was distributed, sold, exchanged, or otherwise disposed of within one year after the date of the decedent's death by the person who acquired it from the decedent, the value applicable in determining the basis is its value as of the date of such distribution, sale, exchange, or other disposition. For illustrations of the operation of this paragraph, see the estate tax regulations under section 2032.
§ 1.1014-4
Uniformity of basis; adjustment to basis.
(a)
In general.
(1) The basis of property acquired from a decedent, as determined under section 1014(a) or section 1022, is uniform in the hands of every person having possession or enjoyment of the property at any time under the will or other instrument or under the laws of descent and distribution. The principle of uniform basis means that the basis of the property (to which proper adjustments must, of course, be made) will be the same, or uniform, whether the property is possessed or enjoyed by the executor or administrator, the heir, the legatee or devisee, or the trustee or beneficiary of a trust created by a will or an inter vivos trust. In determining the amount allowed or allowable to a taxpayer in computing taxable income as deductions for depreciation or depletion under section 1016(a)(2), the uniform basis of the property shall at all times be used and adjusted. The sale, exchange, or other disposition by a life tenant or remainderman of his interest in property will, for purposes of this section, have no effect upon the uniform basis of the property in the hands of those who acquired it from the decedent. Thus, gain or loss on sale of trust assets by the trustee will be determined without regard to the prior sale of any interest in the property. Moreover, any adjustment for depreciation shall be made to the uniform basis of the property without regard to such prior sale, exchange, or other disposition.
(2) Under the law governing wills and the distribution of the property of decedents, all titles to property acquired by bequest, devise, or inheritance relate back to the death of the decedent, even though the interest of the person taking the title was, at the date of death of the decedent, legal, equitable, vested, contingent, general, specific, residual, conditional, executory, or otherwise. Accordingly, there is a common acquisition date for all titles to property acquired from a decedent within the meaning of section 1014 or section 1022, and, for this reason, a common or uniform basis for all such interests. For example, if distribution of personal property left by a decedent is not made until one year after his death, the basis of such property in the hands of the legatee is its fair market value at the time when the decedent died, and not when the legatee actually received the property. If the bequest is of the residue to trustees in trust, and the executors do not distribute the residue to such trustees until five years after the death of the decedent, the basis of each piece of property left by the decedent and thus received, in the hands of the trustees, is its fair market value at the time when the decedent dies. If the bequest is to trustees in trust to pay to A during his lifetime the income of the property bequeathed, and after his death to distribute such property to the survivors of a class,
and upon A's death the property is distributed to the taxpayer as the sole survivor, the basis of such property, in the hands of the taxpayer, is its fair market value at the time when the decedent died. The purpose of the Code in prescribing a general uniform basis rule for property acquired from a decedent is, on the one hand, to tax the gain, in respect of such property, to him who realizes it (without regard to the circumstances that at the death of the decedent it may have been quite uncertain whether the taxpayer would take or gain anything); and, on the other hand, not to recognize as gain any element of value resulting solely from the circumstance that the possession or enjoyment of the taxpayer was postponed. Such postponement may be, for example, until the administration of the decedent's estate is completed, until the period of the possession or enjoyment of another has terminated, or until an uncertain event has happened. It is the increase or decrease in the value of property reflected in a sale or other disposition which is recognized as the measure of gain or loss.
(3) The principles stated in subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph do not apply to property transferred by an executor, administrator or trustee, to an heir, legatee, devisee or beneficiary under circumstances such that the transfer constitutes a sale or exchange. In such a case, gain or loss must be recognized by the transferor to the extent required by the revenue laws, and the transferee acquires a basis equal to the fair market value of the property on the date of the transfer. Thus, for example, if the trustee of a trust created by will transfers to a beneficiary, in satisfaction of a specific bequest of $10,000, securities which had a fair market value of $9,000 on the date of the decedent's death (the applicable valuation date) and $10,000 on the date of the transfer, the trust realizes a taxable gain of $1,000 and the basis of the securities in the hands of the beneficiary would be $10,000. As a further example, if the executor of an estate transfers to a trust property worth $200,000, which had a fair market value of $175,000 on the date of the decedent's death (the applicable valuation date), in satisfaction of the decedent's bequest in trust for the benefit of his wife of cash or securities to be selected by the executor in an amount sufficient to utilize the marital deduction to the maximum extent authorized by law (after taking into consideration any other property qualifying for the marital deduction), capital gain in the amount of $25,000 would be realized by the estate and the basis of the property in the hands of the trustees would be $200,000. If, on the other hand, the decedent bequeathed a fraction of his residuary estate to a trust for the benefit of his wife, which fraction will not change regardless of any fluctuations in value of property in the decedent's estate after his death, no gain or loss would be realized by the estate upon transfer of property to the trust, and the basis of the property in the hands of the trustee would be its fair market value on the date of the decedent's death or on the alternate valuation date.
(b)
Multiple interests.
Where more than one person has an interest in property acquired from a decedent, the basis of such property shall be determined and adjusted without regard to the multiple interests. The basis of computing gain or loss on the sale of any one of such multiple interests shall be determined under § 1.1014-5. Thus, the deductions for depreciation and for depletion allowed or allowable, under sections 167 and 611, to a legal life tenant as if the life tenant were the absolute owner of the property, constitute an adjustment to the basis of the property not only in the hands of the life tenant, but also in the hands of the remainderman and every other person to whom the same uniform basis is applicable. Similarly, the deductions allowed or allowable under sections 167 and 611, both to the trustee and to the trust beneficiaries, constitute an adjustment to the basis of the property not only in the hands of the trustee, but also in the hands of the trust beneficiaries and every other person to whom the uniform basis is applicable. See, however, section 262. Similarly, adjustments in respect of capital expenditures or losses, tax-free distributions, or other distributions applicable in reduction of basis, or other items for which the basis is adjustable are made
without regard to which one of the persons to whom the same uniform basis is applicable makes the capital expenditures or sustains the capital losses, or to whom the tax-free or other distributions are made, or to whom the deductions are allowed or allowable. See § 1.1014-6 for adjustments in respect of property acquired from a decedent prior to his death.
(c)
Records.
The executor or other legal representative of the decedent, the fiduciary of a trust under a will, the life tenant and every other person to whom a uniform basis under this section is applicable, shall maintain records showing in detail all deductions, distributions, or other items for which adjustment to basis is required to be made by sections 1016 and 1017, and shall furnish to the district director such information with respect to those adjustments as he may require.
(d)
Effective/applicability date.
This section applies on and after January 19, 2017. For rules before January 19, 2017, see § 1.1014-4 as contained in 26 CFR part 1 revised as of April 1, 2016.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11910, Nov. 26, 1960; 25 FR 14021, Dec. 31, 1960, as amended by T.D. , 45 FR 6089, 1980; T.D. 9811, 82 FR 6241, Jan. 19, 2017]
§ 1.1014-5
Gain or loss.
(a)
Sale or other disposition of a life interest, remainder interest, or other interest in property acquired from a decedent.
(1) Except as provided in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section with respect to the sale or other disposition after October 9, 1969, of a term interest in property, gain or loss from a sale or other disposition of a life interest, remainder interest, or other interest in property acquired from a decedent is determined by comparing the amount of the proceeds with the amount of that part of the adjusted uniform basis which is assignable to the interest so transferred. The adjusted uniform basis is the uniform basis of the entire property adjusted to the date of sale or other disposition of any such interest as required by sections 1016 and 1017. The uniform basis is the unadjusted basis of the entire property determined immediately after the decedent's death under the applicable sections of part II of subchapter O of chapter 1 of the Code.
(2) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the proper measure of gain or loss resulting from a sale or other disposition of an interest in property acquired from a decedent is so much of the increase or decrease in the value of the entire property as is reflected in such sale or other disposition. Hence, in ascertaining the basis of a life interest, remainder interest, or other interest which has been so transferred, the uniform basis rule contemplates that proper adjustments will be made to reflect the change in relative value of the interests on account of the passage of time.
(3) The factors set forth in the tables contained in § 20.2031-7 or, for certain prior periods, § 20.2031-7A, of part 20 of this chapter (Estate Tax Regulations) shall be used in the manner provided therein in determining the basis of the life interest, the remainder interest, or the term certain interest in the property on the date such interest is sold. The basis of the life interest, the remainder interest, or the term certain interest is computed by multiplying the uniform basis (adjusted to the time of the sale) by the appropriate factor. In the case of the sale of a life interest or a remainder interest, the factor used is the factor (adjusted where appropriate) which appears in the life interest or the remainder interest column of the table opposite the age (on the date of the sale) of the person at whose death the life interest will terminate. In the case of the sale of a term certain interest, the factor used is the factor (adjusted where appropriate) which appears in the term certain column of the table opposite the number of years remaining (on the date of sale) before the term certain interest will terminate.
(b)
Sale or other disposition of certain term interests
—(1)
In general.
In determining gain or loss from the sale or other disposition after October 9, 1969, of a term interest in property (as defined in § 1.1001-1(f)(2)) the adjusted basis of which is determined pursuant, or by reference, to section 1014 (relating to the basis of property acquired from a decedent), section 1015 (relating to the basis of property acquired by
gift or by a transfer in trust), or section 1022 (relating to the basis of property acquired from certain decedents who died in 2010), that part of the adjusted uniform basis assignable under the rules of paragraph (a) of this section to the interest sold or otherwise disposed of shall be disregarded to the extent and in the manner provided by section 1001(e) and § 1.1001-1(f).
(2)
Effective/applicability date.
The provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section relating to section 1022 are effective on and after January 19, 2017. For rules before January 19, 2017, see § 1.1014-5 as contained in 26 CFR part 1 revised as of April 1, 2016.
(c)
Sale or other disposition of a term interest in a tax-exempt trust
—(1)
In general.
In the case of any sale or other disposition by a taxable beneficiary of a term interest (as defined in § 1.1001-1(f)(2)) in a tax-exempt trust (as defined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section) to which section 1001(e)(3) applies, the taxable beneficiary's share of adjusted uniform basis, determined as of (and immediately before) the sale or disposition of that interest, is—
(i) That part of the adjusted uniform basis assignable to the term interest of the taxable beneficiary under the rules of paragraph (a) of this section reduced, but not below zero, by
(ii) An amount determined by applying the same actuarial share applied in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section to the sum of—
(A) The trust's undistributed net ordinary income within the meaning of section 664(b)(1) and § 1.664-1(d)(1)(ii)(
a
)(
1
) for the current and prior taxable years of the trust, if any; and
(B) The trust's undistributed net capital gains within the meaning of section 664(b)(2) and § 1.664-1(d)(1)(ii)(
a
)(
2
) for the current and prior taxable years of the trust, if any.
(2)
Tax-exempt trust defined.
For purposes of this section, the term
tax-exempt trust
means a charitable remainder annuity trust or a charitable remainder unitrust as defined in section 664.
(3)
Taxable beneficiary defined.
For purposes of this section, the term
taxable beneficiary
means any person other than an organization described in section 170(c) or exempt from taxation under section 501(a).
(4)
Effective/applicability date.
This paragraph (c) and paragraph (d)
Example 7
and
Example 8
of this section apply to sales and other dispositions of interests in tax-exempt trusts occurring on or after January 16, 2014, except for sales or dispositions occurring pursuant to a binding commitment entered into before January 16, 2014.
(d)
Illustrations.
The application of this section may be illustrated by the following examples, in which references are made to the actuarial tables contained in part 20 of this chapter (Estate Tax Regulations):

# Example 1.
Securities worth $500,000 at the date of decedent's death on January 1, 1971, are bequeathed to his wife, W, for life, with remainder over to his son, S. W is 48 years of age when the life interest is acquired. The estate does not elect the alternate valuation allowed by section 2032. By reference to § 20.2031-7A(c), the life estate factor for age 48, female, is found to be 0.77488 and the remainder factor for such age is found to be 0.22512. Therefore, the present value of the portion of the uniform basis assigned to W's life interest is $387,440 ($500,000 × 0.77488), and the present value of the portion of the uniform basis assigned to S's remainder interest is $112,560 ($500,000 × 0.22512). W sells her life interest to her nephew, A, on February 1, 1971, for $370,000, at which time W is still 48 years of age. Pursuant to section 1001(e), W realizes no loss; her gain is $370,000, the amount realized from the sale. A has a basis of $370,000 which he can recover by amortization deductions over W's life expectancy.

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in example (1) except that W retains the life interest for 12 years, until she is 60 years of age, and then sells it to A on February 1, 1983, when the fair market value of the securities has increased to $650,000. By reference to § 20.2031-7A(c), the life estate factor for age 60, female, is found to be 0.63226 and the remainder factor for such age is found to be 0.36774. Therefore, the present value on February 1, 1983, of the portion of the uniform basis assigned to W's life interest is $316,130 ($500,000 × 0.63226) and the present value on that date of the portion of the uniform basis assigned to S's remainder interest is $183,870 ($500,000 × 0.36774). W sells her life interest for $410,969, that being the commuted value of her remaining life interest in the securities as appreciated ($650,000 × 0.63226). Pursuant to section 1001(e), W's gain is $410,969, the amount realized. A has a basis of $410,969 which he can recover by amortization deductions over W's life expectancy.

# Example 3.
Unimproved land having a fair market value of $18,800 at the date of the decedent's death on January 1, 1970, is devised to A, a male, for life, with remainder over to B, a female. The estate does not elect the alternate valuation allowed by section 2032. On January 1, 1971, A sells his life interest to S for $12,500. S is not related to A or B. At the time of the sale, A is 39 years of age. By reference to § 20.2031-7A(c), the life estate factor for age 39, male, is found to be 0.79854. Therefore, the present value of the portion of the uniform basis assigned to A's life interest is $15,012.55 ($18,800 × 0.79854). This portion is disregarded under section 1001(e). A realizes no loss; his gain is $12,500, the amount realized. S has a basis of $12,500 which he can recover by amortization deductions over A's life expectancy.

# Example 4.
The facts are the same as in example (3) except that on January 1, 1971, A and B jointly sell the entire property to S for $25,000 and divide the proceeds equally between them. A and B are not related, and there is no element of gift or compensation in the transaction. By reference to § 20.2031-7A(c), the remainder factor for age 39, male, is found to be 0.20146. Therefore, the present value of the uniform basis assigned to B's remainder interest is $3,787.45 ($18,800 × 0.20146). On the sale A realizes a loss of $2,512.55 ($15,012.55 less $12,500), the portion of the uniform basis assigned to his life interest not being disregarded by reason of section 1001(e)(3). B's gain on the sale is $8,712.55 ($12,500 less $3,787.45). S has a basis in the entire property of $25,000, no part of which, however, can be recovered by amortization deductions over A's life expectancy.

# Example 5.
(a) Nondepreciable property having a fair market value of $54,000 at the date of decedent's death on January 1, 1971, is devised to her husband, H, for life and, after his death, to her daughter, D, for life, with remainder over to her grandson, G. The estate does not elect the alternate valuation allowed by section 2032. On January 1, 1973, H sells his life interest to D for $32,000. At the date of the sale, H is 62 years of age, and D is 45 years of age. By reference to § 20.2031-7A(c), the life estate factor for age 62, male, is found to be 0.52321. Therefore, the present value on January 1, 1973, of the portion of the adjusted uniform basis assigned to H's life interest is $28,253 ($54,000 × 0.52321). Pursuant to section 1001(e), H realizes no loss; his gain is $32,000, the amount realized from the sale. D has a basis of $32,000 which she can recover by amortization deductions over H's life expectancy.
(b) On January 1, 1976, D sells both life estates to G for $40,000. During each of the years 1973 through 1975, D is allowed a deduction for the amortization of H's life interest. At the date of the sale H is 65 years of age, and D is 48 years of age. For purposes of determining gain or loss on the sale by D, the portion of the adjusted uniform basis assigned to H's life interest and the portion assigned to D's life interest are not taken into account under section 1001(e). However, pursuant to § 1.1001-1(f)(1), D's cost basis in H's life interest, minus deductions for the amortization of such interest, is taken into account. On the sale, D realizes gain of $40,000 minus an amount which is equal to the $32,000 cost basis (for H's life estate) reduced by amortization deductions. G is entitled to amortize over H's life expectancy that part of the $40,000 cost which is attributable to H's life interest. That part of the $40,000 cost which is attributable to D's life interest is not amortizable by G until H dies.

# Example 6.
Securities worth $1,000,000 at the date of decedent's death on January 1, 1971, are bequeathed to his wife, W, for life, with remainder over to his son, S. W is 48 years of age when the life interest is acquired. The estate does not elect the alternate valuation allowed by section 2032. By reference to § 20.2031-7A(c), the life estate factor for age 48, female, is found to be 0.77488, and the remainder factor for such age is found to be 0.22512. Therefore, the present value of the portion of the uniform basis assigned to W's life interest is $774,880 ($1,000,000 × 0.77488), and the present value of the portion of the uniform basis assigned to S's remainder interest is $225,120 ($1,000,000 × 0.22512). On February 1, 1971, W transfers her life interest to corporation X in exchange for all of the stock of X pursuant to a transaction in which no gain or loss is recognized by reason of section 351. On February 1, 1972, W sells all of her stock in X to S for $800,000. Pursuant to section 1001(e) and § 1.1001-1(f)(2), W realizes no loss; her gain is $800,000, the amount realized from the sale. On February 1, 1972, X sells to N for $900,000 the life interest transferred to it by W. Pursuant to section 1001(e) and § 1.1001-1(f)(1), X realizes no loss; its gain is $900,000, the amount realized from the sale. N has a basis of $900,000 which he can recover by amortization deductions over W's life expectancy.

# Example 7.
(a) Grantor creates a charitable remainder unitrust (CRUT) on Date 1 in which Grantor retains a unitrust interest and irrevocably transfers the remainder interest to Charity. Grantor is an individual taxpayer subject to income tax. CRUT meets the requirements of section 664 and is exempt from income tax.
(b) Grantor's basis in the shares of X stock used to fund CRUT is $10x. On Date 2, CRUT sells the X stock for $100x. The $90x of gain is exempt from income tax under section 664(c)(1). On Date 3, CRUT uses the $100x proceeds from its sale of the X stock to purchase Y stock. On Date 4, CRUT sells the Y stock for $110x. The $10x of gain on the sale of the Y stock is exempt from income tax under section 664(c)(1). On Date 5, CRUT uses the $110x proceeds from its sale of Y stock to
buy Z stock. On Date 5, CRUT's basis in its assets is $110x and CRUT's total undistributed net capital gains are $100x.
(c) Later, when the fair market value of CRUT's assets is $150x and CRUT has no undistributed net ordinary income, Grantor and Charity sell all of their interests in CRUT to a third person. Grantor receives $100x for the retained unitrust interest, and Charity receives $50x for its interest. Because the entire interest in CRUT is transferred to the third person, section 1001(e)(3) prevents section 1001(e)(1) from applying to the transaction. Therefore, Grantor's gain on the sale of the retained unitrust interest in CRUT is determined under section 1001(a), which provides that Grantor's gain on the sale of that interest is the excess of the amount realized, $100x, over Grantor's adjusted basis in the interest.
(d) Grantor's adjusted basis in the unitrust interest in CRUT is that portion of CRUT's adjusted uniform basis that is assignable to Grantor's interest under § 1.1014-5, which is Grantor's actuarial share of the adjusted uniform basis. In this case, CRUT's adjusted uniform basis in its sole asset, the Z stock, is $110x. However, paragraph (c) of this section applies to the transaction. Therefore, Grantor's actuarial share of CRUT's adjusted uniform basis (determined by applying the factors set forth in the tables contained in § 20.2031-7 of this chapter) is reduced by an amount determined by applying the same factors to the sum of CRUT's $0 of undistributed net ordinary income and its $100x of undistributed net capital gains.
(e) In determining Charity's share of the adjusted uniform basis, Charity applies the factors set forth in the tables contained in § 20.2031-7 of this chapter to the full $110x of basis.

# Example 8.
(a) Grantor creates a charitable remainder annuity trust (CRAT) on Date 1 in which Grantor retains an annuity interest and irrevocably transfers the remainder interest to Charity. Grantor is an individual taxpayer subject to income tax. CRAT meets the requirements of section 664 and is exempt from income tax.
(b) Grantor funds CRAT with shares of X stock having a basis of $50x. On Date 2, CRAT sells the X stock for $150x. The $100x of gain is exempt from income tax under section 664(c)(1). On Date 3, CRAT distributes $10x to Grantor, and uses the remaining $140x of net proceeds from its sale of the X stock to purchase Y stock. Grantor treats the $10x distribution as capital gain, so that CRAT's remaining undistributed net capital gains amount described in section 664(b)(2) and § 1.664-1(d) is $90x.
(c) On Date 4, when the fair market value of CRAT's assets, which consist entirely of the Y stock, is still $140x, Grantor and Charity sell all of their interests in CRAT to a third person. Grantor receives $126x for the retained annuity interest, and Charity receives $14x for its remainder interest. Because the entire interest in CRAT is transferred to the third person, section 1001(e)(3) prevents section 1001(e)(1) from applying to the transaction. Therefore, Grantor's gain on the sale of the retained annuity interest in CRAT is determined under section 1001(a), which provides that Grantor's gain on the sale of that interest is the excess of the amount realized, $126x, over Grantor's adjusted basis in that interest.
(d) Grantor's adjusted basis in the annuity interest in CRAT is that portion of CRAT's adjusted uniform basis that is assignable to Grantor's interest under § 1.1014-5, which is Grantor's actuarial share of the adjusted uniform basis. In this case, CRAT's adjusted uniform basis in its sole asset, the Y stock, is $140x. However, paragraph (c) of this section applies to the transaction. Therefore, Grantor's actuarial share of CRAT's adjusted uniform basis (determined by applying the factors set forth in the tables contained in § 20.2031-7 of this chapter) is reduced by an amount determined by applying the same factors to the sum of CRAT's $0 of undistributed net ordinary income and its $90x of undistributed net capital gains.
(e) In determining Charity's share of the adjusted uniform basis, Charity applies the factors set forth in the tables contained in § 20.2031-7 of this chapter to determine its actuarial share of the full $140x of basis.

§ 1.1014-6
Special rule for adjustments to basis where property is acquired from a decedent prior to his death.
(a)
In general.
(1) The basis of property described in section 1014(b)(9) which is acquired from a decedent prior to his death shall be adjusted for depreciation, obsolescence, amortization, and depletion allowed the taxpayer on such property for the period prior to the decedent's death. Thus, in general, the adjusted basis of such property will be its fair market value at the decedent's death, or the applicable alternate valuation date, less the amount allowed (determined with regard to section 1016(a)(2)(B)) to the taxpayer as deductions for exhaustion, wear and tear, obsolescence, amortization, and depletion for the period held by the taxpayer prior to the decedent's death. The deduction allowed for a taxable year in which the decedent dies shall be an amount properly allocable to
that part of the year prior to his death. For a discussion of the basis adjustment required by section 1014(b)(9) where property is held in trust, see paragraph (c) of this section.
(2) Where property coming within the purview of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph was held by the decedent and his surviving spouse as tenants by the entirety or as joint tenants with right of survivorship, and joint income tax returns were filed by the decedent and the surviving spouse in which the deductions referred to in subparagraph (1) were taken, there shall be allocated to the surviving spouse's interest in the property that proportion of the deductions allowed for each period for which the joint returns were filed which her income from the property bears to the total income from the property. Each spouse's income from the property shall be determined in accordance with local law.
(3) The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
The taxpayer acquired income-producing property by gift on January 1, 1954. The property had a fair market value of $50,000 on the date of the donor's death, January 1, 1956, and was included in his gross estate at that amount for estate tax purposes as a transfer in contemplation of death. Depreciation in the amount of $750 per year was allowable for each of the taxable years 1954 and 1955. However, the taxpayer claimed depreciation in the amount of $500 for each of these years (resulting in a reduction in his taxes) and his income tax returns were accepted as filed. The adjusted basis of the property as of the date of the decedent's death is $49,000 ($50,000, the fair market value at the decedent's death, less $1,000, the total of the amounts actually allowed as deductions).

# Example 2.
On July 1, 1952, H purchased for $30,000 income-producing property which he conveyed to himself and W, his wife, as tenants by the entirety. Under local law each spouse was entitled to one-half of the income therefrom. H died on January 1, 1955, at which time the fair market value of the property was $40,000. The entire value of the property was included in H's gross estate. H and W filed joint income tax returns for the years 1952, 1953, and 1954. The total depreciation allowance for the year 1952 was $500 and for each of the other years 1953 and 1954 was $1,000. One-half of the $2,500 depreciation will be allocated to W. The adjusted basis of the property in W's hands of January 1, 1955, was $38,750 ($40,000, value on the date of H's death, less $1,250, depreciation allocated to W for periods before H's death). However, if, under local law, all of the income from the property was allocable to H, no adjustment under this paragraph would be required and W's basis for the property as of the date of H's death would be $40,000.
(b)
Multiple interests in property described in section 1014(b)(9) and acquired from a decedent prior to his death.
(1) Where more than one person has an interest in property described in section 1014(b)(9) which was acquired from a decedent before his death, the basis of such property and of each of the several interests therein shall, in general, be determined and adjusted in accordance with the principles contained in §§ 1.1014-4 and 1.1014-5, relating to the uniformity of basis rule. Application of these principles to the determination of basis under section 1014(b)(9) is shown in the remaining subparagraphs of this paragraph in connection with certain commonly encountered situations involving multiple interests in property acquired from a decedent before his death.
(2) Where property is acquired from a decedent before his death, and the entire property is subsequently included in the decedent's gross estate for estate tax purposes, the uniform basis of the property, as well as the basis of each of the several interests in the property, shall be determined by taking into account the basis adjustments required by section 1014(a) owing to such inclusion of the entire property in the decedent's gross estate. For example, suppose that the decedent transfers property in trust, with a life estate to A, and the remainder to B or his estate. The transferred property consists of 100 shares of the common stock of X Corporation, with a basis of $10,000 at the time of the transfer. At the time of the decedent's death the value of the stock is $20,000. The transfer is held to have been made in contemplation of death and the entire value of the trust is included in the decedent's gross estate. Under section 1014(a), the uniform basis of the property in the hands of the trustee, the life tenant, and the remainderman, is $20,000. If immediately prior to the decedent's death, A's share of the uniform basis of $10,000 was $6,000, and B's share was $4,000, then, immediately after the decedent's
death, A's share of the uniform basis of $20,000 is $12,000, and B's share is $8,000.
(3)(i) In cases where, due to the operation of the estate tax, only a portion of property acquired from a decedent before his death is included in the decedent's gross estate, as in cases where the decedent retained a reversion to take effect upon the expiration of a life estate in another, the uniform basis of the entire property shall be determined by taking into account any basis adjustments required by section 1014(a) owing to such inclusion of a portion of the property in the decedent's gross estate. In such cases the uniform basis is the adjusted basis of the entire property immediately prior to the decedent's death increased (or decreased) by an amount which bears the same relation to the total appreciation (or diminution) in value of the entire property (over the adjusted basis of the entire property immediately prior to the decedent's death) as the value of the property included in the decedent's gross estate bears to the value of the entire property. For example, assume that the decedent creates a trust to pay the income to A for life, remainder to B or his estate. The trust instrument further provides that if the decedent should survive A, the income shall be paid to the decedent for life. Assume that the decedent predeceases A, so that, due to the operation of the estate tax, only the present value of the remainder interest is included in the decedent's gross estate. The trust consists of 100 shares of the common stock of X Corporation with an adjusted basis immediately prior to the decedent's death of $10,000 (as determined under section 1015). At the time of the decedent's death, the value of the stock is $20,000, and the value of the remainder interest in the hands of B is $8,000. The uniform basis of the entire property following the decedent's death is $14,000, computed as follows:
Uniform basis prior to decedent's death
$10,000
plus
Increase in uniform basis (determined by the following formula)
4,000
[Increase in uniform basis (to be determined)/$10,000 (total appreciation)]=
[$8,000 (value of property included in gross estate)/$20,000 (value of entire property)]
Uniform basis under section 1014(a)
14,000
(ii) In cases of the type described in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, the basis of any interest which is included in the decedent's gross estate may be ascertained by adding to (or subtracting from) the basis of such interest determined immediately prior to the decedent's death the increase (or decrease) in the uniform basis of the property attributable to the inclusion of the interest in the decedent's gross estate. Where the interest is sold or otherwise disposed of at any time after the decedent's death, proper adjustment must be made in order to reflect the change in value of the interest on account of the passage of time, as provided in § 1.1014-5. For an illustration of the operation of this subdivision, see step 6 of the example in § 1.1014-7.
(iii) In cases of the type described in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph (cases where, due to the operation of the estate tax, only a portion of the property is included in the decedent's gross estate), the basis for computing the depreciation, amortization, or depletion allowance shall be the uniform basis of the property determined under section 1014(a). However, the manner of taking into account such allowance computed with respect to such uniform basis is subject to the following limitations:
(
a
) In cases where the value of the life interest is not included in the decedent's gross estate, the amount of such allowance to the life tenant under section 167(h) (or section 611(b)) shall not exceed (or be less than) the amount which would have been allowable to the life tenant if no portion of the basis of the property was determined under section 1014(a). Proper adjustment shall be made for the amount allowable to the life tenant, as required by section 1016. Thus, an appropriate adjustment shall be made to the uniform basis of the property in the hands of the trustee, to the basis of the life interest in the hands of the life tenant, and to the basis of the remainder in the hands of the remainderman.
(
b
) Any remaining allowance (that is, the increase in the amount of depreciation, amortization, or depletion allowable resulting from any increase in the uniform basis of the property under section 1014(a)) shall not be allowed to
the life tenant. The remaining allowance shall, instead, be allowed to the trustee to the extent that the trustee both (
1
) is required or permitted, by the governing trust instrument (or under local law), to maintain a reserve for depreciation, amortization, or depletion, and (
2
) actually maintains such a reserve. If, in accordance with the preceding sentence, the trustee does maintain such a reserve, the remaining allowance shall be taken into account, under section 1016, in adjusting the uniform basis of the property in the hands of the trustee and in adjusting the basis of the remainder interest in the hands of the remainderman, but shall not be taken into account, under section 1016, in determining the basis of the life interest in the hands of the life tenant. For an example of the operation of this subdivision, see paragraph (b) of § 1.1014-7.
(4) In cases where the basis of any interest in property is not determined under section 1014(a), as where such interest (i) is not included in the decedent's gross estate, or (ii) is sold, exchanged or otherwise disposed of before the decedent's death, the basis of such interest shall be determined under other applicable provisions of the Code. To illustrate, in the example shown in subparagraph (3)(i) of this paragraph the basis of the life estate in the hands of A shall be determined under section 1015, relating to the basis of property acquired by gift. If, on the other hand, A had sold his life interest prior to the decedent's death, the basis of the life estate in the hands of A's transferee would be determined under section 1012.
(c)
Adjustments for deductions allowed prior to the decedent's death.
(1) As stated in paragraph (a) of this section, section 1014(b)(9) requires a reduction in the uniform basis of property acquired from a decedent before his death for certain deductions allowed in respect of such property during the decedent's lifetime. In general, the amount of the reduction in basis required by section 1014(b)(9) shall be the aggregate of the deductions allowed in respect of the property, but shall not include deductions allowed in respect of the property to the decedent himself. In cases where, owing to the operation of the estate tax, only a part of the value of the entire property is included in the decedent's gross estate, the amount of the reduction required by section 1014(b)(9) shall be an amount which bears the same relation to the total of all deductions (described in paragraph (a) of this section) allowed in respect of the property as the value of the property included in the decedent's gross estate bears to the value of the entire property.
(2) The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
The decedent creates a trust to pay the income to A for life, remainder to B or his estate. The property transferred in trust consists of an apartment building with a basis of $50,000 at the time of the transfer. The decedent dies 2 years after the transfer is made and the gift is held to have been made in contemplation of death. Depreciation on the property was allowed in the amount of $1,000 annually. At the time of the decedent's death the value of the property is $58,000. The uniform basis of the property in the hands of the trustee, the life tenant, and the remainderman, immediately after the decedent's death is $56,000 ($58,000, fair market value of the property immediately after the decedent's death, reduced by $2,000, deductions for depreciation allowed prior to the decedent's death).

# Example 2.
The decedent creates a trust to pay the income to A for life, remainder to B or his estate. The trust instrument provides that if the decedent should survive A, the income shall be paid to the decedent for life. The decedent predeceases A and the present value of the remainder interest is included in the decedent's gross estate for estate tax purposes. The property transferred consists of an apartment building with a basis of $110,000 at the time of the transfer. Following the creation of the trust and during the balance of the decedent's life, deductions for depreciation were allowed on the property in the amount of $10,000. At the time of decedent's death the value of the entire property is $150,000, and the value of the remainder interest is $100,000. Accordingly, the uniform basis of the property in the hands of the trustee, the life tenant, and the remainderman, as adjusted under section 1014(b)(9), is $126,666, computed as follows:
Uniform basis prior to decedent's death
$100,000
plus
Increase in uniform basis—before reduction (determined by the following formula)
33,333
[Increase in uniform basis (to be determined)/$50,000 (total appreciation of property since time of transfer)]=
[$100,000 (value of property included in gross estate)/$150,000 (value of entire property)]
less

§ 1.1014-7
Example applying rules of §§ 1.1014-4 through 1.1014-6 to case involving multiple interests.
(a) On January 1, 1950, the decedent creates a trust to pay the income to A for life, remainder to B or his estate. The trust instrument provides that if the decedent should survive A, the income shall be paid to the decedent for life. The decedent, who died on January 1, 1955, predeceases A, so that, due to the operation of the estate tax, only the present value of the remainder interest is included in the decedent's gross estate. The trust consists of an apartment building with a basis of $30,000 at the time of transfer. Under the trust instrument the trustee is required to maintain a reserve for depreciation. During the decedent's lifetime depreciation is allowed in the amount of $800 annually. At the time of the decedent's death the value of the apartment building is $45,000. A, the life tenant, is 43 years of age at the time of the decedent's death. Immediately after the decedent's death, the uniform basis of the entire property under section 1014(a) is $32,027; A's basis for the life interest is $15,553; and B's basis for the remainder interest is $16,474, computed as follows:
Step 1.

Step 6.
B's basis for the remainder interest, determined under section 1014(a): Basis prior to the decedent's death:

(b) Assume the same facts as in paragraph (a) of this section. Assume further, that following the decedent's death depreciation is allowed in the amount of $1,000 annually. As of January 1, 1964, when A's age is 52, the adjusted uniform basis of the entire property is $23,027; A's basis for the life interest is $9,323; and B's basis for the remainder interest is $13,704, computed as follows:

§ 1.1014-8
Bequest, devise, or inheritance of a remainder interest.
(a)(1) Where property is transferred for life, with remainder in fee, and the remainderman dies before the life tenant, no adjustment is made to the uniform basis of the property on the death of the remainderman (see paragraph (a) of § 1.1014-4). However, the basis of the remainderman's heir, legatee, or devisee for the remainder interest is determined by adding to (or subtracting from) the part of the adjusted uniform basis assigned to the remainder interest (determined in accordance with the principles set forth in §§ 1.1014-4 through 1.1014-6) the difference between—
(i) The value of the remainder interest included in the remainderman's estate, and
(ii) The basis of the remainder interest immediately prior to the remainderman's death.
(2) The basis of any property distributed to the heir, legatee, or devisee upon termination of a trust (or legal life estate) or at any other time (unless included in the gross income of the legatee or devisee) shall be determined by adding to (or subtracting from) the adjusted uniform basis of the property thus distributed the difference between—
(i) The value of the remainder interest in the property included in the remainderman's estate, and
(ii) The basis of the remainder interest in the property immediately prior to the remainderman's death.
(b) The provisions of paragraph (a) of this section are illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Assume that, under the will of a decedent, property consisting of common stock with a value of $1,000 at the time of the decedent's death is transferred in trust, to pay the income to A for life, remainder to B or to B's estate. B predeceases A and bequeaths the remainder interest to C. Assume that B dies on January 1, 1956, and that the value of the stock originally transferred is $1,600 at B's death. A's age at that time is 37. The value of the remainder interest included in B's estate is $547 (0.34185, remainder factor age 37, × $1,600), and hence $547 is C's basis for the remainder interest immediately after B's death. Assume that C sells the remainder interest on January 1, 1961, when A's age is 42. C's basis for the remainder interest at the time of such sale is $596, computed as follows:
Basis of remainder interest computed with respect to uniform basis of entire property (0.39131, remainder factor age 42, × $1,000, uniform basis of entire property)
$391
plus
Value of remainder interest included in B's estate
$547
less
Basis of remainder interest immediately prior to B's death (0.34185, remainder factor age 37, × $1,000)
342
___
205
Basis of C's remainder interest at the time of sale
596

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in example (1), except that C does not sell the remainder interest. Upon A's death terminating the trust, C's basis for the stock distributed to him is computed as follows:
Uniform basis of the property, adjusted to date of termination of the trust
$1,000
plus
Value of remainder interests in the property at the time of B's death
$547
less
B's share of uniform basis of the property at the time of his death
342
___
205
C's basis for the stock distributed to him upon the termination of the trust
1,205

# Example 3.
Assume the same facts as in example (2), except that the property transferred is depreciable. Assume further that $100 of depreciation was allowed prior to B's death and that $50 of depreciation is allowed between the time of B's death and the termination of the trust. Upon A's death terminating the trust, C's basis for the property distributed to him is computed as follows:
Uniform basis of the property, adjusted to date of termination of the trust:
Uniform basis immediately after decedent's death
$1,000
Depreciation allowed following decedent's death
150
$350
plus
Value of remainder interest in the property at the time of B's death
547
less
B's share of uniform basis of the property at the time of his death (0.34185 × $900, uniform basis at B's death)
308
___
239
C's basis for the property distributed to him upon the termination of the trust
1,089
(c) The rules stated in paragraph (a) of this section do not apply where the basis of the remainder interest in the hands of the remainderman's transferee is determined by reference to its cost to such transferee. See also paragraph (a) of § 1.1014-4. Thus, if, in example (
1
) of paragraph (b) of this section B sold his remainder interest to C for $547 in cash, C's basis for the stock distributed to him upon the death of A terminating the trust is $547.
§ 1.1014-9
Special rule with respect to DISC stock.
(a)
In general.
If property consisting of stock of a DISC or former DISC (as defined in section 992(a) (1) or (3) as the case may be) is considered to have been acquired from a decedent (within the meaning of paragraph (a) or (b) of § 1.1014-2), the uniform basis of such stock under section 1014, as determined pursuant to §§ 1.1014-1 through 1.1014-8 shall be reduced as provided in this section. Such uniform basis shall be reduced by the amount (hereinafter referred to in this section as the amount of reduction), if any, which the decedent would have included in his gross income under section 995(c) as a dividend if the decedent had lived and sold such stock at its fair market value on the estate tax valuation date. If the alternate valuation date for Federal estate tax purposes is elected under section 2032, in computing the gain which the decedent would have had if he had lived and sold the stock on the alternate valuation date, the decedent's basis shall be determined with reduction for any distributions with respect to the stock which may have been made, after the date of the decedent's death and on or before the alternate valuation date, from the DISC's previously taxed income (as defined in section 996(f)(2)). For this purpose, the last sentence of section 996(e)(2) (relating to reductions of basis of DISC stock) shall not apply. For purposes of this section, if the corporation is not a DISC or former DISC at the date of the decedent's death but is a DISC for a taxable year which begins after such date and on or before the alternate valuation date, the corporation will be considered to be a DISC or former DISC only if the alternate valuation date is elected. The provisions of this paragraph apply with respect to stock of a DISC or former DISC which is included in the gross estate of the decedent, including but not limited to property which—
(1) Is acquired from the decedent before his death, and the entire property is subsequently included in the decedent's gross estate for estate tax purposes, or
(2) Is acquired property described in paragraph (d) of § 1.1014-3.
(b)
Portion of property acquired from decedent before his death included in decedent's gross estate
—(1)
In general.
In cases where, due to the operation of the estate tax, only a portion of property which consists of stock of a DISC or former DISC and which is acquired from a decedent before his death is included in the decedent's gross estate, the uniform basis of such stock under section 1014, as determined pursuant to §§ 1.1014-1 through 1.1014-8, shall be reduced by an amount which bears the same ratio to the amount of reduction which would have been determined under paragraph (a) of this section if the entire property consisting of such
stock were included in the decedent's gross estate as the value of such property included in the decedent's gross estate bears to the value of the entire property.
(2)
Example.
The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example:
The decedent creates a trust during his lifetime to pay the income to A for life, remainder to B or his estate. The trust instrument further provides that if the decedent shall survive A, the income shall be paid to the decedent for life. The decedent predeceases A, so that, due to the operation of the estate tax, only the present value of the remainder interest is included in the decedent's gross estate. The trust consists of 100 shares of the stock of X corporation (which is a DISC at the time the shares are transferred to the trust and at the time of the decedent's death) with an adjusted basis immediately prior to the decedent's death of $10,000 (as determined under section 1015). At the time of the decedent's death the value of the stock is $20,000, and the value of the remainder interest in the hands of B is $8,000. Applying the principles of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of § 1.1014-6, the uniform basis of the entire property following the decedent's death, prior to reduction pursuant to this paragraph, is $14,000. The amount of reduction which would have been determined under paragraph (a) of this section if the entire property consisting of such stock of X corporation were included in the decedent's gross estate is $5,000. The uniform basis of the entire property following the decedent's death, as reduced pursuant to this paragraph, is $12,000, computed as follows:
Uniform basis under section 1014(a), prior to reduction pursuant to this paragraph
$14,000
Less decrease in uniform basis (determined by the following formula)
2,000
[Reduction in uniform basis (to be determined)/ $5,000 (amount of reduction if paragraph (a) applied)] =
[$8,000 (value of property included in gross estate/$20,000 (value of entire property)]
Uniform basis under section 1014(a) reduced pursuant to this paragraph
12,000
(c)
Estate tax valuation date.
For purposes of section 1014(d) and this section, the estate tax valuation date is the date of the decedent's death or, in the case of an election under section 2032, the applicable valuation date prescribed by that section.
(d)
Examples.
The provisions of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
At the date of A's death, his DISC stock has a fair market value of $100. The estate does not elect the alternate valuation allowed by section 2032, and A's basis in such stock is $60 at the date of his death. The person who acquires such stock from the decedent will take as a basis for such stock its fair market value at A's death ($100), reduced by the amount which would have been included in A's gross income under section 995(c) as a dividend if A had sold stock on the date he died. Thus, if the amount that would have been treated as a dividend under section 995(c) were $30, such person will take a basis of $70 for such stock ($100, reduced by $30). If such person were immediately to sell the DISC stock so received for $100, $30 of the proceeds from the sale would be treated as a dividend by such person under section 995(c).

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in example (1) except that the estate elects the alternate valuation allowed by section 2032, the DISC stock has a fair market value of $140 on the alternate valuation date, the amount that would have been treated as a dividend under section 995(c) in the event of a sale on such date is $50 and the DISC has $20 of previously taxed income which accrued after the date of the decedent's death and before the alternate valuation date. The basis of the person who acquires such stock will be $90 determined as follows:
(1) Fair market value of DISC stock at alternate valuation date
$140
(2) Less: Amount which would have been treated as a dividend under section 995(c)
50
(3) Basis of person who acquires DISC stock
90
If a distribution of $20 attributable to such previously taxed income had been made by the DISC on or before the alternate valuation date (with the DISC stock having a fair market value of $120 after such distribution), the basis of the person who acquires such stock will be $70 determined as follows:
(1) Fair market value of DISC stock at alternate valuation date
$120
(2) Less: Amount which would have been treated as a dividend under section 995(c)
50
(3) Basis of person who acquires DISC stock
70
[T.D. 7283, 38 FR 20825, Aug. 3, 1973]
§ 1.1014-10
Basis of property acquired from a decedent must be consistent with property's Federal estate tax value.
(a)
Consistent basis requirement
—(1)
General rule.
The consistent basis requirement is the requirement that the initial basis in certain property be equal to or less than the property's
final value as determined under paragraph (b)(1) of this section or, if no final value has yet been determined, the property's reported value for Federal estate tax purposes as described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. The property subject to the consistent basis requirement is referred to in this section as consistent basis property and is described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
(2)
Initial basis in consistent basis property and effect of basis adjustments.
The initial basis in consistent basis property is the final value of the property, as determined under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and, until the final value of this property is determined, the property's initial basis is the reported value, as described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. The initial basis in consistent basis property may be adjusted pursuant to the operation of section 1014 or other provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) governing basis, as applicable, and those adjustments will not violate the consistent basis requirement in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. For example, the initial basis in consistent basis property may be adjusted for gain recognized by the estate upon distribution of the property and for post-death capital improvements and depreciation. It also may be adjusted in the manner provided in section 1014(d) in the case of DISC stock and in the manner provided under subchapter K or S of chapter 1 of the Code, respectively, in the case of an interest in a partnership or S corporation.
(3)
Duration of consistent basis requirement.
The consistent basis requirement applies as long as the initial basis in consistent basis property is related, in whole or in part, to the property's final value, as determined under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, or, if applicable, the property's reported value, as determined under paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Therefore, regardless of the number of successive owners, the consistent basis requirement continues to apply until the entire property is sold, exchanged, or otherwise disposed of in one or more transactions that result in a recognition event for income tax purposes (whether or not resulting in a gain or loss) or until the entire property becomes includible in another decedent's gross estate. The consistent basis requirement applies whenever there is a taxable event with respect to the property, such as, but not limited to, a sale or exchange, depreciation, or amortization of the property. The expiration of the period of limitations on assessment for an income tax return that uses an incorrect basis in reporting a taxable event with respect to consistent basis property has no effect on the duty to determine basis under the rules of this section for purposes of reporting any subsequent taxable event with respect to the property if the consistent basis requirement continues to apply under the rule of this paragraph (a)(3).
(b)
Final value and reported value
—(1)
Final value.
The final value of consistent basis property is its fair market value as finally determined for Federal estate tax purposes. That value is—
(i) The value reported on an estate tax return filed with the IRS, once the period of limitations on assessment (
see
section 6501) of estate tax has expired without that value having been timely adjusted by the IRS; or
(ii) The value determined or specified by the IRS that differs from the value reported on an estate tax return filed with the IRS and the value specified by the IRS for other included property, as defined in paragraph (d)(4) of this section, once the period of limitations on assessment applicable to the estate tax has expired without that value having been timely contested by the executor, as defined in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section, respectively; or
(iii) The value determined in a written agreement with the IRS, (whether entered into in the course of the administrative proceedings between the estate and the IRS or after the commencement of litigation), once that written agreement has been executed by both the executor and the IRS and is binding on all parties (including, but not limited to, the executor, the IRS, and the beneficiaries); or
(iv) The value determined by a court for the purpose of determining the estate tax liability of the estate, as defined in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, once the court's determination no longer can be appealed to any court.
(2)
Reported value if no final value yet determined
—(i)
In general.
Prior to the determination of the final value in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section, a taxpayer may not claim an initial basis in consistent basis property in excess of the property's value as reported on the Statement described in § 1.6035-1(c)(2) and required under § 1.6035-1 (as supplemented). This value is referred to in this section as the reported value. A value reported on a Statement (or a supplement to the Statement) that either reports a value from an estate tax return filed after the expiration of the period of limitations on assessment applicable to that return, or a value reported for property not reported on the estate tax return, is not a reported value for purposes of this section.
See
§ 1.6035-1(d) regarding an executor's duty to supplement the Statement.
(ii)
Limit on reliance on Statement not reporting final value.
If the final value of consistent basis property is determined (as described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section) before the expiration of the period of limitations on assessment for a taxpayer's income tax return that reports a taxable event with regard to the property, the taxpayer's reliance on a Statement (or a supplement to the Statement) that does not report the final value of the property may result in an income tax deficiency and underpayment.
See,
however, section 6664 and the corresponding regulations for rules relating to waivers of penalties for certain failures due to reasonable cause.
(3)
Special rules
—(i)
Property subject to debt.
The final value or, if applicable, the reported value of property subject to recourse or non-recourse debt is determined based on the gross value of that property undiminished by the debt, regardless of whether the estate tax return reports the net value (equity of redemption value) of the property or separately reports the gross value of the property and the outstanding debt.
(ii)
Special use property.
The final value or, if applicable, the reported value of special use property with regard to which a recapture event (described in section 2032A(c)(1)) has occurred is increased as provided in section 1016(c) if the qualified heir makes the election under section 1016(c) and pays the amounts required under that section.
(c)
Consistent basis property
—(1)
Property subject to the consistent basis requirement
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, consistent basis property is any property—
(A) To which section 1014(a) applies;
(B) That is included property, as defined in paragraph (d)(4) of this section, if the decedent's Federal estate tax return is filed after July 31, 2015, and any other property the basis of which is determined, in whole or in part, by reference to the basis of included property (for example, property acquired in a like-kind exchange or an involuntary conversion); and
(C) Whose value increases the estate tax liability, as defined in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, that is payable after the application of allowable credits, as defined in paragraph (d)(5) of this section.
(ii)
Application.
If the decedent's Federal estate tax return is filed on or before July 31, 2015, no included property and no other property described in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section is subject to the consistent basis requirement, even if the due date of that return is after July 31, 2015, or if one or more supplements to that return are filed with the IRS after July 31, 2015. If an estate tax liability is payable after the application of allowable credits, all property described in paragraphs (c)(1)(i)(A) and (B) of this section is considered property whose value increases the estate tax liability for purposes of paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) of this section and, therefore, is subject to the consistent basis requirement, except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. If, after the application of allowable credits, no estate tax liability is payable, no such property is subject to the consistent basis requirement.
(2)
Property excepted from or not subject to the consistent basis requirement.
Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the following property either is excepted from or is not subject to the consistent basis requirement—
(i) United States dollars (as defined in paragraph (d)(6) of this section).
(ii) United States dollar-denominated demand deposits.
(iii) Certificates of deposit denominated in United States dollars.
(iv) Cash collateral denominated in United States dollars held by a third party to secure a liability (such as a deposit of purchase money or a security deposit).
(v) Shares of a registered investment company priced in United States dollars that is a money market fund under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (17 CFR 270.2).
(vi) Life insurance proceeds on the life of the decedent payable in a lump sum in United States dollars.
(vii) Federal, State, and local tax refunds and other refunds payable entirely in United States dollars.
(viii) Notes that are forgiven in full by the decedent upon death, whether or not denominated in United States dollars.
(ix) Household and personal effects for which an appraisal is not required under § 20.2031-6(b) of this chapter.
(x) Property the initial basis of which is not in any way determined with regard to or derived from the property's final value as determined under paragraph (b)(1) of this section or its reported value as determined under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, if applicable. Such property includes but is not limited to—
(A) Annuity contracts subject to section 72 and amounts received as an annuity subject to section 72;
(B) An interest in property that consists entirely of the right to receive an item of income in respect of a decedent as defined in section 691;
(C) Amounts received under installment obligations arising from a transaction for which the installment method for determining gain under section 453 applies;
(D) Appreciated property described in section 1014(e) that is acquired by the decedent within 1 year of death;
(E) Stock of a passive foreign investment company subject to section 1296(i), but only if the basis of such stock is the adjusted basis in the hands of the decedent immediately before the decedent's death; and
(F) Interests in and distributions from retirement plans and deferred compensation plans, including individual retirement arrangements as defined in sections 408 and 408A, that are expressed entirely in United States dollars.
(xi) Any interest in property that qualified for an estate tax marital deduction under section 2056, 2056A, or 2106(a)(3) for which such a deduction was properly claimed, and/or any interest in property that qualified for an estate tax charitable deduction under section 2055 or 2106(a)(2) for which such a deduction was properly claimed, provided that the value of the decedent's entire interest in the included property is wholly deductible and equal to the total amount qualifying for those deductions.
(xii) Property that represents the surviving spouse's one-half share of community property to which section 1014(b)(6) applies, regardless of whether this property is included property as defined in paragraph (d)(4) of this section.
(xiii) Property the basis of which is adjusted in a manner similar to section 1014(a) on the occurrence of a taxable termination that occurs on the death of a trust beneficiary pursuant to section 2654(a)(2) (to the extent the property is not then includible in the gross estate of any person).
(xiv) Any other property that is not described in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section or that is identified as excepted property in published guidance in the
Federal Register
or in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (
see
§ 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(
b
) of this chapter).
(d)
Definitions.
The following definitions apply for purposes of this section—
(1)
Contested.
The term
contested
means to put at issue the value of property in a written communication to the IRS that identifies the specific property, states that the executor does not accept as correct the value of that property as determined or specified by the IRS, and provides the executor's claimed value for that property as determined in accordance with the requirements of section 2031, the corresponding regulations, and other applicable guidance. An issue cannot be contested by a general statement or written communication that does not
include each of these specified elements.
(2)
Executor.
The term
executor
includes any person described in section 2203, as expanded to include all persons required under section 6018(b) to file an estate tax return.
(3)
Estate tax liability.
The term
estate tax liability
means the amount of tax imposed under chapter 11 of the Code (chapter 11).
(4)
Included property.
The term
included property
means property the value of which is included in the value of the decedent's gross estate as defined in section 2031 or 2103. Generally, this refers to property whose value is reported on an estate tax return, but it also refers to property whose value otherwise is included in the total value of the gross estate (for example, during examination by the IRS) so that a final value is or will be determined for that property under chapter 11. However, solely for purposes of this section, included property does not refer to unreported property whose value is not reported on an estate tax return and whose value is not otherwise included in the value of the decedent's gross estate as finally determined for Federal estate tax purposes.
(5)
Allowable credits.
The term
allowable credits
includes any credit against the estate tax liability allowable by any section of the Code or by reason of any treaty obligation of the United States, provided the estate qualifies for and properly claims the credit by complying with all applicable rules for claiming the credit. For instance, the prorated unified credit under section 2102(b)(3) is an allowable credit for qualifying estates if the estate files all necessary forms or statements required by the IRS to claim that credit.
(6)
United States dollars.
The term
United States dollars
means the official currency of the United States. The term United States dollars includes physical bills and coins for which the value of each bill or coin is equivalent to the face amount of that bill or coin. This definition does not include other physical United States bills or coins with numismatic value because these bills and coins typically do not have a value equal to their face value.
(e)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this section. In each case, the decedent D was a citizen of the United States, the estate does not elect the alternate valuation method under section 2032, and an estate tax liability is payable after the application of all allowable credits.
(1)
Example 1
—(i)
Final value determined by value on estate tax return.
At D's death, D owned (among other assets) a private residence not subject to any debt. D's sole beneficiary is D's child C. The value of the residence is reported on the estate tax return at $300,000. The IRS accepts the return as filed and the period of limitations on assessment of estate tax expires. For purposes of the consistent basis requirement applicable to C, the final value of D's residence is $300,000, and therefore, C's initial basis in the residence is $300,000. See paragraphs (a)(2) and (b)(1)(i) of this section.
(ii)
Adjustment of initial basis pursuant to other Code provisions.
Several years later, C adds a master suite to the private residence at a cost of $45,000. Pursuant to section 1016(a), C's basis in the residence is increased by $45,000 to $345,000. Subsequently, C sells the residence to an unrelated third party for $450,000. C claims a basis in the residence of $345,000 and reports a gain of $105,000 ($450,000 less $345,000). C has complied with the consistent basis requirement, and C's adjustment to C's initial basis does not violate the consistent basis requirement. See paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section.
(2)
Example 2
—(i)
Final value determined on examination.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section (
Example 1
) except that, on examination, the IRS adjusts the value of the residence to $290,000 and that value is not contested before the period of limitations on assessment of estate tax expires. For purposes of the consistent basis requirement applicable to C, the final value of the residence is $290,000, and therefore, C's initial basis in the residence, before taking into account C's subsequent renovations, is $290,000. See paragraphs (a)(2) and (b)(1)(ii) of this section.
(ii)
Reported value if no final value yet determined and reliance on Statement required under § 1.6035-1.
Prior to the determination of final value, C sells the residence for $375,000. C reports a gain of $75,000 on C's income tax return, relying on the reported value in a Statement required under § 1.6035-1 and claiming an initial basis of $300,000. C has complied with the consistent basis requirement because C did not claim an initial basis in the residence in excess of its reported value before the final value was determined. However, because C claimed an initial basis in the residence that exceeds the final value, C may have an income tax deficiency and underpayment for the year of the sale if the applicable period of limitations on assessment for C's income tax return has not expired when the final value is determined. See paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section.

Example 3
—(i)
Final value determined by agreement.
At D's death, D owned 50% of Partnership P, whose sole asset was a rental building with a fair market value of $10 million subject to non-recourse debt of $2 million. D's sole beneficiary is D's child C. The value of D's interest in Partnership P is reported on the estate tax return at $4 million (50% of ($10 million less $2 million)). On examination, the IRS timely adjusts the value of the partnership interest to $5.25 million and the executor of D's estate timely contests that value before the period of limitations on assessment of estate tax expires. Subsequently, the IRS and the executor of D's estate enter into a settlement agreement that provides that the value of D's interest in Partnership P for purposes of the estate tax is $4.5 million. For purposes of the consistent basis requirement applicable to C, the final value of the partnership interest is $4.5 million, and therefore, C's initial basis in the partnership interest is $4.5 million. See paragraphs (a)(2) and (b)(1)(iii) of this section.
(ii)
Adjustment of initial basis pursuant to other Code provisions.
C's share of Partnership P's liabilities at the date of D's death is $1 million. Under section 742 of the Internal Revenue Code and § 1.742-1 of this part, C's basis in the partnership interest is $5.5 million ($4.5 million initial basis plus C's $1 million share of Partnership P's debt). C later sells the partnership interest for $5 million at a time when C's basis has not changed and C's share of the debt remains $1 million. Under section 752(d), C's amount realized on the sale includes $1 million for the reduction in C's share of partnership liabilities. Therefore, C's total amount realized is $6 million. C reports taxable gain of $0.5 million ($6 million amount realized less $5.5 million basis). C has complied with the consistent basis requirement because C did not claim an initial basis in the partnership interest that exceeds the final value of the interest, as determined under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and C's adjustment of the initial basis in the partnership interest as reported does not violate the consistent basis requirement. See paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section.
(4)
Example 4
—(i)
Final value determined by court decision.
At D's death, D owned (among other assets) a rental property. D's sole beneficiary is D's child C. The value of the rental property is reported on the estate tax return at $1 million. On examination, the IRS determines the value of the rental property to be $1.5 million. A court subsequently determines that the fair market value of the rental property for purposes of the estate tax is $1.3 million and the court's decision becomes final. For purposes of the consistent basis requirement, the final value of the rental property is $1.3 million, and therefore, C's initial basis is $1.3 million. See paragraphs (a)(2) and (b)(1)(iv) of this section.
(ii)
Reliance on Statement required under § 1.6035-1 and duration of consistent basis requirement.
After the estate tax return is filed and before the final value is determined, C receives a Statement required under § 1.6035-1 showing a reported value of $1 million for the rental property. C claims a depreciation deduction on the first income tax return C files after acquiring the property, relying on the reported value in the Statement required under § 1.6035-1. C has complied with the consistent basis requirement on that return because C did not claim an initial basis in the rental property in excess of its reported value before the final value was determined. C may claim a
credit or refund of income tax that may result from the increased depreciation deduction based on the final value of the rental property, but only if the period of limitations for a claim for a credit or refund of income tax for that year has not expired. C must use the final value of $1.3 million to determine C's unadjusted basis in the rental property for all open taxable years. In this case and pursuant to section 1016(a)(2), C's adjusted basis is determined by reducing the rental property's final value of $1.3 million by the greater of the depreciation deductions allowed or allowable based on the final value of $1.3 million for all prior tax years (open and closed). See paragraphs (a)(3), (b)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section.

Example 5
—
Final value for property subject to debt.
At D's death, D's gross estate includes a yacht valued at $750,000, subject to $150,000 non-recourse debt. D's sole beneficiary is D's child C. Pursuant to the rule in § 20.2053-7 of this chapter, the executor of D's estate reports the $600,000 net value of the yacht on the estate tax return ($750,000 less $150,000 debt) and claims no other deduction for the debt. The IRS accepts the return as filed and the period of limitations on assessment of estate tax expires. For purposes of the consistent basis requirement applicable to C, the final value of the yacht is $750,000, and therefore, C's initial basis in the yacht is $750,000. See paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
(6)
Example 6
—
Included property subject to the consistent basis requirement.
After exercising due diligence to discover estate assets, the executor of D's estate reports the value of all known property includible in D's gross estate on a timely filed estate tax return and pays the estate tax liability. During examination of the return, the IRS becomes aware of a piece of artwork in the possession of D's child C, the value of which is includible in D's gross estate but is not reported on the estate tax return. The value of the artwork for Federal estate tax purposes is $500,000. Pursuant to the examination, the IRS includes the value of the artwork in the value of D's gross estate, which causes an increase in D's estate tax liability. Neither the inclusion of the artwork in D's gross estate nor the value at which the artwork is included in D's estate is contested by the executor of D's estate before the period of limitation on assessment of estate tax expires. The artwork is subject to the consistent basis requirement and the final value of the artwork is $500,000. Therefore, C's initial basis in the artwork is $500,000. See paragraphs (a)(2) and (c)(1)(i) of this section.
(7)
Example 7
—(i)
Partially deductible property subject to the consistent basis requirement.
Pursuant to a bequest in D's will, Trust is established and funded with certain property, the value of which is includible in the gross estate under section 2031. Trust is a charitable remainder annuity trust described in section 664(d)(1). Trust provides that, in each taxable year during the lifetime of D's surviving child C, the trustee must pay to C an annuity of 5% of the initial net fair market value of all property passing to Trust as finally determined for Federal estate tax purposes. Upon the death of C, the trustee must distribute all of the then principal and income of Trust to organizations described in sections 170(c), 2055(a), and 2522(a) of the Code as the trustee selects, in the trustee's sole discretion. Although the executor of D's estate properly claims an estate tax charitable deduction under section 2055(e)(2)(A) for the value of the remainder interest in Trust, D's estate has an estate tax liability after application of all allowable credits. The property passing to Trust is subject to the consistent basis requirement because the value of the property is included in D's gross estate, an estate tax liability is payable after the application of all allowable credits, and the property is not described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section (in particular, the property is not wholly deductible property within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(xi) of this section).
(ii)
Wholly deductible property not subject to the consistent basis requirement.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (e)(7)(i) of this section (
Example 7
), except that the sole annuity beneficiary of Trust is D's surviving spouse S, and the executor of D's estate properly claims a deduction under section 2056(b)(8) for the value of S's annuity
interest. Because the value of D's entire interest in the property passing to Trust qualified for either a charitable deduction under section 2055(e)(2) or a marital deduction under section 2056(b)(8), none of the property passing to Trust will be subject to the consistent basis requirement. See paragraph (c)(2)(xi) of this section.
(iii)
Property not wholly deductible property if the sum of marital and charitable deductions allowed for that property is less than the value of the decedent's entire interest in the property.
At the time of D's death, D owned 80 shares of voting stock in a closely-held corporation that has 100 shares of voting stock outstanding. D's will directed the executor of D's estate to distribute 40 shares of D's stock to a marital trust and 40 shares of D's stock to a charitable trust. D's executor included the value of D's 80 shares of stock in D's gross estate at $8,000,000 for purposes of the estate tax. Because of discounts applicable in valuing each of the two blocks of only 40 shares of the stock, D's executor correctly claimed a charitable deduction under section 2055(e)(2) of only $3,000,000, and correctly claimed a marital deduction under section 2056(b)(7) of only $3,000,000. D's executor determined that an estate tax was due on D's estate after the application of all allowable credits. The IRS accepted the return as filed and the period of limitations on assessment of estate tax expired. The 40 shares of stock owned by charitable trust and the 40 shares of stock owned by marital trust are not wholly deductible property within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(xi) of this section and are subject to the consistent basis requirement.
(f)
Applicability date.
This section applies to property described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section that is acquired from a decedent or by reason of the death of a decedent if the decedent's Federal estate tax return is filed after September 17, 2024.
[T.D. 9991, 89 FR 76376, Sept. 17, 2024]
§ 1.1015-1
Basis of property acquired by gift after December 31, 1920.
(a)
General rule.
(1) In the case of property acquired by gift after December 31, 1920 (whether by a transfer in trust or otherwise), the basis of the property for the purpose of determining gain is the same as it would be in the hands of the donor or the last preceding owner by whom it was not acquired by gift. The same rule applies in determining loss unless the basis (adjusted for the period prior to the date of gift in accordance with sections 1016 and 1017) is greater than the fair market value of the property at the time of the gift. In such case, the basis for determining loss is the fair market value at the time of the gift.
(2) The provisions of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example.

# Example:
A acquires by gift income-producing property which has an adjusted basis of $100,000 at the date of gift. The fair market value of the property at the date of gift is $90,000. A later sells the property for $95,000. In such case there is neither gain nor loss. The basis for determining loss is $90,000; therefore, there is no loss. Furthermore, there is no gain, since the basis for determining gain is $100,000.
(3) If the facts necessary to determine the basis of property in the hands of the donor or the last preceding owner by whom it was not acquired by gift are unknown to the donee, the district director shall, if possible, obtain such facts from such donor or last preceding owner, or any other person cognizant thereof. If the district director finds it impossible to obtain such facts, the basis in the hands of such donor or last preceding owner shall be the fair market value of such property as found by the district director as of the date or approximate date at which, according to the best information the district director is able to obtain, such property was acquired by such donor or last preceding owner. See paragraph (e) of this section for rules relating to fair market value.
(b)
Uniform basis; proportionate parts of.
Property acquired by gift has a single or uniform basis although more than one person may acquire an interest in such property. The uniform basis of the property remains fixed subject to proper adjustment for items under sections 1016 and 1017. However, the value of the proportionate parts of the uniform basis represented, for instance, by the respective interests of the life
tenant and remainderman are adjustable to reflect the change in the relative values of such interest on account of the lapse of time. The portion of the basis attributable to an interest at the time of its sale or other disposition shall be determined under the rules provided in § 1.1014-5. In determining gain or loss from the sale or other disposition after October 9, 1969, of a term interest in property (as defined in § 1.1001-1(f)(2)) the adjusted basis of which is determined pursuant, or by reference, to section 1015, that part of the adjusted uniform basis assignable under the rules of § 1.1014-5(a) to the interest sold or otherwise disposed of shall be disregarded to the extent and in the manner provided by section 1001(e) and § 1.1001-1(f).
(c)
Time of acquisition.
The date that the donee acquires an interest in property by gift is when the donor relinquishes dominion over the property and not necessarily when title to the property is acquired by the donee. Thus, the date that the donee acquires an interest in property by gift where he is a successor in interest, such as in the case of a remainderman of a life estate or a beneficiary of the distribution of the corpus of a trust, is the date such interests are created by the donor and not the date the property is actually acquired.
(d)
Property acquired by gift from a decedent dying after December 31, 1953.
If an interest in property was acquired by the taxpayer by gift from a donor dying after December 31, 1953, under conditions which required the inclusion of the property in the donor's gross estate for estate tax purposes, and the property had not been sold, exchanged, or otherwise disposed of by the taxpayer before the donor's death, see the rules prescribed in section 1014 and the regulations thereunder.
(e)
Fair market value.
For the purposes of this section, the value of property as appraised for the purpose of the Federal gift tax, or, if the gift is not subject to such tax, its value as appraised for the purpose of a State gift tax, shall be deemed to be the fair market value of the property at the time of the gift.
(f)
Reinvestments by fiduciary.
If the property is an investment by the fiduciary under the terms of the gift (as, for example, in the case of a sale by the fiduciary of property transferred under the terms of the gift, and the reinvestment of the proceeds), the cost or other basis to the fiduciary is taken in lieu of the basis specified in paragraph (a) of this section.
(g)
Records.
To insure a fair and adequate determination of the proper basis under section 1015, persons making or receiving gifts of property should preserve and keep accessible a record of the facts necessary to determine the cost of the property and, if pertinent, its fair market value as of March 1, 1913, or its fair market value as of the date of the gift.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11910, Nov. 26, 1960, as amended by T.D. 6693, 28 FR 12818, Dec. 3, 1963; T.D. 7142, 36 FR 18952, Sept. 24, 1971]
§ 1.1015-2
Transfer of property in trust after December 31, 1920.
(a)
General rule.
(1) In the case of property acquired after December 31, 1920, by transfer in trust (other than by a transfer in trust by a gift, bequest, or devise) the basis of property so acquired is the same as it would be in the hands of the grantor increased in the amount of gain or decreased in the amount of loss recognized to the grantor upon such transfer under the law applicable to the year in which the transfer was made. If the taxpayer acquired the property by a transfer in trust, this basis applies whether the property be in the hands of the trustee, or the beneficiary, and whether acquired prior to the termination of the trust and distribution of the property, or thereafter.
(2) The principles stated in paragraph (b) of § 1.1015-1 concerning the uniform basis are applicable in determining the basis of property where more than one person acquires an interest in property by transfer in trust after December 31, 1920.
(b)
Reinvestment by fiduciary.
If the property is an investment made by the fiduciary (as, for example, in the case of a sale by the fiduciary of property transferred by the grantor, and the reinvestment of the proceeds), the cost or other basis to the fiduciary is taken in lieu of the basis specified in paragraph (a) of this section.
§ 1.1015-3
Gift or transfer in trust before January 1, 1921.
(a) In the case of property acquired by gift or transfer in trust before January 1, 1921, the basis of such property is the fair market value thereof at the time of the gift or at the time of the transfer in trust.
(b) The principles stated in paragraph (b) of § 1.1015-1 concerning the uniform basis are applicable in determining the basis of property where more than one person acquires an interest in property by gift or transfer in trust before January 1, 1921. In addition, if an interest in such property was acquired from a decedent and the property had not been sold, exchanged, or otherwise disposed of before the death of the donor, the rules prescribed in section 1014 and the regulations thereunder are applicable in determining the basis of such property in the hands of the taxpayer.
§ 1.1015-4
Transfers in part a gift and in part a sale.
(a)
General rule.
Where a transfer of property is in part a sale and in part a gift, the unadjusted basis of the property in the hands of the transferee is the sum of—
(1) Whichever of the following is the greater:
(i) The amount paid by the transferee for the property, or
(ii) The transferor's adjusted basis for the property at the time of the transfer, and
(2) The amount of increase, if any, in basis authorized by section 1015(d) for gift tax paid (see § 1.1015-5).
For determining loss, the unadjusted basis of the property in the hands of the transferee shall not be greater than the fair market value of the property at the time of such transfer. For determination of gain or loss of the transferor, see § 1.1001-1(e) and § 1.1011-2. For special rule where there has been a charitable contribution of less than a taxpayer's entire interest in property, see section 170(e)(2) and § 1.170A-4(c).
(b)
Examples.
The rule of paragraph (a) of this section is illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
If A transfers property to his son for $30,000, and such property at the time of the transfer has an adjusted basis of $30,000 in A's hands (and a fair market value of $60,000), the unadjusted basis of the property in the hands of the son is $30,000.

# Example 2.
If A transfers property to his son for $60,000, and such property at the time of transfer has an adjusted basis of $30,000 in A's hands (and a fair market value of $90,000), the unadjusted basis of such property in the hands of the son is $60,000.

# Example 3.
If A transfers property to his son for $30,000, and such property at the time of transfer has an adjusted basis in A's hands of $60,000 (and a fair market value of $90,000), the unadjusted basis of such property in the hands of the son is $60,000.

# Example 4.
If A transfers property to his son for $30,000 and such property at the time of transfer has an adjusted basis of $90,000 in A's hands (and a fair market value of $60,000), the unadjusted basis of the property in the hands of the son ins $90,000. However, since the adjusted basis of the property in A's hands at the time of the transfer was greater than the fair market value at that time, for the purpose of determining any loss on a later sale or other disposition of the property by the son its unadjusted basis in his hands is $60,000.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11910, Nov. 26, 1960, as amended by T.D. 6693, 28 FR 12818, Dec. 3, 1963; T.D. 7207, 37 FR 20799, Oct. 5, 1972]
§ 1.1015-5
Increased basis for gift tax paid.
(a)
General rule in the case of gifts made on or before December 31, 1976.
(1)(i) Subject to the conditions and limitations provided in section 1015(d), as added by the Technical Amendments Act of 1958, the basis (as determined under section 1015(a) and paragraph (a) of § 1.1015-1) of property acquired by gift is increased by the amount of gift tax paid with respect to the gift of such property. Under section 1015(d)(1)(A), such increase in basis applies to property acquired by gift on or after September 2, 1958 (the date of enactment of the Technical Amendments Act of 1958). Under section 1015(d)(1)(B), such increase in basis applies to property acquired by gift before September 2, 1958, and not sold, exchanged, or otherwise disposed of before such date. If section 1015(d)(1)(A) applies, the basis of the property is increased as of the date of the gift regardless of the date of payment of the gift tax. For example, if the property was acquired by gift on September 8, 1958, and sold by the donee on October 15, 1958, the basis of the property would be increased (subject to the limitation of section 1015(d))
as of September 8, 1958 (the date of the gift), by the amount of gift tax applicable to such gift even though such tax was not paid until March 1, 1959. If section 1015(d)(1)(B) applies, any increase in the basis of the property due to gift tax paid (regardless of date of payment) with respect to the gift is made as of September 2, 1958. Any increase in basis under section 1015(d) can be no greater than the amount by which the fair market value of the property at the time of the gift exceeds the basis of such property in the hands of the donor at the time of the gift. See paragraph (b) of this section for rules for determining the amount of gift tax paid in respect of property transferred by gift.
(ii) With respect to property acquired by gift before September 2, 1958, the provisions of section 1015(d) and this section do not apply if, before such date, the donee has sold, exchanged, or otherwise disposed of such property. The phrase
sold, exchanged, or otherwise disposed of
includes the surrender of a stock certificate for corporate assets in complete or partial liquidation of a corporation pursuant to section 331. It also includes the exchange of property for property of a like kind such as the exchange of one apartment house for another. The phrase does not, however, extend to transactions which are mere changes in form. Thus, it does not include a transfer of assets to a corporation in exchange for its stock in a transaction with respect to which no gain or loss would be recognizable for income tax purposes under section 351. Nor does it include an exchange of stock or securities in a corporation for stock or securities in the same corporation or another corporation in a transaction such as a merger, recapitalization, reorganization, or other transaction described in section 368(a) or 355, with respect to which no gain or loss is recognizable for income tax purposes under section 354 or 355. If a binding contract for the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property is entered into, the property is considered as sold, exchanged, or otherwise disposed of on the effective date of the contract, unless the contract is not subsequently carried out substantially in accordance with its terms. The effective date of a contract is normally the date it is entered into (and not the date it is consummated, or the date legal title to the property passes) unless the contract specifies a different effective date. For purposes of this subdivision, in determining whether a transaction comes within the phrase
sold, exchanged, or otherwise disposed of,
if a transaction would be treated as a mere change in the form of the property if it occurred in a taxable year subject to the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, it will be so treated if the transaction occurred in a taxable year subject to the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 or prior revenue law.
(2) Application of the provisions of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
In 1938, A purchased a business building at a cost of $120,000. On September 2, 1958, at which time the property had an adjusted basis in A's hands of $60,000, he gave the property to his nephew, B. At the time of the gift to B, the property had a fair market value of $65,000 with respect to which A paid a gift tax in the amount of $7,545. The basis of the property in B's hands at the time of the gift, as determined under section 1015(a) and § 1.1015-1, would be the same as the adjusted basis in A's hands at the time of the gift, or $60,000. Under section 1015(d) and this section, the basis of the building in B's hands as of the date of the gift would be increased by the amount of the gift tax paid with respect to such gift, limited to an amount by which the fair market value of the property at the time of the gift exceeded the basis of the property in the hands of A at the time of gift, or $5,000. Therefore, the basis of the property in B's hands immediately after the gift, both for determining gain or loss on the sale of the property, would be $65,000.

# Example 2.
C purchased property in 1938 at a cost of $100,000. On October 1, 1952, at which time the property had an adjusted basis of $72,000 in C's hands, he gave the property to his daughter, D. At the date of the gift to D, the property had a fair market value of $85,000 with respect to which C paid a gift tax in the amount of $11,745. On September 2, 1958, D still held the property which then had an adjusted basis in her hands of $65,000. Since the excess of the fair market value of the property at the time of the gift to D over the adjusted basis of the property in C's hands at such time is greater than the amount of gift tax paid, the basis of the property in D's hands would be increased as of September 2, 1958, by the amount of the gift tax paid, or $11,745. The adjusted basis of
the property in D's hands, both for determining gain or loss on the sale of the property, would then be $76,745 ($65,000 plus $11,745).

# Example 3.
On December 31, 1951, E gave to his son, F, 500 shares of common stock of the X Corporation which shares had been purchased earlier by E at a cost of $100 per share, or a total cost of $50,000. The basis in E's hands was still $50,000 on the date of the gift to F. On the date of the gift, the fair market value of the 500 shares was $80,000 with respect to which E paid a gift tax in the amount of $10,695. In 1956, the 500 shares of X Corporation stock were exchanged for 500 shares of common stock of the Y Corporation in a reorganization with respect to which no gain or loss was recognized for income tax purposes under section 354. F still held the 500 shares of Y Corporation stock on September 2, 1958. Under such circumstances, the 500 shares of X Corporation stock would not, for purposes of section 1015(d) and this section, be considered as having been
sold, exchanged, or otherwise disposed of
by F before September 2, 1958. Therefore, the basis of the 500 shares of Y Corporation stock held by F as of such date would, by reason of section 1015(d) and this section, be increased by $10,695, the amount of gift tax paid with respect to the gift to F of the X Corporation stock.

# Example 4.
On November 15, 1953, G gave H property which had a fair market value of $53,000 and a basis in the hands of G of $20,000. G paid gift tax of $5,250 on the transfer. On November 16, 1956, H gave the property to J who still held it on September 2, 1958. The value of the property on the date of the gift to J was $63,000 and H paid gift tax of $7,125 on the transfer. Since the property was not sold, exchanged, or otherwise disposed of by J before September 2, 1958, and the gift tax paid on the transfer to J did not exceed $43,000 ($63,000, fair market value of property at time of gift to J, less $20,000, basis of property in H's hands at that time), the basis of property in his hands is increased on September 2, 1958, by $7,125, the amount of gift tax paid by H on the transfer. No increase in basis is allowed for the $5,250 gift tax paid by G on the transfer to H, since H had sold, exchanged, or otherwise disposed of the property before September 2, 1958.
(b)
Amount of gift tax paid with respect to gifts made on or before December 31, 1976.
(1)(i) If only one gift was made during a certain
calendar period
(as defined in § 25.2502-1(c)(1)), the entire amount of the gift tax paid under chapter 12 or the corresponding provisions of prior revenue laws for that calendar period is the amount of the gift tax paid with respect to the gift.
(ii) If more than one gift was made during a certain calendar period, the amount of the gift tax paid under chapter 12 or the corresponding provisions of prior revenue laws with respect to any specified gift made during that calendar period is an amount, A, which bears the same ratio to B (the total gift tax paid for that calendar period) as C (the
amount of the gift,
computed as described in this paragraph (b)(1)(ii)) bears to D (the total taxable gifts for the calendar period computed without deduction for the gift tax specific exemption under section 2521 (as in effect prior to its repeal by the Tax Reform Act of 1976) or the corresponding provisions of prior revenue laws). Stated algebraically, the amount of the gift tax paid with respect to a gift equals:

# [
Amount of the gift

# (C) / Total taxable gifts, plus specific exemption allowed (D)] × Total gift tax paid (B)
For purposes of the ratio stated in the preceding sentence, the
amount of the gift
referred to as factor “C” is the value of the gift reduced by any portion excluded or deducted under section 2503(b) (annual exclusion), 2522 (charitable deduction), or 2523 (marital deduction) of the Code or the corresponding provisions of prior revenue laws. In making the computations described in this paragraph, the values to be used are those finally determined for purposes of the gift tax.
(iii) If a gift consists of more than one item of property, the gift tax paid with respect to each item shall be computed by allocating to each item a proportionate part of the gift tax paid with respect to the gift, computed in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph.
(2) For purposes of this paragraph, it is immaterial whether the gift tax is paid by the donor or the donee. Where more than one gift of a present interest in property is made to the same donee during a
calendar period
(as defined in § 25.2502-1(c)(1)), the annual exclusion shall apply to the earliest of such gifts in point of time.
(3) Where the donor and his spouse elect under section 2513 or the corresponding provisions of prior law to have any gifts made by either of them
considered as made one-half by each, the amount of gift tax paid with respect to such a gift is the sum of the amounts of tax (computed separately) paid with respect to each half of the gift by the donor and his spouse.
(4) The method described in section 1015(d)(2) and this paragraph for computing the amount of gift tax paid in respect of a gift may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Prior to 1959 H made no taxable gifts. On July 1, 1959, he made a gift to his wife, W, of land having a value for gift purposes of $60,000 and gave to his son, S, certain securities valued at $60,000. During the year 1959, H also contributed $5,000 in cash to a charitable organization described in section 2522. H filed a timely gift tax return for 1959 with respect to which he paid gift tax in the amount of $6,000, computed as follows:
Value of land given to W
$60,000
Less: Annual exclusion
$3,000
Marital deduction
30,000
33,000
Included amount of gift

Less: Specific exemption allowed

Taxable gifts for 1959
54,000
Gift tax on $54,000
6,000
In determining the gift tax paid with respect to the land given to W, amount C of the ratio set forth in subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph is $60,000, value of property given to W, less $33,000 (the sum of $3,000, the amount excluded under section 2503(b), and $30,000, the amount deducted under section 2523), or $27,000. Amount D of the ratio is $84,000 (the amount of taxable gifts, $54,000, plus the gift tax specific exemption, $30,000). The gift tax paid with respect to the land given to W is $1,928.57, computed as follows:
$27,000(C) ÷ $84,000(D) × $6,000(B)

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in example (1) except that H made his gifts to W and S on July 1, 1971, and that prior to 1971, H made no taxable gifts. Furthermore, H made his charitable contribution on August 12, 1971. These were the only gifts made by H during 1971. H filed his gift tax return for the third quarter of 1971 on November 15, 1971, as required by section 6075(b). With respect to the above gifts H paid a gift tax in the amount of $6,000 on total taxable gifts of $54,000 for the third quarter of 1971. The gift tax paid with respect to the land given to W is $1,928.57. The computations for these figures are identical to those used in example (1).

# Example 3.
On January 15, 1956, A made a gift to his nephew, N, of land valued at $86,000, and on June 30, 1956, gave N securities valued at $40,000. On July 1, 1956, A gave to his sister, S, $46,000 in cash. A and his wife, B, were married during the entire calendar year 1956. The amount of A's taxable gifts for prior years was zero although in arriving at that amount A had used in full the specific exemption authorized by section 2521. B did not make any gifts before 1956. A and B elected under section 2513 to have all gifts made by either during 1956 treated as made one-half by A and one-half by B. Pursuant to that election, A and B each filed a gift tax return for 1956. A paid gift tax of $11,325 and B paid gift tax of $5,250, computed as follows:
A
B
Value of land given to N

The amount of the gift tax paid by A with respect to the land given to N is computed as follows:
$40,000(C) / $80,000(D) × $11,325(B) = $5,662.50
The amount of the gift tax paid by B with respect to the land given to N is computed as follows:
$40,000(C) / $80,000(D) × $5,250(B) = $2,625
The amount of the gift tax paid with respect to the land is $5,662.50 plus $2,625, or $8,287.50. Computed in a similar manner, the amount of gift tax paid by A with respect to the securities given to N is $2,831.25, and the amount of gift tax paid by B with respect thereto is $1,312.50, or a total of $4,143.75.

# Example 4.
The facts are the same as in example (3) except that A gave the land to N on
January 15, 1972, the securities to N on February 3, 1972, and the cash to S on March 7, 1972. As in example (3), the amount of A's taxable gifts for taxable years prior to 1972 was zero, although in arriving at that amount A had used in full the specific exemption authorized by section 2521. B did not make any gifts before 1972. Pursuant to the election under section 2513, A and B treated all gifts made by either during 1972 as made one-half by A and one-half by B. A and B each filed a gift tax return for the first quarter of 1972 on May 15, 1972, as required by section 6075(b). A paid gift tax of $11,325 on taxable gifts of $80,000 and B paid gift tax of $5,250 on taxable gifts of $50,000. The amount of the gift tax paid by A and B with respect to the land given to N is $5,662.50 and $2,625, respectively. The computations for these figures are identical to those used in example (3).
(c)
Special rule for increased basis for gift tax paid in the case of gifts made after December 31, 1976
—(1)
In general.
With respect to gifts made after December 31, 1976 (other than gifts between spouses described in section 1015(e)), the increase in basis for gift tax paid is determined under section 1015(d)(6). Under section 1015(d)(6)(A), the increase in basis with respect to gift tax paid is limited to the amount (not in excess of the amount of gift tax paid) that bears the same ratio to the amount of gift tax paid as the net appreciation in value of the gift bears to the amount of the gift.
(2)
Amount of gift.
In general, for purposes of section 1015(d)(6)(A)(ii), the amount of the gift is determined in conformance with the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section. Thus, the amount of the gift is the amount included with respect to the gift in determining (for purposes of section 2503(a)) the total amount of gifts made during the calendar year (or calendar quarter in the case of a gift made on or before December 31, 1981), reduced by the amount of any annual exclusion allowable with respect to the gift under section 2503(b), and any deductions allowed with respect to the gift under section 2522 (relating to the charitable deduction) and section 2523 (relating to the marital deduction). Where more than one gift of a present interest in property is made to the same donee during a calendar year, the annual exclusion shall apply to the earliest of such gifts in point of time.
(3)
Amount of gift tax paid with respect to the gift.
In general, for purposes of section 1015(d)(6), the amount of gift tax paid with respect to the gift is determined in conformance with the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section. Where more than one gift is made by the donor in a calendar year (or quarter in the case of gifts made on or before December 31, 1981), the amount of gift tax paid with respect to any specific gift made during that period is the amount which bears the same ratio to the total gift tax paid for that period (determined after reduction for any gift tax unified credit available under section 2505) as the amount of the gift (computed as described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section) bears to the total taxable gifts for the period.
(4)
Qualified domestic trusts.
For purposes of section 1015(d)(6), in the case of a qualified domestic trust (QDOT) described in section 2056A(a), any distribution during the noncitizen surviving spouse's lifetime with respect to which a tax is imposed under section 2056A(b)(1)(A) is treated as a transfer by gift, and any estate tax paid on the distribution under section 2056A(b)(1)(A) is treated as a gift tax. The rules under this paragraph apply in determining the extent to which the basis in the assets distributed is increased by the tax imposed under section 2056A(b)(1)(A).
(5)
Examples.
Application of the provisions of this paragraph (c) may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
(i) Prior to 1995, X exhausts X's gift tax unified credit available under section 2505. In 1995, X makes a gift to X's child Y, of a parcel of real estate having a fair market value of $100,000. X's adjusted basis in the real estate immediately before making the gift was $70,000. Also in 1995, X makes a gift to X's child Z, of a painting having a fair market value of $70,000. X timely files a gift tax return for 1995 and pays gift tax in the amount of $55,500, computed as follows:
Value of real estate transferred to Y
$100,000
Less: Annual exclusion
10,000
Included amount of gift (C)
$90,000
Value of painting transferred to Z
$70,000
Less: annual exclusion
10,000
Included amount of gift
60,000
Total included gifts (D)
$150,000
Total gift tax liability for 1995 gifts (B)
$55,500
(ii) The gift tax paid with respect to the real estate transferred to Y, is determined as follows:
ER22AU95.005
(iii)(A) The amount by which Y's basis in the real property is increased is determined as follows:
ER22AU95.006
(B) Y's basis in the real property is $70,000 plus $11,100, or $81,100. If X had not exhausted any of X's unified credit, no gift tax would have been paid and, as a result, Y's basis would not be increased.

# Example 2.
(i) X dies in 1995. X's spouse, Y, is not a United States citizen. In order to obtain the marital deduction for property passing to X's spouse, X established a QDOT in X's will. In 1996, the trustee of the QDOT makes a distribution of principal from the QDOT in the form of shares of stock having a fair market value of $70,000 on the date of distribution. The trustee's basis in the stock (determined under section 1014) is $50,000. An estate tax is imposed on the distribution under section 2056A(b)(1)(A) in the amount $38,500, and is paid. Y's basis in the shares of stock is increased by a portion of the section 2056A estate tax paid determined as follows:
ER22AU95.007
(ii) Y's basis in the stock is $50,000 plus $11,000, or $61,000.
(6)
Effective date.
The provisions of this paragraph (c) are effective for gifts made after August 22, 1995.
(d)
Treatment as adjustment to basis.
Any increase in basis under section 1015(d) and this section shall, for purposes of section 1016(b) (relating to adjustments to a substituted basis), be treated as an adjustment under section 1016(a) to the basis of the donee's property to which such increase applies. See paragraph (p) of § 1.1016-5.
[T.D. 6693, 28 FR 12818, Dec. 3, 1963, as amended by T.D. 7238, 37 FR 28715, Dec. 29, 1972; T.D. 7910, 48 FR 40372, Sept. 7, 1983; T.D. 8612, 60 FR 43537, Aug. 22, 1995]
§ 1.1016-1
Adjustments to basis; scope of section.
Section 1016 and §§ 1.1016-2 to 1.1016-10, inclusive, contain the rules relating to the adjustments to be made to the basis of property to determine the adjusted basis as defined in section 1011. However, if the property was acquired from a decedent before his death, see § 1.1014-6 for adjustments on account of certain deductions allowed the taxpayer for the period between the date of acquisition of the property and the date of death of the decedent. If an election has been made under the Retirement-Straight Line Adjustment Act of 1958 (26 U.S.C. 1016 note), see § 1.9001-1 for special rules for determining adjusted basis in the case of a taxpayer who has changed from the retirement to the straight-line method of computing depreciation allowances.
§ 1.1016-2
Items properly chargeable to capital account.
(a) The cost or other basis shall be properly adjusted for any expenditure, receipt, loss, or other item, properly chargeable to capital account, including the cost of improvements and betterments made to the property. No adjustment shall be made in respect of any item which, under any applicable provision of law or regulation, is treated as an item not properly chargeable to capital account but is allowable as a deduction in computing net or taxable
income for the taxable year. For example, in the case of oil and gas wells no adjustment may be made in respect of any intangible drilling and development expense allowable as a deduction in computing net or taxable income. See the regulations under section 263(c).
(b) The application of the foregoing provisions may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example:
A, who makes his returns on the calendar year basis, purchased property in 1941 for $10,000. He subsequently expended $6,000 for improvements. Disregarding, for the purpose of this example, the adjustments required for depreciation, the adjusted basis of the property is $16,000. If A sells the property in 1954 for $20,000, the amount of his gain will be $4,000.
(c) Adjustments to basis shall be made for carrying charges such as taxes and interest, with respect to property (whether real or personal, improved or unimproved, and whether productive or unproductive), which the taxpayer elects to treat as chargeable to capital account under section 266, rather than as an allowable deduction. The term
taxes
for this purpose includes duties and excise taxes but does not include income taxes.
(d) Expenditures described in section 173 to establish, maintain, or increase the circulation of a newspaper, magazine, or other periodical are chargeable to capital account only in accordance with and in the manner provided in the regulations under section 173.
§ 1.1016-3
Exhaustion, wear and tear, obsolescence, amortization, and depletion for periods since February 28, 1913.
(a)
In general
—(1)
Adjustment where deduction is claimed.
(i) For taxable periods beginning on or after January 1, 1952, the cost or other basis of property shall be decreased for exhaustion, wear and tear, obsolescence, amortization, and depletion by the greater of the following two amounts:
(
a
) The amount allowed as deductions in computing taxable income, to the extent resulting in a reduction of the taxpayer's income taxes, or
(
b
) The amount allowable for the years involved.
See paragraph (b) of this section. Where the taxpayer makes an appropriate election the above rule is applicable for periods since February 28, 1913, and before January 1, 1952. See paragraph (d) of this section. For rule for such periods where no election is made, see paragraph (c) of this section.
(ii) The determination of the amount properly allowable for exhaustion, wear and tear, obsolescence, amortization, and depletion must be made on the basis of facts reasonably known to exist at the end of the taxable year. A taxpayer is not permitted to take advantage in a later year of the taxpayer's prior failure to take any such allowance or the taxpayer's taking an allowance plainly inadequate under the known facts in prior years. In the case of depreciation, if in prior years the taxpayer has consistently taken proper deductions under one method, the amount allowable for such prior years may not be increased, even though a greater amount would have been allowable under another proper method. For rules governing losses on retirement or disposition of depreciable property, including rules for determining basis, see § 1.167(a)-8, 1.168(i)-1(e), or 1.168(i)-8, as applicable. The application of this paragraph is illustrated by the following example (for purposes of this example, assume section 167(f)(1) as in effect on September 19, 2013, applies to taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2014):

# Example.
On July 1, 2014, A, a calendar-year taxpayer, purchased and placed in service “off-the-shelf” computer software at a cost of $36,000. This computer software is not an amortizable section 197 intangible. Pursuant to section 167(f)(1), the useful life of the computer software is 36 months. It has no salvage value. Computer software placed in service in 2014 is not eligible for the additional first year depreciation deduction provided by section 168(k). A did not deduct any depreciation for the computer software for 2014 and deducted depreciation of $12,000 for the computer software for 2015. As a result, the total amount of depreciation allowed for the computer software as of December 31, 2015, was $12,000. However, the total amount of depreciation allowable for the computer software as of December 31, 2015, is $18,000 ($6,000 for 2014 + $12,000 for 2015). As a result, the unrecovered cost of the computer software as of December 31, 2015, is $18,000 (cost of $36,000 less the depreciation allowable of
$18,000 as of December 31, 2015). Accordingly, depreciation for 2016 for the computer software is $12,000 (unrecovered cost of $18,000 divided by the remaining useful life of 18 months as of January 1, 2016, multiplied by 12 full months in 2016).
(2)
Adjustment for amount allowable where no depreciation deduction claimed.
(i) If the taxpayer has not taken a depreciation deduction either in the taxable year or for any prior taxable year, adjustments to basis of the property for depreciation allowable shall be determined by using the straight-line method of depreciation. (See § 1.1016-4 for adjustments in the case of persons exempt from income taxation.)
(ii) For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1953, and ending after August 16, 1954, if the taxpayer with respect to any property has taken a deduction for depreciation properly under one of the methods provided in section 167(b) for one or more years but has omitted the deduction in other years, the adjustment to basis for the depreciation allowable in such a case will be the deduction under the method which was used by the taxpayer with respect to that property. Thus, if A acquired property in 1954 on which he properly computed his depreciation deduction under the method described in section 167(b)(2) (the declining-balance method) for the first year of its useful life but did not take a deduction in the second and third year of the asset's life, the adjustment to basis for depreciation allowable for the second and third year will be likewise computed under the declining-balance method.
(3)
Adjustment for depletion deductions with respect to taxable years before 1932.
Where for any taxable year before the taxable year 1932 the depletion allowance was based on discovery value or a percentage of income, then the adjustment for depletion for such year shall not exceed a depletion deduction which would have been allowable for such year if computed without reference to discovery value or a percentage of income.
(b)
Adjustment for periods beginning on or after January 1, 1952.
The decrease required by paragraph (a) of this section for deductions in respect of any period beginning on or after January 1, 1952, shall be whichever is the greater of the following amounts:
(1) The amount allowed as deductions in computing taxable income under subtitle A of the Code or prior income tax laws and resulting (by reason of the deductions so allowed) in a reduction for any taxable year of the taxpayer's taxes under subtitle A of the Code (other than chapter 2, relating to tax on self-employment income) or prior income, war-profits, or excess-profits tax laws; or
(2) The amount properly allowable as deductions in computing taxable income under subtitle A of the Code or prior income tax laws (whether or not the amount properly allowable would have caused a reduction for any taxable year of the taxpayer's taxes).
(c)
Adjustment for periods since February 28, 1913, and before January 1, 1952, where no election made.
If no election has been properly made under section 1020, or under section 113(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 (see paragraph (d) of this section), the decrease required by paragraph (a) of this section for deductions in respect of any period since February 28, 1913, and before January 1, 1952, shall be whichever of the following amounts is the greater:
(1) The amount allowed as deductions in computing net income under chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 or prior income tax laws;
(2) The amount properly allowable in computing net income under chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 or prior income tax laws.
For the purpose of determining the decrease required by this paragraph, it is immaterial whether or not the amount under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph or the amount under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph would have resulted in a reduction for any taxable year of the taxpayer's taxes.
(d)
Adjustment for periods since February 28, 1913, and before January 1, 1952, where election made.
If an election has been properly made under section 1020, or under section 113(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, the decrease required by paragraph (a) of this section for deductions in respect of any period
since February 28, 1913, and before January 1, 1952, shall be whichever is the greater of the following amounts:
(1) The amount allowed as deductions in computing net income under chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 or prior income tax laws and resulting (by reason of the deductions so allowed) in a reduction for any taxable year of the taxpayer's taxes under such chapter 1 (other than subchapter E, relating to tax on self-employment income), subchapter E, chapter 2, of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, or prior income, war-profits, or excess-profits tax laws;
(2) The amount properly allowable as deductions in computing net income under chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 or prior income tax laws (whether or not the amount properly allowable would have caused a reduction for any taxable year of the taxpayer's taxes).
(e)
Determination of amount allowed which reduced taxpayer's taxes.
(1) As indicated in paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section, there are situations in which it is necessary to determine (for the purpose of ascertaining the basis adjustment required by paragraph (a) of this section) the extent to which the amount allowed as deductions resulted in a reduction for any taxable year of the taxpayer's taxes under subtitle A (other than chapter 2 relating to tax on self-employment income) of the Code, or prior income, war-profits, or excess-profits tax laws. This amount (amount allowed which resulted in a reduction of the taxpayer's taxes) is hereinafter referred to as the
tax-benefit amount allowed.
For the purpose of determining whether the tax-benefit amount allowed exceeded the amount allowable, a determination must be made of that portion of the excess of the amount allowed over the amount allowable which, if disallowed, would not have resulted in an increase in any such tax previously determined. If the entire excess of the amount allowed over the amount allowable could be disallowed without any such increase in tax, the tax-benefit amount allowed shall not be considered to have exceeded the amount allowable. In such a case (if paragraph (b) or (d) of this section is applicable) the reduction in basis required by paragraph (a) of this section would be the amount properly allowable as a deduction. If only part of such excess could be disallowed without any such increase in tax, the tax-benefit amount allowed shall be considered to exceed the amount allowable to the extent of the remainder of such excess. In such a case (if paragraph (b) or (d) of this section is applicable), the reduction in basis required by paragraph (a) of this section would be the amount of the tax-benefit amount allowed.
(2) For the purpose of determining the tax-benefit amount allowed the tax previously determined shall be determined under the principles of section 1314. The only adjustments made in determining whether there would be an increase in tax shall be those resulting from the disallowance of the amount allowed. The taxable years for which the determination is made shall be the taxable year for which the deduction was allowed and any other taxable year which would be affected by the disallowance of such deduction. Examples of such other taxable years are taxable years to which there was a carryover or carryback of a net operating loss from the taxable year for which the deduction was allowed, and taxable years for which a computation under section 111 or section 1333 was made by reference to the taxable year for which the deduction was allowed. In determining whether the disallowance of any part of the deduction would not have resulted in an increase in any tax previously determined, proper adjustment must be made for previous determinations under section 1311, or section 3801 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, and for any previous application of section 1016(a)(2)(B), or section 113(b) (1)(B)(ii) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939.
(3) If a determination under section 1016(a)(2)(B) must be made with respect to several properties for each of which the amount allowed for the taxable year exceeded the amount allowable, the tax-benefit amount allowed with respect to each of such properties shall
be an allocated portion of the tax-benefit amount allowed determined by reference to the sum of the amounts allowed and the sum of the amounts allowable with respect to such several properties.
(4) In the case of property held by a partnership or trust, the computation of the tax-benefit amount allowed shall take into account the tax benefit of the partners or beneficiaries, as the case may be, from the deduction by the partnership or trust of the amount allowed to the partnership or the trust. For this purpose, the determination of the amount allowed which resulted in a tax benefit to the partners or beneficiaries shall be made in the same manner as that provided above with respect to the taxes of the person holding the property.
(5) A taxpayer seeking to limit the adjustment to basis to the tax-benefit amount allowed for any period, in lieu of the amount allowed, must establish the tax-benefit amount allowed. A failure of adequate proof as to the tax-benefit amount allowed with respect to one period does not preclude the taxpayer from limiting the adjustment to basis to the tax-benefit amount allowed with respect to another period for which adequate proof is available. For example, a corporate transferee may have available adequate records with respect to the tax effect of the deduction of erroneous depreciation for certain taxable years, but may not have available adequate records with respect to the deduction of excessive depreciation for other taxable years during which the property was held by its transferor. In such case the corporate transferee shall not be denied the right to apply this section with respect to the erroneous depreciation for the period for which adequate proof is available.
(f)
Determination of amount allowable in prior taxable years.
(1) One of the factors in determining the adjustment to basis as of any date is the amount of depreciation, depletion, etc., allowable for periods prior to such date. The amount allowable for such prior periods is determined under the law applicable to such prior periods; all adjustments required by the law applicable to such periods are made in determining the adjusted basis of the property for the purpose of determining the amount allowable. Provisions corresponding to the rules in section 1016(a)(2)(B) described in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, which limit adjustments to the
tax-benefit amount allowed
where an election is properly exercised, were first enacted by the Act of July 14, 1952 (66 Stat. 629). That law provided that corresponding rules are deemed to be includible in all revenue laws applicable to taxable years ending after December 31, 1931. Accordingly, those rules shall be taken into account in determining the amount of depreciation, etc., allowable for any taxable year ending after December 31, 1931. For example, if the adjusted basis of property held by the taxpayer since January 1, 1930, is determined as of January 1, 1955, and if an election was properly made under section 1020, or section 113(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, then the amount allowable which is taken into account in computing the adjusted basis as of January 1, 1955, shall be determined by taking those rules into account for all taxable years ending after December 31, 1931. The Act of July 14, 1952, made no change in the law applicable in determining the amount allowable for taxable years ending before January 1, 1932. If there was a final decision of a court prior to the enactment of the Act of July 14, 1952, determining the amount allowable for a particular taxable year, such determination shall be adjusted. In such case the adjustment shall be made only for the purpose of taking the provision of that law into account and only to the extent made necessary by such provisions.
(2) Although the Act of July 14, 1952, amended the law applicable to all taxable years ending after December 31, 1931, the amendment does not permit refund, credit, or assessment of a deficiency for any taxable year for which such refund, credit, or assessment was barred by any law or rule of law.
(g)
Property with transferred basis.
The following rules apply in the determination of the adjustments to basis of property in the hands of a transferee, donee, or grantee which are required by section 1016(b), or section 113(b)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, with
respect to the period the property was held by the transferor, donor, or grantor:
(1) An election or a revocation of an election under section 1020, or section 113(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, by a transferor, donor, or grantor, which is made after the date of the transfer, gift, or grant of the property shall not affect the basis of such property in the hands of the transferee, donee, or grantee. An election or a revocation of an election made before the date of the transfer, gift, or grant of the property shall be taken into account in determining under section 1016(b) the adjustments to basis of such property as of the date of the transfer, gift, or grant, whether or not an election or a revocation of an election under section 1020, or section 113(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, was made by the transferee, donee, or grantee.
(2) An election by the transferee, donee, or grantee or a revocation of such an election shall be applicable in determining the adjustments to basis for the period during which the property was held by the transferor, donor, or grantor, whether or not the transferor, donor, or grantor had made an election or a revocation of an election, provided that the property was held by the transferee, donee, or grantee at any time on or before the date on which the election or revocation was made.
(h)
Application to a change in method of accounting.
For purposes of determining whether a change in depreciation or amortization for property subject to section 167, 168, 197, 1400I, 1400L(c), to section 168 prior to its amendment by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (100 Stat. 2121) (former section 168), or to an additional first year depreciation deduction provision of the Internal Revenue Code (for example, section 168(k), 1400L(b), or 1400N(d)) is a change in method of accounting under section 446(e) and the regulations under section 446(e), section 1016(a)(2) does not permanently affect a taxpayer's lifetime income.
(i)
Examples.
The application of section 1016(a) (1) and (2) may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
The case of Corporation A discloses the following facts:
The cost or other basis is to be adjusted by $16,500 with respect to the years 1952-54, that is, by the amount allowable but not less than the amount allowed which reduced the taxpayer's taxes. An adjustment must also be made with respect to the years 1949-1951, the amount of such adjustment depending upon whether an election was properly made under section 1020, or section 113(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939. If no such election was made, the amount of the adjustment with respect to the years 1949-1951 is $19,500, that is, the amount allowed but not less than the amount allowable. If an election was properly made, the amount of the adjustment with respect to the years 1949-1951 is $19,000, that is, the amount allowable but not less than the amount allowed which reduced the taxpayer's taxes.

# Example 2.
Corporation A, which files its returns on the basis of a calendar year, purchased a building on January 1, 1950, at a cost of $100,000. On the basis of the facts reasonably known to exist at the end of 1950, a period of 50 years should have been used as
the correct useful life of the building; nevertheless, depreciation was computed by Corporation A on the basis of a useful life of 25 years, and was allowed for 1950 through 1953 as a deduction in an annual amount of $4,000. The building was sold on January 1, 1954. Corporation A did not make an election under section 1020, or section 113(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939. No part of the amount allowed Corporation A for any of the years 1950 through 1953 resulted in a reduction of Corporation A's taxes. The adjusted basis of the building as of January 1, 1954, is $88,166, computed as follows:

# Example 4.
If it is assumed that in example (2), or in example (3), all of the deduction allowed Corporation A for 1953 had resulted in a reduction of A's taxes, the adjustment to the basis of the building for depreciation for 1953 would reflect the entire $4,000 deduction. In such case, the adjusted basis of the building as of January 1, 1954, would be $86,083 in example (2), and $90,000 in example (3).

# Example 5.
The facts are the same as in example (2), except that for the year 1950 all of the $4,000 amount allowed Corporation A as a deduction for depreciation for that year resulted in a reduction of A's taxes. In such case, the adjustments to the basis of the building remain the same as those set forth in example (2).

# Example 6.
The facts are the same as in example (3), except that for the year 1950 all of the $4,000 amount allowed Corporation A as a deduction for depreciation resulted in a reduction of A's taxes. In such case, the adjusted basis of the building as of January 1, 1954, is $90,123, computed as follows:

§ 1.1016-4
Exhaustion, wear and tear, obsolescence, amortization, and depletion; periods during which income was not subject to tax.
(a) Adjustments to basis must be made for exhaustion, wear and tear, obsolescence, amortization, and depletion to the extent actually sustained in respect of:
(1) Any period before March 1, 1913,
(2) Any period since February 28, 1913, during which the property was held by a person or organization not subject to income taxation under chapter 1 of the Code or prior income tax laws,
(3) Any period since February 28, 1913, and before January 1, 1958, during which the property was held by a person subject to tax under part I, subchapter L, chapter 1 of the Code, or prior income tax law, to the extent that section 1016(a)(2) does not apply, and
(4) Any period since February 28, 1913, during which such property was held by a person subject to tax under part II of subchapter L, chapter 1 of the Code, or prior income tax law, to the extent that section 1016(a)(2) does not apply.
(b) The amount of the adjustments described in paragraph (a) of this section actually sustained is that amount charged off on the books of the taxpayer where such amount is considered by the Commissioner to be reasonable. Otherwise, the amount actually sustained will be the amount that would have been allowable as a deduction:
(1) During the period described in paragraph (a) (1) or (2) of this section, had the taxpayer been subject to income tax during those periods, or
(2) During the period described in paragraph (a) (3) or (4) of this section, with respect to property held by a taxpayer described in that paragraph, to the extent that section 1016(a)(2) was inapplicable to such property during that period.
In the case of a taxpayer subject to the adjustment required by subparagraph (1) or (2) of this paragraph, depreciation shall be determined by using the straight line method.
[T.D. 6681, 28 FR 11131, Oct. 17, 1963]
§ 1.1016-5
Miscellaneous adjustments to basis.
(a)
Certain stock distributions.
(1) In the case of stock, the cost or other basis must be diminished by the amount of distributions previously made which, under the law applicable to the year in which the distribution was made, either were tax free or were applicable in reduction of basis (not including distributions made by a corporation which was classified as a personal service corporation under the provisions of the Revenue Act of 1918 (40 Stat. 1057) or the Revenue Act of 1921 (42 Stat. 227), out of its earnings or profits which were taxable in accordance with the provisions of section 218 of the Revenue Act of 1918 or the Revenue Act of 1921). For adjustments to basis in the case of certain corporate distributions, see section 301 and the regulations thereunder.
(2) The application of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example:
A, who makes his returns upon the calendar year basis, purchased stock in 1923 for $5,000. He received in 1924 a distribution of $2,000 paid out of earnings and profits of the corporation accumulated before March 1, 1913. The adjusted basis for determining the gain or loss from the sale or other disposition of the stock in 1954 is $5,000 less $2,000, or $3,000, and the amount of the gain or loss from the sale or other disposition of the stock is the difference between $3,000 and the amount realized from the sale or other disposition.
(b)
Amortizable bond premium
—(1)
In general.
A holder's basis in a bond is reduced by the amount of bond premium used to offset qualified stated interest income under § 1.171-2. This reduction occurs when the holder takes the qualified stated interest into account under the holder's regular method of accounting.
(2)
Special rules for taxable bonds.
A holder's basis in a taxable bond is reduced by the amount of bond premium allowed as a deduction under § 1.171-3(c)(5)(ii) (relating to the issuer's call of a taxable bond) or under § 1.171-2(a)(4)(i)(A) (relating to excess bond premium).
(3)
Special rule for tax-exempt obligations.
A holder's basis in a tax-exempt obligation is reduced by the amount of excess bond premium that is treated as a nondeductible loss under § 1.171-2(a)(4)(ii).
(c)
Municipal bonds.
In the case of a municipal bond (as defined in section 75(b)), basis shall be adjusted to the extent provided in section 75 or as provided in section 22(o) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, and the regulations thereunder.
(d)
Sale or exchange of residence.
Where the acquisition of a new residence results in the nonrecognition of any part of the gain on the sale, or exchange, or involuntary conversion of the old residence, the basis of the new residence shall be reduced by the amount of the gain not so recognized pursuant to section 1034(a), or section 112(n) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, and the regulations thereunder. See section 1034(e) and the regulations thereunder.
(e)
Loans from Commodity Credit Corporation.
In the case of property pledged to the Commodity Credit Corporation, the basis of such property shall be increased by the amount received as a loan from such corporation and treated by the taxpayer as income for the year in which received under section 77, or under section 123 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939. The basis of such property shall be reduced to the extent of any deficiency on such loan with respect to which the taxpayer has been relieved from liability.
(f)
Deferred development and exploration expenses.
Expenditures for development and exploration of mines or mineral deposits treated as deferred expenses under sections 615 and 616, or under the corresponding provisions of prior income tax laws, are chargeable to capital account and shall be an adjustment to the basis of the property to which they relate. The basis so adjusted shall be reduced by the amount of such expenditures allowed as deductions which results in a reduction for any taxable year of the taxpayer's taxes under subtitle A (other than chapter 2 relating to tax on self-employment income) of the Code, or prior income, war-profits, or excess-profits tax laws, but not less than the amounts allowable under such provisions for the taxable year and prior years. This amount is considered as the
tax-benefit amount allowed
and shall be determined in accordance with paragraph (e) of § 1.1016-3. For example, if a taxpayer purchases unexplored and undeveloped mining property for $1,000,000 and at the close of the development stage has incurred exploration and development costs of $9,000,000 treated as deferred expenses, the basis of such property at such time for computing gain or loss will be $10,000,000. Assuming that the taxpayer in this example has operated the mine for several years and has deducted allowable percentage depletion in the amount of $2,000,000 and has deducted allowable deferred exploration and development expenditures of $2,000,000, the basis of the property in the taxpayer's hands for purposes of determining gain or loss from a sale will be $6,000,000.
(g)
Sale of land with unharvested crop.
In the case of an unharvested crop which is sold, exchanged, or involuntarily converted with the land and which is considered as property used in the trade or business under section
1231, the basis of such crop shall be increased by the amount of the items which are attributable to the production of such crop and which are disallowed, under section 268, as deductions in computing taxable income. The basis of any other property shall be decreased by the amount of any such items which are attributable to such other property, notwithstanding any provisions of section 1016 or of this section to the contrary. For example, if the items attributable to the production of an unharvested crop consist only of fertilizer costing $100 and $50 depreciation on a tractor used only to cultivate such crop, and such items are disallowed under section 268, the adjustments to the basis of such crop shall include an increase of $150 for such items and the adjustments to the basis of the tractor shall incude a reduction of $50 for depreciation.
(h)
Consent dividends.
(1) In the case of amounts specified in a shareholder's consent to which section 28 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 applies, the basis of the consent stock shall be increased to the extent provided in subsection (h) of such section.
(2) In the case of amounts specified in a shareholder's consent to be treated as a consent dividend to which section 565 applies, the basis of the consent stock shall be increased by the amount which, under section 565(c)(2), is treated as contributed to the capital of the corporation.
(i)
Stock in foreign personal holding company.
In the case of the stock of a United States shareholder in a foreign personal holding company, basis shall be adjusted to the extent provided in section 551(f) or corresponding provisions of prior income tax laws.
(j)
Research and experimental expenditures.
Research and experimental expenditures treated as deferred expenses under section 174(b) are chargeable to capital account and shall be an adjustment to the basis of the property to which they relate. The basis so adjusted shall be reduced by the amount of such expenditures allowed as deductions which results in a reduction for any taxable year of the taxpayer's taxes under subtitle A (other than chapter 2 relating to tax on self-employment income) of the Code, or prior income, war-profits, or excess-profits tax laws, but not less than the amounts allowable under such provisions for the taxable year and prior years. This amount is considered as the
tax-benefit amount allowed
and shall be determined in accordance with paragraph (e) of § 1.1016-3.
(k)
Deductions disallowed in connection with disposal of coal or domestic iron ore.
Basis shall be adjusted by the amount of the deductions disallowed under section 272 with respect to the disposal of coal or domestic iron ore covered by section 631.
(l)
Expenditures attributable to grants or loans covered by section 621.
In the case of expenditures attributable to a grant or loan made to a taxpayer by the United States for the encouragement of exploration for, or development or mining of, critical and strategic minerals or metals, basis shall be adjusted to the extent provided in section 621, or in section 22(b)(15) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939.
(m)
Trademark and trade name expenditures.
Trademark and trade name expenditures treated as deferred expenses under section 177 are chargeable to capital account and shall be an adjustment to the basis of the property to which they relate. The basis so adjusted shall be reduced by the amount of such expenditures allowed as deductions which results in a reduction for any taxable year of the taxpayer's taxes under subtitle A (other than chapter 2, relating to tax on self-employment income) of the Code, but not less than the amounts allowable under such section for the taxable year and prior years. This amount is considered as the
tax-benefit amount allowed
and shall be determined in accordance with paragraph (e) of § 1.1016-3.
(n)
Life insurance companies.
In the case of any evidence of indebtedness referred to in section 818(b), the basis shall be adjusted to the extent of the adjustments required under section 818(b) (or the corresponding provisions of prior income tax laws) for the taxable year and all prior taxable years. The basis of any such evidence of indebtedness shall be reduced by the amount of the adjustment required under section 818(b) (or the corresponding provision of prior income
tax laws) on account of amortizable premium and shall be increased by the amount of the adjustment required under section 818(b) on account of accruable discounts.
(o)
Stock and indebtedness of electing small business corporation.
In the case of a shareholder of an electing small business corporation, as defined in section 1371(b), the basis of the shareholder's stock in such corporation, and the basis of any indebtedness of such corporation owing to the shareholder, shall be adjusted to the extent provided in §§ 1.1375-4, 1.1376-1, and 1.1376-2.
(p)
Gift tax paid on certain property acquired by gift.
Basis shall be adjusted by that amount of the gift tax paid in respect of property acquired by gift which, under section 1015(d), is an increase in the basis of such property.
(q)
Section 38 property.
In the case of property which is or has been section 38 property (as defined in section 48(a)), the basis shall be adjusted to the extent provided in section 48(g) and in section 203(a)(2) of the Revenue Act of 1964.
(r)
Stock in controlled foreign corporations and other property.
In the case of stock in controlled foreign corporations (or foreign corporations which were controlled foreign corporations) and of property by reason of which a person is considered as owning such stock, the basis shall be adjusted to the extent provided in section 961.
(s)
Original issue discount.
In the case of certain corporate obligations issued at a discount after May 27, 1969, the basis shall be increased under section 1232(a)(3)(E) by the amount of original issue discount included in the holder's gross income pursuant to section 1232(a)(3).
(t)
Section 23 credit.
In the case of property with respect to which a credit has been allowed under section 23 or former section 44C (relating to residential energy credit), basis shall be adjusted as provided in paragraph (k) of § 1.23-3.
(u)
Gas guzzler tax.
In the case of an automobile upon which the gas guzzler tax was imposed, the basis shall be reduced as provided in section 1016 (d).

§ 1.1016-6
Other applicable rules.
(a) Adjustments must always be made to eliminate double deductions or their equivalent. Thus, in the case of the stock of a subsidiary company, the basis thereof must be properly adjusted for the amount of the subsidiary company's losses for the years in which consolidated returns were made.
(b) In determining basis, and adjustments to basis, the principles of estoppel apply, as elsewhere under the Code, and prior internal revenue laws.
§ 1.1016-10
Substituted basis.
(a) Whenever it appears that the basis of property in the hands of the taxpayer is a substituted basis, as defined in section 1016(b), the adjustments indicated in §§ 1.1016-1 to 1.1016-6, inclusive, shall be made after first making in respect of such substituted basis proper adjustments of a similar nature in respect of the period during which the property was held by the transferor, donor, or grantor, or during which the other property was held by the person for whom the basis is to be determined. In addition, whenever it appears that the basis of property in the hands of the taxpayer is a substituted basis, as defined in section 1016(b)(1), the adjustments indicated in §§ 1.1016-7 to 1.1016-9, inclusive, and in section 1017 shall also be made, whenever necessary, after first making in respect of such substituted basis a proper adjustment of a similar nature in respect of the period during which the property was held by the transferor, donor, or grantor. Similar rules shall also be applied in the case of a series of substituted bases.
(b)cation of this section may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example:
A, who makes his returns upon the calendar year basis, in 1935 purchased the X Building and subsequently gave it to his son B. B exchanged the X Building for the Y Building in a tax-free exchange, and then gave the Y Building to his wife C. C, in determining the gain from the sale or disposition of the Y Building in 1954, is required to reduce the basis of the building by deductions
for depreciation which were successively allowed (but not less than the amount allowable) to A and B upon the X Building and to B upon the Y Building, in addition to the deductions for depreciation allowed (but not less than the amount allowable) to herself during her ownership of the Y Building.
§ 1.1017-1
Basis reductions following a discharge of indebtedness.
(a)
General rule for section 108(b)(2)(E).
This paragraph (a) applies to basis reductions under section 108(b)(2)(E) that are required by section 108(a)(1) (A) or (B) because the taxpayer excluded discharge of indebtedness (COD income) from gross income. A taxpayer must reduce in the following order, to the extent of the excluded COD income (but not below zero), the adjusted bases of property held on the first day of the taxable year following the taxable year that the taxpayer excluded COD income from gross income (in proportion to adjusted basis):
(1) Real property used in a trade or business or held for investment, other than real property described in section 1221(1), that secured the discharged indebtedness immediately before the discharge;
(2) Personal property used in a trade or business or held for investment, other than inventory, accounts receivable, and notes receivable, that secured the discharged indebtedness immediately before the discharge;
(3) Remaining property used in a trade or business or held for investment, other than inventory, accounts receivable, notes receivable, and real property described in section 1221(1);
(4) Inventory, accounts receivable, notes receivable, and real property described in section 1221(1); and
(5) Property not used in a trade or business nor held for investment.
(b)
Operating rules
—(1)
Prior tax-attribute reduction.
The amount of excluded COD income applied to reduce basis does not include any COD income applied to reduce tax attributes under sections 108(b)(2) (A) through (D) and, if applicable, section 108(b)(5). For example, if a taxpayer excludes $100 of COD income from gross income under section 108(a) and reduces tax attributes by $40 under sections 108(b)(2) (A) through (D), the taxpayer is required to reduce the adjusted bases of property by $60 ($100−$40) under section 108(b)(2)(E).
(2)
Multiple discharged indebtednesses.
If a taxpayer has COD income attributable to more than one discharged indebtedness resulting in the reduction of tax attributes under sections 108(b)(2) (A) through (D) and, if applicable, section 108(b)(5), paragraph (b)(1) of this section must be applied by allocating the tax-attribute reductions among the indebtednesses in proportion to the amount of COD income attributable to each discharged indebtedness. For example, if a taxpayer excludes $20 of COD income attributable to secured indebtedness A and excludes $80 of COD income attributable to unsecured indebtedness B (a total exclusion of $100), and if the taxpayer reduces tax attributes by $40 under sections 108(b)(2) (A) through (D), the taxpayer must reduce the amount of COD income attributable to secured indebtedness A to $12 ($20 − ($20 / $100 × $40)) and must reduce the amount of COD income attributable to unsecured indebtedness B to $48 ($80 − ($80 / $100 × $40)).
(3)
Limitation on basis reductions under section 108(b)(2)(E) in bankruptcy or insolvency.
If COD income arises from a discharge of indebtedness in a title 11 case or while the taxpayer is insolvent, the amount of any basis reduction under section 108(b)(2)(E) shall not exceed the excess of—
(i) The aggregate of the adjusted bases of property and the amount of money held by the taxpayer immediately after the discharge; over
(ii) The aggregate of the liabilities of the taxpayer immediately after the discharge.
(4)
Transactions to which section 381 applies.
If a taxpayer realizes COD income that is excluded from gross income under section 108(a) either during or after a taxable year in which the taxpayer is the distributor or transferor of assets in a transaction described in section 381(a), the basis of property acquired by the acquiring corporation in the transaction must reflect the reductions required by section 1017 and this section. For this purpose, the basis of property of the distributor or transferor corporation immediately prior to the transaction described in
section 381(a), but after the determination of tax for the year of the distribution or transfer of assets, will be available for reduction under section 108(b)(2). However, the basis of stock or securities of the acquiring corporation, if any, received by the taxpayer in exchange for the transferred assets shall not be available for reduction under section 108(b)(2).
See
§ 1.108-7. This paragraph (b)(4) applies to discharges of indebtedness occurring on or after May 10, 2004.
(c)
Modification of ordering rules for basis reductions under sections 108(b)(5) and 108(c)
—(1)
In general.
The ordering rules prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section apply, with appropriate modifications, to basis reductions under sections 108(b)(5) and (c). Thus, a taxpayer that elects to reduce basis under section 108(b)(5) may, to the extent that the election applies, reduce only the adjusted basis of property described in paragraphs (a) (1), (2), and (3) of this section and, if an election is made under paragraph (f) of this section, paragraph (a) (4) of this section. Within paragraphs (a) (1), (2), (3) and (4) of this section, such a taxpayer may reduce only the adjusted bases of depreciable property. A taxpayer that elects to apply section 108(c) may reduce only the adjusted basis of property described in paragraphs (a) (1) and (3) of this section and, within paragraphs (a)(1) and (3) of this section, may reduce only the adjusted bases of depreciable real property. Furthermore, for basis reductions under section 108(c), a taxpayer must reduce the adjusted basis of the qualifying real property to the extent of the discharged qualified real property business indebtedness before reducing the adjusted bases of other depreciable real property. The term
qualifying real property
means real property with respect to which the indebtedness is qualified real property business indebtedness within the meaning of section 108(c)(3). See paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section for elections relating to section 1221(1) property and partnership interests.
(2)
Partial basis reductions under section 108(b)(5).
If the amount of basis reductions under section 108(b)(5) is less than the amount of the COD income excluded from gross income under section 108(a), the taxpayer must reduce the balance of its tax attributes, including any remaining adjusted bases of depreciable and other property, by following the ordering rules under section 108(b)(2). For example, if a taxpayer excludes $100 of COD income from gross income under section 108(a) and elects to reduce the adjusted bases of depreciable property by $10 under section 108(b)(5), the taxpayer must reduce its remaining tax attributes by $90, starting with net operating losses under section 108(b)(2).
(3)
Modification of fresh start rule for prior basis reductions under section 108(b)(5).
After reducing the adjusted bases of depreciable property under section 108(b)(5), a taxpayer must compute the limitation on basis reductions under section 1017(b)(2) using the aggregate of the remaining adjusted bases of property. For example, if, immediately after the discharge of indebtedness in a title 11 case, a taxpayer's adjusted bases of property is $100 and its undischarged indebtedness is $70, and if the taxpayer elects to reduce the adjusted bases of depreciable property by $10 under section 108(b)(5), section 1017(b)(2) limits any further basis reductions under section 108(b)(2)(E) to $20 (($100 − $10) − $70).
(d)
Changes in security.
If any property is added or eliminated as security for an indebtedness during the one-year period preceding the discharge of that indebtedness, such addition or elimination shall be disregarded where a principal purpose of the change is to affect the taxpayer's basis reductions under section 1017.
(e)
Depreciable property.
For purposes of this section, the term
depreciable property
means any property of a character subject to the allowance for depreciation or amortization, but only if the basis reduction would reduce the amount of depreciation or amortization which otherwise would be allowable for the period immediately following such reduction. Thus, for example, a lessor cannot reduce the basis of leased property where the lessee's obligation in respect of the property will restore to the lessor the loss due to depreciation during the term of the lease, since the lessor cannot take depreciation in respect of such property.
(f)
Election to treat section 1221(1) real property as depreciable
—(1)
In general.
For basis reductions under section 108(b)(5) and basis reductions relating to qualified farm indebtedness, a taxpayer may elect under sections 1017(b) (3)(E) and (4)(C), respectively, to treat real property described in section 1221(1) as depreciable property. This election is not available, however, for basis reductions under section 108(c).
(2)
Time and manner.
To make an election under section 1017(b) (3)(E) or (4)(C), a taxpayer must enter the appropriate information on Form 982,
Reduction of Tax Attributes Due to Discharge of Indebtedness (and Section 1082 Basis Adjustment),
and attach the form to a timely filed (including extensions) Federal income tax return for the taxable year in which the taxpayer has COD income that is excluded from gross income under section 108(a). An election under this paragraph (f) may be revoked only with the consent of the Commissioner.
(g)
Partnerships
—(1)
Partnership COD income.
For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, a taxpayer must treat a distributive share of a partnership's COD income as attributable to a discharged indebtedness secured by the taxpayer's interest in that partnership.
(2)
Partnership interest treated as depreciable property
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of making basis reductions, if a taxpayer makes an election under section 108(b)(5) (or 108(c)), the taxpayer must treat a partnership interest as depreciable property (or depreciable real property) to the extent of the partner's proportionate share of the partnership's basis in depreciable property (or depreciable real property), provided that the partnership consents to a corresponding reduction in the partnership's basis (inside basis) in depreciable property (or depreciable real property) with respect to such partner.
(ii)
Request by partner and consent of partnership
—(A)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (g)(2)(ii), a taxpayer may choose whether or not to request that a partnership reduce the inside basis of its depreciable property (or depreciable real property) with respect to the taxpayer, and the partnership may grant or withhold such consent, in its sole discretion. A request by the taxpayer must be made before the due date (including extensions) for filing the taxpayer's Federal income tax return for the taxable year in which the taxpayer has COD income that is excluded from gross income under section 108(a).
(B)
Request for consent required.
A taxpayer must request a partnership's consent to reduce inside basis if, at the time of the discharge, the taxpayer owns (directly or indirectly) a greater than 50 percent interest in the capital and profits of the partnership, or if reductions to the basis of the taxpayer's depreciable property (or depreciable real property) are being made with respect to the taxpayer's distributive share of COD income of the partnership.
(C)
Granting of request required.
A partnership must consent to reduce its partners' shares of inside basis with respect to a discharged indebtedness if consent is requested with respect to that indebtedness by partners owning (directly or indirectly) an aggregate of more than 80 percent of the capital and profits interests of the partnership or five or fewer partners owning (directly or indirectly) an aggregate of more than 50 percent of the capital and profits interests of the partnership. For example, if there is a cancellation of partnership indebtedness that is secured by real property used in a partnership's trade or business, and if partners owning (in the aggregate) 90 percent of the capital and profits interests of the partnership elect to exclude the COD income under section 108(c), the partnership must make the appropriate reductions in those partners' shares of inside basis.
(iii)
Partnership consent statement
—(A)
Partnership requirement.
A consenting partnership must include with the Form 1065, U.S. Partnership Return of Income, for the taxable year following the year that ends with or within the taxable year the taxpayer excludes COD income from gross income under section 108(a), and must provide to the taxpayer on or before the due date of the taxpayer's return (including extensions) for the taxable year in which the taxpayer excludes COD income from gross income, a statement that—
(
1
) Contains the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the partnership; and
(
2
) States the amount of the reduction of the partner's proportionate interest in the adjusted bases of the partnership's depreciable property or depreciable real property, whichever is applicable.
(B)
Taxpayer's requirement.
For taxable years beginning before January 1, 2003, statements described in § 1.1017-1(g)(2)(iii)(A) must be attached to a taxpayer's timely filed (including extensions) Federal income tax return for the taxable year in which the taxpayer has COD income that is excluded from gross income under section 108(a). For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2002, taxpayers must retain the statements and keep them available for inspection in the manner required by § 1.6001-1(e), but are not required to attach the statements to their returns.
(iv)
Partner's share of partnership basis
—(A)
In general.
For purposes of this paragraph (g), a partner's proportionate share of the partnership's basis in depreciable property (or depreciable real property) is equal to the sum of—
(
1
) The partner's section 743(b) basis adjustments to items of partnership depreciable property (or depreciable real property); and
(
2
) The common basis depreciation deductions (but not including remedial allocations of depreciation deductions under § 1.704-3(d)) that, under the terms of the partnership agreement effective for the taxable year in which the discharge of indebtedness occurs, are reasonably expected to be allocated to the partner over the property's remaining useful life. The assumptions made by a partnership in determining the reasonably expected allocation of depreciation deductions must be consistent for each partner. For example, a partnership may not treat the same depreciation deductions as being reasonably expected by more than one partner.
(B)
Effective date.
This paragraph (g)(2)(iv) applies to elections made under sections 108(b)(5) and 108(c) on or after December 15, 1999.
(v)
Treatment of basis reduction
—(A)
Basis adjustment.
The amount of the reduction to the basis of depreciable partnership property constitutes an adjustment to the basis of partnership property with respect to the partner only. No adjustment is made to the common basis of partnership property. Thus, for purposes of income, deduction, gain, loss, and distribution, the partner will have a special basis for those partnership properties the bases of which are adjusted under section 1017 and this section.
(B)
Recovery of adjustments to basis of partnership property.
Adjustments to the basis of partnership property under this section are recovered in the manner described in § 1.743-1.
(C)
Effect of basis reduction.
Adjustments to the basis of partnership property under this section are treated in the same manner and have the same effect as an adjustment to the basis of partnership property under section 743(b). The following example illustrates this paragraph (g)(2)(v):

# Example.
(i) A, B, and C are equal partners in partnership PRS, which owns (among other things) Asset 1, an item of depreciable property with a basis of $30,000. A's basis in its partnership interest is $20,000. Under the terms of the partnership agreement, A's share of the depreciation deductions from Asset 1 over its remaining useful life will be $10,000. Under section 1017, A requests, and PRS agrees, to decrease the basis of Asset 1 with respect to A by $10,000.
(ii) In the year following the reduction of basis under section 1017, PRS amends its partnership agreement to provide that items of depreciation and loss from Asset 1 will be allocated equally between B and C. In that year, A's distributive share of the partnership's common basis depreciation deductions from Asset 1 is now $0. Under § 1.743-1(j)(4)(ii)(B), the amount of the section 1017 basis adjustment that A recovers during the year is $1,000. A will report $1,000 of ordinary income because A's distributive share of the partnership's common basis depreciation deductions from Asset 1 ($0) is insufficient to offset the amount of the section 1017 basis adjustment recovered by A during the year ($1,000).
(iii) In the following year, PRS sells Asset 1 for $15,000 and recognizes a $12,000 loss. This loss is allocated equally between B and C, and A's share of the loss is $0. Upon the sale of Asset 1, A recovers its entire remaining section 1017 basis adjustment ($9,000). A will report $9,000 of ordinary income.
(D)
Effective date.
This paragraph (g)(2)(v) applies to elections made under sections 108(b)(5) and 108(c) on or after December 15, 1999.
(3)
Partnership basis reduction.
The rules of this section (including this paragraph (g)) apply in determining the properties to which the partnership's basis reductions must be made.
(h)
Special allocation rule for cases to which section 1398 applies.
If a bankruptcy estate and a taxpayer to whom section 1398 applies (concerning only individuals under Chapter 7 or 11 of title 11 of the United States Code) hold property subject to basis reduction under section 108(b) (2)(E) or (5) on the first day of the taxable year following the taxable year of discharge, the bankruptcy estate must reduce all of the adjusted bases of its property before the taxpayer is required to reduce any adjusted bases of property.
(i)
Effective date.
This section applies to discharges of indebtedness occurring on or after October 22, 1998.
[T.D. 8787, 63 FR 56563, Oct. 22, 1998, as amended by T.D. 8847, 64 FR 69921, Dec. 15, 1999; T.D. 9080, 68 FR 42593, July 18, 2003; T.D. 9100, 68 FR 70705, Dec. 19, 2003; T.D. 9100, 69 FR 5017, Feb. 3, 2004; T.D. 9127, 69 FR 26039, May 11, 2004; T.D. 9300, 71 FR 71042, Dec. 8, 2006]
§ 1.1019-1
Property on which lessee has made improvements.
In any case in which a lessee of real property has erected buildings or made other improvements upon the leased property and the lease is terminated by forfeiture or otherwise resulting in the realization by such lessor of income which, were it not for the provisions of section 109, would be includible in gross income of the lessor, the amount so excluded from gross income shall not be taken into account in determining the basis or the adjusted basis of such property or any portion thereof in the hands of the lessor. If, however, in any taxable year beginning before January 1, 1942, there has been included in the gross income of the lessor an amount representing any part of the value of such property attributable to such buildings or improvements, the basis of each portion of such property shall be properly adjusted for the amount so included in gross income. For example, A leased in 1930 to B for a period of 25 years unimproved real property and in accordance with the terms of the lease B erected a building on the property. It was estimated that upon expiration of the lease the building would have a depreciated value of $50,000, which value the lessor elected to report (beginning in 1931) as income over the term of the lease. This method of reporting was used until 1942. In 1952 B forfeits the lease. The amount of $22,000 reported as income by A during the years 1931 to 1941, inclusive, shall be added to the basis of the property represented by the improvements in the hands of A. If in such case A did not report during the period of the lease any income attributable to the value of the building erected by the lessee and the lease was forfeited in 1940 when the building was worth $75,000, such amount, having been included in gross income under the law applicable to that year, is added to the basis of the property represented by the improvements in the hands of A. As to treatment of such property for the purposes of capital gains and losses, see subchapter P (section 1201 and following), chapter 1 of the Code.
§ 1.1020-1
Election as to amounts allowed in respect of depreciation, etc., before 1952.
(a)
In general.
(1) Any person may elect to have the adjustments to the cost or other basis of property under section 1016(a)(2) determined in accordance with subparagraph (B) of such section by filing a statement of election in accordance with the requirements set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. Any election made after 1952 shall be irrevocable when made. Any election made after 1952 shall apply with respect to all property held by the person making the election at any time on or before December 31, 1952, and shall apply to all periods since February 28, 1913, and before January 1, 1952, during which such person held such property or for which adjustments must be made under section 1016(b). For rules with respect to an election made on or before December 31, 1952, see paragraph (c) of this section.
(2) An election by a partner on his own behalf is not an election for the partnership of which he is a member. A separate election must be made on behalf of the partnership. (See section
703(b) (relating to elections of the partnership).) An election on behalf of the partnership applies only with respect to the partnership, and does not apply to the separate property of the partners. A similar rule applies with respect to elections by trusts and beneficiaries of trusts. These rules also apply with respect to a revocation of an election where such election was made on or before December 31, 1952.
(b)
Rules applicable to making of election.
The following rules are applicable to the making of an election under section 1020:
(1)
Form of election.
The election shall be in the form of a statement in writing, shall state the name and address of the taxpayer making the election, and shall contain a statement that such taxpayer elects to have the provisions of section 1016(a)(2)(B) apply in respect of all periods since February 28, 1913, and before January 1, 1952.
(2)
Signature.
The statement shall be signed by the taxpayer making the election, if an individual, or, if the taxpayer making the election is not an individual, the statement shall be signed by the person or persons required to sign the income return of such taxpayer.
(3)
Filing.
The statement must be filed on or before December 31, 1954, in the office of the district director for the internal revenue district in which the income tax return for the year of the election is required to be filed. For rules as to when timely mailing will be treated as timely filing of the statement see section 7502.
(4)
Filing of duplicate.
A copy of the statement of election must be filed with the first return, amended return, or claim for refund filed on or after the date on which the election is made.
(c)
Election made on or before December 31, 1952.
An election made on or before December 31, 1952, in accordance with the provisions of section 113(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, may be revoked by filing on or before December 31, 1954, in the same office in which the election was filed, a statement of revocation signed in the same manner as the election. Such statement made by any person is irrevocable when made with respect to such person, and no new election may thereafter be made by such person. A copy of the revocation must be filed with the first return, amended return, or claim for refund, filed after the date of the revocation. For additional rules with respect to election made on or before December 31, 1952, see 26 CFR (1939) 39.113(b)(1)-1 (Regulations 118).
(d)
Validity of elections or revocation of elections.
An election or revocation of an election which conforms in substance to the provisions of this section will not be deemed invalid solely because it was filed before the date on which the regulations in this section were promulgated.
(e)
Effect of election.
For rules relating to the effect of an election under this section, see section 1016(a)(2) and the regulations thereunder.
§ 1.1021-1
Sale of annuities.
In the case of a transfer for value of an annuity contract to which section 72(g) and paragraph (a) of § 1.72-10 apply, the transferor shall adjust his basis in such contract as of the time immediately prior to such transfer by subtracting from the premiums or other consideration he has paid or is deemed to have paid for such contract all amounts he has received or is deemed to have received under such annuity contract to the extent that such amounts were not includible in the gross income of the transferor or other recipient under the applicable income tax law. In any case where the amounts which were not includible in the gross income of the recipient were received or deemed to have been received by such transferor exceed the amounts paid or deemed paid by him, the adjusted basis of the contract shall be zero. The income realized by the transferor on such a transfer shall not exceed the total of the amounts received as consideration for the transfer.

§ 1.1031(a)-1
Property held for productive use in trade or business or for investment.
(a)
In general
—(1)
Exchanges of property solely for property of a like kind.
Section 1031(a)(1) provides an exception from the general rule requiring the recognition of gain or loss upon the sale or exchange of property. Under section 1031(a)(1), no gain or loss is recognized if property held for productive use in a trade or business or for investment is exchanged solely for property of a like kind to be held either for productive use in a trade or business or for investment. Under section 1031(a)(1), property held for productive use in a trade or business may be exchanged for property held for investment. Similarly, under section 1031(a)(1), property held for investment may be exchanged for property held for productive use in a trade or business. However, section 1031(a)(2) provides that section 1031(a)(1) does not apply to any exchange of—
(i) Stock in trade or other property held primarily for sale;
(ii) Stocks, bonds, or notes;
(iii) Other securities or evidences of indebtedness or interest;
(iv) Interests in a partnership;
(v) Certificates of trust or beneficial interests; or
(vi) Choses in action.
Section 1031(a)(1) does not apply to any exchange of interests in a partnership regardless of whether the interests exchanged are general or limited partnership interests or are interests in the same partnership or in different partnerships. An interest in a partnership that has in effect a valid election under section 761(a) to be excluded from the application of all of subchapter K is treated as an interest in each of the assets of the partnership and not as an interest in a partnership for purposes of section 1031(a)(2)(D) and paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this section. An exchange of an interest in such a partnership does not qualify for nonrecognition of
gain or loss under section 1031 with respect to any asset of the partnership that is described in section 1031(a)(2) or to the extent the exchange of assets of the partnership does not otherwise satisfy the requirements of section 1031(a).
(2)
Exchanges of property not solely for property of a like kind.
A transfer is not within the provisions of section 1031(a) if, as part of the consideration, the taxpayer receives money or property which does not meet the requirements of section 1031(a), but the transfer, if otherwise qualified, will be within the provisions of either section 1031 (b) or (c). Similarly, a transfer is not within the provisions of section 1031(a) if, as part of the consideration, the other party to the exchange assumes a liability of the taxpayer (or acquires property from the taxpayer that is subject to a liability), but the transfer, if otherwise qualified, will be within the provisions of either section 1031 (b) or (c). A transfer of property meeting the requirements of section 1031(a) may be within the provisions of section 1031(a) even though the taxpayer transfers in addition property not meeting the requirements of section 1031(a) or money. However, the nonrecognition treatment provided by section 1031(a) does not apply to the property transferred which does not meet the requirements of section 1031(a).
(3)
Exchanges after 2017.
Pursuant to section 13303 of Public Law 115-97 (131 Stat. 2054), for exchanges beginning after December 31, 2017, section 1031 and §§ 1.1031(a)-1, 1.1031(b)-2, 1.1031(d)-1T, 1.1031(d)-2, 1.1031(j)-1, 1.1031(k)-1, and references to section 1031 in §§ 1.1031(b)-1, 1.1031(c)-1, and 1.1031(d)-1, apply only to qualifying exchanges of real property (within the meaning of § 1.1031(a)-3) that is held for productive use in a trade or business, or for investment, and that is not held primarily for sale.
(b)
Definition of “like kind.
” As used in section 1031(a), the words
like kind
have reference to the nature or character of the property and not to its grade or quality. One kind or class of property may not, under that section, be exchanged for property of a different kind or class. The fact that any real estate involved is improved or unimproved is not material, for that fact relates only to the grade or quality of the property and not to its kind or class. Unproductive real estate held by one other than a dealer for future use or future realization of the increment in value is held for investment and not primarily for sale. For additional rules for exchanges of personal property, see § 1.1031 (a)-2.
(c)
Examples of exchanges of property of a “like kind.
” No gain or loss is recognized if (1) a taxpayer exchanges property held for productive use in his trade or business, together with cash, for other property of like kind for the same use, such as a truck for a new truck or a passenger automobile for a new passenger automobile to be used for a like purpose; or (2) a taxpayer who is not a dealer in real estate exchanges city real estate for a ranch or farm, or exchanges a leasehold of a fee with 30 years or more to run for real estate, or exchanges improved real estate for unimproved real estate; or (3) a taxpayer exchanges investment property and cash for investment property of a like kind.
(d)
Examples of exchanges not solely in kind.
Gain or loss is recognized if, for instance, a taxpayer exchanges (1) Treasury bonds maturing March 15, 1958, for Treasury bonds maturing December 15, 1968, unless section 1037(a) (or so much of section 1031 as relates to section 1037(a)) applies to such exchange, or (2) a real estate mortgage for consolidated farm loan bonds.
(e)
Applicability dates

§ 1.1031(a)-2
Additional rules for exchanges of personal property.
(a)
Introduction.
Section 1.1031(a)-1(b) provides that the nonrecognition rules
of section 1031 do not apply to an exchange of one kind or class of property for property of a different kind or class. This section contains additional rules for determining whether personal property has been exchanged for property of a like kind or like class. Personal properties of a like class are considered to be of a “like kind” for purposes of section 1031. In addition, an exchange of properties of a like kind may qualify under section 1031 regardless of whether the properties are also of a like class. In determining whether exchanged properties are of a like kind, no inference is to be drawn from the fact that the properties are not of a like class. Under paragraph (b) of this section, depreciable tangible personal properties are of a like class if they are either within the same General Asset Class (as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section) or within the same Product Class (as defined in paragraph (b)(3) of this section). Paragraph (c) of this section provides rules for exchanges of intangible personal property and nondepreciable personal property.
(b)
Depreciable tangible personal property
—(1)
General rule.
Depreciable tangible personal property is exchanged for property of a “like kind” under section 1031 if the property is exchanged for property of a like kind or like class. Depreciable tangible personal property is of a like class to other depreciable tangible personal property if the exchanged properties are either within the same General Asset Class or within the same Product Class. A single property may not be classified within more than one General Asset Class or within more than one Product Class. In addition, property classified within any General Asset Class may not be classified within a Product Class. A property's General Asset Class or Product Class is determined as of the date of the exchange.
(2)
General Asset Classes.
Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(4) and (b)(5) of this section, property within a General Asset Class consists of depreciable tangible personal property described in one of asset classes 00.11 through 00.28 and 00.4 of Rev. Proc. 87-56, 1987-2 C.B. 674. These General Asset Classes describe types of depreciable tangible personal property that frequently are used in many businesses. The General Asset Classes are as follows:
(i) Office furniture, fixtures, and equipment (asset class 00.11),
(ii) Information systems (computers and peripheral equipment) (asset class 00.12),
(iii) Data handling equipment, except computers (asset class 00.13),
(iv) Airplanes (airframes and engines), except those used in commercial or contract carrying of passengers or freight, and all helicopters (airframes and engines) (asset class 00.21),
(v) Automobiles, taxis (asset class 00.22),
(vi) Buses (asset class 00.23),
(vii) Light general purpose trucks (asset class 00.241),
(viii) Heavy general purpose trucks (asset class 00.242),
(ix) Railroad cars and locomotives, except those owned by railroad transportation companies (asset class 00.25),
(x) Tractor units for use over-the-road (asset class 00.26),
(xi) Trailers and trailer-mounted containers (asset class 00.27),
(xii) Vessels, barges, tugs, and similar water-transportation equipment, except those used in marine construction (asset class 00.28), and
(xiii) Industrial steam and electric generation and/or distribution systems (asset class 00.4).
(3)
Product classes.
Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(4) and (5) of this section, or as provided by the Commissioner in published guidance of general applicability, property within a product class consists of depreciable tangible personal property that is described in a 6-digit product class within Sectors 31, 32, and 33 (pertaining to manufacturing industries) of the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), set forth in Executive Office of the President, Office of Management and Budget,
North American Industry Classification System
, United States, 2002 (NAICS Manual), as periodically updated. Copies of the NAICS Manual may be obtained from the National Technical Information Service, an agency of the U.S. Department of Commerce, and may be accessed on the internet. Sectors 31 through 33 of the NAICS Manual contain listings of specialized industries for the manufacture
of described products and equipment. For this purpose, any 6-digit NAICS product class with a last digit of 9 (a miscellaneous category) is not a product class for purposes of this section. If a property is listed in more than one product class, the property is treated as listed in any one of those product classes. A property's 6-digit product class is referred to as the property's NAICS code.
(4)
Modifications of NAICS product classes.
The product classes of the NAICS Manual may be updated or otherwise modified from time to time as the manual is updated, effective on or after the date of the modification. The NAICS Manual generally is modified every five years, in years ending in a 2 or 7 (such as 2002, 2007, and 2012). The applicability date of the modified NAICS Manual is announced in the
Federal Register
and generally is January 1 of the year the NAICS Manual is modified. Taxpayers may rely on these modifications as they become effective in structuring exchanges under this section. Taxpayers may rely on the previous NAICS Manual for transfers of property made by a taxpayer during the one-year period following the effective date of the modification. For transfers of property made by a taxpayer on or after January 1, 1997, and on or before January 1, 2003, the NAICS Manual of 1997 may be used for determining product classes of the exchanged property.
(5)
Administrative procedures for revising general asset classes and product classes.
The Commissioner may, through published guidance of general applicability, supplement, modify, clarify, or update the guidance relating to the classification of properties provided in this paragraph (b). (See § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter.) For example, the Commissioner may determine not to follow (in whole or in part) a general asset class for purposes of identifying property of like class, may determine not to follow (in whole or in part) any modification of product classes published in the NAICS Manual, or may determine that other properties not listed within the same or in any product class or general asset class nevertheless are of a like class. The Commissioner also may determine that two items of property that are listed in separate product classes or in product classes with a last digit of 9 are of a like class, or that an item of property that has a NAICS code is of a like class to an item of property that does not have a NAICS code.
(6)
No inference outside of section 1031.
The rules provided in this section concerning the use of general asset classes or product classes are limited to exchanges under section 1031. No inference is intended with respect to the classification of property for other purposes, such as depreciation.
(7)
Examples.
The application of this paragraph (b) may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Taxpayer A transfers a personal computer (asset class 00.12) to B in exchange for a printer (asset class 00.12). With respect to A, the properties exchanged are within the same General Asset Class and therefore are of a like class.

# Example 2.
Taxpayer C transfers an airplane (asset class 00.21) to D in exchange for a heavy general purpose truck (asset class 00.242). The properties exchanged are not of a like class because they are within different General Asset Classes. Because each of the properties is within a General Asset Class, the properties may not be classified within a Product Class. The airplane and heavy general purpose truck are also not of a like kind. Therefore, the exchange does not qualify for nonrecognition of gain or loss under section 1031.

# Example 3.
Taxpayer E transfers a grader to F in exchange for a scraper. Neither property is within any of the general asset classes. However, both properties are within the same product class (NAICS code 333120). The grader and scraper are of a like class and deemed to be of a like kind for purposes of section 1031.

# Example 4.
Taxpayer G transfers a personal computer (asset class 00.12), an airplane (asset class 00.21) and a sanding machine (NAICS code 333210), to H in exchange for a printer (asset class 00.12), a heavy general purpose truck (asset class 00.242) and a lathe (NAICS code 333210). The personal computer and the printer are of a like class because they are within the same general asset class. The sanding machine and the lathe are of a like class because they are within the same product class (although neither property is within any of the general asset classes). The airplane and the heavy general purpose truck are neither within the same general asset class nor within the same product class, and are not of a like kind.
(8)
Transition rule.
Properties within the same product classes based on the
4-digit codes contained in Division D of the Executive Office of the President, Office of Management and Budget, Standard Industrial Classification Manual (1987), will be treated as property of a like class for transfers of property made by taxpayers on or before May 19, 2005.
(c)
Intangible personal property and nondepreciable personal property
—(1)
General rule.
An exchange of intangible personal property of nondepreciable personal property qualifies for nonrecognition of gain or loss under section 1031 only if the exchanged properties are of a like kind. No like classes are provided for these properties. Whether intangible personal property is of a like kind to other intangible personal property generally depends on the nature or character of the rights involved (e.g., a patent or a copyright) and also on the nature or character of the underlying property to which the intangible personal property relates.
(2)
Goodwill and going concern value.
The goodwill or going concern value of a business is not of a like kind to the goodwill or going concern value of another business.
(3)
Examples.
The application of this paragraph (c) may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Taxpayer K exchanges a copyright on a novel for a copyright on a different novel. The properties exchanged are of a like kind.

# Example 2.
Taxpayer J exchanges a copyright on a novel for a copyright on a song. The properties exchanged are not of a like kind.
(d)
Effective date.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (d), this section applies to exchanges occurring on or after April 11, 1991. Paragraphs (b)(3) through (b)(6),
Example 3
and
Example 4
of paragraph (b)(7), and paragraph (b)(8) of this section apply to transfers of property made by taxpayers on or after August 12, 2004. However, taxpayers may apply paragraphs (b)(3) through (b)(6), and
Example 3
and
Example 4
of paragraph (b)(7) of this section to transfers of property made by taxpayers on or after January 1, 1997, in taxable years for which the period of limitation for filing a claim for refund or credit under section 6511 has not expired.
[T.D. 8343, 56 FR 14854, Apr. 12, 1991, as amended by T.D. 9151, 69 FR 50068, Aug. 13, 2004; T.D. 9202, 70 FR 28819, May 19, 2005]
§ 1.1031(a)-3
Definition of real property.
(a)
Real property
—(1)
In general.
The term
real property
under section 1031 and §§ 1.1031(a)-1 through 1.1031(k)-1 means land and improvements to land, unsevered natural products of land, and water and air space superjacent to land. Under paragraph (a)(5) of this section, an intangible interest in real property of a type described in this paragraph (a)(1) is real property for purposes of section 1031 and this section. Property that is real property under State or local law as provided in paragraph (a)(6) of this section is real property for purposes of section 1031 and this section.
(2)
Improvements to land
—(i)
In general.
The term
improvements to land
means inherently permanent structures and the structural components of inherently permanent structures.
(ii)
Inherently permanent structures
—(A)
In general.
The term
inherently permanent structure
means any building or other structure that is a distinct asset within the meaning of paragraph (a)(4) of this section and is permanently affixed to real property and that will ordinarily remain affixed for an indefinite period of time. Affixation is considered permanent if it is reasonably expected to last indefinitely based on all the facts and circumstances.
(B)
Building.
A building is any structure or edifice enclosing a space within its walls, and covered by a roof, the purpose of which is, for example, to provide shelter or housing, or to provide working, office, parking, display, or sales space. Buildings include the following distinct assets if permanently affixed: Houses, apartments, hotels, motels, enclosed stadiums and arenas, enclosed shopping malls, factories and office buildings, warehouses, barns, enclosed garages, enclosed transportation stations and terminals, and stores.
(C)
Other inherently permanent structures.
Inherently permanent structures
under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section include the following distinct assets, if permanently affixed: In-ground swimming pools; roads; bridges; tunnels; paved parking areas, parking facilities, and other pavements; special foundations; stationary wharves and docks; fences; inherently permanent advertising displays for which an election under section 1033(g)(3) is in effect; inherently permanent outdoor lighting facilities; railroad tracks and signals; telephone poles; power generation and transmission facilities; permanently installed telecommunications cables; microwave transmission, cell, broadcasting, and electric transmission towers; oil and gas pipelines; offshore platforms, derricks, oil and gas storage tanks; and grain storage bins and silos. Affixation to real property may be accomplished by weight alone. If property is not listed as an inherently permanent structure in paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(B) or (C) of this section, the determination of whether the property is an inherently permanent structure under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section is based on the following factors—
(
1
) The manner in which the distinct asset is affixed to real property;
(
2
) Whether the distinct asset is designed to be removed or to remain in place;
(
3
) The damage that removal of the distinct asset would cause to the item itself or to the real property to which it is affixed;
(
4
) Any circumstances that suggest the expected period of affixation is not indefinite; and
(
5
) The time and expense required to move the distinct asset.
(iii)
Structural components
—(A)
In general.
The term
structural component
means any distinct asset, within the meaning of paragraph (a)(4) of this section, that is a constituent part of, and integrated into, an inherently permanent structure. If interconnected assets work together to serve an inherently permanent structure (for example, systems that provide a building with electricity, heat, or water), the assets are analyzed together as one distinct asset that may be a structural component. A structural component may qualify as real property only if the taxpayer holds its interest in the structural component together with a real property interest in the space in the inherently permanent structure served by the structural component. If a distinct asset is customized, the customization does not affect whether the distinct asset is a structural component. Tenant improvements to a building that are inherently permanent or otherwise classified as real property within the meaning of this paragraph (a)(2)(iii) are real property under this section. However, property produced for sale, such as bricks, nails, paint, and windowpanes, that is not real property in the hands of the producing taxpayer or a related person, as defined in section 1031(f)(3), but that may be incorporated into real property by an unrelated buyer, is not treated as real property by the producing taxpayer.
(B)
Examples of structural components.
Structural components include the following items, provided the item is a constituent part of, and integrated into, an inherently permanent structure: Walls; partitions; doors; wiring; plumbing systems; central air conditioning and heating systems; pipes and ducts; elevators and escalators; floors; ceilings; permanent coverings of walls, floors, and ceilings; insulation; chimneys; fire suppression systems, including sprinkler systems and fire alarms; fire escapes; security systems; humidity control systems; and other similar property. If a component of a building or inherently permanent structure is a distinct asset and is not listed as a structural component in this paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(B), the determination of whether the component is a structural component under this paragraph (a)(2)(iii) is based on the following factors—
(
1
) The manner, time, and expense of installing and removing the component;
(
2
) Whether the component is designed to be moved;
(
3
) The damage that removal of the component would cause to the item itself or to the inherently permanent structure to which it is affixed; and
(
4
) Whether the component is installed during construction of the inherently permanent structure.
(3)
Unsevered natural products of land.
Unsevered natural products of land, including growing crops, plants, and timber; mines; wells; and other natural deposits, generally are treated as real property for purposes of this section. Natural products and deposits, such as crops, timber, water, ores, and minerals, cease to be real property when they are severed, extracted, or removed from the land.
(4)
Distinct asset
—(i)
In general.
For this section, a distinct asset is analyzed separately from any other assets to which the asset relates to determine if the asset is real property, whether as land, an inherently permanent structure, or a structural component of an inherently permanent structure. Buildings and other inherently permanent structures are distinct assets. Assets and systems listed as a structural component in paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(B) of this section are treated as distinct assets.
(ii)
Facts and circumstances.
The determination of whether a particular separately identifiable item of property is a distinct asset is based on all the facts and circumstances. In particular, the following factors must be taken into account—
(A) Whether the item is customarily sold or acquired as a single unit rather than as a component part of a larger asset;
(B) Whether the item can be separated from a larger asset, and if so, the cost of separating the item from the larger asset;
(C) Whether the item is commonly viewed as serving a useful function independent of a larger asset of which it is a part; and
(D) Whether separating the item from a larger asset of which it is a part impairs the functionality of the larger asset.
(5)
Intangible assets
—(i)
In general.
Intangible assets that are real property for purposes of section 1031 and this section include the following items: Fee ownership; co-ownership; a leasehold; an option to acquire real property; an easement; stock in a cooperative housing corporation; shares in a mutual ditch, reservoir, or irrigation company described in section 501(c)(12)(A) of the Code if, at the time of the exchange, such shares have been recognized by the highest court of the State in which the company was organized, or by a State statute, as constituting or representing real property or an interest in real property; and land development rights. Similar interests are real property for purposes of section 1031 and this section if the intangible asset derives its value from real property or an interest in real property and is inseparable from that real property or interest in real property. The following intangible assets are not real property for purposes of section 1031 and this section, regardless of the classification of such property under State or local law—
(A) Stock not described in paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section, bonds, or notes;
(B) Other securities or evidences of indebtedness or interest;
(C) Interests in a partnership (other than an interest in a partnership that has in effect a valid election under section 761(a) to be excluded from the application of all of subchapter K);
(D) Certificates of trust or beneficial interests; and
(E) Choses in action.
(ii)
Licenses and permits.
A license, permit, or other similar right that is solely for the use, enjoyment, or occupation of land or an inherently permanent structure and that is in the nature of a leasehold, easement, or other similar right, generally is an interest in real property under this section. However, a license or permit to engage in or operate a business on real property is not real property or an interest in real property, regardless of its classification under State or local law.
(6)
State or local law.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, property is real property within the meaning of paragraph (a)(1) of this section under State or local law if, on the date it is transferred in an exchange, the property is real property under the law of the State or local jurisdiction in which that property is located.
(7)
No inference outside of section 1031.
The rules provided in this section concerning the definition of real property apply only for purposes of section 1031. No inference is intended with respect
to the classification or characterization of property for other purposes of the Code, such as depreciation and sections 1245 and 1250. For example, a structure or a portion of a structure may be section 1245 property for depreciation purposes and for determining gain under section 1245, notwithstanding that the structure or the portion of the structure is real property under this section. Also, a taxpayer transferring relinquished property that is section 1245 property in a section 1031 exchange is subject to the gain recognition rules under section 1245 and the regulations under section 1245, notwithstanding that the relinquished property or replacement property is real property under this section. In addition, the taxpayer must follow the rules of section 1245 and the regulations under section 1245, and section 1250 and the regulations under section 1250, based on the determination of the relinquished property and replacement property being, in whole or in part, section 1245 property or section 1250 property under those Code sections and not under this section.
(b)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the provisions of this section. In each example, unless otherwise provided, the State or local law of the applicable jurisdiction in which the property at issue is located does not address whether the property is real property.
(1)
Example 1: Natural products of land.
A owns land with perennial fruit-bearing plants that A harvests annually. The unsevered plants are natural products of the land within the meaning of paragraph (a)(3) of this section and thus are real property for purposes of section 1031. A annually harvests fruit from the plants. Upon severance from the land, the harvested fruit ceases to be part of the land and therefore is not real property. Storage of the harvested fruit upon or within real property does not cause the harvested fruit to be real property.
(2)
Example 2: Water space superjacent to land.
B owns a marina comprised of U-shaped boat slips and end ties. The U-shaped boat slips are spaces on the water that are surrounded by a dock on three sides. The end ties are spaces on the water at the end of a slip or on a long, straight dock. B rents the boat slips and end ties to boat owners. The boat slips and end ties are water space superjacent to land and thus are real property within the meaning of paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
(3)
Example 3: Indoor sculpture.
(i) C owns an office building and a large sculpture in the atrium of the building. The sculpture measures 30 feet tall by 18 feet wide and weighs five tons. The building was specifically designed to support the sculpture, which is permanently affixed to the building by supports embedded in the building's foundation. The sculpture was constructed within the building. Removal would be costly and time consuming and would destroy the sculpture. The sculpture is reasonably expected to remain in the building indefinitely.
(ii) The sculpture is not an inherently permanent structure listed in paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(C) of this section, and, therefore, C must use the factors provided in paragraphs (a)(2)(ii)(C)(
1
) through (
5
) of this section to determine whether the sculpture is an inherently permanent structure. The sculpture—
(A) Is permanently affixed to the building by supports embedded in the building's foundation;
(B) Is not designed to be removed and is designed to remain in place indefinitely;
(C) Would be damaged if removed and would damage the building to which it is affixed;
(D) Is expected to remain in the building indefinitely; and
(E) Would require significant time and expense to move.
(iii) The factors described in paragraphs (a)(2)(ii)(C)(
1
) through (
5
) of this section all support the conclusion that the sculpture is an inherently permanent structure within the meaning of paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(A) of this section. Therefore, the sculpture is real property.
(4)
Example 4: Bus shelters.
(i) D owns 400 bus shelters, each of which consists of four posts, a roof, and panels enclosing two or three sides. D enters into a long-term lease with a local transit authority for use of the bus shelters. Each bus shelter is prefabricated from steel and is bolted to the sidewalk. Bus shelters are disassembled and moved
when bus routes change. Moving a bus shelter takes less than a day and does not significantly damage either the bus shelter or the real property to which it was affixed.
(ii) The bus shelters are not permanently affixed enclosed transportation stations or terminals, are not buildings under paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, nor are they listed as types of other inherently permanent structures in paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(C) of this section. Therefore, the bus shelters must be analyzed to determine whether they are inherently permanent structures using the factors provided in paragraphs (a)(2)(ii)(C)(
1
) through (
5
) of this section. The bus shelters—
(A) Are not permanently affixed to the land or an inherently permanent structure;
(B) Are designed to be removed and not remain in place indefinitely;
(C) Would not be damaged if removed and would not damage the sidewalks to which they are affixed;
(D) Will not remain affixed indefinitely; and
(E) Would not require significant time and expense to move.
(iii) The factors described in paragraphs (a)(2)(ii)(C)(
1
) through (
5
) of this section all support the conclusion that the bus shelters are not inherently permanent structures within the meaning of paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section. Thus, the bus shelters are not inherently permanent structures within the meaning of paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section and, therefore, are not real property.
(5)
Example 5: Industrial 3D printer and generator.
(i) E owns a building that it uses in its trade or business of manufacturing airplane parts. The building includes an industrial 3D printer that can print airplane wings and an electrical generator that serves the building and the 3D printer in a backup capacity. The 3D printer weighs 12 tons, is designed to remain in place indefinitely once installed in the building, and its removal would be time-consuming and very costly, and would cause significant damage to the building. The 3D printer was installed during the building's construction. The generator also was installed during construction and is designed to remain in place indefinitely once installed. Although costly and time-consuming to remove, removal of the generator will not result in substantial damage to the generator or the building.
(ii) The 3D printer is not listed as an example of a structural component under paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(B) of this section. Therefore, the 3D printer must be analyzed to determine whether it is a structural component using the factors provided in paragraphs (a)(2)(iii)(B)(
1
) through (
4
) of this section. The 3D printer—
(A) Is time-consuming and costly to move;
(B) Is not designed to be moved;
(C) If removed, would cause significant damage to the building in which it is located; and
(D) Was installed during construction of the building.
(iii) The factors described in paragraphs (a)(2)(iii)(B)(
1
) through (
4
) of this section support the conclusion that the 3D printer is a structural component of E's building and real property under this section. Thus, the 3D printer is real property.
(iv) The electrical generator also is not listed as an example of a structural component under paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(B) of this section and must be analyzed to determine whether it is a structural component using the factors provided in paragraphs (a)(2)(iii)(B)(
1
) through (
4
) of this section. The generator—
(A) Is time-consuming and costly to move;
(B) Is not designed to be moved;
(C) If removed, would not result in significant damage to the generator or the building in which it is located; and
(D) Was installed during construction of the building.
(v) The factors described in paragraphs (a)(2)(iii)(B)(
1
) through (
4
) of this section, considered in the aggregate, support the conclusion that the generator is a structural component of E's building. Although the generator's removal would not result in significant damage to the generator or to E's building, that factor does not outweigh the factors supporting the conclusion that it is a structural component. Consequently, the generator is a structural
component of E's building and real property under this section.

Example 6: Raised flooring for industrial 3D printer.
(i) The facts are the same as in paragraph (b)(5),
Example 5,
except that E, when installing its 3D printer, also installed a raised flooring system for the purpose of facilitating the operation of the 3D printer. The raised flooring system is not designed or constructed to remain permanently in place. Rather, the raised flooring system can be removed, without any substantial damage to the system itself or to the building, and then reused. The raised flooring was installed during the building's construction.
(ii) Although floors are listed as an example of a structural component under paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(B) of this section, the raised flooring system installed to facilitate the operation of E's 3D printer is not a constituent part of, and integrated into, an inherently permanent structure as required by paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(A) of this section and, therefore, is not flooring as listed in paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(B) of this section. Thus, the raised flooring must be analyzed to determine whether it is a structural component of E's building (within the meaning of paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section) using the factors provided in paragraphs (a)(2)(iii)(B)(
1
) through (
4
) of this section. The raised flooring—
(A) Is installed and removed quickly and with little expense;
(B) Is designed to be moved and is not designed specifically for the particular building of which it is a part;
(C) Is not damaged, and the building is not damaged, upon its removal; and
(D) Was installed during construction of the building.
(iii) The factors described in paragraphs (a)(2)(iii)(B)(
1
) through (
4
) of this section, considered in the aggregate, support the conclusion that the raised flooring is not a structural component of E's building within the meaning of paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section. Although the raised flooring was installed during construction of the building, that factor does not outweigh the factors supporting the conclusion that the flooring is not a structural component. Therefore, the raised flooring is not real property.
(7)
Example 7: Steam turbine.
(i) F owns a building with a large steam turbine attached as a fixture to the building. The steam turbine is a component of a system used for the commercial production of electricity for sale to customers in the ordinary course of F's business as an electric utility. The steam turbine also generates electricity for F's building. The steam turbine takes up a substantial portion of the building and is designed to remain in place indefinitely once installed in F's building. The steam turbine was installed during the construction of the building and its removal would be costly and cause damage to the building.
(ii) The steam turbine is not listed as an example of a structural component under paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(B) of this section and must be analyzed to determine whether it is a structural component using the factors provided in paragraphs (a)(2)(iii)(B)(
1
) through (
4
) of this section. The steam turbine—
(A) Is costly to remove from the building in which it is located;
(B) Is not designed to be moved;
(C) If removed, would cause damage to the building; and
(D) Was installed during construction of the building.
(iii) The factors described in paragraphs (a)(2)(iii)(B)(
1
) through (
4
) of this section support the conclusion that the steam turbine is a structural component of F's building and real property under this section. Thus, the steam turbine is real property.
(8)
Example 8: Partitions.
(i) G owns an office building that it leases to tenants. The building includes partitions owned by G that are used to delineate space within the building. The office building has two types of interior, non-load-bearing drywall partition systems: A conventional drywall partition system (Conventional Partition System) and a modular drywall partition system (Modular Partition System). Neither the Conventional Partition System nor the Modular Partition System was installed during construction of the office building. Conventional Partition Systems are comprised of fully integrated gypsum board partitions, studs, joint tape, and covering joint compound. Modular Partition Systems are comprised of assembled panels,
studs, tracks, and exposed joints. Both the Conventional Partition System and the Modular Partition System reach from the floor to the ceiling. In addition, both are distinct assets as described in paragraph (a)(4) of this section.
(ii) Depending on the needs of a new tenant, the Conventional Partition System may remain in place when a tenant vacates the premises. The Conventional Partition System is integrated into the office building and is designed and constructed to remain in areas not subject to reconfiguration or expansion. The Conventional Partition System can be removed only by demolition, and, once removed, neither the Conventional Partition System nor its components can be reused. Removal of the Conventional Partition System causes substantial damage to the Conventional Partition System itself, but does not cause substantial damage to the building.
(iii) Modular Partition Systems are typically removed when a tenant vacates the premises. Modular Partition Systems are not designed or constructed to remain permanently in place. Modular Partition Systems are designed and constructed to be movable. Each Modular Partition System can be readily removed, remains in substantially the same condition as before, and can be reused. Removal of a Modular Partition System does not cause any substantial damage to the Modular Partition System itself or to the building. The Modular Partition System may be moved to accommodate the reconfigurations of the interior space within the office building for various tenants that occupy the building.
(iv) The Conventional Partition System is comprised of walls that are integrated into an inherently permanent structure and are listed as structural components in paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(B) of this section. Thus, the Conventional Partition System is real property.
(v) The Modular Partition System is not integrated into the building as required by paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(A) of this section and, therefore, is not listed in paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(B) of this section. Thus, the Modular Partition System must be analyzed to determine whether it is a structural component using the factors provided in paragraphs (a)(2)(iii)(B)(
1
) through (
4
) of this section. The Modular Partition System—
(A) Is installed and removed quickly and with little expense;
(B) Is designed to be moved and is not designed specifically for the particular building of which it is a part;
(C) Is not damaged, and the building is not damaged, upon its removal; and
(D) Was not installed during construction of the building.
(vi) The factors described in paragraphs (a)(2)(iii)(B)(
1
) through (
4
) of this section support the conclusion that the Modular Partition System is not a structural component of G's office building within the meaning of paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section. Therefore, the Modular Partition System is not real property.
(9)
Example 9: Pipeline transmission system.
(i) H owns a natural gas pipeline transmission system that provides a conduit to transport natural gas from unrelated third-party producers and gathering facilities to unrelated third-party distributors and end users. The pipeline transmission system is comprised of underground pipelines, isolation valves and vents, pressure control and relief valves, meters, and compressors. Each of these distinct assets was installed during construction of the pipeline transmission system and each was designed to remain permanently in place.
(ii) The pipelines are permanently affixed and are listed as other inherently permanent structures in paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(C) of this section. Thus, the pipelines are real property.
(iii) Isolation valves and vents are placed at regular intervals along the pipelines to isolate and evacuate sections of the pipelines in case there is need for a shut-down or maintenance of the pipelines. Pressure control and relief valves are installed at regular intervals along the pipelines to provide overpressure protection. The isolation valves and vents and pressure control and relief valves are not listed in paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(B) of this section and, therefore, must be analyzed to determine whether they are structural components using the factors provided in paragraphs (a)(2)(iii)(B)(
1
) through (
4
)
of this section. The isolation valves and vents and pressure control and relief valves—
(A) Are time consuming and expensive to install and remove from the pipelines;
(B) Are designed specifically for the particular pipelines for which they are a part;
(C) Will sustain damage and will damage the pipelines if removed; and
(D) Were installed during construction of the pipelines.
(iv) The factors in paragraphs (a)(2)(iii)(B)(
1
) through (
4
) of this section support the conclusion that the isolation valves and vents and pressure control and relief valves are structural components of H's pipelines within the meaning of paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section. Therefore, the isolation valves and vents and pressure control and relief valves are real property.
(v) Meters are used to measure the natural gas passing into or out of the pipeline transmission system for purposes of determining the end users' consumption. Over long distances, pressure is lost due to friction in the pipeline transmission system. Compressors are required to add pressure to transport natural gas through the entirety of the pipeline transmission system. H installed meters and compressors during the construction of the pipelines. However, unlike other types of such meters and compressors, these particular meters and compressors are not time consuming and expensive to install and remove from the pipelines; are not designed specifically for the particular pipelines for which they are a part; and their removal does not cause damage to the asset or the pipelines if removed. Therefore, the meters and compressors installed by H are not structural components within the meaning of paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section and, therefore, are not real property.
(10)
Example 10: State or local law determination of property.
(i) J owns water pipeline in State X that it wants to exchange for cell phone towers located in State Y. On the date that J transfers the water pipeline in an exchange for the cell phone towers, the water pipeline is classified as real property under the law of State X, the jurisdiction in which the water pipeline is located.
(ii) The water pipeline is real property under paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(6) of this section, regardless of whether the water pipeline is listed as an inherently permanent structure or a structural component of an inherently permanent structure, or is real property under the factors listed in paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(C) or (a)(2)(iii)(B) of this section.
(iii) Cell phone towers are listed as an inherently permanent structure under paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(C) of this section. Thus, the cell phone towers that J acquires in the exchange for the water pipeline are real property under this section, regardless of the State or local characterization of the cell phone towers or whether the cell phone towers are real property under the factors in paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(C) or (a)(2)(iii)(B) of this section.
(11)
Example 11: Land use permit.
K receives a special use permit from the government to place a cell tower on Federal Government land that abuts a Federal highway. Government regulations provide that the permit is not a lease of the land, but is a permit to use the land for a cell tower. Under the permit, the government reserves the right to cancel the permit and compensate K if the site is needed for a higher public purpose. The permit is in the nature of a leasehold that allows K to place a cell tower in a specific location on government land. Therefore, the permit is an interest in real property under paragraph (a)(5) of this section.
(12)
Example 12: License to operate a business.
L owns a building and receives a license from State A to operate a casino in the building. The license applies only to K's building and cannot be transferred to another location. L's building is an inherently permanent structure under paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(A) of this section and, therefore, is real property. However, L's license to operate a casino is not a right for the use, enjoyment, or occupation of L's building, but is rather a license to engage in or operate the casino business in the building. Therefore, the casino license is not real property or an interest in
real property under paragraph (a)(5)(ii) of this section.
(c)
Applicability date.
This section applies to exchanges beginning after December 2, 2020.
[T.D. 9935, 85 FR 77378, Dec. 2, 2020]
§ 1.1031(b)-1
Receipt of other property or money in tax-free exchange.
(a) If the taxpayer receives other property (in addition to property permitted to be received without recognition of gain) or money—
(1) In an exchange described in section 1031(a) of property held for investment or productive use in trade or business for property of like kind to be held either for productive use or for investment,
(2) In an exchange described in section 1035(a) of insurance policies or annuity contracts,
(3) In an exchange described in section 1036(a) of common stock for common stock, or preferred stock for preferred stock, in the same corporation and not in connection with a corporate reorganization, or
(4) In an exchange described in section 1037(a) of obligations of the United States, issued under the Second Liberty Bond Act (31 U.S.C. 774 (2)), solely for other obligations issued under such Act, the gain, if any, to the taxpayer will be recognized under section 1031(b) in an amount not in excess of the sum of the money and the fair market value of the other property, but the loss, if any, to the taxpayer from such an exchange will not be recognized under section 1031(c) to any extent.
(b) The application of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
A, who is not a dealer in real estate, in 1954 exchanges real estate held for investment, which he purchased in 1940 for $5,000, for other real estate (to be held for productive use in trade or business) which has a fair market value of $6,000, and $2,000 in cash. The gain from the transaction is $3,000, but is recognized only to the extent of the cash received of $2,000.

# Example 2.
(a) B, who uses the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting and the calendar year as his taxable year, has never elected under section 454(a) to include in gross income currently the annual increase in the redemption price of non-interest-bearing obligations issued at a discount. In 1943, for $750 each, B purchased four $1,000 series E U.S. savings bonds bearing an issue date of March 1, 1943.
(b) On October 1, 1963, the redemption value of each such bond was $1,396, and the total redemption value of the four bonds was $5,584. On that date B submitted the four $1,000 series E bonds to the United States in a transaction in which one of such $1,000 bonds was reissued by issuing four $100 series E U.S. savings bonds bearing an issue date of March 1, 1943, and by considering six $100 series E bonds bearing an issue date of March 1, 1943, to have been issued. The redemption value of each such $100 series E bond was $139.60 on October 1, 1963. Then, as part of the transaction, the six $100 series E bonds so considered to have been issued and the three $1,000 series E bonds were exchanged, in an exchange qualifying under section 1037(a), for five $1,000 series H U.S. savings bonds plus $25.60 in cash.
(c) The gain realized on the exchange qualifying under section 1037(a) is $2,325.60, determined as follows:
Amount realized:
Par value of five series H bonds
$5,000.00
Cash received
25.60
Total realized
5,025.60
Less: Adjusted basis of series E bonds surrendered in the exchange:
Three $1,000 series E bonds
$2,250.00
Six $100 series E bonds at $75 each
450.00
2,700.00
Gain realized
2,325.60
(d) Pursuant to section 1031(b), only $25.60 (the money received) of the total gain of $2,325.60 realized on the exchange is recognized at the time of exchange and must be included in B's gross income for 1963. The $2,300 balance of the gain ($2,325.60 less $25.60) must be included in B's gross income for the taxable year in which the series H bonds are redeemed or disposed of, or reach final maturity, whichever is earlier, as provided in paragraph (c) of § 1.454-1.
(e) The gain on the four $100 series E bonds, determined by using $75 as a basis for each such bond, must be included in B's gross income for the taxable year in which such bonds are redeemed or disposed of, or reach final maturity, whichever is earlier.

# Example 3.
(a) The facts are the same as in example (2), except that, as part of the transaction, the $1,000 series E bond is reissued by considering ten $100 series E bonds bearing an issue date of March 1, 1943, to have been issued. Six of the $100 series E bonds so considered to have been issued are surrendered to the United States as part of the exchange qualifying under section 1037(a) and the other four are immediately redeemed.
(b) Pursuant to section 1031(b), only $25.60 (the money received) of the total gain of
$2,325.60 realized on the exchange qualifying under section 1037(a) is recognized at the time of the exchange and must be included in B's gross income for 1963. The $2,300 balance of the gain ($2,325.60 less $25.60) realized on such exchange must be included in B's gross income for the taxable year in which the series H bonds are redeemed or disposed of, or reach final maturity, whichever is earlier, as provided in paragraph (c) of § 1.454-1.
(c) The redemption on October 1, 1963, of the four $100 series E bonds considered to have been issued at such time results in gain of $258.40, which is then recognized and must be included in B's gross income for 1963. This gain of $258.40 is the difference between the $558.40 redemption value of such bonds on the date of the exchange and the $300 (4 × $75) paid for such series E bonds in 1943.

# Example 4.
On November 1, 1963, C purchased for $91 a marketable U.S. bond which was originally issued at its par value of $100 under the Second Liberty Bond Act. On February 1, 1964, in an exchange qualifying under section 1037(a), C surrendered the bond to the United States for another marketable U.S. bond, which then had a fair market value of $92, and $1.85 in cash, $0.85 of which was interest. The $0.85 interest received is includible in gross income for the taxable year of the exchange, but the $2 gain ($93 less $91) realized on the exchange is recognized for such year under section 1031(b) to the extent of $1 (the money received). Under section 1031(d), C's basis in the bond received in exchange is $91 (his basis of $91 in the bond surrendered, reduced by the $1 money received and increased by the $1 gain recognized).
(c) Consideration received in the form of an assumption of liabilities (or a transfer subject to a liability) is to be treated as
other property or money
for the purposes of section 1031(b). Where, on an exchange described in section 1031(b), each party to the exchange either assumes a liability of the other party or acquires property subject to a liability, then, in determining the amount of
other property or money
for purposes of section 1031(b), consideration given in the form of an assumption of liabilities (or a receipt of property subject to a liability) shall be offset against consideration received in the form of an assumption of liabilities (or a transfer subject to a liability). See § 1.1031(d)-2, examples (1) and (2).
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11910, Nov. 26, 1960, as amended by T.D. 6935, 32 FR 15822, Nov. 17, 1967]
§ 1.1031(b)-2
Safe harbor for qualified intermediaries.
(a) In the case of simultaneous transfers of like-kind properties involving a qualified intermediary (as defined in § 1.1031(k)-1(g)(4)(iii)), the qualified intermediary is not considered the agent of the taxpayer for purposes of section 1031(a). In such a case, the transfer and receipt of property by the taxpayer is treated as an exchange.
(b) In the case of simultaneous exchanges of like-kind properties involving a qualified intermediary (as defined in § 1.1031(k)-1(g)(4)(iii)), the receipt by the taxpayer of an evidence of indebtedness of the transferee of the qualified intermediary is treated as the receipt of an evidence of indebtedness of the person acquiring property from the taxpayer for purposes of section 453 and § 15a.453-1(b)(3)(i) of this chapter.
(c) Paragraph (a) of this section applies to transfers of property made by taxpayers on or after June 10, 1991.
(d) Paragraph (b) of this section applies to transfers of property made by taxpayers on or after April 20, 1994. A taxpayer may choose to apply paragraph (b) of this section to transfers of property made on or after June 10, 1991.
[T.D. 8346, 56 FR 19937, May 1, 1991, as amended by T.D. 8535, 59 FR 18749, Apr. 20, 1994]
§ 1.1031(c)-1
Nonrecognition of loss.
Section 1031(c) provides that a loss shall not be recognized from an exchange of property described in section 1031(a), 1035(a), 1036(a), or 1037(a) where there is received in the exchange other property or money in addition to property permitted to be received without recognition of gain or loss. See example (4) of paragraph (a)(3) of § 1.1037-1 for an illustration of the application of this section in the case of an exchange of U.S. obligations described in section 1037(a).
[T.D. 6935, 32 FR 15822, Nov. 17, 1967]
§ 1.1031(d)-1
Property acquired upon a tax-free exchange.
(a) If, in an exchange of property solely of the type described in section 1031, section 1035(a), section 1036(a), or section 1037(a), no part of the gain or
loss was recognized under the law applicable to the year in which the exchange was made, the basis of the property acquired is the same as the basis of the property transferred by the taxpayer with proper adjustments to the date of the exchange. If additional consideration is given by the taxpayer in the exchange, the basis of the property acquired shall be the same as the property transferred increased by the amount of additional consideration given (see section 1016 and the regulations thereunder).
(b) If, in an exchange of properties of the type indicated in section 1031, section 1035(a), section 1036(a), or section 1037(a), gain to the taxpayer was recognized under the provisions of section 1031(b) or a similar provision of a prior revenue law, on account of the receipt of money in the transaction, the basis of the property acquired is the basis of the property transferred (adjusted to the date of the exchange), decreased by the amount of money received and increased by the amount of gain recognized on the exchange. The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example:
A, an individual in the moving and storage business, in 1954 transfers one of his moving trucks with an adjusted basis in his hands of $2,500 to B in exchange for a truck (to be used in A's business) with a fair market value of $2,400 and $200 in cash. A realizes a gain of $100 upon the exchange, all of which is recognized under section 1031(b). The basis of the truck acquired by A is determined as follows:
Adjusted basis of A's former truck
$2,500
Less: Amount of money received
200
Difference
2,300
Plus: Amount of gain recognized
100
Basis of truck acquired by A
2,400
(c) If, upon an exchange of properties of the type described in section 1031, section 1035(a), section 1036(a), or section 1037(a), the taxpayer received other property (not permitted to be received without the recognition of gain) and gain from the transaction was recognized as required under section 1031(b), or a similar provision of a prior revenue law, the basis (adjusted to the date of the exchange) of the property transferred by the taxpayer, decreased by the amount of any money received and increased by the amount of gain recognized, must be allocated to and is the basis of the properties (other than money) received on the exchange. For the purpose of the allocation of the basis of the properties received, there must be assigned to such other property an amount equivalent to its fair market value at the date of the exchange. The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example:
A, who is not a dealer in real estate, in 1954 transfers real estate held for investment which he purchased in 1940 for $10,000 in exchange for other real estate (to be held for investment) which has a fair market value of $9,000, an automobile which has a fair market value of $2,000, and $1,500 in cash. A realizes a gain of $2,500, all of which is recognized under section 1031(b). The basis of the property received in exchange is the basis of the real estate A transfers ($10,000) decreased by the amount of money received ($1,500) and increased in the amount of gain that was recognized ($2,500), which results in a basis for the property received of $11,000. This basis of $11,000 is allocated between the automobile and the real estate received by A, the basis of the automobile being its fair market value at the date of the exchange, $2,000, and the basis of the real estate received being the remainder, $9,000.
(d) Section 1031(c) and, with respect to section 1031 and section 1036(a), similar provisions of prior revenue laws provide that no loss may be recognized on an exchange of properties of a type described in section 1031, section 1035(a), section 1036(a), or section 1037(a), although the taxpayer receives other property or money from the transaction. However, the basis of the property or properties (other than money) received by the taxpayer is the basis (adjusted to the date of the exchange) of the property transferred, decreased by the amount of money received. This basis must be allocated to the properties received, and for this purpose there must be allocated to such other property an amount of such basis equivalent to its fair market value at the date of the exchange.
(e) If, upon an exchange of properties of the type described in section 1031, section 1035(a), section 1036(a), or section 1037(a), the taxpayer also exchanged other property (not permitted to be transferred without the recognition of gain or loss) and gain or loss from the transaction is recognized
under section 1002 or a similar provision of a prior revenue law, the basis of the property acquired is the total basis of the properties transferred (adjusted to the date of the exchange) increased by the amount of gain and decreased by the amount of loss recognized on the other property. For purposes of this rule, the taxpayer is deemed to have received in exchange for such other property an amount equal to its fair market value on the date of the exchange. The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example:
A exchanges real estate held for investment plus stock for real estate to be held for investment. The real estate transferred has an adjusted basis of $10,000 and a fair market value of $11,000. The stock transferred has an adjusted basis of $4,000 and a fair market value of $2,000. The real estate acquired has a fair market value of $13,000. A is deemed to have received a $2,000 portion of the acquired real estate in exchange for the stock, since $2,000 is the fair market value of the stock at the time of the exchange. A $2,000 loss is recognized under section 1002 on the exchange of the stock for real estate. No gain or loss is recognized on the exchange of the real estate since the property received is of the type permitted to be received without recognition of gain or loss. The basis of the real estate acquired by A is determined as follows:
Adjusted basis of real estate transferred
$10,000
Adjusted basis of stock transferred
4,000
14,000
Less: Loss recognized on transfer of stock
2,000
Basis of real estate acquired upon the exchange
12,000

If the properties exchanged under section 1031 are part of a group of assets which constitute a trade or business under section 1060, the like-kind property and other property or money which are treated as transferred in exchange for the like-kind property shall be excluded from the allocation rules of section 1060. However, section 1060 shall apply to property which is not like-kind property or other property or money which is treated as transferred in exchange for the like-kind property. For application of the section 1060 allocation rules to property which is not part of the like-kind exchange, see § 1.1060-1(b), (c), and (d)
Example 1 in § 1.338-6(b), to which reference is made by § 1.1060-1(c)(2).

§ 1.1031(d)-2
Treatment of assumption of liabilities.
For the purposes of section 1031(d), the amount of any liabilities of the taxpayer assumed by the other party to the exchange (or of any liabilities to which the property exchanged by the taxpayer is subject) is to be treated as money received by the taxpayer upon the exchange, whether or not the assumption resulted in a recognition of gain or loss to the taxpayer under the law applicable to the year in which the exchange was made. The application of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
B, an individual, owns an apartment house which has an adjusted basis in his hands of $500,000, but which is subject to a mortgage of $150,000. On September 1, 1954, he transfers the apartment house to C, receiving in exchange therefor $50,000 in cash and another apartment house with a fair market value on that date of $600,000. The transfer to C is made subject to the $150,000 mortgage. B realizes a gain of $300,000 on the exchange, computed as follows:
Value of property received
$600,000

# Example 2.
(a) D, an individual, owns an apartment house. On December 1, 1955, the apartment house owned by D has an adjusted basis in his hands of $100,000, a fair market value of $220,000, but is subject to a mortgage of $80,000. E, an individual, also owns an apartment house. On December 1, 1955, the apartment house owned by E has an adjusted basis of $175,000, a fair market value of $250,000, but is subject to a mortgage of $150,000. On December 1, 1955, D transfers his apartment house to E, receiving in exchange therefore $40,000 in cash and the apartment house owned by E. Each apartment house is transferred subject to the mortgage on it.
(b) D realizes a gain of $120,000 on the exchange, computed as follows:

other property or money
for purposes of section 1031(b).) Accordingly, under section 1031(b), $40,000 of the $120,000 gain is recognized. The basis of the apartment house acquired by D is $170,000, computed as follows:

(Consideration received by E in the form of a transfer subject to a liability of $150,000 is offset by consideration given in the form of a receipt of property subject to an $80,000 liability and by the $40,000 cash paid by E. Although consideration received in the form of cash or other property is not offset by consideration given in the form of an assumption of liabilities or a receipt of property subject to a liability, consideration given in the form of cash or other property is offset against consideration received in the form of an assumption of liabilities or a transfer of property subject to a liability.) Accordingly, under section 1031(b), $30,000 of the $75,000 gain is recognized. The basis of the apartment house acquired by E is $175,000, computed as follows:

§ 1.1031(j)-1
Exchanges of multiple properties.
(a)
Introduction
—(1)
Overview.
As a general rule, the application of section 1031 requires a property-by-property comparison for computing the gain recognized and basis of property received in a like-kind exchange. This section provides an exception to this general rule in the case of an exchange of multiple properties. An exchange is an exchange of multiple properties if, under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, more than one exchange group is created. In addition, an exchange is an exchange of multiple properties if only one exchange group is created but there is more than one property being transferred or received within that exchange group. Paragraph (b) of this section provides rules for computing the amount of gain recognized in an exchange of multiple properties qualifying for nonrecognition of gain or loss under section 1031. Paragraph (c) of this section provides rules for computing the basis of properties received in an exchange of multiple properties qualifying for nonrecognition of gain or loss under section 1031.
(2)
General approach.
(i) In general, the amount of gain recognized in an exchange of multiple properties is computed by first separating the properties transferred and the properties received by the taxpayer in the exchange into exchange groups in the manner described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. The separation of the properties transferred and the properties received in the exchange into exchange groups involves matching up properties of a like kind of like class to the extent possible. Next, all liabilities assumed by the taxpayer as part of the transaction are offset by all liabilities of which the taxpayer is relieved as part of the transaction, with the excess liabilities assumed or relieved allocated in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section. Then, the rules of section 1031 and the regulations thereunder are applied separately to each exchange group to determine the amount of gain recognized in the exchange. See §§ 1.1031(b)-1 and 1.1031(c)-1. Finally, the rules of section 1031 and the regulations thereunder are applied separately to each exchange group to determine the basis of the properties received in the exchange. See §§ 1.1031(d)-1 and 1.1031(d)-2.
(ii) For purposes of this section, the exchanges are assumed to be made at arms' length, so that the aggregate fair market value of the property received in the exchange equals the aggregate fair market value of the property transferred. Thus, the amount realized with respect to the properties transferred in each exchange group is assumed to equal their aggregate fair market value.
(b)
Computation of gain recognized
—(1)
In general.
In computing the amount of gain recognized in an exchange of multiple properties, the fair market value must be determined for each property transferred and for each property received by the taxpayer in the exchange. In addition, the adjusted basis must be determined for each property transferred by the taxpayer in the exchange.
(2)
Exchange groups and residual group.
The properties transferred and the properties received by the taxpayer in the exchange are separated into exchange groups and a residual group to the extent provided in this paragraph (b)(2).
(i)
Exchange groups.
Each exchange group consists of the properties transferred and received in the exchange, all of which are of a like kind or like class. If a property could be included in more than one exchange group, the taxpayer may include the property in any of those exchange groups. Property eligible for inclusion within an exchange group does not include money or property described in section 1031(a)(2) (i.e., stock in trade or other property held primarily for sale, stocks, bonds, notes,
other securities or evidences of indebtedness or interest, interests in a partnership, certificates of trust or beneficial interests, or choses in action). For example, an exchange group may consist of all exchanged properties that are within the same General Asset Class or within the same Product Class (as defined in § 1.1031(a)-2(b)). Each exchange group must consist of at least one property transferred and at least one property received in the exchange.
(ii)
Treatment of liabilities.
(A) All liabilities assumed by the taxpayer as part of the exchange are offset against all liabilities of which the taxpayer is relieved as part of the exchange, regardless of whether the liabilities are recourse or nonrecourse and regardless of whether the liabilities are secured by or otherwise relate to specific property transferred or received as part of the exchange. See §§ 1.1031 (b)-1(c) and 1.1031(d)-2. For purposes of this section, liabilities assumed by the taxpayer as part of the exchange consist of liabilities of the other party to the exchange assumed by the taxpayer and liabilities subject to which the other party's property is transferred in the exchange. Similarly, liabilities of which the taxpayer is relieved as part of the exchange consist of liabilities of the taxpayer assumed by the other party to the exchange and liabilities subject to which the taxpayer's property is transferred.
(B) If there are excess liabilities assumed by the taxpayer as part of the exchange (i.e., the amount of liabilities assumed by the taxpayer exceeds the amount of liabilities of which the taxpayer is relieved), the excess is allocated among the exchange groups (but not to the residual group) in proportion to the aggregate fair market value of the properties received by the taxpayer in the exchange groups. The amount of excess liabilities assumed by the taxpayer that are allocated to each exchange group may not exceed the aggregate fair market value of the properties received in the exchange group.
(C) If there are excess liabilities of which the taxpayer is relieved as part of the exchange (i.e., the amount of liabilities of which the taxpayer is relieved exceeds the amount of liabilities assumed by the taxpayer), the excess is treated as a Class I asset for purposes of making allocations to the residual group under paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section.
(D) Paragraphs (b)(2)(ii) (A), (B), and (C) of this section are applied in the same manner even if section 1031 and this section apply to only a portion of a larger transaction (such as a transaction described in section 1060(c) and § 1.1060-1T(b)). In that event, the amount of excess liabilities assumed by the taxpayer or the amount of excess liabilities of which the taxpayer is relieved is determined based on all liabilities assumed by the taxpayer and all liabilities of which the taxpayer is relieve as part of the larger transaction.
(iii)
Residual group.
If the aggregate fair market value of the properties transferred in all of the exchange groups differs from the aggregate fair market value of the properties received in all of the exchange groups (taking liabilities into account in the manner described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section), a residual group is created. The residual group consists of an amount of money or other property having an aggregate fair market value equal to that difference. The residual group consists of either money or other property transferred in the exchange or money or other property received in the exchange, but not both. For this purpose, other property includes property described in section 1031(a)(2) (i.e., stock in trade or other property held primarily for sale, stocks, bonds, notes, other securities or evidences of indebtedness or interest, interests in a partnership, certificates of trust or beneficial interests, or choses in action), property transferred that is not of a like kind or like class with any property received, and property received that is not of a like kind or like class with any property transferred. The money and properties that are allocated to the residual group are considered to come from the following assets in the following order: first from Class I assets, then from Class II assets, then from Class III assets, and then from Class IV assets. The terms Class I assets, Class II assets, Class III assets, and Class IV assets have the same
meanings as in § 1.338-6(b), to which reference is made by § 1.1060-1(c)(2). Within each Class, taxpayers may choose which properties are allocated to the residual group.
(iv)
Exchange group surplus and deficiency.
For each of the exchange groups described in this section, an “exchange group surplus” or “exchange group deficiency,” if any, must be determined. An exchange group surplus is the excess of the aggregate fair market value of the properties received (less the amount of any excess liabilities assumed by the taxpayer that are allocated to that exchange group), in an exchange group over the aggregate fair market value of the properties transferred in that exchange group. An exchange group deficiency is the excess of the aggregate fair market value of the properties transferred in an exchange group over the aggregate fair market value of the properties received (less the amount of any excess liabilities assumed by the taxpayer that are allocated to that exchange group) in that exchange group.
(3)
Amount of gain recognized.
(i) For purposes of this section, the amount of gain or loss realized with respect to each exchange group and the residual group is the difference between the aggregate fair market value of the properties transferred in that exchange group or residual group and the properties' aggregate adjusted basis. The gain realized with respect to each exchange group is recognized to the extent of the lesser of the gain realized and the amount of the exchange group deficiency, if any. Losses realized with respect to an exchange group are not recognized. See section 1031 (a) and (c). The total amount of gain recognized under section 1031 in the exchange is the sum of the amount of gain recognized with respect to each exchange group. With respect to the residual group, the gain or loss realized (as determined under this section) is recognized as provided in section 1001 or other applicable provision of the Code.
(ii) The amount of gain or loss realized and recognized with respect to properties transferred by the taxpayer that are not within any exchange group or the residual group is determined under section 1001 and other applicable provisions of the Code, with proper adjustments made for all liabilities not allocated to the exchange groups or the residual group.
(c)
Computation of basis of properties received.
In an exchange of multiple properties qualifying for nonrecognition of gain or loss under section 1031 and this section, the aggregate basis of properties received in each of the exchange groups is the aggregate adjusted basis of the properties transferred by the taxpayer within that exchange group, increased by the amount of gain recognized by the taxpayer with respect to that exchange group, increased by the amount of the exchange group surplus or decreased by the amount of the exchange group deficiency, and increased by the amount, if any, of excess liabilities assumed by the taxpayer that are allocated to that exchange group. The resulting aggregate basis of each exchange group is allocated proportionately to each property received in the exchange group in accordance with its fair market value. The basis of each property received within the residual group (other than money) is equal to its fair market value.
(d)
Examples.
The application of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
(i) K exchanges computer A (asset class 00.12) and automobile A (asset class 00.22), both of which were held by K for productive use in its business, with W for printer B (asset class 00.12) and automobile B (asset class 00.22), both of which will be held by K for productive use in its business. K's adjusted basis and the fair market value of the exchanged properties are as follows:
Adjusted basis
Fair market value
Computer A
$375
$1,000
Automobile A
1,500
4,000
Printer B
2,050
Automobile B
2,950
(ii) Under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the properties exchanged are separated into exchange groups as follows:
(A) The first exchange group consists of computer A and printer B (both are within the same General Asset Class) and, as to K, has an exchange group surplus of $1050 because the fair market value of printer B ($2050) exceeds the fair market value of computer A ($1000) by that amount.
(B) The second exchange group consists of automobile A and automobile B (both are within the same General Asset Class) and, as to K, has an exchange group deficiency of $1050 because the fair market value of automobile A ($4000) exceeds the fair market value of automobile B ($2950) by that amount.
(iii) K recognizes gain on the exchange as follows:
(A) With respect to the first exchange group, the amount of gain realized is the excess of the fair market value of computer A ($1000) over its adjusted basis ($375), or $625. The amount of gain recognized is the lesser of the gain realized ($625) and the exchange group deficiency ($0), or $0.
(B) With respect to the second exchange group, the amount of gain realized is the excess of the fair market value of automobile A ($4000) over its adjusted basis ($1500), or $2500. The amount of gain recognized is the lesser of the gain realized ($2500) and the exchange group deficiency ($1050), or $1050.
(iv) The total amount of gain recognized by K in the exchange is the sum of the gains recognized with respect to both exchange groups ($0 + $1050), or $1050.
(v) The bases of the property received by K in the exchange, printer B and automobile B, are determined in the following manner:
(A) The basis of the property received in the first exchange group is the adjusted basis of the property transferred within the exchange group ($375), increased by the amount of gain recognized with respect to that exchange group ($0), increased by the amount of the exchange group surplus ($1050), and increased by the amount of excess liabilities assumed allocated to that exchange group ($0), or $1425. Because printer B was the only property received within the first exchange group, the entire basis of $1425 is allocated to printer B.
(B) The basis of the property received in the second exchange group is the adjusted basis of the property transferred within that exchange group ($1500), increased by the amount of gain recognized with respect to that exchange group ($1050), decreased by the amount of the exchange group deficiency ($1050), and increased by the amount of excess liabilities assumed allocated to that exchange group ($0), or $1500. Because automobile B was the only property received within the second exchange group, the entire basis of $1500 is allocated to automobile B.

# Example 2.
(i) F exchanges computer A (asset class 00.12) and automobile A (asset class 00.22), both of which were held by F for productive use in its business, with G for printer B (asset class 00.12) and automobile B (asset class 00.22), both of which will be held by F for productive use in its business, and corporate stock and $500 cash. The adjusted basis and fair market value of the properties are as follows:
Adjusted basis
Fair market value
Computer A
$375
$1,000
Automobile A
3,500
4,000
Printer B
800
Automobile B
2,950
Corporate stock
750
Cash
500
(ii) Under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the properties exchanged are separated into exchange groups as follows:
(A) The first exchange group consists of computer A and printer B (both are within the same General Asset Class) and, as to F, has an exchange group deficiency of $200 because the fair market value of computer A ($1000) exceeds the fair market value of printer B ($800) by that amount.
(B) The second exchange group consists of automobile A and automobile B (both are within the same General Asset Class) and, as to F, has an exchange group deficiency of $1050 because the fair market value of automobile A ($4000) exceeds the fair market value of automobile B ($2950) by that amount.
(C) Because the aggregate fair market value of the properties transferred by F in the exchange groups ($5,000) exceeds the aggregate fair market value of the properties received by F in the exchange groups ($3750) by $1250, there is a residual group in that amount consisting of the $500 cash and the $750 worth of corporate stock.
(iii) F recognizes gain on the exchange as follows:
(A) With respect to the first exchange group, the amount of gain realized is the excess of the fair market value of computer A ($1000) over its adjusted basis ($375), or $625. The amount of gain recognized is the lesser of the gain realized ($625) and the exchange group deficiency ($200), or $200.
(B) With respect to the second exchange group, the amount of gain realized is the excess of the fair market value of automobile A ($4000) over its adjusted basis ($3500), or $500. The amount of gain recognized is the lesser of the gain realized ($500) and the exchange group deficiency ($1050), or $500.
(C) No property transferred by F was allocated to the residual group. Therefore, F does not recognize gain or loss with respect to the residual group.
(iv) The total amount of gain recognized by F in the exchange is the sum of the gains recognized with respect to both exchange groups ($200 + $500), or $700.
(v) The bases of the properties received by F in the exchange (printer B, automobile B, and the corporate stock) are determined in the following manner:
(A) The basis of the property received in the first exchange group is the adjusted basis of the property transferred within that exchange group ($375), increased by the amount
of gain recognized with respect to that exchange group ($200), decreased by the amount of the exchange group deficiency ($200), and increased by the amount of excess liabilities assumed allocated to that exchange group ($0), or $375. Because printer B was the only property received within the first exchange group, the entire basis of $375 is allocated to printer B.
(B) The basis of the property received in the second exchange group is the adjusted basis of the property transferred within that exchange group ($3500), increased by the amount of gain recognized with respect to that exchange group ($500), decreased by the amount of the exchange group deficiency ($1050), and increased by the amount of excess liabilities assumed allocated to that exchange group ($0), or $2950. Because automobile B was the only property received within the second exchange group, the entire basis of $2950 is allocated to automobile B.
(C) The basis of the property received within the residual group (the corporate stock) is equal to its fair market value or $750. Cash of $500 is also received within the residual group.

(ii) Under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the properties exchanged are separated into exchange groups as follows:
(A) The first exchange group consists of computer A, computer B, printer C, computer Z, and printer Y (all are within the same General Asset Class) and, as to J, has an exchange group deficiency of $2500 (($5000 + $3000 + $1500) − ($4500 + $2500)).
(B) The second exchange group consists of real estate D, E, X and W (all are of a like kind) and, as to J, has an exchange group surplus of $1200 (($1000 + $4000) − ($2000 + $1800)).
(C) The third exchange group consists of scraper F and grader V (both are within the same Product Class (NAICS code 333120)) and, as to J, has an exchange group deficiency of $500 ($2500 − $2000).
(D) Because the aggregate fair market value of the properties transferred by J in the exchange groups ($15,800) exceeds the aggregate fair market value of the properties received by J in the exchange groups ($14,000) by $1800, there is a residual group in that amount consisting of the $1800 cash (a Class I asset).
(E) The transaction also includes a taxable exchange of inventory (which is property described in section 1031 (a)(2)) for truck T (which is not of a like kind or like class to any property transferred in the exchange).
(iii) J recognizes gain on the transaction as follows:
(A) With respect to the first exchange group, the amount of gain realized is the excess of the aggregate fair market value of the properties transferred in the exchange group ($9500) over the aggregate adjusted basis ($4000), or $5500. The amount of gain recognized is the lesser of the gain realized ($5500) and the exchange group deficiency ($2500), or $2500.
(B) With respect to the second exchange group, the amount of gain realized is the excess of the aggregate fair market value of the properties transferred in the exchange group ($3800) over the aggregate adjusted basis ($1200), or $2600. The amount of gain recognized is the lesser of the gain realized ($2600) and the exchange group deficiency ($0), or $0.
(C) With respect to the third exchange group, a loss is realized in the amount of $800 because the fair market value of the property transferred in the exchange group ($2500) is less than its adjusted basis ($3300). Although a loss of $800 was realized, under section 1031 (a) and (c) losses are not recognized.
(D) No property transferred by J was allocated to the residual group. Therefore, J does not recognize gain or loss with respect to the residual group.
(E) With respect to the taxable exchange of inventory for truck T, gain of $700 is realized and recognized by J (amount realized of $1700
(the fair market value of truck T) less the adjusted basis of the inventory ($1000)).
(iv) The total amount of gain recognized by J in the transaction is the sum of the gains recognized under section 1031 with respect to each exchange group ($2500 + $0 + $0) and any gain recognized outside of section 1031 ($700), or $3200.
(v) The bases of the property received by J in the exchange are determined in the following manner:
(A) The aggregate basis of the properties received in the first exchange group is the adjusted basis of the properties transferred within that exchange group ($4000), increased by the amount of gain recognized with respect to that exchange group ($2500), decreased by the amount of the exchange group deficiency ($2500), and increased by the amount of excess liabilities assumed allocated to that exchange group ($0), or $4000. This $4000 of basis is allocated proportionately among the assets received within the first exchange group in accordance with their fair market values: Computer Z's basis is $2571 ($4000 × $4500/$7000); printer Y's basis is $1429 ($4000 × $2500/$7000).
(B) The aggregate basis of the properties received in the second exchange group is the adjusted basis of the properties transferred within that exchange group ($1200), increased by the amount of gain recognized with respect to that exchange group ($0), increased by the amount of the exchange group surplus ($1200), and increased by the amount of excess liabilities assumed allocated to that exchange group ($0), or $2400. This $2400 of basis is allocated proportionately among the assets received within the second exchange group in accordance with their fair market values: Real estate X's basis is $480 ($2400 × $1000/$5000); real estate W's basis is $1920 ($2400 × $4000/$5000).
(c) The basis of the property received in the third exchange group is the adjusted basis of the property transferred within that exchange group ($3300), increased by the amount of gain recognized with respect to that exchange group ($0), decreased by the amount of the exchange group deficiency ($500), and increased by the amount of excess liabilities assumed allocated to that exchange group ($0), or $2800. Because grader V was the only property received within the third exchange group, the entire basis of $2800 is allocated to grader V.
(D) Cash of $1800 is received within the residual group.
(E) The basis of the property received in the taxable exchange (truck T) is equal to its cost of $1700.

# Example 4.
(i) B exchanges computer A (asset class 00.12), automobile A (asset class 00.22) and truck A (asset class 00.241), with C for computer R (asset class 00.12), automobile R (asset class 00.22), truck R (asset class 00.241) and $400 cash. All properties transferred by either B or C were held for productive use in the respective transferor's business. Similarly, all properties to be received by either B or C will be held for productive use in the respective recipient's business. Automobile A, automobile R and truck R are each secured by a nonrecourse liability and are transferred subject to such liability. The adjusted basis, fair market value, and liability secured by each property, if any, are as follows:
Adjusted basis

(ii) The tax treatment to B is as follows:
(A)(
1
) The first exchange group consists of computers A and R (both are within the same General Asset Class).
(
2
) The second exchange group consists of automobiles A and R (both are within the same General Asset Class).
(
3
) The third exchange group consists of trucks A and R (both are in the same General Asset Class).
(B) Under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, all liabilities assumed by B ($1000) are offset by all liabilities of which B is relieved ($500), resulting in excess liabilities assumed of $500. The excess liabilities assumed of $500 is allocated among the exchange groups in proportion to the fair market value of the properties received by B in the exchange groups as follows:
(
1
) $131 of excess liabilities assumed ($500 × $1600/$6100) is allocated to the first exchange group. The first exchange group has an exchange group deficiency of $31 because the fair market value of computer A ($1500) exceeds the fair market value of computer R less the excess liabilities assumed allocated to the exchange group ($1600-$131) by that amount.
(
2
) $254 of excess liabilities assumed ($500 × $3100/$6100) is allocated to the second exchange group. The second exchange group has an exchange group surplus of $346 because the fair market value of automobile R less the excess liabilities assumed allocated to the exchange group ($3100-$254) exceeds the fair market value of automobile A ($2500) by that amount.
(
3
) $115 of excess liabilities assumed ($500 × $1400/$6100) is allocated to the third exchange group. The third exchange group has an exchange group deficiency of $715 because the fair market value of truck A ($2000) exceeds
the fair market value of truck R less the excess liabilities assumed allocated to the exchange group ($1400-$115) by that amount.
(
4
) The difference between the aggregate fair market value of the properties transferred in all of the exchange groups, $6000, and the aggregate fair market value of the properties received in all of the exchange groups (taking excess liabilities assumed into account), $5600, is $400. Therefore there is a residual group in that amount consisting of $400 cash received.
(C) B recognizes gain on the exchange as follows:
(
1
) With respect to the first exchange group, the amount of gain realized is the excess of the fair market value of computer A ($1500) over its adjusted basis ($800), or $700. The amount of gain recognized is the lesser of the gain realized ($700) and the exchange group deficiency ($31), or $31.
(
2
) With respect to the second exchange group, the amount of gain realized is the excess of the fair market value of automobile A ($2500) over its adjusted basis ($900), or $1600.
The amount of gain recognized is the lesser of the gain realized ($1600) and the exchange group deficiency ($0), or $0.
(
3
) With respect to the third exchange group, the amount of gain realized is the excess of the fair market value of truck A ($2000) over its adjusted basis ($700), or $1300. The amount of gain recognized is the lesser of gain realized ($1300) and the exchange group deficiency ($715), or $715.
(
4
) No property transferred by B was allocated to the residual group. Therefore, B does not recognize gain or loss with respect to the residual group.
(D) The total amount of gain recognized by B in the exchange is the sum of the gains recognized under section 1031 with respect to each exchange group ($31 + $0 + $715), or $746.
(E) the bases of the property received by B in the exchange (computer R, automobile R, and truck R) are determined in the following manner:
(
1
) The basis of the property received in the first exchange group is the adjusted basis of the property transferred within that exchange group ($800), increased by the amount of gain recognized with respect to that exchange group ($31), decreased by the amount of the exchange group deficiency ($31), and increased by the amount of excess liabilities assumed allocated to that exchange group ($131), or $931. Because computer R was the only property received within the first exchange group, the entire basis of $931 is allocated to computer R.
(
2
) The basis of the property received in the second exchange group is the adjusted basis of the property transferred within that exchange group ($900), increased by the amount of gain recognized with respect to that exchange group ($0), increased by the amount of the exchange group surplus ($346), and increased by the amount of excess liabilities assumed allocated to that exchange group ($254), or $1500. Because automobile R was the only property received within the second exchange group, the entire basis of $1500 is allocated to automobile R.
(
3
) The basis of the property received in the third exchange group is the adjusted basis of the property transferred within that exchange group ($700), increased by the amount of gain recognized with respect to that exchange group ($715), decreased by the amount of the exchange group deficiency ($715), and increased by the amount of excess liabilities assumed allocated to that exchange group ($115), or $815. Because truck R was the only property received within the third exchange group, the entire basis of $815 is allocated to truck R.
(F) Cash of $400 is also received by B.
(iii) The tax treatment to C is as follows:
(A) (
1
) The first exchange group consists of computers R and A (both are within the same General Asset Class).
(
2
) The second exchange group consists of automobiles R and A (both are within the same General Asset Class).
(
3
) The third exchange group consists of trucks R and A (both are in the same General Asset Class).
(B) Under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, all liabilities of which C is relieved ($1000) are offset by all liabilities assumed by C ($500), resulting in excess liabilities relieved of $500. This excess liabilities relieved is treated as cash received by C.
(
1
) The first exchange group has an exchange group deficiency of $100 because the fair market value of computer R ($1600) exceeds the fair market value of computer A ($1500) by that amount.
(
2
) The second exchange group has an exchange group deficiency of $600 because the fair market value of automobile R ($3100) exceeds the fair market value of automobile A ($2500) by that amount.
(
3
) The third exchange group has an exchange group surplus of $600 because the fair market value of truck A ($2000) exceeds the fair market value of truck R ($1400) by that amount.
(
4
) The difference between the aggregate fair market value of the properties transferred by C in all of the exchange groups, $6100, and the aggregate fair market value of the properties received by C in all of the exchange groups, $6000, is $100. Therefore, there is a residual group in that amount, consisting of excess liabilities relieved of $100, which is treated as cash received by C.
(
5
) The $400 cash paid by C and $400 of the excess liabilities relieved which is treated as cash received by C are not within the exchange groups of the residual group.
(C) C recognizes gain on the exchange as follows:
(
1
) With respect to the first exchange group, the amount of gain realized is the excess of the fair market value of computer R ($1600) over its adjusted basis ($1100), or $500. The amount of gain recognized is the lesser of the gain realized ($500) and the exchange group deficiency ($100), or $100.
(
2
) With respect to the second exchange group, the amount of gain realized is the excess of the fair market value of automobile R ($3100) over its adjusted basis ($2100), or $1000. The amount of gain recognized is the lesser of the gain realized ($1000) and the exchange group deficiency ($600), or $600.
(
3
) With respect to the third exchange group, the amount of gain realized is the excess of the fair market value of truck R ($1400) over its adjusted basis ($600), or $800. The amount of gain recognized is the lesser of gain realized ($800) and the exchange group deficiency ($0), or $0.
(
4
) No property transferred by C was allocated to the residual group. Therefore, C does not recognize any gain with respect to the residual group.
(D) The total amount of gain recognized by C in the exchange is the sum of the gains recognized under section 1031 with respect to each exchange group ($100 + $600 + $0), or $700.
(E) The bases of the properties received by C in the exchange (computer A, automobile A, and truck A) are determined in the following manner:
(
1
) The basis of the property received in the first exchange group is the adjusted basis of the property transferred within that exchange group ($1100), increased by the amount of gain recognized with respect to that exchange group ($100), decreased by the amount of the exchange group deficiency ($100), and increased by the amount of excess liabilities assumed allocated to that exchange group ($0), or $1100. Because computer A was the only property received within the first exchange group, the entire basis of $1100 is allocated to computer A.
(
2
) The basis of the property received in the second exchange group is the adjusted basis of the property transferred within that exchange group ($2100), increased by the amount of gain recognized with respect to that exchange group ($600), decreased by the amount of the exchange group deficiency ($600), and increased by the amount of excess liabilities assumed allocated to that exchange group ($0), or $2100. Because automobile A was the only property received within the second exchange group, the entire basis of $2100 is allocated to automobile A.
(
3
) The basis of the property received in the third exchange group is the adjusted basis of the property transferred within that exchange group ($600), increased by the amount of gain recognized with respect to that exchange group ($0), increased by the amount of the exchange group surplus ($600), and increased by the amount of excess liabilities assumed allocated to that exchange group ($0), or $1200. Because truck A was the only property received within the third exchange group, the entire basis of $1200 is allocated to truck A.

# Example 5.
(i) U exchanges real estate A, real estate B, and grader A (NAICS code 333120) with V for real estate R and railroad car R (General Asset Class 00.25). All properties transferred by either U or V were held for productive use in the respective transferor's business. Similarly, all properties to be received by either U or V will be held for productive use in the respective recipient's business. Real estate R is secured by a recourse liability and is transferred subject to that liability. The adjusted basis, fair market value, and liability secured by each property, if any, are as follows:
Adjusted basis
Fair market value
Liability
U Transfers:
Real Estate A
$2000
$5000
Real Estate B
8000
13,500
Grader A
500
2000
V Transfers:
Real Estate R
$20,000
$26,500
$7000
Railroad car R
1200
1000
(ii) The tax treatment to U is as follows:
(A) The exchange group consists of real estate A, real estate B, and real estate R.
(B) Under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, all liabilities assumed by U ($7000) are excess liabilities assumed. The excess liabilities assumed of $7000 is allocated to the exchange group.
(
1
) The exchange group has an exchange group surplus of $1000 because the fair market value of real estate R less the excess liabilities assumed allocated to the exchange group ($26,500-$7000) exceeds the aggregate fair market value of real estate A and B ($18,500) by that amount.
(
2
) The difference between the aggregate fair market value of the properties received in the exchange group (taking excess liabilities assumed into account), $19,500, and the aggregate fair market value of the properties transferred in the exchange group, $18,500, is $1000. Therefore, there is a residual group in that amount consisting of $1000 (or 50 percent of the fair market value) of grader A.
(
3
) The transaction also includes a taxable exchange of the 50 percent portion of grader A not allocated to the residual group (which is not of a like kind or like class to any property received by U in the exchange) for railroad car R (which is not of a like kind or like class to any property transferred by U in the exchange).
(C) U recognizes gain on the exchange as follows:
(
1
) With respect to the exchange group, the amount of the gain realized is the excess of
the aggregate fair market value of real estate A and B ($18,500) over the aggregate adjusted basis ($10,000), or $8500. The amount of the gain recognized is the lesser of the gain realized ($8500) and the exchange group deficiency ($0), or $0.
(
2
) With respect to the residual group, the amount of gain realized and recognized is the excess of the fair market value of the 50 percent portion of grader A that is allocated to the residual group ($1000) over its adjusted basis ($250), or $750.
(
3
) With respect to the taxable exchange of the 50 percent portion of grader A not allocated to the residual group for railroad car R, gain of $750 is realized and recognized by U (amount realized of $1000 (the fair market value of railroad car R) less the adjusted basis of the 50 percent portion of grader A not allocated to the residual group ($250)).
(D) The total amount of gain recognized by U in the transaction is the sum of the gain recognized under section 1031 with respect to the exchange group ($0), any gain recognized with respect to the residual group ($750), and any gain recognized with respect to property transferred that is not in the exchange group or the residual group ($750), or $1500.
(E) The bases of the property received by U in the exchange (real estate R and railroad car R) are determined in the following manner:
(
1
) The basis of the property received in the exchange group is the aggregate adjusted basis of the property transferred within that exchange group ($10,000), increased by the amount of gain recognized with respect to that exchange group ($0), increased by the amount of the exchange group surplus ($1000), and increased by the amount of excess liabilities assumed allocated to that exchange group ($7000), or $18,000. Because real estate R is the only property received within the exchange group, the entire basis of $18,000 is allocated to real estate R.
(
2
) The basis of railroad car R is equal to its cost of $1000.
(iii) The tax treatment to V is as follows:
(A) The exchange group consists of real estate R, real estate A, and real estate B.
(B) Under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, the liabilities of which V is relieved ($7000) results in excess liabilities relieved of $7000 and is treated as cash received by V.
(
1
) The exchange group has an exchange group deficiency of $8000 because the fair market value of real estate R ($26,500) exceeds the aggregate fair market value of real estate A and B ($18,500) by that amount.
(
2
) The difference between the aggregate fair market value of the properties transferred by V in the exchange group, $26,500, and the aggregate fair market value of the properties received by V in the exchange group, $18,500, is $8000. Therefore, there is a residual group in that amount, consisting of the excess liabilities relieved of $7000, which is treated as cash received by V, and $1000 (or 50 percent of the fair market value) of grader A.
(
3
) The transaction also includes a taxable exchange of railroad car R (which is not of a like kind or like class to any property received by V in the exchange) for the 50 percent portion of grader A (which is not of a like kind or like class to any property transferred by V in the exchange) not allocated to the residual group.
(C) V recognizes gain on the exchange as follows:
(
1
) With respect to the exchange group, the amount of the gain realized is the excess of the fair market value of real estate R ($26,500) over its adjusted basis ($20,000), or $6500. The amount of the gain recognized is the lesser of the gain realized ($6500) and the exchange group deficiency ($8000), or $6500.
(
2
) No property transferred by V was allocated to the residual group. Therefore, V does not recognize gain or loss with respect to the residual group.
(
3
) With respect to the taxable exchange of railroad car R for the 50 percent portion of grader A not allocated to the exchange group or the residual group, a loss is realized and recognized in the amount of $200 (the excess of the $1200 adjusted basis of railroad car R over the amount realized of $1000 (fair market value of the 50 percent portion of grader A)).
(D) The basis of the property received by V in the exchange (real estate A, real estate B, and grader A) are determined in the following manner:
(
1
) The basis of the property received in the exchange group is the adjusted basis of the property transferred within that exchange group ($20,000), increased by the amount of gain recognized with respect to that exchange group ($6500), and decreased by the amount of the exchange group deficiency ($8000), or $18,500. This $18,500 of basis is allocated proportionately among the assets received within the exchange group in accordance with their fair market values: real estate A's basis is $5000 ($18,500 × $5000/$18,500); real estate B's basis is $13,500 ($18,500 × $13,500/$18,500).
(
2
) The basis of grader A is $2000.

Effective date.
Section 1.1031 (j)-1 is effective for exchanges occurring on or after April 11, 1991.
[T.D. 8343, 56 FR 14855, Apr. 12, 1991, as amended by T.D. 8858, 65 FR 1237, Jan. 7, 2000; T.D. 8940, 66 FR 9929, Feb. 13, 2001; T.D. 9202, 70 FR 28820, May 19, 2005]
§ 1.1031(k)-1
Treatment of deferred exchanges.
(a)
Overview.
This section provides rules for the application of section 1031 and the regulations thereunder in the
case of a “deferred exchange.” For purposes of section 1031 and this section, a deferred exchange is defined as an exchange in which, pursuant to an agreement, the taxpayer transfers property held for productive use in a trade or business or for investment (the “relinquished property”) and subsequently receives property to be held either for productive use in a trade or business or for investment (the “replacement property”). In the case of a deferred exchange, if the requirements set forth in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section (relating to identification and receipt of replacement property) are not satisfied, the replacement property received by the taxpayer will be treated as property which is not of a like kind to the relinquished property. In order to constitute a deferred exchange, the transaction must be an exchange (i.e., a transfer of property for property, as distinguished from a transfer of property for money). For example, a sale of property followed by a purchase of property of a like kind does not qualify for nonrecognition of gain or loss under section 1031 regardless of whether the identification and receipt requirements of section 1031(a)(3) and paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section are satisfied. The transfer of relinquished property in a deferred exchange is not within the provisions of section 1031(a) if, as part of the consideration, the taxpayer receives money or property which does not meet the requirements of section 1031(a), but the transfer, if otherwise qualified, will be within the provisions of either section 1031 (b) or (c). See § 1.1031(a)-1(a)(2). In addition, in the case of a transfer of relinquished property in a deferred exchange, gain or loss may be recognized if the taxpayer actually or constructively receives money or property which does not meet the requirements of section 1031(a) before the taxpayer actually receives like-kind replacement property. If the taxpayer actually or constructively receives money or property which does not meet the requirements of section 1031(a) in the full amount of the consideration for the relinquished property, the transaction will constitute a sale, and not a deferred exchange, even though the taxpayer may ultimately receive like-kind replacement property. For purposes of this section, property which does not meet the requirements of section 1031(a) (whether by being described in section 1031(a)(2) or otherwise) is referred to as “other property.” For rules regarding actual and constructive receipt, and safe harbors therefrom, see paragraphs (f) and (g), respectively, of this section. For rules regarding the determination of gain or loss recognized and the basis of property received in a deferred exchange, see paragraph (j) of this section.
(b)
Identification and receipt requirements
—(1)
In general.
In the case of a deferred exchange, any replacement property received by the taxpayer will be treated as property which is not of a like kind to the relinquished property if—
(i) The replacement property is not “identified” before the end of the “identification period,” or
(ii) The identified replacement property is not received before the end of the “exchange period.”
(2)
Identification period and exchange period.
(i) The identification period begins on the date the taxpayer transfers the relinquished property and ends at midnight on the 45th day thereafter.
(ii) The exchange period begins on the date the taxpayer transfers the relinquished property and ends at midnight on the earlier of the 180th day thereafter or the due date (including extensions) for the taxpayer's return of the tax imposed by chapter 1 of subtitle A of the Code for the taxable year in which the transfer of the relinquished property occurs.
(iii) If, as part of the same deferred exchange, the taxpayer transfers more than one relinquished property and the relinquished properties are transferred on different dates, the identification period and the exchange period are determined by reference to the earliest date on which any of the properties are transferred.
(iv) For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2), property is transferred when the property is disposed of within the meaning of section 1001(a).
(3)
Example.
This paragraph (b) may be illustrated by the following example.

# Example:
(i) M is a corporation that files its Federal income tax return on a calendar year basis. M and C enter into an agreement for an exchange of property that requires M to transfer property X to C. Under the agreement, M is to identify like-kind replacement property which C is required to purchase and to transfer to M. M transfers property X to C on November 16, 1992.
(ii) The identification period ends at midnight on December 31, 1992, the day which is 45 days after the date of transfer of property X. The exchange period ends at midnight on March 15, 1993, the due date for M's Federal income tax return for the taxable year in which M transferred property X. However, if M is allowed the automatic six-month extension for filing its tax return, the exchange period ends at midnight on May 15, 1993, the day which is 180 days after the date of transfer of property X.
(c)
Identification of replacement property before the end of the identification period
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section (relating to the identification requirement), replacement property is identified before the end of the identification period only if the requirements of this paragraph (c) are satisfied with respect to the replacement property. However, any replacement property that is received by the taxpayer before the end of the identification period will in all events be treated as identified before the end of the identification period.
(2)
Manner of identifying replacement property.
Replacement property is identified only if it is designated as replacement property in a written document signed by the taxpayer and hand delivered, mailed, telecopied, or otherwise sent before the end of the identification period to either—
(i) The person obligated to transfer the replacement property to the taxpayer (regardless of whether that person is a disqualified person as defined in paragraph (k) of this section); or
(ii) Any other person involved in the exchange other than the taxpayer or a disqualified person (as defined in paragraph (k) of this section).
Examples of persons involved in the exchange include any of the parties to the exchange, an intermediary, an escrow agent, and a title company. An identification of replacement property made in a written agreement for the exchange of properties signed by all parties thereto before the end of the identification period will be treated as satisfying the requirements of this paragraph (c)(2).
(3)
Description of replacement property.
Replacement property is identified only if it is unambiguously described in the written document or agreement. Real property generally is unambiguously described if it is described by a legal description, street address, or distinguishable name (e.g., the Mayfair Apartment Building). Personal property generally is unambiguously described if it is described by a specific description of the particular type of property. For example, a truck generally is unambigously described if it is described by a specific make, model, and year.
(4)
Alternative and multiple properties.
(i) The taxpayer may identify more than one replacement property. Regardless of the number of relinguished properties transferred by the taxpayer as part of the same deferred exchange, the maximum number of replacement properties that the taxpayer may identify is—
(A) Three properties without regard to the fair market values of the properties (the “3-property rule”), or
(B) Any number of properties as long as their aggregate fair market value as of the end of the identification period does not exceed 200 percent of the aggregate fair market value of all the relinguished properties as of the date the relinguished properties were transferred by the taxpayer (the “200-percent rule”).
(ii) If, as of the end of the identification period, the taxpayer has identified more properties as replacement properties than permitted by paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, the taxpayer is treated as if no replacement property had been identified. The preceding sentence will not apply, however, and an identification satisfying the requirements of paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section will be considered made, with respect to—
(A) Any replacement property received by the taxpayer before the end of the identification period, and
(B) Any replacement property identified before the end of the identification period and received before the end of the exchange period, but only if the
taxpayer receives before the end of the exchange period identified replacement property the fair market vlaue of which is at least 95 percent of the aggregate fair market value of all identified replacement properties (the “95-percent rule”).
For this purpose, the fair market value of each identified replacement property is determined as of the earlier of the date the property is received by the taxpayer or the last day of the exchange period.
(iii) For purposes of applying the 3-property rule, the 200-percent rule, and the 95-percent rule, all identifications of replacement property, other than identifications of replacement property that have been revoked in the manner provided in paragraph (c)(6) of this section, are taken into account. For example, if, in a deferred exchange, B transfers property X with a fair market value of $100,000 to C and B receives like-kind property Y with a fair market value of $50,000 before the end of the identification period, under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, property Y is treated as identified by reason of being received before the end of the identification period. Thus, under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, B may identify either two additional replacement properties of any fair market value or any number of additional replacement properties as long as the aggregate fair market value of the additional replacement properties does not exceed $150,000.
(5)
Incidental property disregarded.
(i) Solely for purposes of applying this paragraph (c), property that is incidental to a larger item of property is not treated as property that is separate from the larger item of property. Property is incidental to a larger item of property if—
(A) In standard commercial transactions, the property is typically transferred together with the larger item of property, and
(B) The aggregate fair market value of all of the incidental property does not exceed 15 percent of the aggregate fair market value of the larger item of property.
(ii) This paragraph (c)(5) may be illustrated by the following examples.

# Example 1.
For purposes of paragraph (c) of this section, a spare tire and tool kit will not be treated as separate property from a truck with a fair market value of $10,000, if the aggregate fair market value of the spare tire and tool kit does not exceed $1,500. For purposes of the 3-property rule, the truck, spare tire, and tool kit are treated as 1 property. Moreover, for purposes of paragraph (c)(3) of this section (relating to the description of replacement property), the truck, spare tire, and tool kit are all considered to be unambiguously described if the make, model, and year of the truck are specified, even if no reference is made to the spare tire and tool kit.

# Example 2.
For purposes of paragraph (c) of this section, furniture, laundry machines, and other miscellaneous items of personal property will not be treated as separate property from an apartment building with a fair market value of $1,000,000, if the aggregate fair market value of the furniture, laundry machines, and other personal property does not exceed $150,000. For purposes of the 3-property rule, the apartment building, furniture, laundry machines, and other personal property are treated as 1 property. Moreover, for purposes of paragraph (c)(3) of this section (relating to the description of replacement property), the apartment building, furniture, laundry machines, and other personal property are all considered to be unambiguously described if the legal description, street address, or distinguishable name of the apartment building is specified, even if no reference is made to the furniture, laundry machines, and other personal property.
(6)
Revocation of identification.
An identification of replacement property may be revoked at any time before the end of the identification period. An identification of replacement property is revoked only if the revocation is made in a written document signed by the taxpayer and hand delivered, mailed, telecopied, or othewise sent before the end of the identification period to the person to whom the identification of the replacement property was sent. An identification of replacement property that is made in a written agreement for the exchange of properties is treated as revoked only if the revocation is made in a written amendment to the agreement or in a written document signed by the taxpayer and hand delivered, mailed, telecopied, or othewise sent before the end of the identification period to all of the parties to the agreement.
(7)
Examples.
This paragraph (c) may be illustrated by the following examples. Unless otherwise provided in an
example, the following facts are assumed: B, a calendar year taxpayer, and C agree to enter into a deferred exchange. Pursuant to their agreement, B transfers real property X to C on May 17, 1991. Real property X, which has been held by B for investment, is unencumbered and has a fair market value on May 17, 1991, of $100,000. On or before July 1, 1991 (the end of the identification period), B is to identify replacement property that is of a like kind to real property X. On or before November 13, 1991 (the end of the exchange period), C is required to purchase the property identified by B and to transfer that property to B. To the extent the fair market value of the replacement property transferred to B is greater or less than the fair market value of real property X, either B or C, as applicable, will make up the difference by paying cash to the other party after the date the replacement property is received by B. No replacement property is identified in the agreement. When subsequently identified, the replacement property is described by legal description and is of a like kind to real property X (determined without regard to section 1031(a)(3) and this section). B intends to hold the replacement property received for investment.

# Example 1.
(i) On July 2, 1991, B identifies real property E as replacement property by designating real property E as replacement property in a written document signed by B and personally delivered to C.
(ii) Because the identification was made after the end of the identification period, pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section (relating to the identification requirement), real property E is treated as property which is not of a like kind to real property X.

# Example 2.
(i) C is a corporation of which 20 percent of the outstanding stock is owned by B. On July 1, 1991, B identifies real property F as replacement property by designating real property F as replacement property in a written document signed by B and mailed to C.
(ii) Because C is the person obligated to transfer the replacement property to B, real property F is identified before the end of the identification period. The fact that C is a “disqualified person” as defined in paragraph (k) of this section does not change this result.
(iii) Real property F would also have been treated as identified before the end of the identification period if, instead of sending the identification to C, B had designated real property F as replacement property in a written agreement for the exchange of properties signed by all parties thereto on or before July 1, 1991.

# Example 3.
(i) On June 3, 1991, B identifies the replacement property as “unimproved land located in Hood County with a fair market value not to exceed $100,000.” The designation is made in a written document signed by B and personally delivered to C. On July 8, 1991, B and C agree that real property G is the property described in the June 3, 1991 document.
(ii) Because real property G was not unambiguously described before the end of the identification period, no replacement property is identified before the end of the identification period.

# Example 4.
(i) On June 28, 1991, B identifies real properties H, J, and K as replacement properties by designating these properties as replacement properties in a written document signed by B and personally delivered to C. The written document provides that by August 1, 1991, B will orally inform C which of the identified properties C is to transfer to B. As of July 1, 1991, the fair market values of real properties H, J, and K are $75,000, $100,000, and $125,000, respectively.
(ii) Because B did not identify more than three properties as replacement properties, the requirements of the 3-property rule are satisfied, and real properties H, J, and K are all identified before the end of the identification period.

# Example 5.
(i) On May 17, 1991, B identifies real properties L, M, N, and P as replacement properties by designating these properties as replacement properties in a written document signed by B and personally delivered to C. The written document provides that by July 2, 1991, B will orally inform C which of the identified properties C is to transfer to B. As of July 1, 1991, the fair market values of real properties L, M, N, and P are $30,000, $40,000, $50,000, and $60,000, respectively.
(ii) Although B identified more than three properties as replacement properties, the aggregate fair market value of the identified properties as of the end of the identification period ($180,000) did not exceed 200 percent of the aggregate fair market value of real property X (200% × $100,000 = $200,000). Therefore, the requirements of the 200-percent rule are satisfied, and real properties L, M, N, and P are all identified before the end of the identification period.

# Example 6.
(i) On June 21, 1991, B identifies real properties Q, R, and S as replacement properties by designating these properties as replacement properties in a written document signed by B and mailed to C. On June 24, 1991, B identifies real properties T and U as replacement properties in a written document signed by B and mailed to C. On June
28, 1991, B revokes the identification of real properties Q and R in a written document signed by B and personally delivered to C.
(ii) B has revoked the identification of real properties Q and R in the manner provided by paragraph (c)(6) of this section. Identifications of replacement property that have been revoked in the manner provided by paragraph (c)(6) of this section are not taken into account for purposes of applying the 3-property rule. Thus, as of June 28, 1991, B has identified only replacement properties S, T, and U for purposes of the 3-property rule. Because B did not identify more than three properties as replacement properties for purposes of the 3-property rule, the requirements of that rule are satisfied, and real properties S, T, and U are all identified before the end of the identification period.

# Example 7.
(i) On May 20, 1991, B identifies real properties V and W as replacement properties by designating these properties as replacement properties in a written document signed by B and personally delivered to C. On June 4, 1991, B identifies real properties Y and Z as replacement properties in the same manner. On June 5, 1991, B telephones C and orally revokes the identification of real properties V and W. As of July 1, 1991, the fair market values of real properties V, W, Y, and Z are $50,000, $70,000, $90,000, and $100,000, respectively. On July 31, 1991, C purchases real property Y and Z and transfers them to B.
(ii) Pursuant to paragraph (c)(6) of this section (relating to revocation of identification), the oral revocation of the identification of real properties V and W is invalid. Thus, the identification of real properties V and W is taken into account for purposes of determining whether the requirements of paragraph (c)(4) of this section (relating to the identification of alternative and multiple properties) are satisfied. Because B identified more than three properties and the aggregate fair market value of the identified properties as of the end of the identification period ($310,000) exceeds 200 percent of the fair market value of real property X (200% × $100,000 = $200,000), the requirements of paragraph (c)(4) of this section are not satisfied, and B is treated as if B did not identify any replacement property.
(d)
Receipt of identified replacement property
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section (relating to the receipt requirement), the identified replacement property is received before the end of the exchange period only if the requriements of this paragraph (d) are satisfied with respect to the replacement property. In the case of a deferred exchange, the identified replacement property is received before the end of the exchange period if—
(i) The taxpayer receives the replacement property before the end of the exchange period, and
(ii) The replacement property received is substantially the same property as identified.
If the taxpayer has identified more than one replacement property, section 1031(a)(3)(B) and this paragraph (d) are applied separately to each replacement property.
(2)
Examples.
This paragraph (d) may be illustrated by the following examples. The following facts are assumed: B, a calendar year taxpayer, and C agree to enter into a deferred exchange. Pursuant to their agreement, B transfers real property X to C on May 17, 1991. Real property X, which has been held by B for investment, is unencumbered and has a fair market value on May 17, 1991, of $100,000. On or before July 1, 1991 (the end of the identification period), B is to identify replacement property that is of a like kind to real property X. On or before November 13, 1991 (the end of the exchange period), C is required to purchase the property identified by B and to transfer that property to B. To the extent the fair market value of the replacement property transferred to B is greater or less than the fair market value of real property X, either B or C, as applicable, will make up the difference by paying cash to the other party after the date the replacement property is received by B. The replacement property is identified in a manner that satisfies paragraph (c) of this section (relating to identification of replacement property) and is of a like kind to real property X (determined without regard to section 1031(a)(3) and this section). B intends to hold any replacement property received for investment.

# Example 1.
(i) In the agreement, B identifies real properties J, K, and L as replacement properties. The agreement provides that by July 26, 1991, B will orally inform C which of the properties C is to transfer to B.
(ii) As of July 1, 1991, the fair market values of real properties J, K, and L are $75,000, $100,000, and $125,000, respectively. On July 26, 1991, B instructs C to acquire real property K. On October 31, 1991, C purchases real
property K for $100,000 and transfers the property to B.
(iii) Because real property K was identified before the end of the identification period and was received before the end of the exchange period, the identification and receipt requirements of section 1031(a)(3) and this section are satisfied with respect to real property K.

# Example 2.
(i) In the agreement, B identifies real property P as replacement property. Real property P consists of two acres of unimproved land. On October 15, 1991, the owner of real property P erects a fence on the property. On November 1, 1991, C purchases real property P and transfers it to B.
(ii) The erection of the fence on real property P subsequent to its identification did not alter the basic nature or character of real property P as unimproved land. B is considered to have received substantially the same property as identified.

# Example 3.
(i) In the agreement, B identifies real property Q as replacement property. Real property Q consists of a barn on two acres of land and has a fair market value of $250,000 ($187,500 for the barn and underlying land and $62,500 for the remaining land). As of July 26, 1991, real property Q remains unchanged and has a fair market value of $250,000. On that date, at B's direction, C purchases the barn and underlying land for $187,500 and transfers it to B, and B pays $62,500 to C.
(ii) The barn and underlying land differ in basic nature or character from real property Q as a whole, B is not considered to have received substantially the same property as identified.

# Example 4.
(i) In the agreement, B identifies real property R as replacement property. Real property R consists of two acres of unimproved land and has a fair market value of $250,000. As of October 3, 1991, real property R remains unimproved and has a fair market value of $250,000. On that date, at B's direction, C purchases 1
1/2
acres of real property R for $187,500 and transfers it to B, and B pays $62,500 to C.
(ii) The portion of real property R that B received does not differ from the basic nature or character of real property R as a whole. Moreover, the fair market value of the portion of real property R that B received ($187,500) is 75 percent of the fair market value of real property R as of the date of receipt. Accordingly, B is considered to have received substantially the same property as identified.
(e)
Special rules for identification and receipt of replacement property to be produced
—(1)
In general.
A transfer of relinquished property in a deferred exchange will not fail to qualify for nonrecognition of gain or loss under section 1031 merely because the replacement property is not in existence or is being produced at the time the property is identified as replacement property. For purposes of this paragraph (e), the terms “produced” and “production” have the same meanings as provided in section 263A(g)(1) and the regulations thereunder.
(2)
Identification of replacement property to be produced.
(i) In the case of replacement property that is to be produced, the replacement property must be identified as provided in paragraph (c) of this section (relating to identification of replacement property). For example, if the identified replacement property consists of improved real property where the improvements are to be constructed, the description of the replacement property satisfies the requirements of paragraph (c)(3) of this section (relating to description of replacement property) if a legal description is provided for the underlying land and as much detail is provided regarding construction of the improvements as is practicable at the time the identification is made.
(ii) For purposes of paragraphs (c)(4)(i)(B) and (c)(5) of this section (relating to the 200-percent rule and incidental property), the fair market value of replacement property that is to be produced is its estimated fair market value as of the date it is expected to be received by the taxpayer.
(3)
Receipt of replacement property to be produced.
(i) For purposes of paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section (relating to receipt of the identified replacement property), in determining whether the replacement property received by the taxpayer is substantially the same property as identified where the identified replacement property is property to be produced, variations due to usual or typical production changes are not taken into account. However, if substantial changes are made in the property to be produced, the replacement property received will not be considered to be substantially the same property as identified.
(ii) If the identified replacement property is personal property to be produced, the replacement property received will not be considered to be substantially the same property as identified unless production of the replacement property received is completed on or before the date the property is received by the taxpayer.
(iii) If the identified replacement property is real property to be produced and the production of the property is not completed on or before the date the taxpayer receives the property, the property received will be considered to be substantially the same property as identified only if, had production been completed on or before the date the taxpayer receives the replacement property, the property received would have been considered to be substantially the same property as identified. Even so, the property received is considered to be substantially the same property as identified only to the extent the property received constitutes real property under local law.
(4)
Additional rules.
The transfer of relinquished property is not within the provisions of section 1031(a) if the relinquished property is transferred in exchange for services (including production services). Thus, any additional production occurring with respect to the replacement property after the property is received by the taxpayer will not be treated as the receipt of property of a like kind.
(5)
Example.
This paragraph (e) may be illustrated by the following example.

# Example:
(i) B, a calendar year taxpayer, and C agree to enter into a deferred exchange. Pursuant to their agreement, B transfers improved real property X and personal property Y to C on May 17, 1991. On or before November 13, 1991 (the end of the exchange period), C is required to transfer to B real property M, on which C is constructing improvements, and personal property N, which C is producing. C is obligated to complete the improvements and production regardless of when properties M and N are transferred to B. Properties M and N are identified in a manner that satisfies paragraphs (c) (relating to identification of replacement property) and (e)(2) of this section. In addition, properties M and N are of a like kind, respectively, to real property X and personal property Y (determined without regard to section 1031(a)(3) and this section). On November 13, 1991, when construction of the improvements to property M is 20 percent completed and the production of property N is 90 percent completed, C transfers to B property M and property N. If construction of the improvements had been completed, property M would have been considered to be substantially the same property as identified. Under local law, property M constitutes real property to the extent of the underlying land and the 20 percent of the construction that is completed.
(ii) Because property N is personal property to be produced and production of property N is not completed before the date the property is received by B, property N is not considered to be substantially the same property as identified and is treated as property which is not of a like kind to property Y.
(iii) Property M is considered to be substantially the same property as identified to the extent of the underlying land and the 20 percent of the construction that is completed when property M is received by B. However, any additional construction performed by C with respect to property M after November 13, 1991, is not treated as the receipt of property of a like kind.
(f)
Receipt of money or other property
—(1)
In general.
A transfer of relinquished property in a deferred exchange is not within the provisions of section 1031(a) if, as part of the consideration, the taxpayer receives money or other property. However, such a transfer, if otherwise qualified, will be within the provisions of either section 1031 (b) or (c). See § 1.1031(a)-1(a)(2). In addition, in the case of a transfer of relinquished property in a deferred exchange, gain or loss may be recognized if the taxpayer actually or constructively receives money or other property before the taxpayer actually receives like-kind replacement property. If the taxpayer actually or constructively receives money or other property in the full amount of the consideration for the relinquished property before the taxpayer actually receives like-kind replacement property, the transaction will constitute a sale and not a deferred exchange, even though the taxpayer may ultimately receive like-kind replacement property.
(2)
Actual and constructive receipt.
Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section (relating to safe harbors), for purposes of section 1031 and this section, the determination of whether (or the extent to which) the taxpayer is
in actual or constructive receipt of money or other property before the taxpayer actually receives like-kind replacement property is made under the general rules concerning actual and constructive receipt and without regard to the taxpayer's method of accounting. The taxpayer is in actual receipt of money or property at the time the taxpayer actually receives the money or property or receives the economic benefit of the money or property. The taxpayer is in constructive receipt of money or property at the time the money or property is credited to the taxpayer's account, set apart for the taxpayer, or otherwise made available so that the taxpayer may draw upon it at any time or so that the taxpayer can draw upon it if notice of intention to draw is given. Although the taxpayer is not in constructive receipt of money or property if the taxpayer's control of its receipt is subject to substantial limitations or restrictions, the taxpayer is in constructive receipt of the money or property at the time the limitations or restrictions lapse, expire, or are waived. In addition, actual or constructive receipt of money or property by an agent of the taxpayer (determined without regard to paragraph (k) of this section) is actual or constructive receipt by the taxpayer.
(3)
Example.
This paragraph (f) may be illustrated by the following example.

# Example:
(i) B, a calendar year taxpayer, and C agree to enter into a deferred exchange. Pursuant to the agreement, on May 17, 1991, B transfers real property X to C. Real property X, which has been held by B for investment, is unencumbered and has a fair market value on May 17, 1991, of $100,000. On or before July 1, 1991 (the end of the identification period), B is to identify replacement property that is of a like kind to real property X. On or before November 13, 1991 (the end of the exchange period), C is required to purchase the property identified by B and to transfer that property to B. At any time after May 17, 1991, and before C has purchased the replacement property, B has the right, upon notice, to demand that C pay $100,000 in lieu of acquiring and transferring the replacement property. Pursuant to the agreement, B identifies replacement property, and C purchases the replacement property and transfers it to B.
(ii) Under the agreement, B has the unrestricted right to demand the payment of $100,000 as of May 17, 1991. B is therefore in constructive receipt of $100,000 on that date. Because B is in constructive receipt of money in the full amount of the consideration for the relinquished property before B actually receives the like-kind replacement property, the transaction constitutes a sale, and the transfer of real property X does not qualify for nonrecognition of gain or loss under section 1031. B is treated as if B received the $100,000 in consideration for the sale of real property X and then purchased the like-kind replacement property.
(iii) If B's right to demand payment of the $100,000 were subject to a substantial limitation or restriction (e.g., the agreement provided that B had no right to demand payment before November 14, 1991 (the end of the exchange period)), then, for purposes of this section, B would not be in actual or constructive receipt of the money unless (or until) the limitation or restriction lapsed, expired, or was waived.
(g)
Safe harbors
—(1)
In general.
Paragraphs (g)(2) through (g)(5) of this section set forth four safe harbors the use of which will result in a determination that the taxpayer is not in actual or constructive receipt of money or other property for purposes of section 1031 and this section. More than one safe harbor can be used in the same deferred exchange, but the terms and conditions of each must be separately satisfied. For purposes of the safe harbor rules, the term “taxpayer” does not include a person or entity utilized in a safe harbor (e.g., a qualified intermediary). See paragraph (g)(8),
Example 3(v),
of this section.
(2)
Security or guarantee arrangements.
(i) In the case of a deferred exchange, the determination of whether the taxpayer is in actual or constructive receipt of money or other property before the taxpayer actually receives like-kind replacement property will be made without regard to the fact that the obligation of the taxpayer's transferee to transfer the replacement property to the taxpayer is or may be secured or guaranteed by one or more of the following—
(A) A mortgage, deed of trust, or other security interest in property (other than cash or a cash equivalent),
(B) A standby letter of credit which satisfies all of the requirements of § 15A.453-1 (b)(3)(iii) and which may not be drawn upon in the absence of a default of the transferee's obligation to
transfer like-kind replacement property to the taxpayer, or
(C) A guarantee of a third party.
(ii) Paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section ceases to apply at the time the taxpayer has an immediate ability or unrestricted right to receive money or other property pursuant to the security or guarantee arrangement.
(3)
Qualified escrow accounts and qualified trusts.
(i) In the case of a deferred exchange, the determination of whether the taxpayer is in actual or constructive receipt of money or other property before the taxpayer actually receives like-kind replacement property will be made without regard to the fact that the obligation of the taxpayer's transferee to transfer the replacement property to the taxpayer is or may be secured by cash or a cash equivalent if the cash or cash equivalent is held in a qualified escrow account or in a qualified trust.
(ii) A qualified escrow account is an escrow account wherein—
(A) The escrow holder is not the taxpayer or a disqualified person (as defined in paragraph (k) of this section), and
(B) The escrow agreement expressly limits the taxpayer's rights to receive, pledge, borrow, or otherwise obtain the benefits of the cash or cash equivalent held in the escrow account as provided in paragraph (g)(6) of this section.
(iii) A qualified trust is a trust wherein—
(A) The trustee is not the taxpayer or a disqualified person (as defined in paragraph (k) of this section, except that for this purpose the relationship between the taxpayer and the trustee created by the qualified trust will not be considered a relationship under section 267(b)), and
(B) The trust agreement expressly limits the taxpayer's rights to receive, pledge, borrow, or otherwise obtain the benefits of the cash or cash equivalent held by the trustee as provided in paragraph (g)(6) of this section.
(iv) Paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section ceases to apply at the time the taxpayer has an immediate ability or unrestricted right to receive, pledge, borrow, or otherwise obtain the benefits of the cash or cash equivalent held in the qualified escrow account or qualified trust. Rights conferred upon the taxpayer under state law to terminate or dismiss the escrow holder of a qualified escrow account or the trustee of a qualified trust are disregarded for this purpose.
(v) A taxpayer may receive money or other property directly from a party to the exchange, but not from a qualified escrow account or a qualified trust, without affecting the application of paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section.
(4)
Qualified intermediaries.
(i) In the case of a taxpayer's transfer of relinquished property involving a qualified intermediary, the qualified intermediary is not considered the agent of the taxpayer for purposes of section 1031(a). In such a case, the taxpayer's transfer of relinquished property and subsequent receipt of like-kind replacement property is treated as an exchange, and the determination of whether the taxpayer is in actual or constructive receipt of money or other property before the taxpayer actually receives like-kind replacement property is made as if the qualified intermediary is not the agent of the taxpayer.
(ii) Paragraph (g)(4)(i) of this section applies only if the agreement between the taxpayer and the qualified intermediary expressly limits the taxpayer's rights to receive, pledge, borrow, or otherwise obtain the benefits of money or other property held by the qualified intermediary as provided in paragraph (g)(6) of this section.
(iii) A qualified intermediary is a person who—
(A) Is not the taxpayer or a disqualified person (as defined in paragraph (k) of this section), and
(B) Enters into a written agreement with the taxpayer (the “exchange agreement”) and, as required by the exchange agreement, acquires the relinquished property from the taxpayer, transfers the relinquished property, acquires the replacement property, and transfers the replacement property to the taxpayer.
(iv) Regardless of whether an intermediary acquires and transfers property under general tax principals, solely for purposes of paragraph (g)(4)(iii)(B) of this section—
(A) An intermediary is treated as acquiring and transferring property if the intermediary acquires and transfers legal title to that property,
(B) An intermediary is treated as acquiring and transferring the relinquished property if the intermediary (either on its own behalf or as the agent of any party to the transaction) enters into an agreement with a person other than the taxpayer for the transfer of the relinquished property to that person and, pursuant to that agreement, the relinquished property is transferred to that person, and
(C) An intermediary is treated as acquiring and transferring replacement property if the intermediary (either on its own behalf or as the agent of any party to the transaction) enters into an agreement with the owner of the replacement property for the transfer of that property and, pursuant to that agreement, the replacement property is transferred to the taxpayer.
(v) Solely for purposes of paragraphs (g)(4)(iii) and (g)(4)(iv) of this section, an intermediary is treated as entering into an agreement if the rights of a party to the agreement are assigned to the intermediary and all parties to that agreement are notified in writing of the assignment on or before the date of the relevent transfer of property. For example, if a taxpayer enters into an agreement for the transfer of relinquished property and thereafter assigns its rights in that agreement to an intermediary and all parties to that agreement are notified in writing of the assignment on or before the date of the transfer of the relinquished property, the intermediary is treated as entering into that agreement. If the relinquished property is transferred pursuant to that agreement, the intermediary is treated as having acquired and transferred the relinquished property.
(vi) Paragraph (g)(4)(i) of this section ceases to apply at the time the taxpayer has an immediate ability or unrestricted right to receive, pledge, borrow, or otherwise obtain the benefits of money or other property held by the qualified intermediary. Rights conferred upon the taxpayer under state law to terminate or dismiss the qualified intermediary are disregarded for this purpose.
(vii) A taxpayer may receive money or other property directly from a party to the transaction other than the qualified intermediary without affecting the application of paragraph (g)(4)(i) of this section.
(5)
Interest and growth factors.
In the case of a deferred exchange, the determination of whether the taxpayer is in actual or constructive receipt of money or other property before the taxpayer actually receives the like-kind replacement property will be made without regard to the fact that the taxpayer is or may be entitled to receive any interest or growth factor with respect to the deferred exchange. The preceding sentence applies only if the agreement pursuant to which the taxpayer is or may be entitled to the interest or growth factor expressly limits the taxpayer's rights to receive the interest or growth factor as provided in paragragh (g)(6) of this section. For additional rules concerning interest or growth factors, see paragraph (h) of this section.
(6)
Additional restrictions on safe harbors under paragraphs (g)(3) through (g)(5).
(i) An agreement limits a taxpayer's rights as provided in this paragraph (g)(6) only if the agreement provides that the taxpayer has no rights, except as provided in paragraph (g)(6)(ii) and (g)(6)(iii) of this section, to receive, pledge, borrow, or otherwise obtain the benefits of money or other property before the end of the exchange period.
(ii) The agreement may provide that if the taxpayer has not identified replacement property by the end of the identification period, the taxpayer may have rights to receive, pledge, borrow, or othewise obtain the benefits of money or other property at any time after the end of the identification period.
(iii) The agreement may provide that if the taxpayer has identified replacement property, the taxpayer may have rights to receive, pledge, borrow, or otherwise obtain the benefits of money or other property upon or after—
(A) The receipt by the taxpayer of all of the replacement property to which
the taxpayer is entitled under the exchange agreement, or
(B) The occurrence after the end of the identification period of a material and substantial contingency that—
(
1
) Relates to the deferred exchange,
(
2
) Is provided for in writing, and
(
3
) Is beyond the control of the taxpayer and of any disqualified person (as defined in paragraph (k) of this section), other than the person obligated to transfer the replacement property to the taxpayer.
(7)
Items disregarded in applying safe harbors under paragraphs (g)(3) through (g)(5).
In determining whether a safe harbor under paragraphs (g)(3) through (g)(5) of this section ceases to apply and whether the taxpayer's rights to receive, pledge, borrow, or otherwise obtain the benefits of money or other property are expressly limited as provided in paragraph (g)(6) of this section, the taxpayer's receipt of or right to receive any of the following items will be disregarded—
(i) Items that a seller may receive as a consequence of the disposition of property and that are not included in the amount realized from the disposition of property (e.g., prorated rents);
(ii) Transactional items that relate to the disposition of the relinquished property or to the acquisition of the replacement property and appear under local standards in the typical closing statements as the responsibility of a buyer or seller (e.g., commissions, prorated taxes, recording or transfer taxes, and title company fees); and
(iii) Personal property generally resulting in gain recognition under section 1031(b) that is incidental to real property acquired in an exchange. For purposes of this paragraph (g)(7), personal property is incidental to real property acquired in an exchange if—
(A) In standard commercial transactions, the personal property is typically transferred together with the real property; and
(B) The aggregate fair market value of the property described in paragraph (g)(7)(iii)(A) of this section transferred with the real property does not exceed 15 percent of the aggregate fair market value of the replacement real property or properties received in the exchange.
(8)
Examples.
This paragraph (g) may be illustrated by the following examples. Unless otherwise provided in an example, the following facts are assumed: B, a calendar year taxpayer, and C agree to enter into a deferred exchange. Pursuant to their agreement, B is to transfer real property X to C on May 17, 1991. Real property X, which has been held by B for investment, is unencumbered and has a fair market value on May 17, 1991, of $100,000. On or before July 1, 1991 (the end of the identification period), B is to identify replacement property that is of a like kind to real property X. On or before November 13, 1991 (the end of the exchange period), C is required to purchase the property identified by B and to transfer that property to B. To the extent the fair market value of the replacement property transferred to B is greater or less than the fair market value property X, either B or C, as applicable, will make up the difference by paying cash to the other party after the date the replacement property is received by B. The replacement property is identified as provided in paragraph (c) of this section (relating to identification of replacement property) and is of a like kind to real property X (determined without regard to section 1031(a)(3) and this section). B intends to hold any replacement property received for investment.
(i)
Example 1.
(A) On May 17, 1991, B transfers real property X to C. On the same day, C pays $10,000 to B and deposits $90,000 in escrow as security for C's obligation to perform under the agreement. The escrow agreement provides that B has no rights to receive, pledge, borrow, or otherwise obtain the benefits of the money in escrow before November 14, 1991, except that:
(
1
) if B fails to identify replacement property on or before July 1, 1991, B may demand the funds in escrow at any time after July 1, 1991; and
(
2
) if B identifies and receives replacement property, then B may demand the balance of the remaining funds in escrow at any time after B has received the replacement property.
(
3
) The funds in escrow may be used to purchase the replacement property. The escrow holder is not a disqualified person as defined in paragraph (k) of
this section. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, B identifies replacement property, and C purchases the replacement property using the funds in escrow and tranfers the replacement property to B.
(B) C's obligation to transfer the replacement property to B was secured by cash held in a qualified escrow account because the escrow holder was not a disqualified person and the escrow agreement expressly limited B's rights to receive, pledge, borrow, or otherwise obtain the benefits of the money in escrow as provided in paragraph (g)(6) of this section. In addition, B did not have the immediate ability or unrestricted right to receive money or other property in escrow before B actually received the like-kind replacement property. Therefore, for purposes of section 1031 and this section, B is determined not to be in actual or constructive receipt of the $90,000 held in escrow before B received the like-kind replacement property. The transfer of real property X by B and B's acquisition of the replacement property qualify as an exchange under section 1031. See paragraph (j) of this section for determining the amount of gain or loss recognized.
(ii)
Example 2.
(A) On May 17, 1991, B transfers real property X to C, and C deposits $100,000 in escrow as security for C's obligation to perform under the agreement. Also on May 17, B identifies real property J as replacement property. The escrow agreement provides that no funds may be paid out without prior written approval of both B and C. The escrow agreement also provides that B has no rights to receive, pledge, borrow, or otherwise obtain the benefits of the money in escrow before November 14, 1991, except that:
(
1
) B may demand the funds in escrow at any time after the later of July 1, 1991, and the occurrence of any of the following events—
(
i
) real property J is destroyed, seized, requisitioned, or condemned, or
(
ii
) a determination is made that the regulatory approval necessary for the transfer of real property J cannot be obtained in time for real property J to be transferred to B before the end of the exchange period;
(
2
) B may demand the funds in escrow at any time after August 14, 1991, if real property J has not been rezoned from residential to commercial use by that date; and
(
3
) B may demand the funds in escrow at the time B receives real property J or any time thereafter.
(
4
) Otherwise, B is entitled to all funds in escrow after November 13, 1991. The funds in escrow may be used to purchase the replacement property. The escrow holder is not a disqualified person as described in paragraph (k) of this section. Real property J is not rezoned from residential to commercial use on or before August 14, 1991.
(B) C's obligation to transfer the replacement property to B was secured by cash held in a qualified escrow account because the escrow holder was not a disqualified person and the escrow agreement expressly limited B's rights to receive, pledge, borrow, or otherwise obtain the benefits of the money in escrow as provided in paragraph (g)(6) of this section. From May 17, 1991, until August 15, 1991, B did not have the immediate ability or unrestricted right to receive money or other property before B actually received the like-kind replacement property. Therefore, for purposes of section 1031 and this section, B is determined not to be in actual or constructive receipt of the $100,000 in escrow from May 17, 1991, until August 15, 1991. However, on August 15, 1991, B had the unrestricted right, upon notice, to draw upon the $100,000 held in escrow. Thus, the safe harbor ceased to apply and B was in constructive receipt of the funds held in escrow. Because B constructively received the full amount of the consideration ($100,000) before B actually received the like-kind replacement property, the transaction is treated as a sale and not as a deferred exchange. The result does not change even if B chose not to demand the funds in escrow and continued to attempt to have real property J rezoned and to receive the property on or before November 13, 1991.
(C) If real property J had been rezoned on or before August 14, 1991, and C had purchased real property J and transferred it to B on or before November 13, 1991, the transaction would have
qualified for nonrecognition of gain or loss under section 1031(a).
(iii)
Example 3.
(A) On May 1, 1991, D offers to purchase real property X for $100,000. However, D is unwilling to participate in a like-kind exchange. B thus enters into an exchange agreement with C whereby B retains C to facilitate an exchange with respect to real property X. C is not a disqualified person as described in paragraph (k) of this section. The exchange agreement between B and C provides that B is to execute and deliver a deed conveying real property X to C who, in turn, is to execute and deliver a deed conveying real property X to D. The exchange agreement expressly limits B's rights to receive, pledge, borrow, or otherwise obtain the benefits of money or other property held by C as provided in paragraph (g)(6) of this section. On May 3, 1991, C enters into an agreement with D to transfer real property X to D for $100,000. On May 17, 1991, B executes and delivers to C a deed conveying real property X to C. On the same date, C executes and delivers to D a deed conveying real property X to D, and D deposits $100,000 in escrow. The escrow holder is not a disqualified person as defined in paragraph (k) of this section and the escrow agreement expressly limits B's rights to receive, pledge, borrow, or otherwise obtain the benefits of money or other property in escrow as provided in paragraph (g)(6) of this section. However, the escrow agreement provides that the money in escrow may be used to purchase replacement property. On June 3, 1991, B identifies real property K as replacement property. On August 9, 1991, E executes and delivers to C a deed conveying real property K to C and $80,000 is released from the escrow and paid to E. On the same date, C executes and delivers to B a deed conveying real property K to B, and the escrow holder pays B $20,000, the balance of the $100,000 sale price of real property X remaining after the purchase of real property K for $80,000.
(B) B and C entered into an exchange agreement that satisfied the requirements of paragraph (g)(4)(iii)(B) of this section. Regardless of whether C may have acquired and transferred real property X under general tax principles, C is treated as having acquired and transferred real property X because C acquired and transferred legal title to real property X. Similarly, C is treated as having acquired and transferred real property K because C acquired and transferred legal title to real property K. Thus, C was a qualified intermediary. This result is reached for purposes of this section regardless of whether C was B's agent under state law.
(C) Because the escrow holder was not a disqualified person and the escrow agreement expressly limited B's rights to receive, pledge, borrow, or otherwise obtain the benefits of money or other property in escrow as provided in paragraph (g)(6) of this section, the escrow account was a qualified escrow account. For purposes of section 1031 and this section, therefore, B is determined not to be in actual or constructive receipt of the funds in escrow before B received real property K.
(D) The exchange agreement between B and C expressly limited B's rights to receive, pledge, borrow, or otherwise obtain the benefits of any money held by C as provided in paragraph (g)(6) of this section. Because C was a qualified intermediary, for purposes of section 1031 and this section B is determined not to be in actual or constructive receipt of any funds held by C before B received real property K. In addition, B's transfer of real property X and acquisition of real property K qualify as an exchange under section 1031. See paragraph (j) of this section for determining the amount of gain or loss recognized.
(E) If the escrow agreement had expressly limited C's rights to receive, pledge, borrow, or otherwise obtain the benefits of money or other property in escrow as provided in paragraph (g)(6) of this section, but had not expressly limited B's rights to receive, pledge, borrow, or otherwise obtain the benefits of that money or other property, the escrow account would not have been a qualified escrow account. Consequently, paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section would not have been applicable in determining whether B was in actual or constructive receipt of that money or other property before B received real property K.
(iv)
Example 4.
(A) On May 1, 1991, B enters into an agreement to sell real property X to D for $100,000 on May 17, 1991. However, D is unwilling to participate in a like-kind exchange. B thus enters into an exchange agreement with C whereby B retains C to facilitate an exchange with respect to real property X. C is not a disqualified person as described in paragraph (k) of this section. In the exchange agreement between B and C, B assigns to C all of B's rights in the agreement with D. The exchange agreement expressly limits B's rights to receive, pledge, borrow, or otherwise obtain the benefits of money or other property held by C as provided in paragraph (g)(6) of this section. On May 17, 1991, B notifies D in writing of the assignment. On the same date, B executes and delivers to D a deed conveying real property X to D. D pays $10,000 to B and $90,000 to C. On June 1, 1991, B identifies real property L as replacement property. On July 5, 1991, B enters into an agreement to purchase real property L from E for $90,000, assigns its rights in that agreement to C, and notifies E in writing of the assignment. On August 9, 1991, C pays $90,000 to E, and E executes and delivers to B a deed conveying real property L to B.
(B) The exchange agreement entered into by B and C satisfied the requirements of paragraph (g)(4)(iii)(B) of this section. Because B's rights in its agreements with D and E were assigned to C, and D and E were notified in writing of the assignment on or before the transfer of real properties X and L, respectively, C is treated as entering into those agreements. Because C is treated as entering into an agreement with D for the transfer of real property X and, pursuant to that agreement, real property X was transferred to D, C is treated as acquiring and transferring real property X. Similarly, because C is treated as entering into an agreement with E for the transfer of real property K and, pursuant to that agreement, real property K was transferred to B, C is treated as acquiring and transferring real property K. This result is reached for purposes of this section regardless of whether C was B's agent under state law and regardless of whether C is considered, under general tax principles, to have acquired title or beneficial ownership of the properties. Thus, C was a qualified intermediary.
(C) The exchange agreement between B and C expressly limited B's rights to receive, pledge, borrow, or otherwise obtain the benefits of the money held by C as provided in paragraph (g)(6) of this section. Thus, B did not have the immediate ability or unrestricted right to receive money or other property held by C before B received real property L. For purposes of section 1031 and this section, therefore, B is determined not to be in actual or constructive receipt of the $90,000 held by C before B received real property L. In addition, the transfer of real property X by B and B's acquisition of real property L qualify as an exchange under section 1031. See paragraph (j) of this section for determining the amount of gain or loss recognized.
(v)
Example 5.
(A) On May 1, 1991, B enters into an agreement to sell real property X to D for $100,000. However, D is unwilling to participate in a like-kind exchange. B thus enters into an agreement with C whereby B retains C to facilitate an exchange with respect to real property X. C is not a disqualified person as described in paragraph (k) of this section. The agreement between B and C expressly limits B's rights to receive, pledge, borrow, or otherwise obtain the benefits of money or other property held by C as provided in paragraph (g)(6) of this section. C neither enters into an agreement with D to transfer real property X to D nor is assigned B's rights in B's agreement to sell real property X to D. On May 17, 1991, B transfers real property X to D and instructs D to transfer the $100,000 to C. On June 1, 1991, B identifies real property M as replacement property. On August 9, 1991, C purchases real property L from E for $100,000, and E executes and delivers to C a deed conveying real property M to C. On the same date, C executes and delivers to B a deed conveying real property M to B.
(B) Because B transferred real property X directly to D under B's agreement with D, C did not acquire real property X from B and transfer real property X to D. Moreover, because C did not acquire legal title to real property X, did not enter into an agreement
with D to transfer real property X to D, and was not assigned B's rights in B's agreement to sell real property X to D, C is not treated as acquiring and transferring real property X. Thus, C was not a qualified intermediary and paragraph (g)(4))(i) of this section does not apply.
(C) B did not exchange real property X for real property M. Rather, B sold real property X to D and purchased, through C, real property M. Therefore, the transfer of real property X does not qualify for nonrecognition of gain or loss under section 1031.
(vi)
Example 6.
(A) In 2020, B transfers to C real property with a fair market value of $1,100,000 and an adjusted basis of $400,000. B's replacement property is an office building and, as a part of the exchange, B also will acquire certain office furniture in the building that is not real property, which is industry practice in a transaction of this type. The fair market value of the real property B will acquire is $1,000,000 and the fair market value of the personal property is $100,000.
(B) In a standard commercial transaction, the buyer of an office building typically also acquires some or all of the office furniture in the building. The fair market value of the personal property B will acquire does not exceed 15 percent of the fair market value of the office building B will acquire. Accordingly, under paragraph (g)(7)(iii) of this section, the personal property is incidental to the real property in the exchange and is disregarded in determining whether the taxpayer's rights to receive, pledge, borrow or otherwise obtain the benefits of money or non-like-kind property are expressly limited as provided in paragraph (g)(6) of this section. Upon the receipt of the personal property, B recognizes gain of $100,000 under section 1031(b), the lesser of the realized gain on the disposition of the relinquished property, $700,000, and the fair market value of the non-like-kind property B acquired in the exchange, $100,000.
(9)
Applicability date.
Paragraphs (g)(7)(iii) and (g)(8)(vi) of this section apply to exchanges beginning after December 2, 2020.
(h)
Interest and growth factors
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of this section, the taxpayer is treated as being entitled to receive interest or a growth factor with respect to a deferred exchange if the amount of money or property the taxpayer is entitled to receive depends upon the length of time elapsed between transfer of the relinquished property and receipt of the replacement property.
(2)
Treatment as interest.
If, as part of a deferred exchange, the taxpayer receives interest or a growth factor, the interest or growth factor will be treated as interest, regardless of whether it is paid to the taxpayer in cash or in property (including property of a like kind). The taxpayer must include the interest or growth factor in income according to the taxpayer's method of accounting. For rules under section 468B(g) relating to the current taxation of qualified escrow accounts, qualified trusts, and other escrow accounts, trusts, and funds used during deferred exchanges of like-kind property, see § 1.468B-6.
(i) [Reserved]
(j)
Determination of gain or loss recognized and the basis of property received in a deferred exchange
—(1)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided, the amount of gain or loss recognized and the basis of property received in a deferred exchange is determined by applying the rules of section 1031 and the regulations thereunder. See §§ 1.1031(b)-1, 1.1031(c)-1, 1.1031(d)-1, 1.1031(d)-1T, 1.1031(d)-2, and 1.1031(j)-1.
(2)
Coordination with section 453
—(i)
Qualified escrow accounts and qualified trusts.
Subject to the limitations of paragraphs (j)(2) (iv) and (v) of this section, in the case of a taxpayer's transfer of relinquished property in which the obligation of the taxpayer's transferee to transfer replacement property to the taxpayer is or may be secured by cash or a cash equivalent, the determination of whether the taxpayer has received a payment for purposes of section 453 and § 15a.453-1(b)(3)(i) of this chapter will be made without regard to the fact that the obligation is or may be so secured if the cash or cash equivalent is held in a qualified escrow account or a qualified trust. This paragraph (j)(2)(i) ceases to apply at the earlier of—
(A) The time described in paragraph (g)(3)(iv) of this section; or
(B) The end of the exchange period.
(ii)
Qualified intermediaries.
Subject to the limitations of paragraphs (j)(2) (iv) and (v) of this section, in the case of a taxpayer's transfer of relinquished property involving a qualified intermediary, the determination of whether the taxpayer has received a payment for purposes of section 453 and § 15a.453-1(b)(3)(i) of this chapter is made as if the qualified intermediary is not the agent of the taxpayer. For purposes of this paragraph (j)(2)(ii), a person who otherwise satisfies the definition of a qualified intermediary is treated as a qualified intermediary even though that person ultimately fails to acquire identified replacement property and transfer it to the taxpayer. This paragraph (j)(2)(ii) ceases to apply at the earlier of—
(A) The time described in paragraph (g)(4)(vi) of this section; or
(B) The end of the exchange period.
(iii)
Transferee indebtedness.
In the case of a transaction described in paragraph (j)(2)(ii) of this section, the receipt by the taxpayer of an evidence of indebtedness of the transferee of the qualified intermediary is treated as the receipt of an evidence of indebtedness of the person acquiring property from the taxpayer for purposes of section 453 and § 15a.453-1(b)(3)(i) of this chapter.
(iv)
Bona fide intent requirement.
The provisions of paragraphs (j)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section do not apply unless the taxpayer has a bona fide intent to enter into a deferred exchange at the beginning of the exchange period. A taxpayer will be treated as having a bona fide intent only if it is reasonable to believe, based on all the facts and circumstances as of the beginning of the exchange period, that like-kind replacement property will be acquired before the end of the exchange period.
(v)
Disqualified property.
The provisions of paragraphs (j)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section do not apply if the relinquished property is disqualified property. For purposes of this paragraph (j)(2),
disqualified property
means property that is not held for productive use in a trade or business or for investment or is property described in section 1031(a)(2).
(vi)
Examples.
This paragraph (j)(2) may be illustrated by the following examples. Unless otherwise provided in an example, the following facts are assumed: B is a calendar year taxpayer who agrees to enter into a deferred exchange. Pursuant to the agreement, B is to transfer real property X. Real property X, which has been held by B for investment, is unencumbered and has a fair market value of $100,000 at the time of transfer. B's adjusted basis in real property X at that time is $60,000. B identifies a single like-kind replacement property before the end of the identification period, and B receives the replacement property before the end of the exchange period. The transaction qualifies as a like-kind exchange under section 1031.

# Example 1.
(i) On September 22, 1994, B transfers real property X to C and C agrees to acquire like-kind property and deliver it to B. On that date B has a bona fide intent to enter into a deferred exchange. C's obligation, which is not payable on demand or readily tradable, is secured by $100,000 in cash. The $100,000 is deposited by C in an escrow account that is a qualified escrow account under paragraph (g)(3) of this section. The escrow agreement provides that B has no rights to receive, pledge, borrow, or otherwise obtain the benefits of the cash deposited in the escrow account until the earlier of the date the replacement property is delivered to B or the end of the exchange period. On March 11, 1995, C acquires replacement property having a fair market value of $80,000 and delivers the replacement property to B. The $20,000 in cash remaining in the qualified escrow account is distributed to B at that time.
(ii) Under section 1031(b), B recognizes gain to the extent of the $20,000 in cash that B receives in the exchange. Under paragraph (j)(2)(i) of this section, the qualified escrow account is disregarded for purposes of section 453 and § 15a.453-1(b)(3)(i) of this chapter in determining whether B is in receipt of payment. Accordingly, B's receipt of C's obligation on September 22, 1994, does not constitute a payment. Instead, B is treated as receiving payment on March 11, 1995, on receipt of the $20,000 in cash from the qualified escrow account. Subject to the other requirements of sections 453 and 453A, B may report the $20,000 gain in 1995 under the installment method. See section 453(f)(6) for special rules for determining total contract price and gross profit in the case of an exchange described in section 1031(b).

# Example 2.
(i) D offers to purchase real property X but is unwilling to participate in a like-kind exchange. B thus enters into an
exchange agreement with C whereby B retains C to facilitate an exchange with respect to real property X. On September 22, 1994, pursuant to the agreement, B transfers real property X to C who transfers it to D for $100,000 in cash. On that date B has a bona fide intent to enter into a deferred exchange. C is a qualified intermediary under paragraph (g)(4) of this section. The exchange agreement provides that B has no rights to receive, pledge, borrow, or otherwise obtain the benefits of the money held by C until the earlier of the date the replacement property is delivered to B or the end of the exchange period. On March 11, 1995, C acquires replacement property having a fair market value of $80,000 and delivers it, along with the remaining $20,000 from the transfer of real property X to B.
(ii) Under section 1031(b), B recognizes gain to the extent of the $20,000 cash B receives in the exchange. Under paragraph (j)(2)(ii) of this section, any agency relationship between B and C is disregarded for purposes of section 453 and § 15a.453-1(b)(3)(i) of this chapter in determining whether B is in receipt of payment. Accordingly, B is not treated as having received payment on September 22, 1994, on C's receipt of payment from D for the relinquished property. Instead, B is treated as receiving payment on March 11, 1995, on receipt of the $20,000 in cash from C. Subject to the other requirements of sections 453 and 453A, B may report the $20,000 gain in 1995 under the installment method.

# Example 3.
(i) D offers to purchase real property X but is unwilling to participate in a like-kind exchange. B enters into an exchange agreement with C whereby B retains C as a qualified intermediary to facilitate an exchange with respect to real property X. On December 1, 1994, pursuant to the agreement, B transfers real property X to C who transfers it to D for $100,000 in cash. On that date B has a bona fide intent to enter into a deferred exchange. The exchange agreement provides that B has no rights to receive, pledge, borrow, or otherwise obtain the benefits of the cash held by C until the earliest of the end of the identification period if B has not identified replacement property, the date the replacement property is delivered to B, or the end of the exchange period. Although B has a bona fide intent to enter into a deferred exchange at the beginning of the exchange period, B does not identify or acquire any replacement property. In 1995, at the end of the identification period, C delivers the entire $100,000 from the sale of real property X to B.
(ii) Under section 1001, B realizes gain to the extent of the amount realized ($100,000) over the adjusted basis in real property X ($60,000), or $40,000. Because B has a bona fide intent at the beginning of the exchange period to enter into a deferred exchange, paragraph (j)(2)(iv) of this section does not make paragraph (j)(2)(ii) of this section inapplicable even though B fails to acquire replacement property. Further, under paragraph (j)(2)(ii) of this section, C is a qualified intermediary even though C does not acquire and transfer replacement property to B. Thus, any agency relationship between B and C is disregarded for purposes of section 453 and § 15a.453-1(b)(3)(i) of this chapter in determining whether B is in receipt of payment. Accordingly, B is not treated as having received payment on December 1, 1994, on C's receipt of payment from D for the relinquished property. Instead, B is treated as receiving payment at the end of the identification period in 1995 on receipt of the $100,000 in cash from C. Subject to the other requirements of sections 453 and 453A, B may report the $40,000 gain in 1995 under the installment method.

# Example 4.
(i) D offers to purchase real property X but is unwilling to participate in a like-kind exchange. B thus enters into an exchange agreement with C whereby B retains C to facilitate an exchange with respect to real property X. C is a qualified intermediary under paragraph (g)(4) of this section. On September 22, 1994, pursuant to the agreement, B transfers real property X to C who then transfers it to D for $80,000 in cash and D's 10-year installment obligation for $20,000. On that date B has a bona fide intent to enter into a deferred exchange. The exchange agreement provides that B has no rights to receive, pledge, borrow, or otherwise obtain the benefits of the money or other property held by C until the earlier of the date the replacement property is delivered to B or the end of the exchange period. D's obligation bears adequate stated interest and is not payable on demand or readily tradable. On March 11, 1995, C acquires replacement property having a fair market value of $80,000 and delivers it, along with the $20,000 installment obligation, to B.
(ii) Under section 1031(b), $20,000 of B's gain (i.e., the amount of the installment obligation B receives in the exchange) does not qualify for nonrecognition under section 1031(a). Under paragraphs (j)(2) (ii) and (iii) of this section, B's receipt of D's obligation is treated as the receipt of an obligation of the person acquiring the property for purposes of section 453 and § 15a.453-1(b)(3)(i) of this chapter in determining whether B is in receipt of payment. Accordingly, B's receipt of the obligation is not treated as a payment. Subject to the other requirements of sections 453 and 453A, B may report the $20,000 gain under the installment method on receiving payments from D on the obligation.

# Example 5.
(i) B is a corporation that has held real property X to expand its manufacturing operations. However, at a meeting in November 1994, B's directors decide that real
property X is not suitable for the planned expansion, and authorize a like-kind exchange of this property for property that would be suitable for the planned expansion. B enters into an exchange agreement with C whereby B retains C as a qualified intermediary to facilitate an exchange with respect to real property X. On November 28, 1994, pursuant to the agreement, B transfers real property X to C, who then transfers it to D for $100,000 in cash. The exchange agreement does not include any limitations or conditions that make it unreasonable to believe that like-kind replacement property will be acquired before the end of the exchange period. The exchange agreement provides that B has no rights to receive, pledge, borrow, or otherwise obtain the benefits of the cash held by C until the earliest of the end of the identification period, if B has not identified replacement property, the date the replacement property is delivered to B, or the end of the exchange period. In early January 1995, B's directors meet and decide that it is not feasible to proceed with the planned expansion due to a business downturn reflected in B's preliminary financial reports for the last quarter of 1994. Thus, B's directors instruct C to stop seeking replacement property. C delivers the $100,000 cash to B on January 12, 1995, at the end of the identification period. Both the decision to exchange real property X for other property and the decision to cease seeking replacement property because of B's business downturn are recorded in the minutes of the directors' meetings. There are no other facts or circumstances that would indicate whether, on November 28, 1994, B had a bona fide intent to enter into a deferred like-kind exchange.
(ii) Under section 1001, B realizes gain to the extent of the amount realized ($100,000) over the adjusted basis of real property X ($60,000), or $40,000. The directors' authorization of a like-kind exchange, the terms of the exchange agreement with C, and the absence of other relevant facts, indicate that B had a bona fide intent at the beginning of the exchange period to enter into a deferred like-kind exchange. Thus, paragraph (j)(2)(iv) of this section does not make paragraph (j)(2)(ii) of this section inapplicable, even though B fails to acquire replacement property. Further, under paragraph (j)(2)(ii) of this section, C is a qualified intermediary, even though C does not transfer replacement property to B. Thus, any agency relationship between B and C is disregarded for purposes of section 453 and § 15a.453-1(b)(3)(i) of this chapter in determining whether B is in receipt of payment. Accordingly, B is not treated as having received payment until January 12, 1995, on receipt of the $100,000 cash from C. Subject to the other requirements of sections 453 and 453A, B may report the $40,000 gain in 1995 under the installment method.

# Example 6.
(i) B has held real property X for use in its trade or business, but decides to transfer that property because it is no longer suitable for B's planned expansion of its commercial enterprise. B and D agree to enter into a deferred exchange. Pursuant to their agreement, B transfers real property X to D on September 22, 1994, and D deposits $100,000 cash in a qualified escrow account as security for D's obligation under the agreement to transfer replacement property to B before the end of the exchange period. D's obligation is not payable on demand or readily tradable. The agreement provides that B is not required to accept any property that is not zoned for commercial use. Before the end of the identification period, B identifies real properties J, K, and L, all zoned for residential use, as replacement properties. Any one of these properties, rezoned for commercial use, would be suitable for B's planned expansion. In recent years, the zoning board with jurisdiction over properties J, K, and L has rezoned similar properties for commercial use. The escrow agreement provides that B has no rights to receive, pledge, borrow, or otherwise obtain the benefits of the money in the escrow account until the earlier of the time that the zoning board determines, after the end of the identification period, that it will not rezone the properties for commercial use or the end of the exchange period. On January 5, 1995, the zoning board decides that none of the properties will be rezoned for commercial use. Pursuant to the exchange agreement, B receives the $100,000 cash from the escrow on January 5, 1995. There are no other facts or circumstances that would indicate whether, on September 22, 1994, B had a bona fide intent to enter into a deferred like-kind exchange.
(ii) Under section 1001, B realizes gain to the extent of the amount realized ($100,000) over the adjusted basis of real property X ($60,000), or $40,000. The terms of the exchange agreement with D, the identification of properties J, K, and L, the efforts to have those properties rezoned for commercial purposes, and the absence of other relevant facts, indicate that B had a bona fide intent at the beginning of the exchange period to enter into a deferred exchange. Moreover, the limitations imposed in the exchange agreement on acceptable replacement property do not make it unreasonable to believe that like-kind replacement property would be acquired before the end of the exchange period. Therefore, paragraph (j)(2)(iv) of this section does not make paragraph (j)(2)(i) of this section inapplicable even though B fails to acquire replacement property. Thus, for purposes of section 453 and § 15a.453-1(b)(3)(i) of this chapter, the qualified escrow account is disregarded in determining whether B is in receipt of payment. Accordingly, B is not treated as having received payment on September 22, 1994, on D's deposit of the $100,000
cash into the qualified escrow account. Instead, B is treated as receiving payment on January 5, 1995. Subject to the other requirements of sections 453 and 453A, B may report the $40,000 gain in 1995 under the installment method.
(vii)
Effective date.
This paragraph (j)(2) is effective for transfers of property occurring on or after April 20, 1994. Taxpayers may apply this paragraph (j)(2) to transfers of property occurring before April 20, 1994, but on or after June 10, 1991, if those transfers otherwise meet the requirements of § 1.1031(k)-1. In addition, taxpayers may apply this paragraph (j)(2) to transfers of property occurring before June 10, 1991, but on or after May 16, 1990, if those transfers otherwise meet the requirements of § 1.1031(k)-1 or follow the guidance of IA-237-84 published in 1990-1, C.B. See § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(
b
) of this chapter.
(3)
Examples.
This paragraph (j) may be illustrated by the following examples. Unless otherwise provided in an example, the following facts are assumed: B, a calendar year taxpayer, and C agree to enter into a deferred exchange. Pursuant to their agreement, B is to transfer real property X to C on May 17, 1991. Real property X, which has been held by B for investment, is unencumbered and has a fair market value on May 17, 1991, of $100,000. B's adjusted basis in real property X is $40,000. On or before July 1, 1991 (the end of the identification period), B is to identify replacement property that is of a like kind to real property X. On or before November 13, 1991 (the end of the exchange period), C is required to purchase the property identified by B and to transfer that property to B. To the extent the fair market value of the replacement property transferred to B is greater or less than the fair market value of real property X, either B or C, as applicable, will make up the difference by paying cash to the other party after the date the replacement property is received. The replacement property is identified as provided in paragraph (c) of this section and is of a like kind to real property X (determined without regard to section 1031(a)(3) and this section). B intends to hold any replacement property received for investment.

# Example 1.
(i) On May 17, 1991, B transfers real property X to C and identifies real property R as replacement property. On June 3, 1991, C transfers $10,000 to B. On September 4, 1991, C purchases real property R for $90,000 and transfers real property R to B.
(ii) The $10,000 received by B is “money or other property” for purposes of section 1031 and the regulations thereunder. Under section 1031(b), B recognizes gain in the amount of $10,000. Under section 1031(d), B's basis in real property R is $40,000 (i.e., B's basis in real property X ($40,000), decreased in the amount of money received ($10,000), and increased in the amount of gain recognized ($10,000) in the deferred exchange).

# Example 2.
(i) On May 17, 1991, B transfers real property X to C and identifies real property S as replacement property, and C transfers $10,000 to B. On September 4, 1991, C purchases real property S for $100,000 and transfers real property S to B. On the same day, B transfers $10,000 to C.
(ii) The $10,000 received by B is “money or other property” for purposes of section 1031 and the regulations thereunder. Under section 1031(b), B recognizes gain in the amount of $10,000. Under section 1031(d), B's basis in real property S is $50,000 (i.e., B's basis in real property X ($40,000), decreased in the amount of money received ($10,000), increased in the amount of gain recognized ($10,000), and increased in the amount of the additional consideration paid by B ($10,000) in the deferred exchange).

# Example 3.
(i) Under the exchange agreement, B has the right at all times to demand $100,000 in cash in lieu of replacement property. On May 17, 1991, B transfers real property X to C and identifies real property T as replacement property. On September 4, 1991, C purchases real property T for $100,000 and transfers real property T to B.
(ii) Because B has the right on May 17, 1991, to demand $100,000 in cash in lieu of replacement property, B is in constructive receipt of the $100,000 on that date. Thus, the transaction is a sale and not an exchange, and the $60,000 gain realized by B in the transaction (i.e., $100,000 amount realized less $40,000 adjusted basis) is recognized. Under section 1031(d), B's basis in real property T is $100,000.

# Example 4.
(i) Under the exchange agreement, B has the right at all times to demand up to $30,000 in cash and the balance in replacement propertry instead of receiving replacement property in the amount of $100,000. On May 17, 1991, B transfers real property X to C and identifies real property U as replacement property. On September 4, 1991, C purchases real property U for $100,000 and transfers real property U to B.
(ii) The transaction qualifies as a deferred exchange under section 1031 and this section. However, because B had the right on May 17, 1991, to demand up to $30,000 in cash, B is in
constructive receipt of $30,000 on that date. Under section 1031(b), B recognizes gain in the amount of $30,000. Under section 1031(d), B's basis in real property U is $70,000 (i.e., B's basis in real property X ($40,000), decreased in the amount of money that B received ($30,000), increased in the amount of gain recognized ($30,000), and increased in the amount of additional consideration paid by B ($30,000) in the deferred exchange).

# Example 5.
(i) Assume real property X is encumbered by a mortgage of $30,000. On May 17, 1991, B transfers real property X to C and identifies real property V as replacement property, and C assumes the $30,000 mortgage on real property X. Real property V is encumbered by a $20,000 mortgage. On July 5, 1991, C purchases real property V for $90,000 by paying $70,000 and assuming the mortgage and transfers real property V to B with B assuming the mortgage.
(ii) The consideration received by B in the form of the liability assumed by C ($30,000) is offset by the consideration given by B in the form of the liability assumed by B ($20,000). The excess of the liability assumed by C over the liability assumed by B, $10,000, is treated as “money or other property.” See § 1.1031(b)-1(c). Thus, B recognizes gain under section 1031(b) in the amount of $10,000. Under section 1031(d), B's basis in real property V is $40,000 (i.e., B's basis in real property X ($40,000), decreased in the amount of money that B is treated as receiving in the form of the liability assumed by C ($30,000), increased in the amount of money that B is treated as paying in the form of the liability assumed by B ($20,000), and increased in the amount of the gain recognized ($10,000) in the deferred exchange).
(k)
Definition of disqualified person.
(1) For purposes of this section, a disqualified person is a person described in paragraph (k)(2), (k)(3), or (k)(4) of this section.
(2) The person is the agent of the taxpayer at the time of the transaction. For this purpose, a person who has acted as the taxpayer's employee, attorney, accountant, investment banker or broker, or real estate agent or broker within the 2-year period ending on the date of the transfer of the first of the relinquished properties is treated as an agent of the taxpayer at the time of the transaction. Solely for purposes of this paragraph (k)(2), performance of the following services will not be taken into account—
(i) Services for the taxpayer with respect to exchanges of property intended to qualify for nonrecognition of gain or loss under section 1031; and
(ii) Routine financial, title insurance, escrow, or trust services for the taxpayer by a financial institution, title insurance company, or escrow company.
(3) The person and the taxpayer bear a relationship described in either section 267(b) or section 707(b) (determined by substituting in each section “10 percent” for “50 percent” each place it appears).
(4)(i) Except as provided in paragraph (k)(4)(ii) of this section, the person and a person described in paragraph (k)(2) of this section bear a relationship described in either section 267(b) or 707(b) (determined by substituting in each section “10 percent” for “50 percent” each place it appears).
(ii) In the case of a transfer of relinquished property made by a taxpayer on or after January 17, 2001, paragraph (k)(4)(i) of this section does not apply to a bank (as defined in section 581) or a bank affiliate if, but for this paragraph (k)(4)(ii), the bank or bank affiliate would be a disqualified person under paragraph (k)(4)(i) of this section solely because it is a member of the same controlled group (as determined under section 267(f)(1), substituting “10 percent” for “50 percent' where it appears) as a person that has provided investment banking or brokerage services to the taxpayer within the 2-year period described in paragraph (k)(2) of this section. For purposes of this paragraph (k)(4)(ii), a bank affiliate is a corporation whose principal activity is rendering services to facilitate exchanges of property intended to qualify for nonrecognition of gain under section 1031 and all of whose stock is owned by either a bank or a bank holding company (within the meaning of section 2(a) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (12 U.S.C. 1841(a)).
(5) This paragraph (k) may be illustrated by the following examples. Unless otherwise provided, the following facts are assumed: On May 1, 1991, B enters into an exchange agreement (as defined in paragraph (g)(4)(iii)(B) of this section) with C whereby B retains C to facilitate an exchange with respect to real property X. On May 17, 1991, pursuant to the agreement, B executes and delivers to C a deed conveying real property X to C. C has no
relationship to B described in paragraph (k)(2), (k)(3), or (k)(4) of this section.

# Example 1.
(i) C is B's accountant and has rendered accounting services to B within the 2-year period ending on May 17, 1991, other than with respect to exchanges of property intended to qualify for nonrecognition of gain or loss under section 1031.
(ii) C is a disqualified person because C has acted as B's accountant within the 2-year period ending on May 17, 1991.
(iii) If C had not acted as B's accountant within the 2-year period ending on May 17, 1991, or if C had acted as B's accountant within that period only with respect to exchanges intended to qualify for nonrecognition of gain or loss under section 1031, C would not have been a disqualified person.

# Example 2.
(i) C, which is engaged in the trade or business of acting as an intermediary to facilitate deferred exchanges, is a wholly owned subsidiary of an escrow company that has performed routine escrow services for B in the past. C has previously been retained by B to act as an intermediary in prior section 1031 exchanges.
(ii) C is not a disqualified person notwithstanding the intermediary services previously provided by C to B (see paragraph (k)(2)(i) of this section) and notwithstanding the combination of C's relationship to the escrow company and the escrow services previously provided by the escrow company to B (see paragraph (k)(2)(ii) of this section).

# Example 3.
(i) C is a corporation that is only engaged in the trade or business of acting as an intermediary to facilitate deferred exchanges. Each of 10 law firms owns 10 percent of the outstanding stock of C. One of the 10 law firms that owns 10 percent of C is M. J is the managing partner of M and is the president of C. J, in his capacity as a partner in M, has also rendered legal advice to B within the 2-year period ending on May 17, 1991, on matters other than exchanges intended to qualify for nonrecognition of gain or loss under section 1031.
(ii) J and M are disqualified persons. C, however, is not a disqualified person because neither J nor M own, directly or indirectly, more than 10 percent of the stock of C. Similarly, J's participation in the management of C does not make C a disqualified person.
(l) [Reserved]
(m)
Definition of fair market value.
For purposes of this section, the fair market value of property means the fair market value of the property without regard to any liabilities secured by the property.
(n)
No inference with respect to actual or constructive receipt rules outside of section 1031.
The rules provided in this section relating to actual or constructive receipt are intended to be rules for determining whether there is actual or constructive receipt in the case of a deferred exchange. No inference is intended regarding the application of these rules for purposes of determining whether actual or constructive receipt exists for any other purpose.
(o)
Effective date.
This section applies to transfers of property made by a taxpayer on or after June 10, 1991. However, a transfer of property made by a taxpayer on or after May 16, 1990, but before June 10, 1991, will be treated as complying with section 1031 (a)(3) and this section if the deferred exchange satisfies either the provision of this section or the provisions of the notice of proposed rulemaking published in the
Federal Register
on May 16, 1990 (55 FR 20278).
[T.D. 8346, 56 FR 19938, May 1, 1991, as amended by T.D. 8535, 59 FR 18749, Apr. 20, 1994; T.D. 8982, 67 FR 4909, Feb. 1, 2002; T.D. 9413, 73 FR 39622, July 10, 2008; T.D. 9935, 85 FR 77383, Dec. 2, 2020]
§ 1.1032-1
Disposition by a corporation of its own capital stock.
(a) The disposition by a corporation of shares of its own stock (including treasury stock) for money or other property does not give rise to taxable gain or deductible loss to the corporation regardless of the nature of the transaction or the facts and circumstances involved. For example, the receipt by a corporation of the subscription price of shares of its stock upon their original issuance gives rise to neither taxable gain nor deductible loss, whether the subscription or issue price be equal to, in excess of, or less than, the par or stated value of such stock. Also, the exchange or sale by a corporation of its own shares for money or other property does not result in taxable gain or deductible loss, even though the corporation deals in such shares as it might in the shares of another corporation. A transfer by a corporation of shares of its own stock (including treasury stock) as compensation for services is considered, for purposes of section 1032(a), as a disposition by the corporation of such shares for money or other property.
(b) Section 1032(a) does not apply to the acquisition by a corporation of shares of its own stock except where the corporation acquires such shares in exchange for shares of its own stock (including treasury stock). See paragraph (e) of § 1.311-1, relating to treatment of acquisitions of a corporation's own stock. Section 1032(a) also does not relate to the tax treatment of the recipient of a corporation's stock.
(c) Where a corporation acquires shares of its own stock in exchange for shares of its own stock (including treasury stock) the transaction may qualify not only under section 1032(a), but also under section 368(a)(1)(E) (recapitalization) or section 305(a) (distribution of stock and stock rights).
(d) For basis of property acquired by a corporation in connection with a transaction to which section 351 applies or in connection with a reorganization, see section 362. For basis of property acquired by a corporation in a transaction to which section 1032 applies but which does not qualify under any other nonrecognition provision, see section 1012.
§ 1.1032-2
Disposition by a corporation of stock of a controlling corporation in certain triangular reorganizations.
(a)
Scope.
This section provides rules for certain triangular reorganizations described in § 1.358-6(b) when the acquiring corporation (
S
) acquires property or stock of another corporation (
T
) in exchange for stock of the corporation (
P
) in control of
S.
(b)
General nonrecognition of gain or loss.
For purposes of § 1.1032-1(a), in the case of a forward triangular merger, a triangular C reorganization, or a triangular B reorganization (as described in § 1.358-6(b)),
P
stock provided by
P
to
S,
or directly to
T
or
T
's shareholders on behalf of
S,
pursuant to the plan of reorganization is treated as a disposition by
P
of shares of its own stock for
T
's assets or stock, as applicable. For rules governing the use of
P
stock in a reverse triangular merger, see section 361.
(c)
Treatment of S. S
must recognize gain or loss on its exchange of
P
stock as consideration in a forward triangular merger, a triangular C reorganization, or a triangular B reorganization (as described in § 1.358-6(b)), if
S
did not receive the
P
stock from
P
pursuant to the plan of reorganization. See § 1.358-6(d) for the effect on
P
's basis in its
S
or
T
stock, as applicable. For rules governing
S
's use of
P
stock in a reverse triangular merger, see section 361.
(d)
Examples.
The rules of this section are illustrated by the following examples. For purposes of these examples,
P, S,
and
T
are domestic corporations,
P
and
S
do not file consolidated returns,
P
owns all of the only class of
S
stock, the
P
stock exchanged in the transaction satisfies the requirements of the applicable reorganization provisions, and the facts set forth the only corporate activity.

# Example 1. Forward triangular merger solely for P stock.
(a)
Facts. T
has assets with an aggregate basis of $60 and fair market value of $100 and no liabilities. Pursuant to a plan,
P
forms
S
by transferring $100 of
P
stock to
S
and
T
merges into
S.
In the merger, the
T
shareholders receive, in exchange for their
T
stock, the
P
stock that
P
transferred to
S.
The transaction is a reorganization to which sections 368(a)(1)(A) and (a)(2)(D) apply.
(b)
No gain or loss recognized on the use of P stock.
Under paragraph (b) of this section, the
P
stock provided by
P
pursuant to the plan of reorganization is treated for purposes of § 1.1032-1(a) as disposed of by
P
for the
T
assets acquired by
S
in the merger. Consequently, neither
P
nor
S
has taxable gain or deductible loss on the exchange.

# Example 2. Forward triangular merger solely for P stock provided in part by S.
(a)
Facts. T
has assets with an aggregate basis of $60 and fair market value of $100 and no liabilities.
S
is an operating company with substantial assets that has been in existence for several years.
S
also owns
P
stock with a $20 adjusted basis and $30 fair market value.
S
acquired the
P
stock in an unrelated transaction several years before the reorganization. Pursuant to a plan,
P
transfers additional
P
stock worth $70 to
S
and
T
merges into
S.
In the merger, the
T
shareholders receive $100 of
P
stock ($70 of
P
stock provided by
P
to
S
as part of the plan and $30 of
P
stock held by
S
previously). The transaction is a reorganization to which sections 368(a)(1)(A) and (a)(2)(D) apply.
(b)
Gain or loss recognized by S on the use of its P
stock. Under paragraph (b) of this section, the $70 of
P
stock provided by
P
pursuant to the plan of reorganization is treated as disposed of by
P
for the
T
assets acquired by
S
in the merger. Consequently, neither
P
nor
S
has taxable gain or deductible loss on
the exchange of those shares. Under paragraph (c) of this section, however,
S
recognizes $10 of gain on the exchange of its
P
stock in the reorganization because
S
did not receive the
P
stock from
P
pursuant to the plan of reorganization. See § 1.358-6(d) for the effect on
P
's basis in its
S
stock.
(e)
Stock options.
The rules of this section shall apply to an option to buy or sell P stock issued by P in the same manner as the rules of this section apply to P stock.
(f)
Effective dates.
This section applies to triangular reorganizations occurring on or after December 23, 1994, except for paragraph (e) of this section, which applies to transfers of stock options occurring on or after May 16, 2000.
[T.D. 8648, 60 FR 66081, Dec. 21, 1995, as amended by T.D. 8883, 65 FR 31076, May 16, 2000]
§ 1.1032-3
Disposition of stock or stock options in certain transactions not qualifying under any other nonrecognition provision.
(a)
Scope.
This section provides rules for certain transactions in which a corporation or a partnership (the acquiring entity) acquires money or other property (as defined in § 1.1032-1) in exchange, in whole or in part, for stock of a corporation (the issuing corporation).
(b)
Nonrecognition of gain or loss
—(1)
General rule.
In a transaction to which this section applies, no gain or loss is recognized on the disposition of the issuing corporation's stock by the acquiring entity. The transaction is treated as if, immediately before the acquiring entity disposes of the stock of the issuing corporation, the acquiring entity purchased the issuing corporation's stock from the issuing corporation for fair market value with cash contributed to the acquiring entity by the issuing corporation (or, if necessary, through intermediate corporations or partnerships). For rules that may apply in determining the issuing corporation's adjustment to basis in the acquiring entity (or, if necessary, in determining the adjustment to basis in intermediate entities), see sections 358, 722, and the regulations thereunder.
(2)
Special rule for actual payment for stock of the issuing corporation.
If the issuing corporation receives money or other property in payment for its stock, the amount of cash deemed contributed under paragraph (b)(1) of this section is the difference between the fair market value of the issuing corporation stock and the amount of money or the fair market value of other property that the issuing corporation receives as payment.
(c)
Applicability.
The rules of this section apply only if, pursuant to a plan to acquire money or other property—
(1) The acquiring entity acquires stock of the issuing corporation directly or indirectly from the issuing corporation in a transaction in which, but for this section, the basis of the stock of the issuing corporation in the hands of the acquiring entity would be determined, in whole or in part, with respect to the issuing corporation's basis in the issuing corporation's stock under section 362(a) or 723 (provided that, in the case of an indirect acquisition by the acquiring entity, the transfers of issuing corporation stock through intermediate entities occur immediately after one another);
(2) The acquiring entity immediately transfers the stock of the issuing corporation to acquire money or other property (from a person other than an entity from which the stock was directly or indirectly acquired);
(3) The party receiving stock of the issuing corporation in the exchange specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section from the acquiring entity does not receive a substituted basis in the stock of the issuing corporation within the meaning of section 7701(a)(42); and
(4) The issuing corporation stock is not exchanged for stock of the issuing corporation.
(d)
Stock options.
The rules of this section shall apply to an option issued by a corporation to buy or sell its own stock in the same manner as the rules of this section apply to the stock of an issuing corporation.
(e)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this section:

# Example 1.
(i)
X,
a corporation, owns all of the stock of
Y
corporation.
Y
reaches an agreement with
C,
an individual, to acquire a truck from
C
in exchange for 10 shares of
X
stock with a fair market value of $100. To effectuate
Y'
s agreement with
C,
X
transfers to
Y
the
X
stock in a transaction in which, but for this section, the basis of the
X
stock
in the hands of
Y
would be determined with respect to
X'
s basis in the
X
stock under section 362(a).
Y
immediately transfers the
X
stock to
C
to acquire the truck.
(ii) In this
Example 1,
no gain or loss is recognized on the disposition of the
X
stock by
Y.
Immediately before
Y'
s disposition of the
X
stock,
Y
is treated as purchasing the
X
stock from
X
for $100 of cash contributed to
Y
by
X.
Under section 358,
X'
s basis in its
Y
stock is increased by $100.

# Example 2.
(i) Assume the same facts as
Example 1,
except that, rather than
X
stock,
X
transfers an option with a fair market value of $100 to purchase
X
stock.
(ii) In this
Example 2,
no gain or loss is recognized on the disposition of the
X
stock option by
Y.
Immediately before
Y
's disposition of the
X
stock option,
Y
is treated as purchasing the
X
stock option from
X
for $100 of cash contributed to
Y
by
X.
Under section 358,
X
's basis in its
Y
stock is increased by $100.

# Example 3.
(i)
X,
a corporation, owns all of the outstanding stock of
Y
corporation.
Y
is a partner in partnership
Z. Z
reaches an agreement with
C,
an individual, to acquire a truck from
C
in exchange for 10 shares of
X
stock with a fair market value of $100. To effectuate
Z
's agreement with
C, X
transfers to
Y
the
X
stock in a transaction in which, but for this section, the basis of the
X
stock in the hands of
Y
would be determined with respect to
X
's basis in the
X
stock under section 362(a).
Y
immediately transfers the
X
stock to
Z
in a transaction in which, but for this section, the basis of the
X
stock in the hands of
Z
would be determined under section 723.
Z
immediately transfers the
X
stock to
C
to acquire the truck.
(ii) In this
Example 3,
no gain or loss is recognized on the disposition of the
X
stock by
Z.
Immediately before
Z
's disposition of the
X
stock,
Z
is treated as purchasing the
X
stock from
X
for $100 of cash indirectly contributed to
Z
by
X
through an intermediate corporation,
Y.
Under section 722,
Y
's basis in its
Z
partnership interest is increased by $100, and, under section 358,
X
's basis in its
Y
stock is increased by $100.

# Example 4.
(i)
X,
a corporation, owns all of the outstanding stock of
Y
corporation.
B,
an individual, is an employee of
Y.
Pursuant to an agreement between
X
and
Y
to compensate
B
for services provided to
Y, X
transfers to
B
10 shares of
X
stock with a fair market value of $100. Under § 1.83-6(d), but for this section, the transfer of
X
stock by
X
to
B
would be treated as a contribution of the
X
stock by
X
to the capital of
Y,
and immediately thereafter, a transfer of the
X
stock by
Y
to
B.
But for this section, the basis of the
X
stock in the hands of
Y
would be determined with respect to
X
's basis in the
X
stock under section 362(a).
(ii) In this
Example 4,
no gain or loss is recognized on the deemed disposition of the
X
stock by
Y.
Immediately before
Y
's deemed disposition of the
X
stock,
Y
is treated as purchasing the
X
stock from
X
for $100 of cash contributed to
Y
by
X.
Under section 358,
X
's basis in its
Y
stock is increased by $100.

# Example 5.
(i)
X,
a corporation, owns all of the outstanding stock of
Y
corporation.
B,
an individual, is an employee of
Y.
To compensate
B
for services provided to
Y, B
is offered the opportunity to purchase 10 shares of
X
stock with a fair market value of $100 at a reduced price of $80.
B
transfers $80 and
Y
transfers $10 to
X
as partial payment for the
X
stock.
(ii) In this
Example 5,
no gain or loss is recognized on the deemed disposition of the
X
stock by
Y.
Immediately before
Y
's deemed disposition of the
X
stock,
Y
is treated as purchasing the
X
stock from
X
for $100, $80 of which
Y
is deemed to have received from
B,
$10 of which originated with
Y,
and $10 of which is deemed to have been contributed to
Y
by
X.
Under section 358,
X
's basis in its
Y
stock is increased by $10.

# Example 6.
(i)
X,
a corporation, owns stock of
Y.
To compensate
Y
's employee,
B,
for services provided to
Y, X
issues 10 shares of
X
stock to
B,
subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture.
B
does not have an election under section 83(b) in effect with respect to the
X
stock.
X
retains the only reversionary interest in the
X
stock in the event that
B
forfeits the right to the stock. Several years after
X
's transfer of the
X
shares, the stock vests. At the time the stock vests, the 10 shares of
X
stock have a fair market value of $100. Under § 1.83-6(d), but for this section, the transfer of the
X
stock by
X
to
B
would be treated, at the time the stock vests, as a contribution of the
X
stock by
X
to the capital of
Y,
and immediately thereafter, a disposition of the
X
stock by
Y
to
B.
The basis of the
X
stock in the hands of
Y,
but for this section, would be determined with respect to
X
's basis in the
X
stock under section 362(a).
(ii) In this
Example 6,
no gain or loss is recognized on the deemed disposition of
X
stock by
Y
when the stock vests. Immediately before
Y
's deemed disposition of the
X
stock,
Y
is treated as purchasing
X
's stock from
X
for $100 of cash contributed to
Y
by
X.
Under section 358,
X
's basis in its
Y
stock is increased by $100.

# Example 7.
(i) Assume the same facts as in
Example 6,
except that
Y
(rather than
X
) retains a reversionary interest in the
X
stock in the event that
B
forfeits the right to the stock. Several years after
X
's transfer of the
X
shares, the stock vests.
(ii) In this
Example 7,
this section does not apply to
Y
's deemed disposition of the
X
shares because
Y
is not deemed to have transferred the
X
stock to
B
immediately after receiving the stock from
X.
For the tax consequences to
Y
on the deemed disposition of the
X
stock, see § 1.83-6(b).

# Example 8.
(i)
X,
a corporation, owns all of the outstanding stock of
Y
corporation. In Year 1,
X
issues to
Y
's employee,
B,
a nonstatutory stock option to purchase 10 shares of
X
stock as compensation for services provided to
Y.
The option is exercisable against
X
and does not have a readily ascertainable fair market value (determined under § 1.83-7(b)) at the time the option is granted. In
Y
ear 2,
B
exercises the option by paying
X
the strike price of $80 for the
X
stock, which then has a fair market value of $100.
(ii) In this
Example 8,
because, under section 83(e)(3), section 83(a) does not apply to the grant of the option, paragraph (d) of this section also does not apply to the grant of the option. Section 83 and § 1.1032-3 apply in Year 2 when the option is exercised; thus, no gain or loss is recognized on the deemed disposition of
X
stock by
Y
in Year 2. Immediately before
Y
's deemed disposition of the
X
stock in Year 2,
Y
is treated as purchasing the
X
stock from
X
for $100, $80 of which
Y
is deemed to have received from B and the remaining $20 of which is deemed to have been contributed to
Y
by
X.
Under section 358,
X
's basis in its
Y
stock is increased by $20.

# Example 9.
(i)
A,
an individual, owns a majority of the stock of
X. X
owns stock of
Y
constituting control of
Y
within the meaning of section 368(c).
A
transfers 10 shares of its
X
stock to B, a key employee of
Y.
The fair market value of the 10 shares on the date of transfer was $100.
(ii) In this
Example 9, A
is treated as making a nondeductible contribution of the 10 shares of
X
to the capital of
X,
and no gain or loss is recognized by
A
as a result of this transfer. See
Commissioner v. Fink,
483 U.S. 89 (1987).
A
must allocate his basis in the transferred shares to his remaining shares of
X
stock. No gain or loss is recognized on the deemed disposition of the
X
stock by
Y.
Immediately before
Y
's disposition of the
X
stock,
Y
is treated as purchasing the
X
stock from
X
for $100 of cash contributed to
Y
by
X.
Under section 358,
X
's basis in its
Y
stock is increased by $100.

# Example 10.
(i) In Year 1,
X,
a corporation, forms a trust which will be used to satisfy deferred compensation obligations owed by
Y, X
's wholly owned subsidiary, to
Y
's employees.
X
funds the trust with
X
stock, which would revert to
X
upon termination of the trust, subject to the employees' rights to be paid the deferred compensation due to them. The creditors of
X
can reach all the trust assets upon the insolvency of
X.
Similarly,
Y
's creditors can reach all the trust assets upon the insolvency of
Y.
In Year 5, the trust transfers
X
stock to the employees of
Y
in satisfaction of the deferred compensation obligation.
(ii) In this
Example 10, X
is considered to be the grantor of the trust, and, under section 677,
X
is also the owner of the trust. Any income earned by the trust would be reflected on
X
's income tax return.
Y
is not considered a grantor or owner of the trust corpus at the time
X
transfers
X
stock to the trust. In Year 5, when employees of
Y
receive X stock in satisfaction of the deferred compensation obligation, no gain or loss is recognized on the deemed disposition of the
X
stock by
Y.
Immediately before
Y
's deemed disposition of the
X
stock,
Y
is treated as purchasing the
X
stock from
X
for fair market value using cash contributed to
Y
by
X.
Under section 358,
X
's basis in its
Y
stock increases by the amount of cash deemed contributed.
(f)
Effective date.
This section applies to transfers of stock or stock options of the issuing corporation occurring on or after May 16, 2000.

§ 1.1033(a)-1
Involuntary conversions; nonrecognition of gain.
(a)
In general.
Section 1033 applies to cases where property is compulsorily or involuntarily converted. An
involuntary conversion
may be the result of the destruction of property in whole or in part, the theft of property, the seizure of property, the requisition or condemnation of property, or the threat or imminence of requisition or condemnation of property. An
involuntary conversion
may be a conversion into similar property or into money or into dissimilar property. Section 1033 provides that, under certain specified circumstances, any gain which is realized from an involuntary conversion shall not be recognized. In cases where property is converted into other property similar or related in service or use to the converted property, no gain shall be recognized regardless of when the disposition of the converted property occurred and regardless of whether or not the taxpayer elects to have the gain not recognized. In other types of involuntary conversion cases, however, the proceeds arising from the disposition of the converted property must (within the time limits specified) be reinvested in similar property in order to avoid recognition of any gain realized. Section 1033 applies only with respect to gains; losses from involuntary conversions are recognized or not recognized without regard to this section.
(b)
Special rules.
For rules relating to the application of section 1033 to involuntary conversions of a principal residence with respect to which an election has been made under section 121 (relating to gain from sale or exchange of residence of individual who has attained age 65), see paragraph (g) of § 1.121-5. For rules applicable to involuntary conversions of a principal residence occurring before January 1, 1951, see § 1.1033(a)-3. For rules applicable to involuntary conversions of a principal residence occurring after December 31, 1950, and before January 1, 1954, see paragraph (h)(1) of § 1.1034-1. For rules applicable to involuntary conversions of a personal residence occurring after December 31, 1953, see § 1.1033(a)-3. For special rules relating to the election to have section 1034 apply to certain involuntary conversions of a principal reisdence occurring after December 31, 1957, see paragraph (h)(2) of § 1.1034-1. For special rules relating to certain involuntary conversions of real property held either for productive use in trade or business or for investment and occurring after December 31, 1957, see § 1.1033(g)-1. See also special rules applicable to involuntary conversions of property sold pursuant to reclamation laws, livestock destroyed by disease, and livestock sold on account of drought provided in §§ 1.1033(c)-1, 1.1033(d)-1, and 1.1033(e)-1, respectively. For rules relating to basis of property acquired through involuntary conversions, see § 1.1033(b)-1. For determination of the period for which the taxpayer has held property acquired as a result of certain involuntary conversions, see section 1223 and regulations issued thereunder. For treatment of gains from involuntary conversions as capital gains in certain cases, see section 1231(a) and regulations issued thereunder. For portion of war loss recoveries treated as gain on involuntary conversion, see section 1332(b)(3) and regulations issued thereunder.
(Secs. 1033 (90 Stat. 1920, 26 U.S.C. 1033), and 7805 (68A Stat. 917, 26 U.S.C. 7805))
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11910, Nov. 26, 1960, as amended by T.D. 6856, 30 FR 13318, Oct. 20, 1965; T.D. 7625, 44 FR 31013, May 30, 1979; T.D. 7758, 46 FR 6925, Jan. 22, 1981]
§ 1.1033(a)-2
Involuntary conversion into similar property, into money or into dissimilar property.
(a)
In general.
The term
disposition of the converted property
means the destruction, theft, seizure, requisition, or condemnation of the converted property, or the sale or exchange of such property under threat or imminence of requisition or condemnation.
(b)
Conversion into similar property.
If property (as a result of its destruction in whole or in part, theft, seizure, or requisition or condemnation or threat or imminence thereof) is compulsorily or involuntarily converted only into property similar or related in service or use to the property so converted, no gain shall be recognized. Such nonrecognition of gain is mandatory.
(c)
Conversion into money or into dissimilar property.
(1) If property (as a result of its destruction in whole or in part, theft, seizure, or requisition or condemnation or threat or imminence thereof) is compulsorily or involuntarily converted into money or into property not similar or related in service or use to the converted property, the gain, if any, shall be recognized, at the election of the taxpayer, only to the extent that the amount realized upon such conversion exceeds the cost of other property purchased by the taxpayer which is similar or related in service or use to the property so converted, or the cost of stock of a corporation owning such other property which is purchased by the taxpayer in the acquisition of control of such corporation, if the taxpayer purchased such other property, or such stock, for the purpose of replacing the property so converted and during the period specified in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph. For the purposes of section 1033, the term
control
means the ownership of stock possessing at least 80 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote and at least 80 percent of the total number of shares of all other classes of stock of the corporation.
(2) All of the details in connection with an involuntary conversion of property at a gain (including those relating to the replacement of the converted property, or a decision not to replace, or the expiration of the period
for replacement) shall be reported in the return for the taxable year or years in which any of such gain is realized. An election to have such gain recognized only to the extent provided in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall be made by including such gain in gross income for such year or years only to such extent. If, at the time of filing such a return, the period within which the converted property must be replaced has expired, or if such an election is not desired, the gain should be included in gross income for such year or years in the regular manner. A failure to so include such gain in gross income in the regular manner shall be deemed to be an election by the taxpayer to have such gain recognized only to the extent provided in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph even though the details in connection with the conversion are not reported in such return. If, after having made an election under section 1033(a)(2), the converted property is not replaced within the required period of time, or replacement is made at a cost lower than was anticipated at the time of the election, or a decision is made not to replace, the tax liability for the year or years for which the election was made shall be recomputed. Such recomputation should be in the form of an
amended return.
If a decision is made to make an election under section 1033(a)(2) after the filing of the return and the payment of the tax for the year or years in which any of the gain on an involuntary conversion is realized and before the expiration of the period within which the converted property must be replaced, a claim for credit or refund for such year or years should be filed. If the replacement of the converted property occurs in a year or years in which none of the gain on the conversion is realized, all of the details in connection with such replacement shall be reported in the return for such year or years.
(3) The period referred to in subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph is the period of time commencing with the date of the disposition of the converted property, or the date of the beginning of the threat or imminence of requisition or condemnation of the converted property, whichever is earlier, and ending 2 years (or, in the case of a disposition occurring before December 31, 1969, 1 year) after the close of the first taxable year in which any part of the gain upon the conversion is realized, or at the close of such later date as may be designated pursuant to an application of the taxpayer. Such application shall be made prior to the expiration of 2 years (or, in the case of a disposition occurring before December 31, 1969, 1 year) after the close of the first taxable year in which any part of the gain from the conversion is realized, unless the taxpayer can show to the satisfaction of the district director—
(i) Reasonable cause for not having filed the application within the required period of time, and
(ii) The filing of such application was made within a reasonable time after the expiration of the required period of time. The application shall contain all of the details in connection with the involuntary conversion. Such application shall be made to the district director for the internal revenue district in which the return is filed for the first taxable year in which any of the gain from the involuntary conversion is realized. No extension of time shall be granted pursuant to such application unless the taxpayer can show reasonable cause for not being able to replace the converted property within the required period of time.
See section 1033(g)(4) and § 1.1033(g)-1 for the circumstances under which, in the case of the conversion of real property held either for productive use in trade or business or for investment, the 2-year period referred to in this paragraph (c)(3) shall be extended to 3 years.
(4) Property or stock purchased before the disposition of the converted property shall be considered to have been purchased for the purpose of replacing the converted property only if such property or stock is held by the taxpayer on the date of the disposition of the converted property. Property or stock shall be considered to have been purchased only if, but for the provisions of section 1033(b), the unadjusted basis of such property or stock would be its cost to the taxpayer within the
meaning of section 1012. If the taxpayers unadjusted basis of the replacement property would be determined, in the absence of section 1033(b), under any of the exceptions referred to in section 1012, the unadjusted basis of the property would not be its cost within the meaning of section 1012. For example, if property similar or related in service or use to the converted property is acquired by gift and its basis is determined under section 1015, such property will not qualify as a replacement for the converted property.
(5) If a taxpayer makes an election under section 1033(a)(2), any deficiency, for any taxable year in which any part of the gain upon the conversion is realized, which is attributable to such gain may be assessed at any time before the expiration of three years from the date the district director with whom the return for such year has been filed is notified by the taxpayer of the replacement of the converted property or of an intention not to replace, or of a failure to replace, within the required period, notwithstanding the provisions of section 6212(c) or the provisions of any other law or rule of law which would otherwise prevent such assessment. If replacement has been made, such notification shall contain all of the details in connection with such replacement. Such notification should be made in the return for the taxable year or years in which the replacement occurs, or the intention not to replace is formed, or the period for replacement expires, if this return is filed with such district director. If this return is not filed with such district director, then such notification shall be made to such district director at the time of filing this return. If the taxpayer so desires, he may, in either event, also notify such district director before the filing of such return.
(6) If a taxpayer makes an election under section 1033(a)(2) and the replacement property or stock was purchased before the beginning of the last taxable year in which any part of the gain upon the conversion is realized, any deficiency, for any taxable year ending before such last taxable year, which is attributable to such election may be assessed at any time before the expiration of the period within which a deficiency for such last taxable year may be assessed, notwithstanding the provisions of section 6212(c) or 6501 or the provisions of any law or rule of law which would otherwise prevent such assessment.
(7) If the taxpayer makes an election under section 1033(a)(2), the gain upon the conversion shall be recognized to the extent that the amount realized upon such conversion exceeds the cost of the replacement property or stock, regardless of whether such amount is realized in one or more taxable years.
(8) The proceeds of a use and occupancy insurance contract, which by its terms insured against actual loss sustained of net profits in the business, are not proceeds of an involuntary conversion but are income in the same manner that the profits for which they are substituted would have been.
(9) There is no investment in property similar in character and devoted to a similar use if—
(i) The proceeds of unimproved real estate, taken upon condemnation proceedings, are invested in improved real estate.
(ii) The proceeds of conversion of real property are applied in reduction of indebtedness previously incurred in the purchase or a leasehold.
(iii) The owner of a requisitioned tug uses the proceeds to buy barges.
(10) If, in a condemnation proceeding, the Government retains out of the award sufficient funds to satisfy special assessments levied against the remaining portion of the plot or parcel of real estate affected for benefits accruing in connection with the condemnation, the amount so retained shall be deducted from the gross award in determining the amount of the net award.
(11) If, in a condemnation proceeding, the Government retains out of the award sufficient funds to satisfy liens (other than liens due to special assessments levied against the remaining portion of the plot or parcel of real estate affected for benefits accruing in connection with the condemnation) and mortgages against the property, and itself pays the same, the amount so retained shall not be deducted from the gross award in determining the
amount of the net award. If, in a condemnation proceeding, the Government makes an award to a mortgagee to satisfy a mortgage on the condemned property, the amount of such award shall be considered as a part of the
amount realized
upon the conversion regardless of whether or not the taxpayer was personally liable for the mortgage debt. Thus, if a taxpayer has acquired property worth $100,000 subject to a $50,000 mortgage (regardless of whether or not he was personally liable for the mortgage debt) and, in a condemnation proceeding, the Government awards the taxpayer $60,000 and awards the mortgagee $50,000 in satisfaction of the mortgage, the entire $110,000 is considered to be the
amount realized
by the taxpayer.
(12) An amount expended for replacement of an asset, in excess of the recovery for loss, represents a capital expenditure and is not a deductible loss for income tax purposes.
(Secs. 1033 (90 Stat. 1920, 26 U.S.C. 1033), and 7805 (68A Stat. 917, 26 U.S.C. 7805)

§ 1.1033(a)-3
Involuntary conversion of principal residence.
Section 1033 shall apply in the case of property used by the taxpayer as his principal residence if the destruction, theft, seizure, requisition, or condemnation of such residence, or the sale or exchange of such residence under threat or imminence thereof, occurs before January 1, 1951, or after December 31, 1953. However, section 1033 shall not apply to the seizure, requisition, or condemnation (but not destruction), or the sale or exchange under threat or imminence thereof, of such residence property if the seizure, requisition, condemnation, sale, or exchange occurs after December 31, 1957, and if the taxpayer properly elects under section 1034(i) to treat the transaction as a sale (see paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of § 1.1034-1). See section 121 and paragraphs (d) and (g) of § 1.121-5 for special rules relating to the involuntary conversion of a principal residence of individuals who have attained age 65.

§ 1.1033(b)-1
Basis of property acquired as a result of an involuntary conversion.
(a) The provisions of the first sentence of section 1033(b) may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example:
A's vessel which has an adjusted basis of $100,000 is destroyed in 1950 and A receives in 1951 insurance in the amount of $200,000. If A invests $150,000 in a new vessel, taxable gain to the extent of $50,000 would be recognized. The basis of the new vessel is $100,000; that is, the adjusted basis of the old vessel ($100,000) minus the money received by the taxpayer which was not expended in the acquisition of the new vessel ($50,000) plus the amount of gain recognized upon the conversion ($50,000). If any amount in excess of the proceeds of the conversion is expended in the acquisition of the new property, such amount may be added to the basis otherwise determined.
(b) The provisions of the last sentence of section 1033(b) may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example:
A taxpayer realizes $22,000 from the involuntary conversion of his barn in 1955; the adjusted basis of the barn to him was $10,000, and he spent in the same year $20,000 for a new barn which resulted in the nonrecognition of $10,000 of the $12,000 gain on the conversion. The basis of the new barn to the taxpayer would be $10,000—the cost of the new barn ($20,000) less the amount of the gain not recognized on the conversion ($10,000). The basis of the new barn would not be a substituted basis in the hands of the taxpayer within the meaning of section 1016(b)(2). If the replacement of the converted barn had been made by the purchase of two smaller barns which, together, were similar or related in service or use to the converted barn and which cost $8,000 and $12,000, respectively, then the basis of the two barns would be $4,000 and $6,000, respectively, the total basis of the purchased property ($10,000) allocated in proportion to their respective costs (8,000/ 20,000 of $10,000 or $4,000; and 12,000/20,000 of $10,000, or $6,000).

§ 1.1033(c)-1
Disposition of excess property within irrigation project deemed to be involuntary conversion.
(a) The sale, exchange, or other disposition occurring in a taxable year to which the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 applies, of excess lands lying within an irrigation project or division in order to conform to acreage limitations of the Federal reclamation laws effective with respect to such project or division shall be treated as an involuntary conversion to which the provisions of section 1033 and the regulations thereunder shall be applicable. The term
excess lands
means irrigable lands within an irrigation project or division held by one owner in excess of the amount of irrigable land held by such owner entitled to receive water under the Federal reclamation laws applicable to such owner in such project or division. Such excess lands may be either (1) lands receiving no water from the project or division, or (2) lands receiving water only because the owner thereof has executed a valid recordable contract agreeing to sell such lands under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Secretary of the Interior.
(b) If a disposition in order to conform to the acreage limitation provisions of Federal reclamation laws includes property other than excess lands (as, for example, where the excess lands alone do not constitute a marketable parcel) the provisions of section 1033(d) shall apply only to the part of the disposition that relates to excess lands.
(c) The provisions of § 1.1033(a)-2 shall be applicable in the case of dispositions treated as involuntary conversions under this section. The details in connection with such a disposition required to be reported under paragraph (c)(2) of § 1.1033(a)-2 shall include the authority whereby the lands disposed of are considered
excess lands,
as defined in this section, and a statement that such disposition is not part of a plan contemplating the disposition of all or any nonexcess land within the irrigation project or division.
(d) The term
involuntary conversion,
where it appears in subtitle A of the Code or the regulations thereunder, includes dispositions of excess property within irrigation projects described in this section. (See, e.g., section 1231 and the regulations thereunder.)

§ 1.1033(d)-1
Destruction or disposition of livestock because of disease.
(a) The destruction occurring in a taxable year to which the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 applies, of livestock by, or on account of, disease, or the sale or exchange, in such a year, of livestock because of disease, shall be treated as an involuntary conversion to which the provisions of section 1033 and the regulations thereunder shall be applicable. Livestock which are killed either because they are diseased or because of exposure to disease shall be considered destroyed on account of disease. Livestock which are sold or exchanged because they are diseased or have been exposed to disease, and would not otherwise have been sold or exchanged at that particular time shall be considered sold or exchanged because of disease.
(b) The provisions of § 1.1033(a)-2 shall be applicable in the case of a disposition treated as an involuntary conversion under this section. The details in connection with such a disposition required to be reported under paragraph (c)(2) of § 1.1033(a)-2 shall include a recital of the evidence that the livestock were destroyed by or on account of disease, or sold or exchanged because of disease.
(c) The term
involuntary conversion,
where it appears in subtitle A of the Code or the regulations thereunder, includes disposition of livestock described in this section. (See, e.g., section 1231 and the regulations thereunder.)

§ 1.1033(e)-1
Sale or exchange of livestock solely on account of drought.
(a) The sale or exchange of livestock (other than poultry) held for draft, breeding, or dairy purposes in excess of the number the taxpayer would sell or exchange during the taxable year if he followed his usual business practices
shall be treated as an involuntary conversion to which section 1033 and the regulations thereunder are applicable if the sale or exchange of such livestock by the taxpayer is solely on account of drought. Section 1033(e) and this section shall apply only to sales and exchanges occurring after December 31, 1955.
(b) To qualify under section 1033(e) and this section, the sale or exchange of the livestock need not take place in a drought area. While it is not necessary that the livestock be held in a drought area, the sale or exchange of the livestock must be solely on account of drought conditions the existence of which affected the water, grazing, or other requirements of the livestock so as to necessitate their sale or exchange.
(c) The total sales or exchanges of livestock held for draft, breeding, or dairy purposes occurring in any taxable year which may qualify as an involuntary conversion under section 1033(e) and this section is limited to the excess of the total number of such livestock sold or exchanged during the taxable year over the number that the taxpayer would have sold or exchanged if he had followed his usual business practices, that is, the number he would have been expected to sell or exchange under ordinary circumstances if there had been no drought. For example, if in the past it has been a taxpayer's practice to sell or exchange annually one-half of his herd of dairy cows, only the number sold or exchanged solely on account of drought conditions which is in excess of one-half of his herd, may qualify as an involuntary conversion under section 1033(e) and this section.
(d) The replacement requirements of section 1033 will be satisfied only if the livestock sold or exchanged is replaced within the prescribed period with livestock which is similar or related in service or use to the livestock sold or exchanged because of drought, that is, the new livestock must be functionally the same as the livestock involuntarily converted. This means that the new livestock must be held for the same useful purpose as the old was held. Thus, although dairy cows could be replaced by dairy cows, a taxpayer could not replace draft animals with breeding or dairy animals.
(e) The provisions of § 1.1033(a)-2 shall be applicable in the case of a sale or exchange treated as an involuntary conversion under this section. The details in connection with such a disposition required to be reported under paragraph (c)(2) of § 1.1033(a)-2 shall include:
(1) Evidence of the existence of the drought conditions which forced the sale or exchange of the livestock;
(2) A computation of the amount of gain realized on the sale or exchange;
(3) The number and kind of livestock sold or exchanged; and
(4) The number of livestocks of each kind that would have been sold or exchanged under the usual business practice in the absence of the drought.
(f) The term
involuntary conversion,
where it appears in subtitle A of the Code or the regulations thereunder, includes the sale or exchange of livestock described in this section.
(g) The provisions of section 1033(e) and this section apply to taxable years ending after December 31, 1955, but only in the case of sales or exchange of livestock after December 31, 1955.

§ 1.1033(g)-1
Condemnation of real property held for productive use in trade or business or for investment.
(a)
Special rule in general.
This section provides special rules for applying section 1033 with respect to certain dispositions, occurring after December 31, 1957, of real property held either for productive use in trade or business or for investment (not including stock in trade or other property held primarily for sale). For this purpose, disposition means the seizure, requisition, or condemnation (but not destruction) of the converted property, or the sale or exchange of such property under threat or imminence of seizure, requisition, or condemnation. In such cases, for purposes of applying section 1033, the replacement of such property with property of like kind to be held either for productive use in trade or business or for investment shall be treated as property similar or related in service or use
to the property so converted. For principles in determining whether the replacement property is property of like kind, see paragraph (b) of § 1.1031(a)-1.
(b)
Election to treat outdoor advertising displays as real property
—(1)
In general.
Under section 1033(g)(3) of the Code, a taxpayer may elect to treat property which constitutes an outdoor advertising display as real property for purposes of chapter 1 of the Code. The election is available for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1970. In the case of an election made on or before July 21, 1981, the election is available whether or not the period for filing a claim for credit or refund under section 6511 has expired. No election may be made with respect to any property for which (i) the investment credit under section 38 has been claimed, or (ii) an election to expense certain depreciable business assets under section 179(a) is in effect. The election once made applies to all outdoor advertising displays of the taxpayer which may be made the subject of an election under this paragraph, including all outdoor advertising displays acquired or constructed by the taxpayer in a taxable year after the taxable year for which the election is made. The election applies with respect to dispositions during the taxable year for which made and all subsequent taxable years (unless an effective revocation is made pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) (ii) or (iii)).
(2)
Election
—(i)
Time and manner of making election
—(A)
In general.
Unless otherwise provided in the return or in the instructions for a return for a taxable year, any election made under section 1033(g)(3) shall be made by attaching a statement to the return (or amended return if filed on or before July 21, 1981) for the first taxable year to which the election is to apply. Any election made under this paragraph must be made not later than the time, including extensions thereof, prescribed by law for filing the income tax return for such taxable year or July 21, 1981, whichever occurs last. If a taxpayer makes an election (or revokes an election under subdivision (ii) or (iii) of this subparagraph (b) (2)) for a taxable year for which he or she has previously filed a return, the return for that taxable year and all other taxable years affected by the election (or revocation) must be amended to reflect any tax consequences of the election (or revocation). However, no return for a taxable year for which the period for filing a claim for credit or refund under section 6511 has expired may be amended to make any changes other than those resulting from the election (or revocation). In order for the election (or revocation) to be effective, the taxpayer must remit with the amended return any additional tax due resulting from the election (or revocation), notwithstanding the provisions of section 6212(c) or 6501 or the provisions of any other law which would prevent assessment or collection of such tax.
(B)
Statement required when making election.
The statement required when making the election must clearly indicate that the election to treat outdoor advertising displays as real property is being made.
(ii)
Revocation of election by Commissioner's consent.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, an election under section 1033(g)(3) shall be irrevocable unless consent to revoke is obtained from the Commissioner. In order to secure the Commissioner's consent to revoke an election, the taxpayer must file a request for revocation of election with the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Washington, DC 20224. The request for revocation shall include—
(A) The taxpayer's name, address, and taxpayer identification number,
(B) The date on which and taxable year for which the election was made and the Internal Revenue Service office with which it was filed,
(C) Identification of all outdoor advertising displays of the taxpayer to which the revocation would apply (including the location, date of purchase, and adjusted basis in such property),
(D) The effective date desired for the revocation, and
(E) The reasons for requesting the revocation.
The Commissioner may require such other information as may be necessary in order to determine whether the requested revocation will be permitted. The Commissioner may prescribe administrative procedures (subject to
such limitations, terms and conditions as he deems necessary) to obtain his consent to permit the taxpayer to revoke the election. The taxpayer may submit a request for revocation for any taxable year for which the period of limitations for filing a claim for credit or refund or overpayment of tax has not expired.
(iii)
Revocation where election was made on or before December 11, 1979.
In the case of an election made on or before December 11, 1979, the taxpayer may revoke such election provided such revocation is made not later than March 23, 1981. The request for revocation shall be made in conformity with the requirements of paragraph (b)(2)(ii), except that, in lieu of the information required by paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(E), the taxpayer shall state that the revocation is being made pursuant to this paragraph. In addition, the taxpayer must forward, with the statement of revocation, copies of his or her tax returns, including both the original return and any amended returns, for the taxable year in which the original election was made and for all subsequent years and must remit any additional tax due as a result of the revocation.
(3)
Definition of outdoor advertising display.
The term
outdoor advertising display
means a rigidly assembled sign, display, or device that constitutes, or is used to display, a commercial or other advertisement to the public and is permanently affixed to the ground or permanently attached to a building or other inherently permanent structure. The term includes highway billboards affixed to the ground with wood or metal poles, pipes, or beams, with or without concrete footings.
(4)
Character of replacement property.
For purposes of section 1033(g), an interest in real property purchased as replacement property for a compulsorily or involuntarily converted outdoor advertising display (with respect to which an election under this section is in effect) shall be considered property of a like kind as the property converted even though a taxpayer's interest in the replacement property is different from the interest held in the property converted. Thus, for example, a fee simple interest in real estate acquired to replace a converted billboard and a 5-year leasehold interest in the real property on which the billboard was located qualifies as property of a like kind under this section.
(c)
Special rule for period within which property must be replaced.
In the case of a disposition described in paragraph (a) of this section, section 1033(a)(2)(B) and § 1.1033(a)-2(c)(3) (relating to the period within which the property must be replaced) shall be applied by substituting 3 years for 2 years. This paragraph shall apply to any disposition described in section 1033(f)(1) and paragraph (a) of this section occurring after December 31, 1974, unless a condemnation proceeding with respect to the property was begun before October 4, 1976. Thus, regardless of when the property is disposed of, the taxpayer will not be eligible for the 3-year replacement period if a condemnation proceeding was begun before October 4, 1976. However, if the property is disposed of after December 31, 1974, and the condemnation proceeding was begun (if at all) after October 4, 1976, then the taxpayer is eligible for the 3-year replacement period. For the purposes of this paragraph, whether a condemnation proceeding is considered as having begun is determined under the applicable State or Federal procedural law.
(d)
Limitation on application of special rule.
This section shall not apply to the purchase of stock in the acquisition of control of a corporation described in section 1033(a)(2)(A).

Effective date.
Except as provided otherwise in § 1.1033(e)-1 and § 1.1033(g)-1, the provisions of section 1033 and the regulations thereunder are effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1953, and ending after August 16, 1954.

§ 1.1035-1
Certain exchanges of insurance policies.
Under the provisions of section 1035 no gain or loss is recognized on the exchange of:
(a) A contract of life insurance for another contract of life insurance or for an endowment or annuity contract (section 1035(a)(1));
(b) A contract of endowment insurance for another contract of endowment insurance providing for regular payments beginning at a date not later than the date payments would have begun under the contract exchanged, or an annuity contract (section 1035(a)(2)); or
(c) An annuity contract for another annuity contract (section 1035(a)(3)), but section 1035 does not apply to such exchanges if the policies exchanged to not relate to the same insured. The exchange, without recognition of gain or loss, of an annuity contract for another annuity contract under section 1035(a)(3) is limited to cases where the same person or persons are the obligee or obligees under the contract received in exchange as under the original contract. This section and section 1035 do not apply to transactions involving the exchange of an endowment contract or annuity contract for a life insurance contract, nor an annuity contract for an endowment contract. In the case of such exchanges, any gain or loss shall be recognized. In the case of exchanges which would be governed by section 1035 except for the fact that the property received in exchange consists not only of property which could otherwise be received without the recognition of gain or loss, but also of other property or money, see section 1031 (b) and (c) and the regulations thereunder. Such an exchange does not come within the provisions of section 1035. Determination of the basis of property acquired in an exchange under section 1035(a) shall be governed by section 1031(d) and the regulations thereunder.
§ 1.1036-1
Stock for stock of the same corporation.
(a) Section 1036 permits the exchange, without the recognition of gain or loss, of common stock for common stock, or of preferred stock for preferred stock, in the same corporation. Section 1036 applies even though voting stock is exchanged for nonvoting stock or nonvoting stock is exchanged for voting stock. It is not limited to an exchange between two individual stockholders; it includes a transaction between a stockholder and the corporation. However, a transaction between a stockholder and the corporation may qualify not only under section 1036(a), but also under section 368(a)(1)(E) (recapitalization) or section 305(a) (distribution of stock and stock rights). The provisions of section 1036(a) do not apply if stock is exchanged for bonds, or preferred stock is exchanged for common stock, or common stock is exchanged for preferred stock, or common stock in one corporation is exchanged for common stock in another corporation. See paragraph (l) of section 1301-1 for certain transactions treated as distributions under section 301. See paragraph (e)(5) of § 1.368-2 for certain transactions which result in deemed distributions under section 305(c) to which sections 305(b)(4) and 301 apply.
(b) For rules relating to recognition of gain or loss where an exchange is not wholly in kind, see subsections (b) and (c) of section 1031. For rules relating to the basis of property acquired in an exchange described in paragraph (a) of this section, see subsection (d) of section 1031.
(c) A transfer is not within the provisions of section 1036(a) if as part of the consideration the other party to the exchange assumes a liability of the taxpayer (or if the property transferred is subject to a liability), but the transfer, if otherwise qualified, will be within the provisions of section 1031(b).
(d)
Nonqualified preferred stock.
See § 1.356-7(a) for the applicability of the definition of nonqualified preferred stock in section 351(g)(2) for stock issued prior to June 9, 1997, and for stock issued in transactions occurring after June 8, 1997, that are described in section 1014(f)(2) of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, Public Law 105-34 (111 Stat. 788, 921).
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11910, Nov. 26, 1960, as amended by T.D. 7281, 38 FR 18540, July 12, 1973; T.D. 8904, 65 FR 58652, Oct. 2, 2000]
§ 1.1037-1
Certain exchanges of United States obligations.
(a)
Nonrecognition of gain or loss
—(1)
In general.
Section 1037(a) provides for the nonrecognition of gain or loss on the surrender to the United States of obligations of the United States issued under the Second Liberty Bond Act (31 U.S.C. 774(2)) when such obligations are exchanged solely for other obligations issued under that Act and the Secretary provides by regulations promulgated in connection with the issue of such other obligations that gain or loss is not to be recognized on such exchange. It is not necessary that at the time of the exchange the obligation which is surrendered to the United States be a capital asset in the hands of the taxpayer. For purposes of section 1037(a) and this subparagraph, a circular of the Treasury Department which offers to exchange obligations of the United States issued under the Second Liberty Bond Act for other obligations issued under that Act shall constitute regulations promulgated by the Secretary in connection with the issue of the obligations offered to be exchanged if such circular contains a declaration by the Secretary that no gain or loss shall be recognized for Federal income tax purposes on the exchange or grants the privilege of continuing to defer the reporting of the income of the bonds exchanged until such time as the bonds received in the exchange are redeemed or disposed of, or have reached final maturity, whichever is earlier. See, for example, regulations of the Bureau of the Public Debt, 31 CFR part 339, or Treasury Department Circular 1066, 26 FR 8647. The application of section 1037(a) and this subparagraph will not be precluded merely because the taxpayer is required to pay money on the exchange. See section 1031 and the regulations thereunder if the taxpayer receives money on the exchange.
(2)
Recognition of gain or loss postponed.
Gain or loss which has been realized but not recognized on the exchange of a U.S. obligation for another such obligation because of the provisions of section 1037(a) (or so much of section 1031 (b) or (c) as related to section 1037(a)) shall be recognized at such time as the obligation received in the exchange is disposed of, or redeemed, in a transaction other than an exchange described in section 1037(a) (or so much of section 1031 (b) or (c) as relates to section 1037(a)) or reaches final maturity, whichever is earlier, to the extent gain or loss is realized on such later transaction.
(3)
Illustrations.
The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples, in which it is assumed that the taxpayer uses the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting and has never elected under section 454(a) to include in gross income currently the annual increase in the redemption price of non-interest-bearing obligations issued at a discount. In addition, it is assumed that the old obligations exchanged are capital assets transferred in an exchange in respect of which regulations are promulgated pursuant to section 1037(a):

# Example 1.
A, the owner of a $1,000 series E U.S. savings bond purchased for $750 and bearing an issue date of May 1, 1945, surrenders the bond to the United States in exchange solely for series H U.S. savings bonds on February 1, 1964, when the series E bond has a redemption value of $1,304.80. In the exchange A pays an additional $195.20 and obtains three $500 series H bonds. None of the $554.80 gain ($1,304.80 less $750) realized by A on the series E bond is recognized at the time of the exchange.

# Example 2.
In 1963, B purchased for $97 a marketable U.S. bond which was originally issued at its par value of $100. In 1964 he surrenders the bond to the United States in exchange solely for another marketable U.S. bond which then has a fair market value of $95. B's loss of $2 on the old bond is not recognized at the time of the exchange, and his basis for the new bond is $97 under section 1031(d). If it has been necessary for B to pay $1 additional consideration in the exchange, his basis in the new bond would be $98.

# Example 3.
The facts are the same as in example (2) except that B also receives $1 interest on the old bond for the period which has elapsed since the last interest payment date and that B does not pay any additional consideration on the exchange. As in example (2), B has a loss of $2 which is not recognized at the time of the exchange and his basis in the new bond is $97. In addition, the $1 of interest received on the old bond is includible in gross income. B holds the new bond 1 year and sells it in the market for $99 plus interest. At this time he has a gain of $2, the difference between his basis of $97 in the new bond and the sales price of such bond. In addition, the interest received on the new bond is includible in gross income.

# Example 4.
The facts are the same as in example (2), except that in addition to the new bond B also receives $1.85 in cash, $0.85 of which is interest. The $0.85 interest received is includible in gross income. B's loss of $1 ($97 less $96) on the old bond is not recognized at the time of the exchange by reason of section 1031(c). Under section 1031(d) B's basis in the new bond is $96 (his basis of $97 in the old bond, reduced by the $1 cash received in the exchange).

# Example 5.
(a) For $975 D subscribes to a marketable U.S. obligation which has a face value of $1,000. Thereafter, he surrenders this obligation to the United States in exchange solely for a 10-year marketable $1,000 obligation which at the time of exchange has a fair market value of $930, at which price such obligation is initially offered to the public. At the time of issue of the new obligation there was no intention to call it before maturity. Five years after the exchange D sells the new obligation for $960.
(b) On the exchange of the old obligation for the new obligation D sustains a loss of $45 ($975 less $930), none of which is recognized pursuant to section 1037(a).
(c) The basis of the new obligation in D's hands, determined under section 1031(d), is $975 (the same basis as that of the old obligation).
(d) On the sale of the new obligation D sustains a loss of $15 ($975 less $960), all of which is recognized by reason of section 1002.

# Example 6.
(a) The facts are the same as in example (5), except that five years after the exchange D sells the new obligation for $1,020.
(b) On the exchange of the old obligation for the new obligation D sustains a loss of $45 ($975 less $930), none of which is recognized pursuant to section 1037(a).
(c) The basis of the new obligation in D's hands, determined under section 1031(d), is $975 (the same basis as that of the old obligation). The issue price of the new obligation under section 1232(b)(2) is $930.
(d) On the sale of the new obligation D realizes a gain of $45 ($1,020 less $975), all of which is recognized by reason of section 1002. Of this gain of $45, the amount of $35 is treated as ordinary income and $10 is treated as long-term capital gain, determined as follows:
(1) Ordinary income under first sentence of section 1232(a)(2)(B) on sale of new obligation:
Stated redemption price of new obligation at maturity
$1,000
Less: Issue price of new obligation under section 1232(b)(2)
930
Original issue discount on new obligation
70
Proration under section 1232(a)(2)(B)(ii): ($70 × 60 months/120 months)
35
(2) Long-term capital gain ($45 less $35)
10

# Example 7.
(a) The facts are the same as in example (5), except that D retains the new obligation and redeems it at maturity for $1,000.
(b) On the exchange of the old obligation for the new obligation D sustains a loss of $45 ($975 less $930), none of which is recognized pursuant to section 1037(a).
(c) The basis of the new obligation in D's hands, determined under section 1031(d), is $975 (the same basis as that of the old obligation). The issue price of the new obligation is $930 under section 1232(b)(2).
(d) On the redemption of the new obligation D realizes a gain of $25 ($1,000 less $975), all of which is recognized by reason of section 1002. Of this gain of $25, the entire amount is treated as ordinary income, determined as follows:
Ordinary income under first sentence of section 1232(a)(2)(B) on redemption of new obligation:
Stated redemption price of new obligation at maturity
$1,000
Less: Issue price of new obligation under section 1232(b)(2)
930
Original issue discount on new obligation
70
Proration under section 1232(a)(2)(B)(ii): ($70 × 120 months/120 months), but such amount not to exceed the $25 gain recognized on redemption
25
(b)
Application of section 1232 upon disposition or redemption of new obligation
—(1)
Exchanges involving nonrecognition of gain on obligations issued at a discount.
If an obligation, the gain on which is subject to the first sentence of section 1232(a)(2)(B), because the obligation was originally issued at a discount, is surrendered to the United States in exchange for another obligation and any part of the gain realized on the exchange is not then recognized because of the provisions of section 1037(a) (or because of so much of section 1031(b) as relates to section 1037(a)), the first sentence of section 1232(a)(2)(B) shall apply to so much of such unrecognized
gain as is later recognized upon the disposition or redemption of the obligation which is received in the exchange as though the obligation so disposed of or redeemed were the obligation surrendered, rather than the obligation received, in such exchange. See the first sentence of section 1037(b)(1). Thus, in effect that portion of the gain which is unrecognized on the exchange but is recognized upon the later disposition or redemption of the obligation received from the United States in the exchange shall be considered as ordinary income in an amount which is equal to the gain which, by applying the first sentence of section 1232(a)(2)(B) upon the earlier surrender of the old obligation to the United States, would have been considered as ordinary income if the gain had been recognized upon such earlier exchange. Any portion of the gain which is recognized under section 1031(b) upon the earlier exchange and is treated at such time as ordinary income shall be deducted from the gain which is treated as ordinary income by applying the first sentence of section 1232(a)(2)(B) pursuant to this subparagraph upon the disposition or redemption of the obligation which is received in the earlier exchange. This subparagraph shall apply only in a case where on the exchange of United States obligations there was some gain not recognized by reason of section 1037(a) (or so much of section 1031(b) as relates to section 1037(a)); it shall not apply where, only loss was unrecognized by reason of section 1037(a).
(2)
Rules to apply when a nontransferable obligation is surrendered in the exchange.
For purposes of applying both section 1232(a)(2)(B) and subparagraph (1) of this paragraph to the total gain realized on the obligation which is later disposed of or redeemed, if the obligation surrendered to the United States in the earlier exchange is a nontransferable obligation described in section 454 (a) or (c)—
(i) The aggregate amount considered, with respect to the obligation so surrendered in the earlier exchange, as ordinary income shall not exceed the difference between the issue price of the surrendered obligation and the stated redemption price of the surrendered obligation which applied at the time of the earlier exchange, and
(ii) The issue price of the obligation which is received from the United States in the earlier exchange shall be considered to be the stated redemption price of the surrendered obligation which applied at the time of the earlier exchange, increased by the amount of other consideration (if any) paid to the United States as part of the earlier exchange.
If the obligation received in the earlier exchange is a nontransferable obligation described in section 454(c) and such obligation is partially redeemed before final maturity or partially disposed of by being partially reissued to another owner, the amount determined by applying subdivision (i) of this subparagraph shall be determined on a basis proportional to the total denomination of obligations redeemed or disposed of. See paragraph (c) of § 1.454-1.
(3)
Long-term capital gain.
If, in a case where both subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph are applied, the total gain realized on the redemption or disposition of the obligation which is received from the United States in the exchange to which section 1037(a) (or so much of section 1031(b) as related to section 1037(a)) applies exceeds the amount of gain which, by applying such subparagraphs, is treated as ordinary income, the gain in excess of such amount shall be treated as long-term capital gain.
(4)
Illustrations.
The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples, in which it is assumed that the taxpayer uses the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting and has never elected under section 454(a) to include in gross income currently the annual increase in the redemption price of non-interest-bearing obligations issued at a discount. In addition, it is assumed that the old obligations exchanged are capital assets transferred in an exchange in respect of which regulations are promulgated pursuant to section 1037(a):

# Example 1.
(a) A purchased a noninterest-bearing nontransferable U.S. bond for $74 which was issued after December 31, 1954, and redeemable in 10 years for $100. Several years later, when the stated redemption value of such bond is $94.50, A surrenders it to the
United States in exchange for $1 in cash and a 10-year marketable bond having a face value of $100. On the date of exchange the bond received in the exchange has a fair market value of $96. Less than one month after the exchange, A sells the new bond for $96.
(b) On the exchange of the old bond for the new bond A realizes a gain of $23, determined as follows:
Amount realized (a new bond worth $96 plus $1 cash)
$97
Less: Adjusted basis of old bond
74
Gain realized
23
Pursuant to so much of section 1031(b) as applies to section 1037(a), the amount of such gain which is recognized is $1 (the money received). Such recognized gain of $1 is treated as ordinary income. On the exchange of the old bond a gain of $22 ($23 less $1) is not recognized.
(c) The basis of the new bond in A's hands, determined under section 1031(d) is $74 (the basis of the old bond, decreased by the $1 received in cash and increased by the $1 gain recognized on the exchange).
(d) On the sale of the new bond A realizes a gain of $22 ($96 less $74), all of which is recognized by reason of section 1002. Of this gain of $22, the amount of $19.50 is treated as ordinary income and $2.50 is treated as long-term capital gain, determined as follows:
(1) Ordinary income, treating sale of new bond as though a sale of old bond and applying section 1037(b)(1)(A):
Stated redemption price of old bond
$94.50
Less: Issue price of old bond
74.00
Aggregate gain under section 1037(b)(1)(A) (not to exceed $22 not recognized at time of exchange)
20.50
Less: Amount of such gain recognized at time of exchange
1.00
Ordinary income
19.50
(2) Ordinary income under first sentence of section 1232(a)(2)(B), applying section 1037(b)(1)(B) to sale of new bond:
Stated redemption price of new bond at maturity
$100.00
Less: Issue price of new bond under section 1037(b)(1)(B) ($94.50 plus $0 additional consideration paid on exchange)
94.50
Original issue discount on new bond
5.50
Proration under section 1232(a)(2)(B)(ii): ($5.50 × 0 months/120 months)
0
(3) Total ordinary income (sum of subparagraphs (1) and (2))
19.50
(4) Long-term capital gain ($22 less $19.50)
2.50

# Example 2.
(a) The facts are the same as in example (1), except that, less than one month after the exchange of the old bond, the new bond is sold for $92.
(b) On the sale of the new bond A realizes a gain of $18 ($92 less $74), all of which is recognized by reason of section 1002. Of this gain, the entire amount of $18 is treated as ordinary income. This amount is determined as provided in paragraph (d)(1) of example (1) except that the ordinary income of $19.50 is limited to the $18 recognized on the sale of the new bond.

# Example 3.
(a) The facts are the same as in example (1), except that 2 years after the exchange of the old bond A sells the new bond for $98.
(b) On the sale of the new bond A realizes a gain of $24 ($98 less $74), all of which is recognized by reason of section 1002. Of this gain of $24, the amount of $20.60 is treated as ordinary income and $3.40 is treated as long-term capital gain, determined as follows:
(1) Ordinary income applicable to old bond (determined as provided in paragraph (d)(1) of example (1))
$19.50
(2) Ordinary income applicable to new bond (determined as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of example (1), except that the proration of the original issue discount under section 1232(a)(2)(B)(ii) amounts to $1.10 ($5.50 × 24 months/120 months)
1.10
(3) Total ordinary income (sum of subparagraphs (1) and (2))
20.60
(4) Long-term capital gain ($24 less $20.60)
3.40

# Example 4.
(a) The facts are the same as in example (1), except that A retains the new bond and redeems it at maturity for $100.
(b) On the redemption of the new bond A realizes a gain of $26 ($100 less $74), all of which is recognized by reason of section 1002. Of this gain of $26, the amount of $25 is treated as ordinary income and $1 is treated as long-term capital gain, determined as follows:
(1) Ordinary income applicable to old bond (determined as provided in paragraph (d)(1) of example (1))
$19.50
(2) Ordinary income applicable to new bond (determined as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of example (1), except that the proration of the original issue discount under section 1232(a)(2)(B)(ii) amounts to $5.50 ($5.50 × 120 months/120 months))
5.50
(3) Total ordinary income (sum of subparagraphs (1) and (2))
25.00
(4) Long-term capital gain ($26 less $25)
1.00

# Example 5.
(a) In 1958 B purchased for $7,500 a series E United States savings bond having a face value of $10,000. In 1965 when the stated redemption value of the series E bond is $9,760, B surrenders it to the United States in exchange solely for a $10,000 series H U.S. savings bond, after paying $240 additional consideration. B retains the series H bond and redeems it at maturity in 1975 for $10,000, after receiving all the semiannual interest payments thereon.
(b) On the exchange of the series E bond for the series H bond, B realizes a gain of $2,260 ($9,760 less $7,500), none of which is recognized at such time by reason of section 1037(a).
(c) The basis of the series H bond in B's hands, determined under section 1031(d), is $7,740 (the $7,500 basis of the series E bond, plus $240 additional consideration paid for the series H bond).
(d) On the redemption of the series H bond, B realizes a gain of $2,260 ($10,000 less $7,740), all of which is recognized by reason of section 1002. This entire gain is treated as ordinary income by treating the redemption of the series H bond as though it were a redemption of the series E bond and by applying section 1037(b)(1)(A).
(e) Under section 1037(b)(1)(B) the issue price of the series H bonds is $10,000 ($9,760 stated redemption price of the series E bond at time of exchange, plus $240 additional consideration paid). Thus, with respect to the series H bond, there is no original issue discount to which section 1232(a)(2)(B) might apply.

# Example 6.
(a) The facts are the same as in example (5), except that in 1970 B submits the $10,000 series H bond to the United States for partial redemption in the amount of $3,000 and for reissuance of the remainder in $1,000 series H savings bonds registered in his name. On this transaction B receives $3,000 cash and seven $1,000 series H bonds, bearing the original issue date of the $10,000 bond which is partially redeemed. The $1,000, series H bonds are redeemed at maturity in 1975 for $7,000.
(b) On the partial redemption of the $10,000 series H bond in 1970 B realizes a gain of $678 ($3,000 less $2,322 [$7,740 × $3,000/$10,000]), all of which is recognized at such time by reason of section 1002 and paragraph (c) of § 1.454-1. This entire gain is treated as ordinary income, by treating the partial redemption of the series H bond as though it were a redemption of the relevant denominational portion of the series E bond and by applying section 1037(b)(1)(A).
(c) On the redemption at maturity in 1975 of the seven $1,000 series H bonds B realizes a gain of $1,582 ($7,000 less $5,418 [$7,740 × $7,000/$10,000]), all of which is recognized at such time by reason of section 1002 and paragraph (c) of § 1.454-1. This entire gain is treated as ordinary income, determined in the manner described in paragraph (b) of this example.

# Example 7.
(a) The facts are the same as in example (5), except that in 1970 B requests the United States to reissue the $10,000 series H bond by issuing two $5,000 series H bonds bearing the original issue date of such $10,000 bond. One of such $5,000 bonds is registered in B's name, and the other is registered in the name of C, who is B's son. Each $5,000 series H bond is redeemed at maturity in 1975 for $5,000.
(b) On the issuing in 1970 of the $5,000 series H bond to C, B realizes a gain of $1,130 ($5,000 less $3,870 [$7,740 × $5,000/$10,000]), all of which is recognized at such time by reason of section 1002 and paragraph (c) of § 1.454-1. This entire gain is treated as ordinary income by treating the transaction as though it were a redemption of the relevant denominational portion of the series E bond and by applying section 1037(b)(1)(A).
(c) On the redemption at maturity in 1975 of the $5,000 series H bond registered in his name B realizes a gain of $1,130 ($5,000 less $3,870 [$7,740 × $5,000/$10,000]), all of which is recognized at such time by reason of section 1002 and paragraph (c) of § 1.454-1. This entire gain is treated as ordinary income, determined in the manner described in paragraph (b) of this example.
(d) On the redemption at maturity in 1975 of the $5,000 series H bond registered in his name C does not realize any gain, since the amount realized on redemption does not exceed his basis in the property, determined as provided in section 1015.
(5)
Exchanges involving nonrecognition of gain or loss on transferable obligations issued at not less than par
—(i)
In general.
If a transferable obligation of the United States which was originally issued at not less than par is surrendered to the United States for another transferable obligation in an exchange to which the provisions of section 1037(a) (or so much of section 1031 (b) or (c) as relates to section 1037(a)) apply, the issue price of the obligation received from the United States in the exchange shall be considered for purposes of applying section 1232 to gain realized on the disposition or redemption of the obligation so received, to be the same as the issue price of the obligation which is surrendered to the United States in the exchange, increased by the amount of other consideration, if any, paid to the United States as part of the exchange. This subparagraph shall apply irrespective of whether there is gain or loss unrecognized on the exchange and irrespective of the fair market value, at the time of the exchange, of either the obligation surrendered to, or the obligation received from, the United States in the exchange.
(ii)
Illustrations.
The application of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples, in which it is assumed that the taxpayer uses the
cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting and that the old obligations exchanged are capital assets transferred in an exchange in respect of which regulations are promulgated pursuant to section 1037(a):

# Example 1.
(a) A purchases in the market for $85 a marketable U.S. bond which was originally issued at its par value of $100. Three months later, A surrenders this bond to the United States in exchange solely for another $100 marketable U.S. bond which then has a fair market value of $88. He holds the new bond for 5 months and then sells it on the market for $92.
(b) On the exchange of the old bond for the new bond A realizes a gain of $3 ($88 less $85), none of which is recognized by reason of section 1037(a).
(c) The basis of the new bond in A's hands, determined under section 1031(d), is $85 (the same as that of the old bond). The issue price of the new bond for purposes of section 1232(a)(2)(B) is considered under section 1037(b)(2) to be $100 (the same issue price as that of the old bond).
(d) On the sale of the new bond A realizes a gain of $7 ($92 less $85), all of which is recognized by reason of section 1002. Of this gain of $7, the entire amount is treated as long-term capital gain, determined as follows:
(1) Ordinary income under first sentence of section 1232(a)(2)(B), applicable to old bond:
Stated redemption price of old bond at maturity
$100
Less: Issue price of old bond
100
Original issue discount on old bond
0
(2) Ordinary income under first sentence of section 1232(a)(2)(B), applying section 1037(b)(2) to sale of new bond:
Stated redemption price of new bond at maturity
100
Less: Issue price of new bond under section 1037(b)(2)
100
Original issue discount on new bond
0
(3) Long-term capital gain ($7 less sum of subparagraphs (1) and (2))
$7

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in example (1), except that A retains the new bond and redeems it at maturity for $100. On the redemption of the new bond, A realizes a gain of $15 ($100 less $85), all of which is recognized under section 1002. This entire gain is treated as long-term capital gain, determined in the same manner as provided in paragraph (d) of example (1).

# Example 3.
(a) For $1,000 B subscribes to a marketable U.S. bond which has a face value of $1,000. Thereafter, he surrenders this bond to the United States in exchange solely for a 10-year marketable $1,000 bond which at the time of exchange has a fair market value of $930, at which price such bond is initially offered to the public. Five years after the exchange, B sells the new bond for $950.
(b) On the exchange of the old bond for the new bond, B sustains a loss of $70 ($1,000 less $930), none of which is recognized pursuant to section 1037(a).
(c) The basis of the new bond in A's hands, determined under section 1031(d), is $1,000 (the same basis as that of the old bond).
(d) On the sale of the new bond B sustains a loss of $50 ($1,000 less $950), all of which is recognized by reason of section 1002.

# Example 4.
(a) The facts are the same as in example (3), except that 5 years after the exchange B sells the new bond for $1,020.
(b) On the exchange of the old bond for the new bond B sustains a loss of $70 ($1,000 less $930), none of which is recognized pursuant to section 1037(a).
(c) The basis of the new bond in B's hands, determined under section 1031(d), is $1,000 (the same basis as that of the old bond). The issue price of the new bond for purposes of section 1232(a)(2)(B) is considered under section 1037(b)(2) to be $1,000 (the same issue price as that of the old bond).
(d) On the sale of the new bond B realizes a gain of $20 ($1,020 less $1,000), all of which is recognized by reason of section 1002. This entire gain is treated as long-term capital gain, determined in the same manner as provided in paragraph (d) of example (1).
(6)
Other rules for applying section 1232.
To the extent not specifically affected by the provisions of section 1037(b) and subparagraphs (1) through (5) of this paragraph, any gain realized on the disposition or redemption of any obligation received from the United States in an exchange to which section 1037(a) (or so much of section 1031 (b) or (c) as relates to section 1037(a)) applies shall be treated in the manner provided by section 1232 if the facts and circumstances relating to the acquisition and disposition or redemption of such obligation require the application of section 1232.
(c)
Holding period of obligation received in the exchange.
The holding period of an obligation received from the United States in an exchange to which the provisions of section 1037(a) (or so much of section 1031 (b) or (c) as relates to section 1037(a)) apply shall include the period for which the obligation which was surrendered to the United States in the exchange was held by the taxpayer, but only if the obligation so surrendered was at the time of the exchange a capital asset in the hands of
the taxpayer. See section 1223 and the regulations thereunder.
(d)
Basis.
The basis of an obligation received from the United States in an exchange to which the provisions of section 1037(a) (or so much of section 1031 (b) or (c) as relates to section 1037(a)) apply shall be determined as provided in section 1031(d) and the regulations thereunder.
(e)
Effective date.
Section 1.1037 and this section shall apply only for taxable years ending after September 22, 1959.
[T.D. 6935, 32 FR 15824, Nov. 17, 1967, as amended by T.D. 7154, 36 FR 24998, Dec. 28, 1971]
§ 1.1038-1
Reacquisitions of real property in satisfaction of indebtedness.
(a)
Scope of section 1038
—(1)
General rule on gain or loss.
If a sale of real property gives rise to indebtedness to the seller which is secured by the real property which is sold, and the seller of such property reacquires such property in a taxable year beginning after September 2, 1964, in partial or full satisfaction of such indebtedness, then, except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (f) of this section, no gain or loss shall result to the seller from such reacquisition. The treatment so provided is mandatory; however, see § 1.1038-3 for an election to apply the provisions of this section to certain taxable years beginning after December 31, 1957. It is immaterial, for purposes of applying this subparagraph, whether the seller realized a gain or sustained a loss on the sale of the real property, or whether it can be ascertained at the time of the sale whether gain or loss occurs as a result of the sale. It is also immaterial what method of accounting the seller used in reporting gain or loss from the sale of the real property or whether at the time of reacquisition such property has depreciated or appreciated in value since the time of the original sale. Moreover, the character of the gain realized on the original sale of the property is immaterial for purposes of applying this subparagraph. The provisions of this section shall apply, except as provided in § 1.1038-2, to the reacquisition of real property which was used by the seller as his principal residence and with respect to the sale of which an election under section 121 is in effect or with respect to the sale of which gain was not recognized under section 1034.
(2)
Sales giving rise to indebtedness
—(i)
Sale defined.
For purposes of this section, it is not necessary for title to the property to have passed to the purchaser in order to have a sale. Ordinarily, a sale of property has occurred in a transaction in which title to the property has not passed to the purchaser, if the purchaser has a contractual right to retain possession of the property so long as he performs his obligations under the contract and to obtain title to the property upon the completion of the contract. However, a sale may have occurred even if the purchaser does not have the right to possession until he partially or fully satisfies the terms of the contract. For example, if S contracts to sell real property to P, and if S promises to convey title to P upon the completion of all of the payments due under the contract and to allow P to obtain possession of the property after 10 percent of the purchase price has been paid, there has been a sale on the date of the contract for purposes of this section. This section shall not apply to a disposition of real property which constituted an exchange of property or was treated as a sale under section 121(d)(4) or section 1034(i); nor shall it apply to a sale of stock in a cooperative housing corporation described in section 121(d)(3) or section 1034(f).
(ii)
Secured indebtedness defined.
An indebtedness to the seller is secured by the real property for purposes of this section whenever the seller has the right to take title or possession of the property or both if there is a default with respect to such indebtedness. A sale of real property may give rise to an indebtedness to the seller although the seller is limited in his recourse to the property for payment of the indebtedness in the case of a default.
(3)
Reacquisitions in partial or full satisfaction of indebtedness
—(i)
Purpose of reacquisition.
This section applies only where the seller reacquires the real property in partial or full satisfaction of the indebtedness to him that arose from the sale of the real property and was secured by the property. That is,
the reacquisition must be in furtherance of the seller's security rights in the property with respect to indebtedness to him that arose at the time of the sale. Accordingly, if the seller in reacquiring the real property does not pay consideration in addition to discharging the purchaser's indebtedness to him that arose from the sale and was secured by such property, this section shall apply to the reacquisition even though the purchaser has not defaulted in his obligations under the contract or such a default is not imminent. If in addition to discharging the purchaser's indebtedness to him that arose from the sale the seller pays consideration in reacquiring the real property, this section shall generally apply to the reacquisition if the reacquisition and the payment of additional consideration is provided for in the original contract for the sale of the property. This section generally shall apply to a reacquisition of real property if the seller reacquires the property either when the purchaser has defaulted in his obligations under the contract or when such a default is imminent. This section generally shall not apply to a reacquisition of real property where the seller pays consideration in addition to discharging the purchaser's indebtedness to him that arose from the sale if the reacquisition and payment of additional consideration was not provided for in the original contract for the sale of the property and if the purchaser has not defaulted in his obligations under the contract or such a default is not imminent. Thus, for example, if the purchaser is in arrears on the payment of interest or principal or has in any other way defaulted on his contract for the purchase of the property, or if the facts of the case indicate that the purchaser is unable satisfactorily to perform his obligations under the contract, and the seller reacquires the property from the purchaser in a transaction in which the seller pays consideration in addition to discharging the purchaser's indebtedness to him that arose from the sale and was secured by the property, this section shall apply to the reacquisition. Additional consideration paid by the seller includes money and other property paid or transferred by the seller. Also, the reacquisition by the seller of real property subject to an indebtedness (or the assumption, upon the reacquisition, of indebtedness) which arose subsequent to the original sale shall be considered as a payment by the seller of additional consideration. However, the reacquisition by the seller of real property subject to an indebtedness (or the assumption, upon the reacquisition, of an indebtedness) which arose prior to or arose out of the original sale shall not be considered as a payment by the seller of additional consideration.
(ii)
Manner of reacquisition.
For purposes of applying section 1038 and this section there must be a reacquisition by the seller of the real property itself, but the manner in which the seller so reduces the property to ownership or possession, as the case may be, shall generally be immaterial. Thus, the seller may reduce the real property to ownership or possession or both, as the case may require, by agreement or by process of law. The reduction of the real property to ownership or possession by agreement includes, where valid under local law, such methods as voluntary conveyance from the purchaser and abandonment to the seller. The reduction of the real property to ownership or possession by process of law includes foreclosure proceedings in which a competitive bid is entered, such as foreclosure by judicial sale or by power of sale contained in the loan agreement without recourse to the courts, as well as those types of foreclosure proceedings in which a competitive bid is not entered, such as strict foreclosure and foreclosure by entry and possession, by writ of entry, or by publication or notice.
(4)
Persons from whom real property may be reacquired.
The real property reacquired in satisfaction of the indebtedness need not be reacquired from the purchaser but may be reacquired from the purchaser's transferee or assignee, or from a trustee holding title to such property pending the purchaser's satisfaction of the terms of the contract, so long as the indebtedness that is partially or completely satisfied in the reacquisition of such property arose in the original sale of the property and was secured by the property so reacquired. In such a case, a reference in
this section to the purchaser shall, where appropriate, include the purchaser's transferee or assignee. Thus, for example, this section will apply if the seller reacquires the property from a purchaser from the original purchaser and either the property is subject to, or the subsequent purchaser assumes, the liability to the seller on the indebtedness.
(5)
Reacquisitions not included.
This section shall not apply to reacquisitions of real property by mutual savings banks, domestic building and loan associations, and cooperative banks, described in section 593(a).
(b)
Amount of gain resulting from a reacquisition
—(1)
Determination of amount
—(i)
In general.
As a result of a reacquisition to which paragraph (a) of this section applies gain shall be derived by the seller to the extent that the amount of money and the fair market value of other property (other than obligations of the purchaser arising with respect to the sale) which are received by the seller, prior to such reacquisition, with respect to the sale of the property exceed the amount of the gain derived by the seller on the sale of such property which is returned as income for periods prior to the reacquisition. However, the amount of gain so determined shall in no case exceed the amount determined under paragraph (c) of this section with respect to such reacquisition.
(ii)
Amount of gain returned as income for prior periods.
For purposes of this subparagraph and paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the amount of gain on the sale of the property which is returned as income for periods prior to the reacquisition of the real property does not include any amount of income determined under paragraph (f)(2) of this section which is considered to be received at the time of the reacquisition of the property. However, the amount of gain on the sale of the property which is returned as income for such periods does include gain on the sale resulting from payments received in the taxable year in which the date of reacquisition occurs if such payments are received prior to such reacquisition. The application of this subdivision may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example:
In 1965 S, who uses the calendar year as the taxable year, sells to P for $10,000 real property which has an adjusted basis of $3,000. S properly elects under section 453 to report the income from the sale on the installment method. In 1965 and 1966, S receives a total of $4,000 on the contract. On May 15, 1967, S receives $1,000 on the contract. Because of P's default, S reacquires the property on August 31, 1967. The gain on the sale which is returned as income for periods prior to the reacquisition is $3,500 ($5,000 × $7,000/$10,000).
(2)
Amount of money and other property received with respect to the sale
—(i)
In general.
Amounts of money and other property received by the seller with respect to the sale of the property include payments made by the purchaser for the seller's benefit, as well as payments made and other property transferred directly to the seller. If the purchaser of the real property makes payments on a mortgage or other indebtedness to which the property is subject at the time of the sale of such property to him, or on which the seller was personally liable at the time of such sale, such payments are considered amounts received by the seller with respect to the sale. However, if after the sale the purchaser borrows money and uses the property as security for the loan, payments by the purchaser in satisfaction of the indebtedness are not considered as amounts received by the seller with respect to the sale, although the seller does in fact receive some indirect benefit when the purchaser makes such payments.
(ii)
Payments by purchaser at time of reacquisition.
All payments made by the purchaser at the time of the reacquisition of the real property that are with respect to the original sale of the property shall be treated, for purposes of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, by the seller as having been received prior to the reacquisition with respect to such sale. For example, if the purchaser, at the time of the reacquisition by the seller, pays money or other property to the seller in partial or complete satisfaction of the purchaser's indebtedness on the original sale, the seller shall treat such amounts as having been received prior to the reacquisition with respect to the sale.
(iii)
Interest received.
For purposes of this subparagraph and paragraph (c)(1) of this section any amounts received by the seller as interest, stated or unstated, are excluded from the computation of gain on the sale of the property and are not considered amounts of money or other property received with respect to the sale.
(iv)
Amounts received on sale of purchaser's indebtedness.
Money or other property received by the seller on the sale of the purchaser's indebtedness that arose at the time of the sale of the real property are amounts received by the seller with respect to the sale of such real property, except that the amounts so received from the sale of such indebtedness shall be reduced by the amount of money and the fair market value of other property paid or transferred by the seller, before the reacquisition of the real property, to reacquire such indebtedness. For example, if S sells real property to P for $25,000, and under the contract receives $10,000 down and a note from P for $15,000, S would receive $22,000 with respect to the sale if he were to discount the note for $12,000. If before the reacquisition of the real property S were to reacquire the discounted note for $8,000, he would receive $14,000 with respect to the sale.
(3)
Obligations of the purchaser arising with respect to the sale.
The term
obligations of the purchaser arising with respect to the sale
of the real property includes, for purposes of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, only that indebtedness on which the purchaser is liable to the seller and which arises out of the sale of such property. Thus, the term does not include any indebtedness in respect of the property that the seller owes to a third person which the purchaser assumes, or to which the property is subject, at the time of the sale of the property to the purchaser. Nor does the term include any indebtedness on which the purchaser is liable to the seller if such indebtedness arises subsequent to the sale of such property.
(c)
Limitation upon amount of gain
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided by subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, the amount of gain on a reacquisition of real property, as determined under paragraph (b) of this section, shall in no case exceed—
(i) The amount by which the price at which the real property was sold exceeded its adjusted basis at the time of the sale, as determined under § 1.1011-1, reduced by
(ii) The amount of gain on the sale of such real property which is returned as income for periods prior to the reacquisition, and by
(iii) The amount of money and the fair market value of other property (other than obligations of the purchaser to the seller which are secured by the real property) paid or transferred by the seller in connection with the reacquisition of such real property.
(2)
Cases where limitation does not apply.
The limitation provided by subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall not apply in a case where the selling price of property is indefinite in amount and cannot be ascertained at the time of the reacquisition of such property, as, for example, where the selling price is stated as a percentage of the profits to be realized from the development of the property which is sold. Moreover, the limitation so provided shall not apply to a reacquisition of real property occurring in a taxable year beginning before September 3, 1964, to which the provisions of this section are applied pursuant to an election under § 1.1038-3.
(3)
Determination of sales price.
The price at which the real property was sold shall be, for purposes of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, the gross sales price reduced by the selling commissions, legal fees, and other expenses incident to the sale of such property which are properly taken into account in determining gain or loss on the sale. For example, the amount of selling commissions paid by a nondealer will be deducted from the gross sales price in determining the price at which the real property was sold; on the other hand, selling commissions paid by a real estate dealer will be deducted as a business expense. Examples of other expenses incident to the sale of the property are expenses for appraisal fees, advertising expense, cost of preparing maps, recording fees, and documentary
stamp taxes. Payments on indebtedness to the seller which are for interest, stated or unstated, are not included in determining the price at which the property was sold. See paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section.
(4)
Determination of amounts paid or transferred in connection with a reacquisition
—(i)
In general.
Amounts of money or property paid or transferred by the seller of the real property in connection with the reacquisition of such property include payments of money, or transfers of property, to persons from whom the real property is reacquired as well as to other persons. Payments or transfers in connection with the reacquisition of the property do not include money or property paid or transferred by the seller to reacquire obligations of the purchaser to the seller which were received by the seller with respect to the sale of the property or which arose subsequent to the sale. Amounts of money or property paid or transferred by the seller in connection with the reacquisition of the property include payments or transfers for such items as court costs and fees for services of an attorney, master, trustee, or auctioneer, or for publication, acquiring title, clearing liens, or filing and recording.
(ii)
Assumption of indebtedness.
The assumption by the seller, upon reacquisition of the real property, of any indebtedness to another person which at such time is secured by such property will be considered a payment of money by the seller in connection with the reacquisition. Also, if at the time of reacquisition such property is subject to an indebtedness which is not an indebtedness of the purchaser to the seller, the seller shall be considered to have paid money, in an amount equal to such indebtedness, in connection with the reacquisition of the property. Thus, for example, if at the time of the sale the purchaser executes in connection with the sale a first mortgage to a bank and a second mortgage to the seller and at the time of reacquisition the seller reacquires the property subject to the first mortgage which he does not assume, the seller will be considered to have paid money, in an amount equal to the unpaid amount of the first mortgage, in connection with the reacquisition.
(d)
Character of gain resulting from a reacquisition.
Paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section set forth the extent to which gain shall be derived from a reacquisition to which paragraph (a) of this section applies, but the rule provided by section 1038 and this section do not affect the character of the gain so derived. The character of the gain resulting from such a reacquisition is determined on the basis of whether the gain on the original sale was returned on the installment method or, if not, on the basis of whether title to the real property was transferred to the purchaser; and, if title was transferred to the purchaser in a deferred-payment sale, whether the reconveyance of the property to the seller was voluntary. For example, if the gain on the original sale of the reacquired property was returned on the installment method, the character of the gain on reacquisition by the seller shall be determined in accordance with the rules provided in paragraph (a) of § 1.453-9. If the original sale was not on the installment method but was a deferred-payment sale, as described in § 1.453-6(a), where title to the real property was transferred to the purchaser and the seller accepts a voluntary reconveyance of the property, the gain on the reacquisition shall be ordinary income; however, if the obligations satisfied are securities (as defined in section 165(g)(2)(C)), any gain resulting from the reacquisition is capital gain subject to the provisions of subchapter P of chapter 1 of the Code.
(e)
Recognition of gain.
The entire amount of the gain determined under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section with respect to a reacquisition to which paragraph (a) of this section applies shall be recognized notwithstanding any other provisions of subtitle A (relating to income taxes) of the Code.
(f)
Special rules applicable to worthless indebtedness
—(1)
Worthlessness resulting from reacquisition.
No debt of the purchaser to the seller which was secured by the reacquired real property shall be considered as becoming worthless or partially worthless as a result of a reacquisition of such real property to
which paragraph (a) of this section applies. Accordingly, no deduction for a bad debt and no charge against a reserve for bad debts shall be allowed, as a result of the reacquisition, in order to reflect the noncollectibility of any indebtedness of the purchaser to the seller which at the time of reacquisition was secured by such real property.
(2)
Indebtedness treated as worthless prior to reacquisition
—(i)
Prior taxable years.
If for any taxable year ending before the taxable year in which occurs a reacquisition of real property to which paragraph (a) of this section applies the seller of such property has treated any indebtedness of the purchaser which is secured by such property as having become worthless or partially worthless by taking a bad debt deduction under section 166(a), he shall be considered as receiving, at the time of such reacquisition, income in an amount equal to the amount of such indebtedness previously treated by him as having become worthless. The amount so treated as income received shall be treated as a recovery of a bad debt previously deducted as worthless or partially worthless. Accordingly, the amount of such income shall be excluded from gross income, as provided in § 1.111-1, to the extent of the
recovery exclusion
with respect to such item. For purposes of § 1.111-1, if the indebtedness was treated as partially worthless in a prior taxable year, the amount treated under this subparagraph as a recovery shall be considered to be with respect to the part of the indebtedness that was previously deducted as worthless. The seller shall not be considered to have treated an indebtedness as worthless in any taxable year for which he took the standard deduction under section 141 or paid the tax imposed by section 3 if a deduction in respect of such indebtedness was not allowed in determining adjusted gross income for such year under section 62.
(ii)
Current taxable year.
No deduction shall be allowed under section 166 (a), for the taxable year in which occurs a reacquisition of real property to which paragraph (a) of this section applies, in respect of any indebtedness of the purchaser secured by such property which has been treated by the seller as having become worthless or partially worthless in such taxable year but prior to the date of such reacquisition.
(3)
Basis adjustment.
The basis of any indebtedness described in subparagraph (2)(i) of this paragraph shall be increased (as of the date of the reacquisition) by an amount equal to the amount which, under such subparagraph of this paragraph, is treated as income received by the seller with respect to such indebtedness, but only to the extent the amount so treated as received is not excluded from gross income by reason of the application of § 1.111-1.
(g)
Rules for determining gain or loss on disposition of reacquired property
—(1)
Basis of reacquired real property.
The basis of any real property acquired in a reacquisition to which paragraph (a) of this section applies shall be the sum of the following amounts, determined as of the date of such reacquisition:
(i) The amount of the adjusted basis, determined under sections 453 and 1011, and the regulations thereunder, of all indebtedness of the purchaser to the seller which at the time of reacquisition was secured by such property, including any increase by reason of paragraph (f)(3) of this section,
(ii) The amount of gain determined under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section with respect to such reacquisition, and
(iii) The amount of money and the fair market value of other property (other than obligations of the purchaser to the seller which are secured by the real property) paid or transferred by the seller in connection with the reacquisition of such real property, determined as provided in paragraph (c) of this section even though such paragraph does not apply to the reacquisition.
(2)
Basis of undischarged indebtedness.
The basis of any indebtedness of the purchaser to the seller which was secured by the reacquired real property described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, to the extent that such indebtedness is not discharged upon the reacquisition of such property, shall be zero. Therefore, to the extent not discharged upon the reacquisition of the real property, indebtedness on the original obligation of the purchaser, a
substituted obligation of the purchaser, a deficiency judgment entered in a court of law into which the purchaser's obligation has merged, or any other obligation of the purchaser to the seller, shall be zero if such indebtedness constitutes an indebtedness to the seller which was secured by such property.
(3)
Holding period of reacquired property.
Since the reacquisition described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph is in a sense considered a nullification of the original sale of the real property, for purposes of determining gain or loss on a disposition of such property after its reacquisition the period for which the seller has held the real property at the time of such disposition shall include the period for which such property is held by him prior to the original sale. However, the holding period shall not include the period of time commencing with the date following the date on which the property is originally sold to the purchaser and ending with the date on which the property is reacquired by the seller. The period for which the property was held by the seller prior to the original sale shall be determined as provided in § 1.1223-1. For example, if under paragraph (a) of § 1.1223-1 real property, which was acquired as the result of an involuntary conversion, has been held for five months on January 1, 1965, the date of its sale, and such property is reacquired on July 2, 1965, and resold on July 3, 1965, the seller will be considered to have held such property for five months and one day for purposes of this subparagraph.
(h)
Illustrations.
The application of this section may be illustrated by the following examples in which it is assumed that the reacquisition is in satisfaction of secured indebtedness arising out of the sale of the real property:

# Example 1.
(a) S purchases real property for $20 and sells it to P for $100, the property not being mortgaged at the time of sale. Under the contract P pays $10 down and executes a note for $90, with stated interest at 6 percent, to be paid in nine annual installments. S properly elects to report the gain on the installment method. After the second $10 annual payment P defaults and S accepts a voluntary reconveyance of the property in complete satisfaction of the indebtedness. S pays $5 in connection with the reacquisition of the property. The fair market value of the property at the time of the reacquisition is $110.

S properly elects to report the gain on the installment method. After the first $10 annual payment P defaults and S accepts a voluntary reconveyance of the property in complete satisfaction of the indebtedness. S pays $5 in connection with the reacquisition of the property. The fair market value of the property at the time of the reacquisition is $50.

(a) S purchases real property for $80 and sells it to P for $100, the property not being mortgaged at the time of sale. Under the contract P pays $10 down and executes a note for $90, with stated interest at 6 percent, to be paid in nine annual installments. At the time of sale P's note has a fair market value of $90. S does not elect to report the gain on the installment method but treats the transaction as a deferred-payment sale. After the third $10 annual payment P defaults and S forecloses. Under the foreclosure sale S bids in the property at $70, cancels P's obligation of $60, and pays $10 to P. There are no other amounts paid by S in connection with the reacquisition of the property. The fair market value of the property at the time of the reacquisition is $70.

§ 1.1038-2
Reacquisition and resale of property used as a principal residence.
(a)
Application of special rules
—(1)
In general.
If paragraph (a) of § 1.1038-1 applies to the reacquisition of real property which was used by the seller as his principal residence and with respect to the sale of which an election under section 121 is in effect or with respect to the sale of which gain was not recognized under section 1034, the provisions of § 1.1038-1 (other than paragraph (a) thereof) shall not, and this section shall, apply to the reacquisition of such property if the property is resold by the seller within one year after the date of the reacquisition. For purposes of this section an election under section 121 shall be considered to be in effect with respect to the sale of the property if, at the close of the last day for making such an election under section 121(c) with respect to such sale, an election under section 121 has been made and not revoked. Thus, a taxpayer who properly elects, subsequent to the reacquisition, to have section 121 apply to a sale of his residence may be eligible for the treatment provided in this section. The treatment provided by this section is mandatory; however, see § 1.1038-3 for an election to apply the provisions of this section to certain taxable years beginning after December 31, 1957.
(2)
Sale and resale treated as one transaction.
In the case of a reacquisition to which this section applies, the resale of the reacquired property shall be treated, for purposes of applying sections 121 and 1034, as part of the transaction constituting the original sale of such property. In effect, the reacquisition is generally disregarded pursuant to this section and, for purposes of applying sections 121 and 1034, the resale of the property is considered to constitute a sale of such property occurring on the date of the original sale of such property.
(b)
Transactions not included.
(1) If with respect to the original sale of the property there was no nonrecognition of gain under section 1034 and an election under section 121 is not in effect, the provisions of § 1.1038-1, and not this section, shall apply to the reacquisition. Thus, for example, if in the case of a taxpayer not entitled to the benefit of section 121 there is no gain on the original sale of the property, the provisions of § 1.1038-1, and not this section, shall apply even though a redetermination of gain under this section would result in the nonrecognition of gain on the sale under section 1034. Also, if in the case of such a taxpayer there was gain on the original sale of the property but after the application of section 1034 all of such gain was recognized, the provisions of § 1.1038-1, and not this section, shall apply to the reacquisition.
(2) If the original sale of the property was not eligible for the treatment provided by section 121 and section 1034, the provisions of § 1.1038-1, and not this section, shall apply to the reacquisition of the property even though the resale of such property is eligible for the treatment provided by either or both of sections 121 and 1034.
(c)
Redetermination of gain required
—(1)
Sale of old residence.
The amount of gain excluded under section 121 on the sale of the property and the amount of gain recognized under section 1034 on the sale of the property shall be redetermined under this section by recomputing the adjusted sales price and the adjusted basis of the property, and any adjustments resulting from the redetermination of the gain on the sale of such property shall be reflected in the income of the seller for his taxable year in which the resale of the property occurs.
(2)
Sale of new residence.
If gain was not recognized under section 1034 on the original sale of the property, the adjusted basis of the new residence shall be redetermined under this section. If the new residence has been sold, the amount of gain returned on such sale of the new residence which is affected by the redetermination of the recognized gain on the sale of the old residence shall be redetermined under this section, and any adjustments resulting from the redetermination of the gain on the sale of the new residence shall be reflected in income of the seller for his taxable year in which the resale of the old residence occurs.
(d)
Redetermination of adjusted sales price.
For purposes of applying sections 121 and 1034 pursuant to this section, the adjusted sales price of the reacquired real property shall be redetermined by taking into account both the sale and the resale of the property and shall be—
(1) The amount realized, which for purposes of section 1001 shall be—
(i) The amount realized on the resale of the property, as determined under paragraph (b)(4) of § 1.1034-1, plus
(ii) The amount realized on the original sale of the property, determined as provided in paragraph (b)(4) of § 1.1034-1, less that portion of any obligations of the purchaser arising with respect to such sale which at the time of reacquisition is secured by such property and is unpaid, less
(iii) The amount of money and the fair market value of other property (other than obligations of the purchaser to the seller secured by the real property) paid or transferred by the seller in connection with the reacquisition of such real property,
reduced by
(2) The total of the fixing-up expenses (as defined in par. (b)(6) of § 1.1034-1) incurred for work performed on such real property to assist in both its original sale and its resale.
For purposes of applying paragraph (b)(6) of § 1.1034-1, there shall be two 90-day periods, the first ending on the day on which the contract to sell is entered into in connection with the original sale of the property, and the second ending on the day on which the contract to sell is entered into in connection with the resale of the property. There shall also be two 30-day periods for such purposes, the first ending on the 30th day after the date of the original sale, and the second ending on the 30th day after the date of the resale. For determination of the obligations of the purchaser arising with respect to the original sale of the property, see paragraph (b)(3) of § 1.1038-1. For determination of amounts paid or transferred by the seller in connection with the reacquisition of the property, see paragraph (c)(4) of § 1.1038-1.
(e)
Determination of adjusted basis at time of resale.
For purposes of applying sections 121 and 1034 pursuant to this section, the adjusted basis of the reacquired real property at the time of its resale shall be—
(1) The sum of—
(i) The adjusted basis of such property at the time of the original sale, with proper adjustment under section 1016(a) in respect of such property for the period occurring after the reacquisition of such property, and
(ii) Any indebtedness of the purchaser to the seller which arose subsequent to the original sale of such property and which at the time of reacquisition was secured by such property,
reduced by
(2) Any indebtedness of the purchaser to the seller which at the time of reacquisition was secured by the reacquired real property and which, for any taxable year ending before the taxable year in which occurs the reacquisition to the seller which was secured by the seller as having become worthless or
partially worthless by taking a bad debt deduction under section 166(a).
The reduction under the preceding sentence by reason of having treated indebtedness as worthless or partially worthless shall not exceed the amount by which there would be an increase in the basis of such indebtedness under paragraph (f)(3) of § 1.1038-1 if section 1038(d) had been applicable to the reacquisition of such property.
(f)
Treatment of indebtedness secured by the property
—(1)
Year of reacquisition.
No debt of the purchaser to the seller which was secured by the reacquired real property shall be considered as becoming worthless or partially worthless as a result of a reacquisition of such real property to which this section applies. Accordingly, no deduction for a bad debt shall be allowed, as a result of the reacquisition, in order to reflect the noncollectibility of any indebtedness of the purchaser to the seller which at the time of reacquisition was secured by such real property. In addition, no deduction shall be allowed, for the taxable year in which occurs a reacquisition of real property to which this section applies, in respect of any indebtedness of the purchaser secured by such property which has been treated by the seller as having become worthless or partially worthless in such taxable year but prior to the date of such reacquisition.
(2)
Prior taxable years.
For reduction of the basis of the real property for indebtedness treated as worthless or partially worthless for taxable years ending before the taxable year in which occurs the reacquisition, see paragraph (e) of this section.
(3)
Basis of indebtedness.
The basis of any indebtedness of the purchaser to the seller which was secured by the reacquired real property, to the extent that such indebtedness is not discharged upon the reacquisition of such property, shall be zero.
(g)
Date of sale.
Since the resale of the property, by being treated as part of the transaction constituting the original sale of the property, is treated as having occurred on the date of the original sale, in determining whether any of the time requirements of section 121 or section 1034 are satisfied for purposes of this section the date of the original sale is used, except to the extent provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
(h)
Illustrations.
The application of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
(a) On June 30, 1964, S, a single individual over 65 years of age, sells his principal residence to P for $25,000, the property not being mortgaged at the time of sale. S properly elects to apply the provisions of section 121 to the sale. Under the contract, P pays $5,000 down and executes a note for $20,000 with stated interest at 6 percent, the principal being payable in installments of $5,000 each on January 1 of each year and the note being secured by the real property which is sold. At the time of sale P's note has a fair market value of $20,000. S does not elect to report the gain on the installment method but treats the transaction as a deferred-payment sale, title to the property being transferred to P at the time of sale. S uses the calendar year as the taxable year and the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting. After making two annual payments of $5,000 each on the note, P defaults on the contract, and on March 1, 1967, S reacquires the real property in full satisfaction of P's indebtedness, title to the property being voluntarily reconveyed to S. On November 1, 1967, S sells the property to T for $35,000. The assumption is made that no fixing-up expenses are incurred for work performed on the principal residence in order to assist in the sale of the property in 1964 or in the resale of the property in 1967. At the time of sale in 1964 the property has an adjusted basis of $15,000. S does not treat any indebtedness with respect to the sale in 1964 as being worthless or partially worthless or make any capital expenditures with respect to the property after such sale. In his return for 1964, S includes in income $2,000 capital gain from the sale of his residence.
(b) The results obtained before and after the reacquisition of the property are as follows:

21,000
(c) S is required to show the additional inclusion of $19,000 capital gain ($21,000 −$2,000) in income on his return for 1967.

# Example 2.
(a) The facts are the same as in example (1) except that on April 1, 1965, S purchases a new residence at a cost of $30,000 and qualifies for the nonrecognition of gain under section 1034 in respect of the sale of his principal residence on June 30, 1964. In his return for 1964, S does not include any capital gain in income as a result of the sale of the old residence.
(b) The results obtained before and after the reacquisition of the property are as follows:

(c) The $6,000 of capital gain on the sale of the old residence is required to be included in income on the return for 1967. The adjusted basis on April 1, 1965, for determining gain on a sale or exchange of the new residence at any time on or after that date is $15,000, after taking into account the reacquisition and resale of the old residence.

# Example 3.
The facts are the same as in example (2) except that S sells the new residence on June 20, 1965, for $40,000 and includes $12,000 of capital gain ($40,000− $28,000) on its sale in his income on the return for 1965. S is required to include the additional capital gain of $13,000 ([$40,000− $15,000]−$12,000) on the sale of the new residence in his income on the return for 1967. For this purpose, the assumption is also made that there are no additional adjustments to the basis of the new residence after April 1, 1965.

§ 1.1038-3
Election to have section 1038 apply for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1957.
(a)
In general.
If an election is made in the manner provided by paragraph (b) of this section, the applicable provisions of §§ 1.1038-1 and 1.1038-2 shall apply to all reacquisitions of real property occurring in each and every taxable year beginning after December 31, 1957, and before September 3, 1964, for which the assessment of a deficiency, or the credit or refund of an overpayment, is not prevented on September 2, 1964, by the operation of any law or rule of law. The election so made shall apply to all taxable years beginning after December 31, 1957, and before September 3, 1964, for which the assessment of a deficiency, or the credit or refund of an overpayment, is not prevented on September 2, 1964, by the operation of any law or rule of law and shall apply to every reacquisition occurring in such taxable years. The fact that the assessment of a deficiency, or the credit or refund of an overpayment, is prevented for any other taxable year or years affected by the election will not prohibit the making of an election under this section. For example, if an individual who uses the calendar year as the taxable year were to sell in 1960 real property used as his principal residence in respect of the sale of which gain is not recognized under section 1034, and if such property were reacquired by the seller in 1962 and resold within 1 year, he would be permitted to make an election under this section with respect to such reacquisition even though on September 2, 1964, the period of limitations on assessment or refund has run for 1960. An election under this section shall be deemed a consent to the application of the provisions of this section.
(b)
Time and manner of making election
—(1)
In general.
(i) An election to have the provisions of § 1.1038-2 apply to reacquisitions of real property occurring in taxable years beginning
after December 31, 1957, and before September 3, 1964, shall be made by filing on or before September 3, 1965, a return, an amended return, or a claim for refund, whichever is proper, for each taxable year in which the resale of such real property occurs. If the return for any such year is not due on or before such date and has not been filed, the election with respect to such taxable year shall be made by filing on or before such date the statement described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph.
(ii) An election to have the provisions of § 1.1038-1 apply to reacquisitions of real property occurring in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1957, and before September 3, 1964, shall be made by filing on or before September 3, 1965, a return, an amended return, or a claim for refund, whichever is proper, for each taxable year in which such reacquisitions occur. If the return for any such year is not due on or before such date and has not been filed, the election with respect to such taxable year shall be made by filing on or before such date the statement described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph.
(iii) If the facts are such that § 1.1038-2 applies to a reacquisition of property except that the reacquisition occurs in a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1957, and before September 3, 1964, an election may not be made under this paragraph to have the provisions of § 1.1038-1 apply to such reacquisition.
(iv) Once made, an election under this paragraph may not be revoked after September 3, 1965. To any return, amended return, or claim for refund filed under this subparagraph there shall be attached the statement described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph.
(2)
Statement to be attached.
The statement described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall indicate—
(i) The name, address and account number of the taxpayer, and the fact that the taxpayer is electing to have the provisions of section 1038 apply to the reacquisitions of real property,
(ii) The taxable years in which the reacquisitions of property occur and any other taxable year or years the tax for which is affected by the application of section 1038 to such reacquisitions,
(iii) The office of the district director where the return or returns for such taxable year or years were or will be filed,
(iv) The dates on which such return or returns were filed and on which the tax for such taxable year or years was paid,
(v) The type of real property reacquired, the terms under which such property was sold and reacquired, and an indication of whether the taxpayer is applying the provisions of § 1.1038-2 to the reacquisition of such property,
(vi) If § 1.1038-2 is being applied to the reacquisition, the terms under which the old residence was resold and, if applicable, the terms under which the new residence was sold, and
(vii) The office where, and the date when, the election to apply section 121 in respect to any sale of such property was or will be made.
(3)
Place for filing.
Any claim for refund, amended return, or statement, filed under this paragraph in respect of any taxable year, whether the taxable year in which occurs the reacquisition of property or the taxable year in which occurs the resale of the old residence, shall be filed in the office of the district director in which the return for such taxable year was or will be filed.
(c)
Extension of period of limitations on assessment or refund
—(1)
Assessment of tax.
If an election is properly made under paragraph (b) of this section and the assessment of a deficiency for the taxable years to which such election applies is not prevented on September 2, 1964, by the operation of any law or rule of law, the period within which a deficiency for such taxable years may be assessed shall, to the extent such deficiency is attributable to the application of section 1038, not expire prior to one year after the date on which such election is made.
(2)

If an election is properly made under paragraph (b) of this section and the credit or refund of any overpayment for the taxable years to which such election applies is not prevented on September 2, 1964, by the operation of any law or rule of law, the period within which a claim for credit
or refund of an overpayment for such taxable years may be filed shall, to the extent such overpayment is attributable to the application of section 1038, not expire prior to one year after the date on which such election is made.
(d)
Payment of interest for period prior to September 2, 1964.
No interest shall be payable with respect to any deficiency attributable to the application of the provisions of section 1038, and no interest shall be allowed with respect to any credit or refund of any overpayment attributable to the application of such section, for any period prior to September 2, 1964. See section 2(c)(3) of the Act of September 2, 1964 (Pub. L. 88-750, 78 Stat. 856).
[T.D. 6916, 32 FR 5930, Apr. 13, 1967]
§ 1.1039-1
Certain sales of low-income housing projects.
(a)
Nonrecognition of gain.
Section 1039 provides rules under which the taxpayer may elect not to recognize gain in certain cases where a qualified housing project is sold or disposed of after October 9, 1969, in an approved disposition and another such qualified housing project or projects (referred to as the
replacement project
) is acquired, constructed, or reconstructed within a specified reinvestment period. If the requirements of section 1039 are met, and if the taxpayer makes an election in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (b)(4) of this section, then the gain realized upon the sale or disposition is recognized only to the extent that the net amount realized on such sale or disposition exceeds the cost of the replacement project. However, notwithstanding section 1039, gain may be recognized by reason of the application of section 1245 or 1250 to the sale or disposition. (See § 1.1245-6(b) and § 1.1250-3(h). The terms
qualified housing project, approved disposition, reinvestment period,
and
net amount realized
are defined in paragraph (c) of this section.
(b)
Rules of application
—(1)
In general.
The election under section 1039(a) may be made only by the taxpayer owning the qualified housing project disposed of. Thus, if the qualified housing project disposed of is owned by a partnership, the partnership must make the election. (See section 703(b).) Similarly, if the qualified housing project disposed of is owned by a corporation or trust, the corporation or trust must make the election. In addition, the reinvestment of the taxpayer must be in such a manner that the taxpayer would be entitled to a deduction for depreciation on the replacement project. Thus, if the qualified housing project disposed of is owned by individual A, the purchase by A of stock in a corporation owning or constructing such a project or of an interest in a partnership owning or constructing such a project will not be considered as the purchase or construction by A of such a project.
(2)
Special rules.
(i) The cost of a replacement project acquired before the approved disposition of a qualified housing project shall be taken into account under section 1039 only if such property is held by the taxpayer on the date of the approved disposition.
(ii) Except as provided in section 1039 (d), no property acquired by the taxpayer shall be taken into account for purposes of section 1039(a)(2) unless the unadjusted basis of such property is its cost within the meaning of section 1012. For example, if a qualified housing project is acquired in an exchange under section 1031, relating to exchange of property held for productive use or investment, such property will not be taken into account under section 1039(a)(2) because its basis is determined by reference to the basis of the property exchanged. (See section 1031(d).)
(3)
Cost of replacement project.
The taxpayer's cost for the replacement project includes only amounts properly treated as capital expenditures by the taxpayer that are attributable to acquisition, construction, or reconstruction made within the reinvestment period (as defined in paragraph (c)(4) of this section). See section 263 for rules as to what constitutes capital expenditures. Thus, assume that a calendar year taxpayer realizes gain in 1970 upon the approved disposition of a qualified housing project occurring on January 1, 1970. If the taxpayer had begun construction of another qualified housing project on January 1, 1969, and completes such construction on June 1, 1972, only that portion of the cost attributable to the period before January
1, 1972, constitutes the cost of the replacement project for purposes of section 1039. For purposes of determining the cost of a replacement project attributable to a particular period, the total cost of the project may be allocated to such period on the basis of the portion of the total project actually constructed during such period.
(4)
Election.
(i) An election not to recognize the gain realized upon an approved disposition of a qualified housing project to the extent provided in section 1039(a) may be made by attaching a statement to the income tax return filed for the first taxable year in which any portion of the gain on such disposition is realized. Such a statement shall contain the information required by subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph. If the taxpayer does not file such a statement for the first taxable year in which any portion of the gain is realized, but fails to report a portion of the gain realized upon the approved disposition as income for such year or for any subsequent taxable year, then an election shall be deemed to be made under section 1039 (a) with respect to that portion of the gain not reported as income.
(ii) An election may be made under section 1039(a) even though the replacement project has not been acquired or constructed at the time of election. However, if an election has been made and (
a
) a replacement project is not constructed, reconstructed, or acquired, (
b
) the cost of the replacement project is lower than the net amount realized from the approved disposition, or (
c
) a decision is made not to construct, reconstruct, or acquire a replacement project, then the tax liability for the year or years for which the election was made shall be recomputed and an amended return filed. An election may be made even though the taxpayer has filed his return and recognized gain upon the disposition provided that the period of limitation on filing claims for credit or refund prescribed by section 6511 has not expired. In such case, a statement containing the information required by subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph should be filed together with a claim for credit or refund for the taxable year or years in which gain was recognized.
(iii) The statement referred to in subdivisions (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph shall contain the following information:
(
a
) The date of the approved disposition;
(
b
) If a replacement project has been acquired, the date of acquisition and cost of the project;
(
c
) If a replacement project has been constructed or reconstructed by or for the taxpayer, the date construction was begun, the date construction was completed, and the percentage of construction completed within the reinvestment period;
(
d
) If no replacement project has been constructed, reconstructed, or acquired prior to the time of filing of the statement, the estimated cost of such construction, reconstruction, or acquisition;
(
e
) The adjusted basis of the project disposed of; and
(
f
) The amount realized upon the approved disposition and a description of the expenses directly connected with the disposition and the taxes (other than income taxes) attributable to the disposition.
(c)
Definitions
—(1)
General.
The definitions contained in subparagraphs (2) through (5) of this paragraph shall apply for purposes of this section.
(2)
Qualified housing project.
The term
qualified housing project
means a rental or cooperative housing project for lower income families that has been constructed, reconstructed, or rehabilitated pursuant to a mortgage which is insured under section 221(d)(3) or 236 of the National Housing Act, provided that with respect to the housing project disposed of and the replacement project constructed, reconstructed, or acquired, the owner of the project at the time of the approved disposition and prior to the close of the reinvestment period is, under such sections or regulations issued thereunder,
(i) Limited as to rate of return on his investment in the project, and
(ii) Limited as to rentals or occupancy charges for units in the project.
If the owner of the project is organized and operated as a nonprofit cooperative or other nonprofit organization, then such owner shall be considered to meet
the requirement of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph.
(3)
Approved disposition.
The term
approved disposition
means a sale or other disposition of a qualified housing project to the tenants or occupants of units in such project, or to a nonprofit cooperative or other nonprofit organization formed and operated solely for the benefit of such tenants or occupants, provided that it is approved by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development or his delegate under section 221 (d)(3) or 236 of the National Housing Act or regulations issued under such sections. Evidence of such approval should be attached to the tax return or statement in which the election under section 1039 is made.
(4)
Reinvestment period.
(i) The term
reinvestment period
means the period beginning 1 year before the date of the disposition and ending 1 year after the close of the first taxable year in which any part of the gain from such disposition is realized, or at such later date as may be designated pursuant to an application made by the taxpayer. Such application shall be made before the expiration of one year after the close of the first taxable year in which any part of the gain from such disposition is realized, unless the taxpayer can show to the satisfaction of the district director that—
(
a
) Reasonable cause exists for not having filed the application within the required period, and
(
b
) The filing of such application was made within a reasonable time after the expiration of the required period.
The application shall contain all the information required by paragraph (b)(4) of this section and shall be made to the district director for the internal revenue district in which the return is filed for the first taxable year in which any of the gain from the approved disposition is realized.
(ii) Ordinarily, requests for extension of the reinvestment period will not be granted until near the end of such period and any extension will usually be limited to a period not exceeding one year. Although granting of an extension depends upon the facts and circumstances of a particular case, if a predominant portion of the construction of the replacement project has been completed or is reasonably expected to be completed within the reinvestment period (determined without regard to any extension thereof), an extension of the reinvestment period will ordinarily be granted. The fact that there is a scarcity of replacement property for acquisition will not be considered sufficient grounds for granting an extension.
(5)
Net amount realized.
(i) The
net amount realized
from the approved disposition of a qualified housing project is the amount realized from such disposition, reduced by—
(
a
) The expenses paid or incurred by the taxpayer which are directly connected with the approved disposition, and
(
b
) The amount of taxes (other than income taxes) paid or incurred by the taxpayer which are attributable to the approved disposition.
(ii) Examples of expenses directly connected with an approved disposition of a qualified housing project include amounts paid for sales or other commissions, advertising, and for the preparation of a deed or other legal services in connection with the disposition. An amount paid for a repair to the building will be considered as an expense directly connected with the approved disposition under subdivision (i)(
a
) of this subparagraph only if such repair is required as a condition of sale, or is required by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development or his delegate as a condition of approval of the disposition.
(iii) Examples of taxes that are attributable to the approved disposition include local property transfer taxes and stamp taxes. A local real property tax is not so attributable.
(d)
Basis and holding period of replacement project
—(1)
Basis.
If the taxpayer makes an election under section 1039, the basis of the replacement housing project shall be its cost (including costs incurred subsequent to the reinvestment period) reduced by the amount of gain not recognized under section 1039 (a). If the replacement consists of more than one housing project, the basis determined under this subparagraph shall be allocated to the properties in proportion to their respective costs.
(2)
Holding period.
The holding period of the replacement housing project shall begin on the date the taxpayer acquires such project, that is, on the date the taxpayer first acquires possession or control of such project and bears the burdens and enjoys the benefits of ownership of the replacement project. (For special rule regarding the holding period of property for purposes of section 1250, see section 1250(e)(4).)
(e)
Assessment of deficiencies
—(1)
Deficiency attributable to gain.
If a taxpayer makes an election under section 1039(a) with respect to an approved disposition, any deficiency attributable to the gain on such disposition, for any taxable year in which any part of such gain is realized, may be assessed at any time before the expiration of 3 years after the date the district director or director of the regional service center with whom the return for such year has been filed is notified by the taxpayer of the acquisition or the completion of construction or reconstruction of the replacement qualified housing project or of the failure to acquire, construct, or reconstruct a replacement qualified housing project, as the case may be. Such a deficiency may be assessed before the expiration of such 3-year period notwithstanding the provisions of section 6212(c) or the provisions of any other law or rule of law which would otherwise prevent such assessment. If replacement has been made, such notification shall contain the information required by paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section. Such notification shall be attached to the return filed for the taxable year or years in which the replacement occurs, or in which the period for the replacement expires, and a copy of such notification shall be filed with the district director or director of regional service center with whom the election under section 1039(a) was required to be filed, if the return is not filed with such director.
(2)
Deficiency attributable to election.
If gain upon an approved disposition is realized in two (or more) taxable years, and the replacement qualified housing project was acquired, constructed, or reconstructed before the beginning of the last such year, any deficiency, for any taxable year before such last year, which is attributable to an election by the taxpayer under section 1039(a) may be assessed at any time before the expiration of the period within which a deficiency for such last taxable year may be assessed, notwithstanding the provisions of section 6212(c) or 6501 or the provisions of any law or rule of law which would otherwise prevent such assessment. Thus, if gain upon an approved disposition is realized in 1971 and 1975, and if a replacement project is purchased in 1971, any deficiency for 1971 may be assessed within the period for assessing a deficiency for 1975.

§ 1.1041-1T
Treatment of transfer of property between spouses or incident to divorce (temporary).
Q-1: How is the transfer of property between spouses treated under section 1041?
A-1: Generally, no gain or loss is recognized on a transfer of property from an individual to (or in trust for the benefit of) a spouse or, if the transfer is incident to a divorce, a former spouse. The following questions and answers describe more fully the scope, tax consequences and other rules which apply to transfers of property under section 1041.
(a)
Scope of section 1041 in general.
Q-2: Does section 1041 apply only to transfers of property incident to divorce?
A-2: No. Section 1041 is not limited to transfers of property incident to divorce. Section 1041 applies to any transfer of property between spouses regardless of whether the transfer is a gift or is a sale or exchange between spouses acting at arm's length (including a transfer in exchange for the relinquishment of property or marital rights or an exchange otherwise governed by another nonrecognition provision of the Code). A divorce or legal separation need not be contemplated between the spouses at the time of the transfer nor must a divorce or legal separation ever occur.

# Example 1.
A and B are married and file a joint return. A is the sole owner of a condominium unit. A sale or gift of the condominium from A to B is a transfer which is subject to the rules of section 1041.

# Example 2.
A and B are married and file separate returns. A is the owner of an independent sole proprietorship, X Company. In the ordinary course of business, X Company makes a sale of property to B. This sale is a transfer of property between spouses and is subject to the rules of section 1041.

# Example 3.
Assume the same facts as in example (2), except that X Company is a corporation wholly owned by A. This sale is not a sale between spouses subject to the rules of section 1041. However, in appropriate circumstances, general tax principles, including the step-transaction doctrine, may be applicable in recharacterizing the transaction.
Q-3: Do the rules of section 1041 apply to a transfer between spouses if the transferee spouse is a nonresident alien?
A-3: No. Gain or loss (if any) is recognized (assuming no other nonrecognition provision applies) at the time of a transfer of property if the property is transferred to a spouse who is a nonresident alien.
Q-4: What kinds of transfers are governed by section 1041?
A-4: Only transfers of property (whether real or personal, tangible or intangible) are governed by section 1041. Transfers of services are not subject to the rules of section 1041.
Q-5: Must the property transferred to a former spouse have been owned by the transferor spouse during the marriage?
A-5: No. A transfer of property acquired after the marriage ceases may be governed by section 1041.
(b)
Transfer incident to the divorce.
Q-6: When is a transfer of property
incident to the divorce
?
A-6: A transfer of property is
incident to the divorce
in either of the following 2 circumstances—
(1) The transfer occurs not more than one year after the date on which the marriage ceases, or
(2) The transfer is related to the cessation of the marriage.
Thus, a transfer of property occurring not more than one year after the date on which the marriage ceases need not be related to the cessation of the marriage to qualify for section 1041 treatment. (See A-7 for transfers occurring more than one year after the cessation of the marriage.)
Q-7: When is a transfer of property
related to the cessation of the marriage
?
A-7: A transfer of property is treated as related to the cessation of the marriage if the transfer is pursuant to a divorce or separation instrument, as defined in section 71(b)(2), and the transfer occurs not more than 6 years after the date on which the marriage ceases. A divorce or separation instrument includes a modification or amendment to such decree or instrument. Any transfer not pursuant to a divorce or separation instrument and any transfer occurring more than 6 years after the cessation of the marriage is presumed to be not related to the cessation of the marriage. This presumption may be rebutted only by showing that the transfer was made to effect the division of property owned by the former spouses at the time of the cessation of the marriage. For example, the presumption may be rebutted by showing that (a) the transfer was not made within the one- and six-year periods described above because of factors which hampered an earlier transfer of the property, such as legal or business impediments to transfer or disputes concerning the value of the property owned at the time of the cessation of the marriage, and (b) the transfer is effected promptly after the impediment to transfer is removed.
Q-8: Do annulments and the cessations of marriages that are void
ab initio
due to violations of state law constitute divorces for purposes of section 1041?
A-8: Yes.
(c)
Transfers on behalf of a spouse.
Q-9: May transfers of property to third parties on behalf of a spouse (or former spouse) qualify under section 1041?
A-9: Yes. There are three situations in which a transfer of property to a third party on behalf of a spouse (or former spouse) will qualify under section 1041, provided all other requirements of the section are satisfied. The first situation is where the transfer to the third party is required by a divorce or separation instrument. The second situation is where the transfer to the third party is pursuant to the written request of the other spouse (or former spouse). The third situation is where the transferor receives from the other spouse (or former spouse) a written
consent or ratification of the transfer to the third party. Such consent or ratification must state that the parties intend the transfer to be treated as a transfer to the nontransferring spouse (or former spouse) subject to the rules of section 1041 and must be received by the transferor prior to the date of filing of the transferor's first return of tax for the taxable year in which the transfer was made. In the three situations described above, the transfer of property will be treated as made directly to the nontransferring spouse (or former spouse) and the nontransferring spouse will be treated as immediately transferring the property to the third party. The deemed transfer from the nontransferring spouse (or former spouse) to the third party is not a transaction that qualifies for nonrecognition of gain under section 1041. This A-9 shall not apply to transfers to which § 1.1041-2 applies.
(d)
Tax consequences of transfers subject to section 1041.
Q-10: How is the transferor of property under section 1041 treated for income tax purposes?
A-10: The transferor of property under section 1041 recognizes no gain or loss on the transfer even if the transfer was in exchange for the release of marital rights or other consideration. This rule applies regardless of whether the transfer is of property separately owned by the transferor or is a division (equal or unequal) of community property. Thus, the result under section 1041 differs from the result in
United States
v.
Davis,
370 U.S. 65 (1962).
Q-11: How is the transferee of property under section 1041 treated for income tax purposes?
A-11: The transferee of property under section 1041 recognizes no gain or loss upon receipt of the transferred property. In all cases, the basis of the transferred property in the hands of the transferee is the adjusted basis of such property in the hands of the transferor immediately before the transfer. Even if the transfer is a bona fide sale, the transferee does not acquire a basis in the transferred property equal to the transferee's cost (the fair market value). This carryover basis rule applies whether the adjusted basis of the transferred property is less than, equal to, or greater than its fair market value at the time of transfer (or the value of any consideration provided by the transferee) and applies for purposes of determining loss as well as gain upon the subsequent disposition of the property by the transferee. Thus, this rule is different from the rule applied in section 1015(a) for determining the basis of property acquired by gift.
Q-12: Do the rules described in A-10 and A-11 apply even if the transferred property is subject to liabilities which exceed the adjusted basis of the property?
A-12: Yes. For example, assume A owns property having a fair market value of $10,000 and an adjusted basis of $1,000. In contemplation of making a transfer of this property incident to a divorce from B, A borrows $5,000 from a bank, using the property as security for the borrowing. A then transfers the property to B and B assumes, or takes the property subject to, the liability to pay the $5,000 debt. Under section 1041, A recognizes no gain or loss upon the transfer of the property, and the adjusted basis of the property in the hands of B is $1,000.
Q-13: Will a transfer under section 1041 result in a recapture of investment tax credits with respect to the property transferred?
A-13: In general, no. Property transferred under section 1041 will not be treated as being disposed of by, or ceasing to be section 38 property with respect to, the transferor. However, the transferee will be subject to investment tax credit recapture if, upon or after the transfer, the property is disposed of by, or ceases to be section 38 property with respect to, the transferee. For example, as part of a divorce property settlement, B receives a car from A that has been used in A's business for two years and for which an investment tax credit was taken by A. No part of A's business is transferred to B and B's use of the car is solely personal. B is subject to recapture of the investment tax credit previously taken by A.
(e)
Notice and recordkeeping requirement with respect to transactions under section 1041.
Q-14: Does the trasnsferor of property in a transaction described in section
1041 have to supply, at the time of the transfer, the transferee with records sufficient to determine the adjusted basis and holding period of the property at the time of the transfer and (if applicable) with notice that the property transferred under section 1041 is potentially subject to recapture of the investment tax credit?
A-14: Yes. A transferor of property under section 1041 must, at the time of the transfer, supply the transferee with records sufficient to determine the adjusted basis and holding period of the property as of the date of the transfer. In addition, in the case of a transfer of property which carries with it a potential liability for investment tax credit recapture, the transferor must, at the time of the transfer, supply the transferee with records sufficient to determine the amount and period of such potential liability. Such records must be preserved and kept accessible by the transferee.
(f)
Property settlements—effective dates, transitional periods and elections.
Q-15: When does section 1041 become effective?
A-15: Generally, section 1041 applies to all transfers after July 18, 1984. However, it does not apply to transfers after July 18, 1984 pursuant to instruments in effect on or before July 18, 1984. (See A-16 with respect to exceptions to the general rule.)
Q-16: Are there any exceptions to the general rule stated in A-15 above?
A-16: Yes. Two transitional rules provide exceptions to the general rule stated in A-15. First, section 1041 will apply to transfers after July 18, 1984 under instruments that were in effect on or before July 18, 1984 if both spouses (or former spouses) elect to have section 1041 apply to such transfers. Second, section 1041 will apply to all transfers after December 31, 1983 (including transfers under instruments in effect on or before July 18, 1984) if both spouses (or former spouses) elect to have section 1041 apply. (See A-18 relating to the time and manner of making the elections under the first or second transitional rule.)
Q-17: Can an election be made to have section 1041 apply to some, but not all, transfers made after December 31, 1983, or some but not all, transfers made after July 18, 1984 under instruments in effect on or before July 18, 1984?
A-17: No. Partial elections are not allowed. An election under either of the two elective transitional rules applies to all transfers governed by that election whether before or after the election is made, and is irrevocable.
(g)
Property settlements—time and manner of making the elections under section 1041.
Q-18: How do spouses (or former spouses) elect to have section 1041 apply to transfers after December 31, 1983, or to transfers after July 18, 1984 under instruments in effect on or before July 18, 1984?
A-18: In order to make an election under section 1041 for property transfers after December 31, 1983, or property transfers under instruments that were in effect on or before July 18, 1984, both spouses (or former spouses) must elect the application of the rules of section 1041 by attaching to the transferor's first filed income tax return for the taxable year in which the first transfer occurs, a statement signed by both spouses (or former spouses) which includes each spouse's social security number and is in substantially the form set forth at the end of this answer.
In addition, the transferor must attach a copy of such statement to his or her return for each subsequent taxable year in which a transfer is made that is governed by the transitional election. A copy of the signed statment must be kept by both parties.
The election statements shall be in substantially the following form:
In the case of an election regarding transfers after 1983:

# Section 1041 Election
The undersigned hereby elect to have the provisions of section 1041 of the Internal Revenue Code apply to all qualifying transfers of property after December 31, 1983. The undersigned understand that section 1041 applies to all property transferred between spouses, or former spouses incident to divorce. The parties further understand that the effects for Federal income tax purposes of having section 1041 apply are that (1) no gain or loss is recognized by the transferor spouse or former spouse as a result of this transfer; and (2) the basis of the transferred property in the hands of the transferee is the
adjusted basis of the property in the hands of the transferor immediately before the transfer, whether or not the adjusted basis of the transferred property is less than, equal to, or greater than its fair market value at the time of the transfer. The undersigned understand that if the transferee spouse or former spouse disposes of the property in a transaction in which gain is recognized, the amount of gain which is taxable may be larger than it would have been if this election had not been made.
In the case of an election regarding preexisting decrees:

# Section 1041 Election
The undersigned hereby elect to have the provisions of section 1041 of the Internal Revenue Code apply to all qualifying transfers of property after July 18, 1984 under any instrument in effect on or before July 18, 1984. The undersigned understand that section 1041 applies to all property transferred between spouses, or former spouses incident to the divorce. The parties further understand that the effects for Federal income tax purposes of having section 1041 apply are that (1) no gain or loss is recognized by the transferor spouse or former spouse as a result of this transfer; and (2) the basis of the transferred property in the hands of the transferee is the adjusted basis of the property in the hands of the transferor immediately before the transfer, whether or not the adjusted basis of the transferred property is less than, equal to, or greater than its fair market value at the time of the transfer. The undersigned understand that if the transferee spouse or former spouse disposes of the property in a transaction in which gain is recognized, the amount of gain which is taxable may be larger than it would have been if this election had not been made.

§ 1.1041-2
Redemptions of stock.
(a)
In general
—(1)
Redemptions of stock not resulting in constructive distributions.
Notwithstanding Q
A-9 of § 1.1041-1T(c), if a corporation redeems stock owned by a spouse or former spouse (transferor spouse), and the transferor spouse's receipt of property in respect of such redeemed stock is not treated, under applicable tax law, as resulting in a constructive distribution to the other spouse or former spouse (nontransferor spouse), then the form of the stock redemption shall be respected for Federal income tax purposes. Therefore, the transferor spouse will be treated as having received a distribution from the corporation in redemption of stock.
(2)
Redemptions of stock resulting in constructive distributions.
Notwithstanding Q
A-9 of § 1.1041-1T(c), if a corporation redeems stock owned by a transferor spouse, and the transferor spouse's receipt of property in respect of such redeemed stock is treated, under applicable tax law, as resulting in a constructive distribution to the nontransferor spouse, then the redeemed stock shall be deemed first to be transferred by the transferor spouse to the nontransferor spouse and then to be transferred by the nontransferor spouse to the redeeming corporation. Any property actually received by the transferor spouse from the redeeming corporation in respect of the redeemed stock shall be deemed first to be transferred by the corporation to the nontransferor spouse in redemption of such spouse's stock and then to be transferred by the nontransferor spouse to the transferor spouse.
(b)
Tax consequences
—(1)
Transfers described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
Section 1041 will not apply to any of the transfers described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. See section 302 for rules relating to the tax consequences of certain redemptions; redemptions characterized as distributions under section 302(d) will be subject to section 301 if received from a Subchapter C corporation or section 1368 if received from a Subchapter S corporation.
(2)
Transfers described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
The tax consequences of each deemed transfer described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section are determined under applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code as if the spouses had actually made such transfers. Accordingly, section 1041 applies to any deemed transfer of the stock and redemption proceeds between the transferor spouse and the nontransferor spouse, provided the requirements of section 1041 are otherwise satisfied with respect to such deemed transfer. Section 1041, however, will not apply to any deemed transfer
of stock by the nontransferor spouse to the redeeming corporation in exchange for the redemption proceeds.
See
section 302 for rules relating to the tax consequences of certain redemptions; redemptions characterized as distributions under section 302(d) will be subject to section 301 if received from a Subchapter C corporation or section 1368 if received from a Subchapter S corporation.
(c)
Special rules in case of agreements between spouses or former spouses
—(1)
Transferor spouse taxable.
Notwithstanding applicable tax law, a transferor spouse's receipt of property in respect of the redeemed stock shall be treated as a distribution to the transferor spouse in redemption of such stock for purposes of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, and shall not be treated as resulting in a constructive distribution to the nontransferor spouse for purposes of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, if a divorce or separation instrument, or a valid written agreement between the transferor spouse and the nontransferor spouse, expressly provides that—
(i) Both spouses or former spouses intend for the redemption to be treated, for Federal income tax purposes, as a redemption distribution to the transferor spouse; and
(ii) Such instrument or agreement supersedes any other instrument or agreement concerning the purchase, sale, redemption, or other disposition of the stock that is the subject of the redemption.
(2)
Nontransferor spouse taxable.
Notwithstanding applicable tax law, a transferor spouse's receipt of property in respect of the redeemed stock shall be treated as resulting in a constructive distribution to the nontransferor spouse for purposes of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, and shall not be treated as a distribution to the transferor spouse in redemption of such stock for purposes of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, if a divorce or separation instrument, or a valid written agreement between the transferor spouse and the nontransferor spouse, expressly provides that—
(i) Both spouses or former spouses intend for the redemption to be treated, for Federal income tax purposes, as resulting in a constructive distribution to the nontransferor spouse; and
(ii) Such instrument or agreement supersedes any other instrument or agreement concerning the purchase, sale, redemption, or other disposition of the stock that is the subject of the redemption.
(3)
Execution of agreements.
For purposes of this paragraph (c), a divorce or separation instrument must be effective, or a valid written agreement must be executed by both spouses or former spouses, prior to the date on which the transferor spouse (in the case of paragraph (c)(1) of this section) or the nontransferor spouse (in the case of paragraph (c)(2) of this section) files such spouse's first timely filed Federal income tax return for the year that includes the date of the stock redemption, but no later than the date such return is due (including extensions).
(d)
Examples.
The provisions of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Corporation X has 100 shares outstanding. A and B each own 50 shares. A and B divorce. The divorce instrument requires B to purchase A's shares, and A to sell A's shares to B, in exchange for $100x. Corporation X redeems A's shares for $100x. Assume that, under applicable tax law, B has a primary and unconditional obligation to purchase A's stock, and therefore the stock redemption results in a constructive distribution to B. Also assume that the special rule of paragraph (c)(1) of this section does not apply. Accordingly, under paragraphs (a)(2) and (b)(2) of this section, A shall be treated as transferring A's stock of Corporation X to B in a transfer to which section 1041 applies (assuming the requirements of section 1041 are otherwise satisfied), B shall be treated as transferring the Corporation X stock B is deemed to have received from A to Corporation X in exchange for $100x in an exchange to which section 1041 does not apply and sections 302(d) and 301 apply, and B shall be treated as transferring the $100x to A in a transfer to which section 1041 applies.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as
Example 1,
except that the divorce instrument provides as follows: “A and B agree that the redemption will be treated for Federal income tax purposes as a redemption distribution to A.” The divorce instrument further provides that it “supersedes all other instruments or agreements concerning the purchase, sale, redemption, or other disposition of the stock that is the subject of the redemption.” By virtue of the special rule of paragraph (c)(1) of this section and under paragraphs (a)(1)
and (b)(1) of this section, the tax consequences of the redemption shall be determined in accordance with its form as a redemption of A's shares by Corporation X and shall not be treated as resulting in a constructive distribution to B. See section 302.

# Example 3.
Assume the same facts as
Example 1,
except that the divorce instrument requires A to sell A's shares to Corporation X in exchange for a note. B guarantees Corporation X's payment of the note. Assume that, under applicable tax law, B does not have a primary and unconditional obligation to purchase A's stock, and therefore the stock redemption does not result in a constructive distribution to B. Also assume that the special rule of paragraph (c)(2) of this section does not apply. Accordingly, under paragraphs (a)(1) and (b)(1) of this section, the tax consequences of the redemption shall be determined in accordance with its form as a redemption of A's shares by Corporation X. See section 302.

# Example 4.
Assume the same facts as
Example 3,
except that the divorce instrument provides as follows: “A and B agree the redemption shall be treated, for Federal income tax purposes, as resulting in a constructive distribution to B.” The divorce instrument further provides that it “supersedes any other instrument or agreement concerning the purchase, sale, redemption, or other disposition of the stock that is the subject of the redemption.” By virtue of the special rule of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the redemption is treated as resulting in a constructive distribution to B for purposes of paragraph (a)(2) of this section. Accordingly, under paragraphs (a)(2) and (b)(2) of this section, A shall be treated as transferring A's stock of Corporation X to B in a transfer to which section 1041 applies (assuming the requirements of section 1041 are otherwise satisfied), B shall be treated as transferring the Corporation X stock B is deemed to have received from A to Corporation X in exchange for a note in an exchange to which section 1041 does not apply and sections 302(d) and 301 apply, and B shall be treated as transferring the note to A in a transfer to which section 1041 applies.
(e)
Effective date.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, this section is applicable to redemptions of stock on or after January 13, 2003, except for redemptions of stock that are pursuant to instruments in effect before January 13, 2003. For redemptions of stock before January 13, 2003 and redemptions of stock that are pursuant to instruments in effect before January 13, 2003, see § 1.1041-1T(c), A-9. However, these regulations will be applicable to redemptions described in the preceding sentence of this paragraph (e) if the spouses or former spouses execute a written agreement on or after August 3, 2001 that satisfies the requirements of one of the special rules in paragraph (c) of this section with respect to such redemption. A divorce or separation instrument or valid written agreement executed on or after August 3, 2001, and before May 13, 2003 that meets the requirements of the special rule in Regulations Project REG-107151-00 published in 2001-2 C.B. 370 (
see
§ 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter) will be treated as also meeting the requirements of the special rule in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
[T.D. 9035, 68 FR 1536, Jan. 13, 2003]
§ 1.1042-1T
Questions and answers relating to the sales of stock to employee stock ownership plans or certain cooperatives (temporary).
Q-1: What does section 1042 provide?
A-1: (a) Section 1042 provides rules under which a taxpayer may elect not to recognize gain in certain cases where
qualified securities
are sold to a qualifying employee stock ownership plan or worker-owned cooperative in taxable years of the seller beginning after July 18, 1984, and
qualified replacement property
is purchased by the taxpayer within the
replacement period.
If the requirements of Q
A-2 of this section are met, and if the taxpayer makes an election under section 1042(a) in accordance with Q
A-3 of this section, the gain realized by the taxpayer on the sale of the qualified securities is recognized only to the extent that the amount realized on such sale exceeds the cost to the taxpayer of the qualified replacement property.
(b) Under section 1042, the term
qualified securities
means employer securities (as defined in section 409(l)) with respect to which each of the following requirements is satisfied: (1) The employer securities were issued by a domestic corporation; (2) for at least one year before and immediately after the sale, the domestic corporation that issued the employer securities (and each corporation that is a member of a
controlled group of corporations
with such corporation for purposes of section 409(l)) has no stock outstanding
that is readily tradeable on an established market; (3) as of the time of the sale, the employer securities have been held by the taxpayer for more than 1 year; and (4) the employer securities were not received by the taxpayer in a distribution from a plan described in section 401(a) or in a transfer pursuant to an option or other right to acquire stock to which section 83, 422, 422A, 423, or 424 applies.
(c) The term
replacement period
means the period which begins 3 months before the date on which the sale of qualified securities occurs and which ends 12 months after the date of such sale. A replacement period may include any period which occurs prior to July 19, 1984.
(d) The term
qualified replacement property
means any securities (as defined in section 165(g)(2)) issued by a domestic corporation which does not, for the taxable year of such corporation in which the securities are purchased by the taxpayer, have passive investment income (as defined in section 1362(d)(3)(D)) that exceeds 25 percent of the gross receipts of such corporation for the taxable year preceding the taxable year of purchase. In addition, securities of the domestic corporation that issued the employer securities qualifying under section 1042 (and of any corporation that is a member of a
controlled group of corporations
with such corporation for purposes of section 409(l)) will not qualify as
qualified replacement property.
(e) For purposes of section 1042(a), there is a
purchase
of qualified replacement property only if the basis of such property is determined by reference to its cost to the taxpayer. If the basis of the qualified replacement property is determined by reference to its basis in the hands of the transferor thereof or another person, or by reference to the basis of property (other than cash or its equivalent) exchanged for such property, then the basis of such property is not determined solely by reference to its cost to the taxpayer.
Q-2: What is a sale of qualified securities for purposes of section 1042(b)?
A-2: (a) Under section 1042(b), a sale of qualified securities is one under which all of the following requirements are met:
(1) The qualified securities are sold to an employee stock ownership plan (as defined in section 4975(e)(7)) maintained by the corporation that issued the qualified securities (or by a member of the
controlled group of corporations
with such corporation for purposes of section 409(l)) or to an eligible worker-owned cooperative (as defined in section 1042(c)(2));
(2) The employee stock ownership plan or eligible worker-owned cooperative owns, immediately after the sale, 30 percent or more of the total value of the employer securities (within the meaning of section 409(l) outstanding as of such time;
(3) No portion of the assets of the employee stock ownership plan or eligible worker-owned cooperative attributable to qualified securities that are sold to the plan or cooperative by the taxpayer or by any other person in a sale with respect to which an election under section 1042(a) is made accrue under the plan or are allocated by the cooperative, either directly or indirectly and either concurrently with or at any time thereafter, for the benefit of (i) the taxpayer; (ii) any person who is a member of the family of the taxpayer (within the meaning of section 267(c)(4)); or (iii) any person who owns (after the application of section 318(a)), at any time after July 18, 1984, and until immediately after the sale, more than 25 percent of in value of the outstanding portion of any class of stock of the corporation that issued the qualified securities (or of any member of the
controlled group of corporations
with such corporation for purposes of section 409(l)). For purposes of this calculation, stock that is owned, directly or indirectly, by or for a qualified plan shall not be treated as outstanding.
(4) The taxpayer files with the Secretary (as part of the required election described in Q
A-3 of this section) a verified written statement of the domestic corporation (or corporations) whose employees are covered by the plan acquiring the qualified securities or of any authorized officer of the eligible workerowned cooperative, consenting to the application of section 4978(a) with respect to such corporation or cooperative.
(b) For purposes of determining whether paragraph (a)(2) of this section is satisfied, sales of qualified securities by two or more taxpayers may be treated as a single sale if such sales are made as part of a single, integrated transaction under a prearranged agreement between the taxpayers.
(c) For purposes of determining whether paragraph (a)(3) of this section is satisfied with respect to the prohibition against an accrual or allocation of qualified securities, the accrual or allocation of any benefits or contributions or other assets that are not attributable to qualified securities sold to the employee stock ownership plan or eligible worker-owned cooperative in a sale with respect to which an election under section 1042(a) is made (including any accrual or allocation under any other plan or arrangement maintained by the corporation or any member of
the controlled group of corporations
with such corporation for purposes of section 409(l)) must be made without regard to the allocation of such qualified securities. Paragraph (a)(3) of this section above may be illustrated in part by the following example: Individuals A, B, and C own 50, 25, and 25, respectively, of the 100 outstanding shares of common stock of Corporation X. Such shares constitute qualified securities as defined in Q
A-1 of this section. A and B, but not C, are employees of Corporation X. For the benefit of all its employees, Corporation X establishes an employee stock ownership plan that obtains a loan meeting the exemption requirements of section 4975(d)(3). The loan proceeds are used by the plan to purchase the 100 shares of qualified securities from A, B, and C, all of whom elect nonrecognition treatment under section 1042(a) with respect to the gain realized on their sale of such securities. Under the requirements of paragraph (a)(3) of this section, no part of the assets of the plan attributable to the 100 shares of qualified securities may accrue under the plan (or under any other plan or arrangement maintained by Corporation X) for the benefit of A or B or any person who is a member of the family of A or B (as determined under section 267(c)(4)). Furthermore, no other assets of the plan or assets of the employer may accrue for the benefit of such individuals in lieu of the receipt of assets attributable to such qualified securities.
(d) A sale under section 1042(a) shall not include any sale of securities by a dealer or underwriter in the ordinary course of its trade or business as a dealer or underwriter, whether or not guaranteed.
Q-3: What is the time and manner for making the election under section 1042(a)?
A-3: (a) The election not to recognize the gain realized upon the sale of qualified securities to the extent provided under section 1042(a) shall be made in a
statement of election
attached to the taxpayer's income tax return filed on or before the due date (including extensions of time) for the taxable year in which the sale occurs. If a taxpayer does not make a timely election under this section to obtain section 1042(a) nonrecognition treatment with respect to the sale of qualified securities, it may not subsequently make an election on an amended return or otherwise. Also, an election once made is irrevocable.
(b) The statement of election shall provide that the taxpayer elects to treat the sale of securities as a sale of qualified securities under section 1042(a), and shall contain the following information:
(1) A description of the qualified securities sold, including the type and number of shares;
(2) The date of the sale of the qualified securities;
(3) The adjusted basis of the qualified securities;
(4) The amount realized upon the sale of the qualified securities;
(5) The identity of the employee stock ownership plan or eligible worker-owned cooperative to which the qualified securities were sold; and
(6) If the sale was part of a single, interrelated transaction under a prearranged agreement between taxpayers involving other sales of qualified securities, the names and taxpayer identification numbers of the other taxpayers under the agreement and the number of shares sold by the other taxpayers. See Q
A-2 of this section.
If the taxpayer has purchased qualified replacement property at the time of
the election, the taxpayer must attach as part of the statement of election a
statement of purchase
describing the qualified replacement property, the date of the purchase, and the cost of the property, and declaring such property to be the qualified replacement property with respect to the sale of qualified securities. Such statement of purchase must be notarized by the later of thirty days after the purchase or March 6, 1986. In addition, the statement of election must be accompanied by the verified written statement of consent required under Q
A-2 of this section with respect to the qualified securities sold.
(c) If the taxpayer has not purchased qualified replacement property at the time of the filing of the statement of election, a timely election under this Q
A shall not be considered to have been made unless the taxpayer attaches the notarized statement of purchase described above to the taxpayer's income tax return filed for the taxable year following the year for which the election under section 1042(a) was made. Such notarized statement of purchase shall be filed with the district director or the director of the regional service center with whom such election was originally filed, if the return is not filed with such director.
Q-4: What is the basis of qualified replacement property?
A-4: If a taxpayer makes an election under section 1042(a), the basis of the qualified replacement property purchased by the taxpayer during the replacement period shall be reduced by an amount equal to the amount of gain which was not recognized. If more than one item of qualified replacement property is purchased, the basis of each of such items shall be reduced by an amount determined by multiplying the total gain not recognized by reason of the application of section 1042(a) by a fraction, the numerator of which is the cost of such item of property and the denominator of which is the total cost of all such items of property. For the rule regarding the holding period of qualified replacement property, see section 1223(13).
Q-5: What is the statute of limitations for the assessment of a deficiency relating to the gain on the sale of qualified securities?
A-5: (a) If any gain is realized by the taxpayer on the sale of any qualified securities and such gain has not been recognized under section 1042(a) in accordance with the requirements of this section, the statutory period provided in section 6501(a) for the assessment of any deficiency with respect to such gain shall not expire prior to the expiration of 3 years from the date of receipt, by the district director or director of regional service center with whom the statement of election under 1042(a) was originally filed, of:
(1) A notarized statement of purchase as described in Q
A-3;
(2) A written statement of the taxpayer's intention not to purchase qualified replacement property within the replacement period; or
(3) A written statement of the taxpayer's failure to purchase qualified replacement property within the replacement period.
In those situations when a taxpayer is providing a written statement of an intention not to purchase or of a failure to purchase qualified replacement property, the statement shall be accompanied, where appropriate, by an amended return for the taxable year in which the gain from the sale of the qualified securities was realized, in order to reflect the inclusion in gross income for that year of gain required to be recognized in connection with such sale.
(b) Any gain from the sale of qualified securities which is required to be recognized due to a failure to meet the requirements under section 1042 shall be included in the gross income for the taxable year in which the gain was realized. If any gain from the sale of qualified securities is not recognized under section 1042(a) in accordance with the requirements of this section, any deficiency attributable to any portion of such gain may be assessed at any time before the expiration of the 3-year period described in this Q
A, notwithstanding the provision of any law or rule of law which would otherwise prevent such assessment.
Q-6: When does section 1042 become effective?
A-6: Section 1042 applies to sales of qualified securities in taxable years of sellers beginning after July 18, 1984.

[T.D. 8688, 61 FR 65322, Dec. 12, 1996]
§ 1.1045-1
Application to partnerships.
(a)
Overview of section.
A partnership that holds qualified small business stock (QSB stock) (as defined in paragraph (g)(1) of this section) for more than 6 months, sells such QSB stock, and purchases replacement QSB stock (as defined in paragraph (g)(2) of this section) may elect to apply section 1045. An eligible partner (as defined in paragraph (g)(3) of this section) of a partnership that sells QSB stock, may elect to apply section 1045 if the eligible partner purchases replacement QSB stock directly or through a purchasing partnership (as defined in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section). A taxpayer (other than a C corporation) that holds QSB stock for more than 6 months, sells such QSB stock and purchases replacement QSB stock through a purchasing partnership may elect to apply section 1045. A section 1045 election is revocable only with the prior written consent of the Commissioner. To obtain the Commissioner's prior written consent, the person who made the section 1045 election must submit a request for a private letter ruling. (For further guidance, see Rev. Proc. 2007-1, 2007-1 CB 1 (or any applicable successor) and § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(
b
) of this chapter.) Paragraph (b) of this section provides rules for partnerships that elect to apply section 1045. Paragraph (c) of this section provides rules for certain taxpayers other than C corporations and for eligible partners that elect to apply section 1045. Paragraph (d) of this section provides a limitation on the amount of gain that an eligible partner does not recognize under section 1045. Paragraph (e) of this section provides rules for partnership distributions of QSB stock to an eligible partner. Paragraph (f) of this section provides rules for contributions of QSB stock or replacement QSB stock to a partnership. Paragraph (g) of this section provides definitions of certain terms used in section 1045 and this section. Paragraph (h) of this section provides reporting rules for partnerships and partners that elect to apply section 1045. Paragraph (i) of this section provides examples illustrating the provisions of this section. Paragraph (j) of this section contains the effective/applicability date.
(b)
Partnership election
—(1)
Partnership purchase of replacement QSB stock.
A partnership that holds QSB stock for more than 6 months, sells such QSB stock, and purchases replacement QSB
stock may elect in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section to apply section 1045. If the partnership elects to apply section 1045, then, subject to the provisions of paragraphs (b)(4) and (d) of this section, each eligible partner shall not recognize its distributive share of any partnership section 1045 gain (as determined under paragraph (b)(2) of this section). For this purpose, partnership section 1045 gain equals the partnership's gain from the sale of the QSB stock reduced by the greater of—
(i) The amount of the gain from the sale of the QSB stock that is treated as ordinary income; or
(ii) The excess of the amount realized by the partnership on the sale over the total cost of all replacement QSB stock purchased by the partnership (excluding the cost of any replacement QSB stock purchased by the partnership that is otherwise taken into account under section 1045).
(2)
Partner's distributive share of partnership section 1045 gain.
A partner's distributive share of partnership section 1045 gain shall be in the same proportion as the partner's distributive share of the partnership's gain from the sale of the QSB stock. For this purpose, the partnership's gain from the sale of QSB stock and the partner's distributive share of that gain are determined without regard to basis adjustments under section 743(b) and paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section.
(3)
Basis adjustments
—(i)
Partner's interest in a partnership.
The adjusted basis of an eligible partner's interest in a partnership shall not be increased under section 705(a)(1) by gain from a partnership's sale of QSB stock that is not recognized by the partner as the result of a partnership election under paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(ii)
Partnership's replacement QSB stock
—(A)
Rule.
The basis of a partnership's replacement QSB stock is reduced (in the order acquired) by the amount of gain from the partnership's sale of QSB stock that is not recognized by an eligible partner as a result of the partnership's election under section 1045. The basis adjustment with respect to any amount described in this paragraph (b)(3)(ii) constitutes an adjustment to the basis of the partnership's replacement QSB stock with respect to that partner only. The effect of such a basis adjustment is determined under the principles of § 1.743-1(g), (h), and (j) except as modified in this paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A). If a partnership sells QSB stock with respect to which a basis adjustment has been made under this paragraph (b)(3)(ii), and the partnership makes an election under paragraph (b)(1) of this section with respect to the sale and purchases replacement QSB stock, the basis adjustment shall carry over to the replacement QSB stock except to the extent otherwise provided in this paragraph (b)(3)(ii). The basis adjustment that carries over to the replacement QSB stock shall be reduced (but not below zero) by the eligible partner's distributive share of the excess, if any, of the greater of the amount determined under paragraph (b)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section from the sale of the QSB stock, over the partnership's gain from the sale of the QSB stock (determined without regard to basis adjustments under section 743 or paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section). The excess amount that reduces the basis adjustment shall be accounted for as gain in accordance with § 1.743-1(j)(3). See
Example 5
of paragraph (i) of this section. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(3)(ii), a partnership must presume that a partner did not recognize that partner's distributive share of the partnership section 1045 gain as a result of the partnership's section 1045 election unless the partner notifies the partnership to the contrary as described in paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section. However, if a partnership knows that a particular partner is classified, for Federal tax purposes, as a C corporation, then the partnership may presume that the partner did not defer recognition of its distributive share of the partnership section 1045 gain, even in the absence of a notification by the partner. If a partnership makes an election under section 1045, but an eligible partner opts out of the election under paragraph (b)(4) of this section and provides to the partnership the notification required under paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section, no basis adjustments under this paragraph (b)(3)(ii) are required with respect to that partner as a result
of the section 1045 election by the partnership.
(B)
Tiered-partnership rule.
If a partnership (upper-tier partnership) holds an interest in another partnership (lower-tier partnership) that makes an election under section 1045, the portion of the lower-tier partnership's basis adjustment as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A) of this section in the replacement QSB stock must be segregated and allocated to the upper-tier partnership and any eligible partner as defined in paragraph (g)(3)(iii) of this section. Similarly, that portion of the basis of the upper-tier partnership's interest in the lower-tier partnership attributable to the basis adjustment as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A) of this section in the lower-tier partnership's replacement QSB stock must be segregated and allocated solely to any eligible partner as defined in paragraph (g)(2)(iii) of this section.
(C)
Statement of adjustments.
A partnership that must adjust the basis of replacement QSB stock under this paragraph (b) must attach a statement to the partnership return for the taxable year in which the partnership purchases replacement QSB stock setting forth the computation of the adjustment, the replacement QSB stock to which the adjustment has been made, the date(s) on which such QSB stock was acquired by the partnership, and the amount of the adjustment that is allocated to each partner.
(4)
Eligible partners may opt out of partnership's section 1045 election.
An eligible partner may opt out of the partnership's section 1045 election with respect to QSB stock either by recognizing the partner's distributive share of the partnership section 1045 gain, or by making a partner section 1045 election under paragraph (c) of this section with respect to the partner's distributive share of the partnership section 1045 gain. See paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section for applicable notification requirements. Opting out of a partnership's section 1045 election under this paragraph (b)(4) does not constitute a revocation of the partnership's election, and such election shall continue to apply to other partners of the partnership.
(5)
Notice requirements
—(i)
Partnership notification to partners.
A partnership that makes an election under paragraph (b)(1) of this section must notify all of its partners of the election and the purchase of replacement QSB stock, in accordance with the applicable forms and instructions, and separately state each partner's distributive share of partnership section 1045 gain from the sale of QSB stock under section 702. Each partner shall determine whether the partner is an eligible partner within the meaning of paragraph (g)(3) of this section and report the partner's distributive share of partnership section 1045 gain from the partnership's sale of QSB stock, including gain not recognized, in accordance with the applicable forms and instructions.
(ii)
Partner notification to partnership.
Any partner that must recognize all or part of the partner's distributive share of partnership section 1045 gain must notify the partnership, in writing, of the amount of partnership section 1045 gain that is recognized by the partner. Similarly, an eligible partner that opts out of a partnership's section 1045 election under paragraph (b)(4) of this section must notify the partnership, in writing, that the partner is opting out of the partnership's section 1045 election.
(c)
Partner election
—(1)
In general
—(i)
Rule.
An eligible partner of a partnership that sells QSB stock (selling partnership) may elect in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section to apply section 1045 if replacement QSB stock is purchased by the eligible partner. An eligible partner of a selling partnership may elect in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section to apply section 1045 if replacement QSB stock is purchased by a partnership in which the taxpayer is a partner (directly or through an upper-tier partnership) on the date on which the partnership acquires the replacement QSB stock (purchasing partnership). A taxpayer other than a C corporation that sells QSB stock held for more than 6 months at the time of the sale may elect in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section to apply section 1045 if replacement QSB stock is purchased by a purchasing partnership (including a selling partnership).
(ii)
Partner purchase of replacement QSB stock.
Subject to paragraph (d) of this section, an eligible partner of a selling partnership that elects to apply section 1045 with respect to the eligible partner's purchase of replacement QSB stock must recognize its distributive share of gain from the sale of QSB stock by the selling partnership only to the extent of the greater of—
(A) The amount of the eligible partner's distributive share of the selling partnership's gain from the sale of the QSB stock that is treated as ordinary income; or
(B) The excess of the eligible partner's share of the selling partnership's amount realized (as determined under paragraph (c)(2) of this section) on the sale by the selling partnership of the QSB stock (excluding the cost of any replacement QSB stock purchased by the selling partnership) over the cost of any replacement QSB stock purchased by the eligible partner (excluding the cost of any replacement QSB stock that is otherwise taken into account under section 1045).
(iii)
Partnership purchase of replacement QSB stock—(A) Partner of a selling partnership.
Subject to paragraph (d) of this section, an eligible partner that treats its interest in QSB stock purchased by a purchasing partnership as a purchase of replacement QSB stock by the eligible partner and that elects to apply section 1045 with respect to such purchase must recognize its total gain (the eligible partner's distributive share of gain from the selling partnership's sale of QSB stock and any gain taken into account under paragraph (c)(5) of this section from the sale of replacement QSB stock) only to the extent of the greater of—
(
1
) The amount of the eligible partner's distributive share of the selling partnership's gain from the sale of the QSB stock that is treated as ordinary income; or
(
2
) The excess of the eligible partner's share of the selling partnership's amount realized (as determined under paragraph (c)(2) of this section) on the sale by the selling partnership of the QSB stock (excluding the cost of any replacement QSB stock purchased by the selling partnership) over the eligible partner's share of the purchasing partnership's cost of the replacement QSB stock, as determined under paragraph (c)(3) of this section (excluding the cost of any QSB stock that is otherwise taken into account under section 1045).
(B)
Taxpayer other than a C corporation.
Subject to paragraph (d) of this section, a taxpayer other than a C corporation that treats its interest in QSB stock purchased by a purchasing partnership with respect to which the taxpayer is a partner as a purchase of replacement QSB stock by the taxpayer must recognize its gain from the sale of the QSB stock only to the extent of the greater of—
(
1
) The amount of gain from the sale of the QSB stock that is treated as ordinary income; or
(
2
) The excess of the amount realized by the taxpayer on the sale of the QSB stock over the partner's share of the purchasing partnership's cost of the replacement QSB stock, as determined under paragraph (c)(3) of this section (excluding the cost of any QSB stock that is otherwise taken into account under section 1045).
(2)
Eligible partner's share of amount realized by partnership
—(i)
General rule.
The eligible partner's share of the amount realized by the selling partnership is the amount realized by the partnership on the sale of the QSB stock (excluding the cost of any replacement QSB stock otherwise taken into account under section 1045) multiplied by the following fraction—
(A) The numerator of which is the eligible partner's distributive share of the partnership's realized gain from the sale of the QSB stock; and
(B) The denominator of which is the partnership's realized gain on the sale of the QSB stock.
(ii)
General rule modified for determining eligible partner's share of amount realized by purchasing partnership upon a sale of replacement QSB stock in certain situations
—(A)
No gain realized or loss realized on sale of replacement QSB stock.
If a purchasing partnership does not realize a gain or realizes a loss from the sale of replacement QSB stock for which an election under this section was made for purposes of applying paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(A) of this section,
the eligible partner's share of the amount realized is—
(
1
) The greater of—
(
i
) The amount determined in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section from a prior sale of QSB stock (that is not otherwise taken into account under paragraph (c)(2) of this section) in which the eligible partner had a distributive share of gain allocated to the eligible partner that was not recognized under paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(A) of this section; or
(
ii
) The amount realized by a taxpayer other than a C corporation from a prior sale of QSB stock (that is not otherwise taken into account under paragraph (c)(2) of this section) in which the taxpayer realized gain that was not recognized under paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(B) of this section; less
(
2
) The eligible partner's distributive share of any loss recognized on the sale of replacement QSB stock, if applicable.
(B)
Eligible partner's interest in purchasing partnership is reduced and gain realized on sale of replacement QSB stock.
If an eligible partner's interest in a purchasing partnership is reduced subsequent to the sale of QSB stock and the purchasing partnership realizes a gain from the sale of the replacement QSB stock, the eligible partner's share of the amount realized upon a sale of replacement QSB stock must be determined under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section based on the distributive share of the partnership's realized gain that would have been allocated to the eligible partner if the eligible partner's interest in the partnership had not been reduced.
(iii)
Eligible partner's share of the amount realized.
For purposes of determining the eligible partner's share of the amount realized by the partnership, the partnership's realized gain from the sale of QSB stock and the eligible partner's distributive share of that gain are determined without regard to basis adjustments under section 743(b) and paragraphs (b)(3)(ii) and (c) of this section.
(3)
Partner's share of the cost of QSB stock purchased by a purchasing partnership.
The partner's share of the cost (adjusted basis) of replacement QSB stock purchased by a purchasing partnership is the percentage of the partnership's future income and gain, if any, that is reasonably expected to be allocated to the partner (determined without regard to any adjustment under section 1045) with respect to the replacement QSB stock that was purchased by the partnership, multiplied by the cost of that replacement QSB stock. The assumptions made by a partnership in determining the reasonably expected allocation of income and gain must be consistent for each partner. For example, a partnership may not treat the same item of income or gain as being reasonably expected to be allocated to more than one partner.
(4)
Basis adjustments
—(i)
Eligible partner's interest in selling partnership.
Under section 705(a)(1), the adjusted basis of an eligible partner's interest in a selling partnership that sells QSB stock is increased by the partner's distributive share of gain without regard to paragraph (c)(1) of this section. However, if the selling partnership is also a purchasing partnership, the adjusted basis of an eligible partner's interest in a partnership that sells QSB stock may be reduced under paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section.
(ii)
Replacement QSB stock.
A partner's basis in any replacement QSB stock that is purchased by the partner, as well as the adjusted basis of any replacement QSB stock that is purchased by a purchasing partnership and that is treated as the partner's replacement QSB stock must be reduced (in the order replacement QSB stock is acquired by the partner and purchasing partnership, as applicable) by the partner's distributive share of the gain on the sale of the selling partnership's QSB stock that is not recognized by the partner under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, or by the gain on a sale of QSB stock by the partner that is not recognized by the partner under section 1045, as applicable. If replacement QSB stock is purchased by the purchasing partnership, the purchasing partnership shall maintain its adjusted basis in the replacement QSB stock without regard to any basis adjustments required by this paragraph (c)(4)(ii). The eligible partner, however, shall in computing its distributive
share of income, gain, loss and deduction from the purchasing partnership with respect to the replacement QSB stock take into account the variation between the adjusted basis in the QSB stock as determined under this paragraph (c)(4)(ii) and the adjusted basis determined without regard to this paragraph (c)(4)(ii). A partner must retain records setting forth the computation of this basis adjustment, the replacement QSB stock to which the adjustment has been made, and the date(s) on which such stock was acquired. See
Examples 7
and
8
of paragraph (i) of this section.
(iii)
Partner's basis in purchasing partnership interest.
A partner that treats the partner's interest in QSB stock purchased by a purchasing partnership as the partner's replacement QSB stock must reduce (in the order replacement QSB stock is acquired) the adjusted basis of the partner's interest in the purchasing partnership by the partner's distributive share of the gain on the sale of the selling partnership's QSB stock that is not recognized by the partner pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section, or by the gain on a sale of QSB stock by the partner that is not recognized by the partner under section 1045, as applicable. Similarly, a partner of an upper-tier partnership that treats the partner's interest in QSB stock purchased by a lower-tier purchasing partnership as the partner's replacement QSB stock must reduce (in the order replacement QSB stock is acquired) the adjusted basis of the partner's interest in the upper-tier partnership by the partner's distributive share of the gain on the sale of the selling partnership's QSB stock that is not recognized by the partner pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section, or by the gain on a sale of QSB stock by the partner that is not recognized by the partner under section 1045, as applicable.
(iv)
Increase in basis on sale of QSB stock by purchasing partnership.
A partner that recognizes gain under paragraph (c)(5) of this section must increase the adjusted basis of the partner's interest in the purchasing partnership under section 705(a)(1) by the amount of the gain recognized by that partner. Similarly, a partner in an upper-tier partnership that recognizes gain under paragraph (c)(5) of this section must increase the adjusted basis of the partner's interest in the upper-tier partnership under section 705(a)(1) by the amount of the gain recognized by that partner.
(5)
Partner recognition of gain.
At the time that either the partner or the purchasing partnership (whichever applies) sells or exchanges replacement QSB stock, the amount recognized by the partner is determined by taking into account the basis adjustments described in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section. Similarly, a partner of an upper-tier partnership that owns an interest in a lower-tier partnership that holds replacement QSB stock must take into account the basis adjustments described in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section in determining the amount recognized by the partner on a sale of the interest in the lower-tier partnership by the upper-tier partnership or the partner's distributive share of gain from the upper-tier partnership. See paragraph (e)(4) of this section for rules applicable to certain distributions of replacement QSB stock.
(d)
Nonrecognition limitation
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of this section, the amount of gain that an eligible partner does not recognize under paragraphs (b)(1) and (c)(1) of this section cannot exceed the nonrecognition limitation. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the nonrecognition limitation is equal to the product of—
(i) The partnership's realized gain from the sale of the QSB stock, determined without regard to any basis adjustment under section 734(b) or section 743(b) (other than basis adjustments described in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section); and
(ii) The eligible partner's smallest percentage interest in partnership capital as determined in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. See
Example 9
of paragraph (i) of this section.
(2)
Eligible partner's smallest percentage interest in partnership capital.
An eligible partner's smallest percentage interest in partnership capital is the eligible partner's percentage share of capital determined at the time of the acquisition of the QSB stock as adjusted
prior to the time the QSB stock is sold to reflect any reduction in the capital of the eligible partner including a reduction as a result of a disproportionate capital contribution by other partners, a disproportionate capital distribution to the eligible partner or the transfer of an interest by the eligible partner, but excluding income and loss allocations.
(3)
Special rule for tiered partnerships.
For purposes of paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, if an eligible partner is treated as owning an interest in a lower-tier purchasing partnership through an upper-tier partnership, the eligible partner's percentage interest in the purchasing partnership shall be proportionately adjusted to reflect the eligible partner's percentage interest in the upper-tier partnership.
(e)
Partnership distribution of QSB stock to a partner
—(1)
In general.
Subject to paragraphs (e)(2) and (3) of this section, in the case of a partnership distribution of QSB stock to a partner, the partner shall be treated for purposes of this section as—
(i) Having acquired such stock in the same manner as the partnership; and
(ii) Having held such stock during any continuous period immediately preceding the distribution during which it was held by the partnership. See
Examples 10
and
11
of paragraph (i) of this section.
(2)
Eligibility under section 1202(c).
Paragraph (e)(1) of this section does not apply unless all eligibility requirements with respect to QSB stock as defined in section 1202(c) are met by the distributing partnership with respect to its investment in QSB stock.
(3)
Distribution nonrecognition limitation
—(i)
Generally.
The amount of gain that an eligible partner does not recognize under this section on the sale of QSB stock that was distributed by the partnership to the partner cannot exceed the distribution nonrecognition limitation. For this purpose, the distribution nonrecognition limitation is—
(A) The partner's section 1045 amount realized (determined under paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section); reduced by
(B) The partner's section 1045 adjusted basis (determined under paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section).
(ii)
Section 1045 amount realized
—(A)
QSB stock received in liquidation of partner's interest and in certain nonliquidating distributions.
If a partner receives QSB stock from the partnership in a distribution in liquidation of the partner's interest in the partnership or as part of a series of related distributions by the partnership in which the partnership distributes all of the partnership's QSB stock of a particular type, then the partner's section 1045 amount realized is the partner's amount realized from the sale of the distributed QSB stock, multiplied by a fraction—
(
1
) The numerator of which is the partner's smallest percentage interest in partnership capital determined under paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(B) of this section; and
(
2
) The denominator of which is the partner's percentage interest in that type of QSB stock immediately after the distribution (determined under paragraph (e)(3)(iv) of this section).
(B)
Partner's smallest percentage interest in partnership capital.
A partner's smallest percentage interest in partnership capital is the partner's percentage share of capital determined at the time of the acquisition of the QSB stock as adjusted prior to the time the QSB stock is distributed to the partner to reflect any reduction in the capital of the partner including a reduction as a result of a disproportionate capital contribution by other partners, a disproportionate capital distribution to the partner, or the transfer of a capital interest by the partner, but excluding income and loss allocations.
(C)
QSB stock received in other distributions.
If a partner receives QSB stock in a distribution from the partnership that is not described in paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, the partner's section 1045 amount realized is the partner's amount realized from the sale of the distributed QSB stock multiplied by the partner's smallest percentage interest in partnership capital determined under paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(B) of this section.
(iii)
Section 1045 adjusted basis
—(A)
QSB stock received in liquidation of partner's interest and in certain nonliquidating distributions.
If a partner receives QSB stock from the partnership
in a distribution in liquidation of the partner's interest in the partnership or as part of a series of related distributions by the partnership in which the partnership distributes all of the partnership's QSB stock of a particular type, then the partner's section 1045 adjusted basis is the product of—
(
1
) The partnership's basis in all of the QSB stock of the type distributed (without regard to basis adjustments under section 734(b) or section 743(b), other than basis adjustments described in paragraphs (b)(3)(ii) and (c)(4)(ii) of this section);
(
2
) The partner's smallest percentage interest in partnership capital determined under paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(B) of this section; and
(
3
) The proportion of the distributed QSB stock that was sold by the partner.
(B)
QSB stock received in other distributions.
If a partner receives QSB stock in a distribution from the partnership that is not described in paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, the partner's section 1045 adjusted basis is the product of—
(
1
) The partnership's basis in the QSB stock sold by the partner (without regard to basis adjustments under section 734(b) or section 743(b), other than basis adjustments described in paragraphs (b)(3)(ii) and (c)(4)(ii) of this section); and
(
2
) The partner's smallest percentage interest in partnership capital determined under paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(B) of this section.
(iv)
Partner's percentage interest in distributed QSB stock.
For purposes of this paragraph (e)(3), a partner's percentage interest in a type of QSB stock immediately after a partnership distribution is the value (as of the date of the distribution) of the QSB stock distributed to the partner divided by the value (as of the date of the distribution) of all of that type of QSB stock that was acquired by the partnership.
(v)
QSB stock of the same type.
For purposes of this paragraph (e)(3), QSB stock will be of the same type as the distributed QSB stock if it has the same issuer and the same rights and preferences as the distributed QSB stock and was acquired by the partnership at original issue.
(4)
Distribution of replacement QSB stock to a partner that reduces another partner's interest in the replacement QSB stock.
For purposes of this section, a partner must recognize gain upon a distribution of replacement QSB stock to another partner that reduces the partner's share of the replacement QSB stock held by a partnership. The amount of gain that the partner must recognize is determined based on the amount of gain that the partner would recognize upon a sale of the distributed replacement QSB stock for its fair market value on the date of the distribution but not to exceed the amount that was previously not recognized by the partner under section 1045 with respect to the distributed replacement QSB stock. Any gain recognized by a partner whose interest is reduced must be taken into account in determining the adjusted basis of the partner's interest in the partnership and also taken into account in determining the partnership's adjusted basis in the QSB stock distributed to another partner under paragraph (e)(3) of this section.
(f)
Contribution of QSB stock or replacement QSB stock to a partnership.
Section 721 applies to a contribution of QSB stock to a partnership. Except as provided in section 721(b), any gain that was not recognized by the taxpayer under section 1045 is not recognized when the taxpayer contributes QSB stock to a partnership in exchange for a partnership interest. Stock that is contributed to a partnership is not QSB stock in the hands of the partnership. See
Example 12
of paragraph (i) of this section.
(g)
Definitions.
For purposes of section 1045 and this section, the following terms are defined as follows:
(1)
Qualified small business stock.
The term
qualified small business stock
(QSB stock) has the meaning provided in section 1202(c). The term “QSB stock” does not include an interest in a partnership that purchases or holds QSB stock. See
Example 1
of paragraph (i) of this section.
(2)
Replacement QSB stock.
The term
replacement QSB stock
is any QSB stock purchased within 60 days beginning on the date of a sale of QSB stock.
(3)
Eligible partner
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraphs (e)(1),
(g)(3)(ii), (iii) and (iv) of this section, an eligible partner with respect to QSB stock is a taxpayer other than a C corporation that holds an interest in a partnership on the date the partnership acquires the QSB stock and at all times thereafter for more than 6 months until the partnership sells or distributes the QSB stock.
(ii)
Acquisition by gift or at death.
For purposes of paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section, a taxpayer who acquires from a partner (other than a C corporation) by gift or at death an interest in a partnership that holds QSB stock is treated as having held the acquired interest in the partnership during the period the partner (other than a C corporation) held the interest in the partnership.
(iii)
Tiered partnership.
For purposes of paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section, if a partnership (upper-tier partnership) holds an interest in another partnership (lower-tier partnership) that holds QSB stock, then the upper-tier partnership's ownership of the lower-tier partnership is disregarded and each partner of the upper-tier partnership is treated as owning the interest in the lower-tier partnership directly. The partner of the upper-tier partnership is treated as owning the interest in the lower-tier partnership during the period in which both—
(A) The partner of the upper-tier partnership held an interest in the upper-tier partnership; and
(B) The upper-tier partnership held an interest in the lower-tier partnership. See
Examples 3
and
4
of paragraph (i) of this section.
(iv)
Multiple tiers of partnerships.
Principles similar to those described in paragraph (g)(3)(iii) of this section apply where a taxpayer holds an interest in a lower-tier partnership through multiple tiers of partnerships.
(4)
Month(s).
For purposes of this section, the term
month(s)
means a period commencing on the same numerical day of any calendar month as the day on which the QSB stock is sold and ending with the close of the day preceding the numerically corresponding day of the succeeding calendar month or, if there is no corresponding day, with the last day of the succeeding calendar month.
(h)
Reporting and election rules
—(1)
Time and manner of making election.
A partnership making an election under section 1045 (as described under paragraph (b)(1) of this section) must do so on the partnership's timely filed (including extensions) Federal income tax return for the taxable year during which the sale of QSB stock occurs. A partner making an election under section 1045 (as described under paragraph (c)(1) of this section) must do so on the partner's timely filed (including extensions) Federal income tax return for the taxable year during which the partner's distributive share of the partnership's gain from the sale of the QSB stock is taken into account by such partner under section 706. In addition, a partnership or partner making an election under section 1045 must make such election in accordance with the applicable forms and instructions.
(2)
Purchases, distributions, and sales of QSB stock or replacement QSB stock by partnerships.
A partnership that purchases, distributes to a partner, or sells or exchanges QSB stock or replacement QSB stock must provide information to the Commissioner and to the partnership's partners to the extent provided by the applicable forms and instructions.
(3)
Nonrecognition of gain by eligible partners.
An eligible partner that does not recognize gain under section 1045 must provide information to the Commissioner to the extent provided by the applicable forms and instructions.
(i)
Examples.
The provisions of this section are illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1. Sale of a partnership interest.
On January 1, 2008, A, an individual, X, a C corporation, and Y, a C corporation, form PRS, a partnership. A, X, and Y each contribute $250 to PRS and agree to share all partnership items equally. PRS purchases QSB stock for $750 on February 1, 2008. On November 4, 2008, A sells A's interest in PRS for $500, realizing $250 of capital gain. Under paragraph (g)(1) of this section, an interest in a partnership that holds QSB stock is not treated as QSB stock. Therefore, the sale of an interest in a partnership that holds QSB stock is not treated as a sale of QSB stock, and A may not elect to apply section 1045 with respect to A's $250 gain from the sale of A's interest in PRS.

# Example 2. Election by partner; replacement by partnership.
(i) Assume the same facts as
in
Example 1
, except that A does not sell A's interest in PRS. Instead, PRS sells the QSB stock (QSB1 stock) for $1,500 on November 3, 2008. PRS realizes $750 of gain from the sale of the QSB1 stock (none of which is treated as ordinary income) and allocates $250 of gain to each of A, X, and Y. PRS does not make a section 1045 election. On November 30, 2008, A contributes $500 to ABC, a partnership, in exchange for a 10 percent interest in ABC. ABC then purchases QSB stock (QSB2 stock) for $5,000 on December 1, 2008. ABC has no other assets. A makes an election under paragraph (c)(1) of this section and treats A's percentage interest in ABC's QSB2 stock as replacement QSB stock under paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section with respect to the $250 gain PRS allocated to A. Under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, A's share of the cost of QSB2 stock purchased by ABC is $500 (A's reasonably expected income and gain with respect to QSB2 stock, or 10 percent multiplied by the cost of the QSB2 stock, $5,000). Under paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section, A will not recognize the $250 gain PRS allocated to A, because A's share of the amount realized by PRS, $500 (the total amount realized by the partnership on the sale of the QSB1 stock ($1,500) multiplied by A's share of the gain from the sale of the QSB1 stock ($250) over the total gain realized by the partnership on the sale of the QSB1 stock ($750)), does not exceed A's share of ABC's cost of the QSB2 stock acquired by ABC, $500. Under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, A must reduce A's share of ABC's basis in the QSB2 stock by $250. Under paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section, A must reduce A's basis in A's interest in ABC by $250. Under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, A's basis in A's interest in PRS is increased by $250.
(ii) Assume the same facts as in paragraph (i) of this
Example 2
, except that A does not contribute $500 to ABC in exchange for a partnership interest. Instead, on November 30, 2008, EFG, a partnership in which A has an existing 10 percent partnership interest, purchases QSB stock for $5,000. Under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, A may treat A's 10 percent interest in EFG's QSB stock as replacement QSB stock with respect to the $250 of gain PRS allocated to A.
(iii) Assume the same facts as in paragraph (i) of this
Example 2
, except that ABC owns QSB stock that ABC purchased on November 10, 2008, and ABC does not purchase QSB stock on December 1, 2008. Under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, ABC is not a purchasing partnership with respect to A for the QSB stock ABC purchased on November 10, 2008. A may not treat A's percentage interest in ABC's QSB stock as replacement QSB stock to defer the $250 gain PRS allocated to A, because A acquired its interest in ABC after ABC acquired the QSB stock.
(iv) Assume the same facts as in paragraph (i) of this
Example 2
, except that ABC sells QSB2 stock on July 30, 2009, for $5,000. ABC realizes no gain or loss on the sale of QSB2 stock. A desires to continue to rollover the $250 gain from the sale of QSB1 stock. Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, A's share of the amount realized is $500, which was A's share of the amount realized on the prior sale of QSB1 stock. Accordingly, A must elect to apply section 1045 and purchase $500 of replacement QSB stock either directly or through a purchasing partnership to continue to defer the $250 gain from the sale of QSB1 stock.

# Example 3. Tiered partnerships; partnership election.
(i) On January 1, 2008, A, an individual, and B, an individual, each contribute $500 to UTP (upper-tier partnership) for equal partnership interests. On February 1, 2008, UTP and C, an individual, each contribute $1,000 to LTP (lower-tier partnership) for equal partnership interests. On March 1, 2008, LTP purchases QSB stock for $500. On April 1, 2008, D, an individual, joins UTP by contributing $500 to UTP for a
1/3
interest in UTP. On December 1, 2008, LTP sells the QSB stock for $2,000. Under paragraph (g)(3)(iii) of this section, A, B, and D are treated as owning an interest in LTP during the period in which each of the partners held an interest in UTP and UTP held an interest in LTP. Therefore, under paragraphs (g)(3)(i) and (iii) of this section, A and B are eligible partners, and D and UTP are not eligible partners with respect to the QSB stock sold by LTP. Under paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section, C is also an eligible partner with respect to the QSB stock sold by LTP.
(ii) Assume the same facts as in paragraph (i) of this
Example 3.
LTP realizes a gain of $1,500 on the December 1, 2008, sale of QSB stock. LTP allocates $750 of gain to each of UTP and C. UTP, in turn, allocates $250 (of the $750 of gain allocated to UTP) to each of A, B, and D. LTP makes a section 1045 election. On January 1, 2009, LTP purchases replacement QSB stock for $2,000. Under paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section, D notifies UTP that it recognizes $250 of gain and UTP notifies LTP. Because A, B, and C are eligible partners with respect to the QSB stock sold by LTP, A and B may each defer $250 of LTP's section 1045 gain and C may defer $750 of LTP's section 1045 gain. LTP must decrease its basis in the replacement QSB stock by the $750 of partnership section 1045 gain that was allocated to C and by $500 of the partnership section 1045 gain that was allocated to UTP. These basis reductions are with respect to UTP (A and B) and C only. Under paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, the basis of UTP's interest in LTP attributable to the LTP's replacement QSB stock must be segregated and allocated to A and B.
In addition, A and B each have a $250 negative basis adjustment in their respective interests in UTP. If UTP sells its interest in LTP for $1,250, A and B would each recognize $250 of gain from the sale of the LTP interest. D would not recognize any gain or loss from the sale.

# Example 4. Tiered partnerships; partner election.
(i) On January 1, 2008, A, an individual, and X, a C corporation, form UTP, a partnership. A and X each contribute $250 to UTP and agree to share all partnership items equally. Also, on January 1, 2008, UTP and Y, a C corporation, form LTP, a partnership. UTP and Y contribute $500 and $250, respectively, to LTP. UTP and Y agree to share all partnership items equally. LTP purchases QSB stock for $750 on February 1, 2008. On November 3, 2008, LTP sells the QSB stock for $1,500. LTP realizes $750 of gain from the sale of the QSB stock (none of which is treated as ordinary income) and allocates $250 gain to Y and $500 gain to UTP. Of the $500 gain allocated to UTP from the sale of QSB stock, $250 is allocated to A and $250 is allocated to X. LTP purchases replacement QSB stock (replacement QSB1 stock) for $1,350 on December 15, 2008. LTP does not make an election under section 1045. Under the rules provided in paragraph (c) of this section, A makes an election under section 1045 on its timely filed return for the taxable year for which the distributive share of gain from the sale of QSB stock is taken into account by A under section 706. Under paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section, A treats A's interest in replacement QSB1 stock as replacement stock with respect to A's distributive share of LTP's section 1045 gain. On March 30, 2009, LTP sells replacement QSB1 stock for $1,650. LTP realizes $300 of gain from the sale of replacement QSB1 stock (none of which is treated as ordinary income) and allocates $100 to Y and $200 to UTP.
(ii) Under paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section, A must recognize its distributive share of gain from LTP's sale of QSB stock ($250) only to the extent of the greater of A's distributive share of LTP's gain from the sale of QSB stock that is treated as ordinary income ($0) or the amount by which A's share of the amount realized by LTP's sale of QSB stock exceeds A's share of LTP's cost of the replacement QSB1 stock, $50 (
1/3
of $1,500, or $500, minus
1/3
of $1,350, or $450). Because Y is not an eligible partner of LTP under paragraph (g)(3) of this section, Y must recognize its $250 distributive share of partnership gain from the sale of the QSB stock. Also, X is not an eligible partner under paragraph (g)(3) of this section, and it must recognize its $250 distributive share of gain from UTP attributable to UTP's distributive share of $500 of LTP's gain from the sale of QSB stock.
(iii) Under section 705(a)(1), the adjusted basis of Y's interest in LTP is increased by $250, and the adjusted basis of UTP's interest in LTP is increased by $500. Under section 705(a)(1), the adjusted basis of X's interest in UTP is increased by $250, and the adjusted basis of A's interest in UTP is increased by $250. However, under paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section, the adjusted basis of A's interest in UTP is reduced by the $200 of partnership section 1045 gain that was not recognized by A.
(iv) Under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, the LTP's adjusted basis in replacement QSB1 stock is reduced by the $200 of gain from the sale of QSB stock that is not recognized by A, as a result of A's election under section 1045. A must retain records setting forth the computation of this basis adjustment, the replacement QSB stock to which the adjustment is made, and dates the stock was acquired. LTP's adjusted basis in the replacement QSB1 stock is maintained without regard to the eligible partner's adjustment provided in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section.
(v) On the sale of replacement QSB1 stock, LTP realizes a gain of $300, $100 of which is allocated to Y and $200 of which is allocated to UTP. UTP allocates $100 of this gain to A. Under paragraph (c)(5) of this section, in determining A's amount recognized upon the sale of replacement QSB1 stock by LTP, A must take into account A's basis adjustment of $200. Accordingly, A recognizes a total gain of $300 upon the sale of replacement QSB1 stock, absent an additional section 1045 election by A or LTP. Under paragraph (c)(4)(iv) of this section, the adjusted basis of A's interest in UTP is increased by $300 under section 705(a)(1).
(vi) Assume the same facts as in paragraph (i) of this
Example 4
, except that UTP sells its entire interest in LTP on March 30, 2009, for $1,200. UTP realizes a gain of $200 on the sale of its interest in LTP ($1,200 amount realized less $1,000 adjusted basis) and allocates $100 of this gain to A. Under paragraph (c)(5) of this section, in determining A's amount recognized upon the sale of UTP's interest in LTP, A must take into account A's basis adjustment of $200. Accordingly, A recognizes a total gain of $300 upon the sale of the interest in LTP. Under paragraph (c)(4)(iv) of this section, the adjusted basis in A's interest in UTP is increased by $300 under section 705(a)(1).

# Example 5. Partnership sale of QSB stock and purchase and sale of replacement QSB stock.
(i) On January 1, 2008, A, an individual, X, a C corporation, and Y, a C corporation, form PRS, a partnership. A, X, and Y each contribute $250 to PRS and agree to share all partnership items equally. PRS purchases QSB stock for $750 on February 1, 2008. On November 3, 2008, PRS sells the QSB stock for $1,500. PRS realizes $750 of gain from the sale of the QSB stock (none of which is treated as ordinary income) and allocates $250 of gain to each of A, X, and Y. PRS purchases
replacement QSB stock (replacement QSB1 stock) for $1,350 on December 15, 2008. On its timely filed return for the taxable year during which the sale of the QSB stock occurs, PRS makes an election to apply section 1045. A does not make an election to apply section 1045 with respect to the November 3, 2008, sale of QSB stock. PRS knows that X and Y are C corporations. On March 30, 2009, PRS sells replacement QSB1 stock for $1,650. PRS realizes $300 of gain from the sale of replacement QSB1 stock (none of which is treated as ordinary income) and allocates $100 of gain to each of A, X, and Y. A does not make an election to apply section 1045 with respect to the March 30, 2009, sale of replacement QSB1 stock.
(ii) Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the partnership section 1045 gain from the November 3, 2008, sale of QSB stock is $600 ($750 gain less $150 ($1,500 amount realized on the sale of QSB stock less $1,350 cost of replacement QSB1 stock)). This amount must be allocated among the partners in the same proportions as the entire gain from the sale of QSB stock is allocated to the partners,
1/3
($200) to A,
1/3
($200) to X, and
1/3
($200) to Y.
(iii) Because neither X nor Y is an eligible partner under paragraph (g)(3) of this section, X and Y must each recognize its $250 distributive share of partnership gain from the sale of QSB stock. Because A is an eligible partner under paragraph (g)(3) of this section, A may defer recognition of A's $200 distributive share of partnership section 1045 gain. A is not required to separately elect to apply section 1045. A must recognize A's remaining $50 distributive share of the partnership's gain from the sale of QSB stock.
(iv) Under section 705(a)(1), the adjusted bases of X's and Y's interests in PRS are each increased by $250. Under section 705(a)(1) and paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, the adjusted basis of A's interest in PRS is not increased by the $200 of partnership section 1045 gain that was not recognized by A, but is increased by A's remaining $50 distributive share of gain.
(v) PRS must decrease its basis in the replacement QSB1 stock by the $200 of partnership section 1045 gain that was allocated to A. This basis reduction is a reduction with respect to A only. PRS then adjusts A's distributive share of gain from the sale of replacement QSB1 stock to reflect the effect of A's basis adjustment under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section. In accordance with the principles of § 1.743-1(j)(3), the amount of A's gain from the March 30, 2009, sale of replacement QSB1 stock in which A has a $200 negative basis adjustment equals $300 (A's share of PRS' gain from the sale of replacement QSB1 stock ($100), increased by the amount of A's negative basis adjustment for replacement QSB1 stock ($200)). Accordingly, upon the sale of replacement QSB1 stock, A recognizes $300 of gain, and X and Y each recognize $100 of gain.
(vi) Assume the same facts as in paragraph (i) of this
Example 5
, except that PRS purchases replacement QSB stock (replacement QSB2 stock) on April 15, 2009, for $1,150 and PRS makes an election to apply section 1045 with respect to the March 30, 2009, sale of replacement QSB1 stock. Under paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, PRS' $200 basis adjustment in QSB1 stock relating to the November 3, 2008, sale of QSB stock carries over to the basis adjustment for QSB2 stock. This basis adjustment is an adjustment with respect to A only. The $200 basis adjustment is reduced by A's distributive share of the excess of $500 (the greater of the amount determined under paragraph (b)(1)(i), $0, or (ii) of this section, $500 ($1,650 amount realized on the sale of QSB1 stock less $1,150 cost of replacement QSB2 stock)) over $300 (PRS' gain from the sale of QSB1 stock), or $67 ($200 ($500 minus $300) divided by 3). Under paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A), A must account for the $67 excess amount that reduces PRS' basis adjustment in QSB2 stock as gain in accordance with § 1.743-1(j)(3). Therefore, A now has a $133 negative basis adjustment with respect to replacement QSB2 stock (($200) negative basis adjustment from the November 3, 2008, sale of QSB stock plus $67 positive basis adjustment from the March 30, 2009, sale of QSB1 stock). A also recognizes the $100 of gain allocated by PRS to A from the March 30, 2009, sale of replacement QSB1 stock for total gain recognition of $167 ($100 plus $67).

# Example 6. Partnership sale of QSB stock; election by eligible partner; replacement QSB stock purchased by purchasing partnership.
(i) Assume the same facts as in
Example 5
except that PRS does not make an election under section 1045 with respect to the sale of either the QSB stock on November 3, 2008, or the QSB1 stock on March 30, 2009. However, A makes an election under section 1045 with respect to the sale of QSB stock and treats the purchase of QSB1 stock on December 15, 2008, by PRS, as the purchase of replacement QSB stock. Additionally, A makes an election under section 1045 with respect to the sale of QSB1 stock and treats the purchase of QSB2 stock on April 15, 2009, by PRS, as the purchase of replacement QSB stock.
(ii) A's distributive share of gain from the November 3, 2008, sale of QSB stock is $250 (A's
1/3
interest in $750 of total PRS gain). Under paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section, A must recognize only $50 of A's distributive share of PRS' gain of $250, that is the excess of A's share of the amount realized on the sale of QSB stock, or $500 (the total amount realized by PRS on the sale of QSB stock ($1,500) multiplied by A's share of the gain from the sale of QSB stock ($250) over the total gain realized by PRS on the sale of QSB stock ($750)), minus A's share of PRS' cost of QSB1 stock, or $450 (
1/3
of $1,350).
Under section 705(a)(1) and paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, A's adjusted basis in its interest in PRS is increased by $250. However, under paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section, because PRS is a purchasing partnership, A's adjusted basis of its interest in PRS is then reduced by the deferred gain of $200. Also under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, PRS' adjusted basis in QSB1 stock is reduced by the gain not recognized of $200 and A must take into account such adjusted basis in computing A's income, gain, loss or deduction with respect to QSB1 stock. A must retain records setting forth the computation of this basis adjustment, the replacement QSB stock to which the adjustment is made, and dates the stock was acquired.
(iii) A's distributive share of gain from the March 30, 2009, sale of QSB1 stock is $100 (A's
1/3
interest in $300 of total PRS gain) and under paragraph (c)(5) of this section, A must take into account A's $200 basis adjustment with respect to the QSB1 stock that was sold. Accordingly, A's total gain from the sale of QSB1 stock is $300. Under paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section, A must recognize only $167 of A's total gain of $300, that is, the excess of A's share of the amount realized on the sale of QSB1 stock, or $550 (the total amount realized by PRS on the sale of QSB1 stock ($1,650) multiplied by A's share of the gain from the sale of QSB1 stock ($100) over the total gain realized by PRS on the sale of QSB1 stock ($300)) minus A's share of PRS' cost of QSB2 stock, or $383 (
1/3
of $1,150). Under section 705(a)(1), A's adjusted basis in A's interest in PRS is increased by A's $100 distributive share of gain from the sale of QSB1 stock. Under paragraph (c)(4)(iv) of this section, A's adjusted basis of A's interest in PRS is increased by the additional $67 of gain recognized under paragraph (c)(5) of this section. Also, under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, PRS' adjusted basis in QSB2 stock is reduced by the gain not recognized of $133 ($300 minus $167) and A must take into account such adjusted basis in computing A's income, gain, loss or deduction with respect to QSB2 stock. A must retain records setting forth the computation of this basis adjustment, the replacement QSB stock to which the adjustment is made, and dates the stock was acquired.

# Example 7. Partnership sale of QSB stock and partner purchase of replacement QSB stock.
(i) Assume the same facts as in paragraph (i) of
Example 5
, except that PRS does not make an election under section 1045 with respect to the sale of the QSB stock and does not purchase replacement QSB stock. On November 30, 2008, A, an eligible partner under paragraph (g)(3) of this section, purchases replacement QSB stock for $500. A elects pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section to apply section 1045 on A's timely filed return for the taxable year that A is required to include A's distributive share of PRS' gain from the sale of the QSB stock.
(ii) Under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, A's share of the amount realized from PRS' sale of the QSB stock is $500 (the total amount realized by the partnership on the sale of the QSB stock ($1,500) multiplied by A's share of the gain from the sale of the QSB stock ($250) over the total gain realized by the partnership on the sale of the QSB stock ($750)). Because A purchased, within 60 days of PRS' sale of the QSB stock, replacement QSB stock for a cost equal to A's share of the partnership's amount realized on the sale of the QSB stock, and because A made an election pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section to apply section 1045, A defers recognition of A's $250 distributive share of gain from PRS' sale of the QSB stock. Under section 705(a)(1) and paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, the adjusted basis of A's interest in PRS is increased by $250. Under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, A's adjusted basis in the replacement QSB stock is $250 ($500 cost minus $250 nonrecognition amount).

# Example 8. Partial replacement by partnership; partial replacement by partner.
(i) On January 1, 2008, A, an individual, and X, a C corporation, form PRS, a partnership. A and X each contribute $500 to PRS and agree to share all partnership items equally. PRS purchases QSB stock on February 1, 2008, for $1,000 and subsequently sells the QSB stock on January 31, 2010, for $3,000. PRS realizes $2,000 of gain from the sale of the QSB stock (none of which is treated as ordinary income) and allocates $1,000 of gain to each of A and X. On February 10, 2010, PRS purchases replacement QSB stock for $2,200. On March 20, 2010, A purchases replacement QSB stock for $400. PRS makes an election to apply section 1045 under paragraph (b)(1) of this section with respect to the partnership section 1045 gain from the sale of QSB stock and A does not opt out of PRS' section 1045 election under paragraph (b)(4) of this section. Also, A makes an election under paragraph (c)(1) of this section with respect to the remaining gain from the sale of the QSB stock.
(ii) Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, partnership section 1045 gain is $1,200 ($2,000 less $800 ($3,000 amount realized on the sale of the QSB stock minus $2,200 cost of the replacement QSB stock)). This amount is allocated among the partners in the same proportions as the entire gain from the sale of the QSB stock is allocated to the partners,
1/2
to A ($600), and
1/2
to X ($600). Because A is an eligible partner, A defers recognition of A's $600 distributive share of partnership section 1045 gain.
(iii) A also made an election under section 1045 and purchased, within 60 days of PRS' sale of the QSB stock, replacement QSB stock for $400. Therefore, under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, A may defer a portion of A's distributive share of the remaining
gain from the partnership's sale of the QSB stock. A must recognize that remaining gain to the extent that A's share of the amount realized by PRS on the sale of the QSB stock (excluding the cost of the QSB stock that was replaced by PRS) exceeds the cost of the replacement QSB stock purchased by A during the 60-day period following the sale of the QSB stock. The amount realized by PRS on the sale of the QSB stock (excluding the cost of the QSB stock that was replaced by PRS) is $800 ($3,000 minus $2,200). Under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, A's share of that amount realized is $400 ($1,000 (A's share of the realized gain from the sale of the QSB stock) ÷ $2,000 (PRS total realized gain from the sale of the QSB stock) multiplied by $800). Because the replacement QSB stock purchased by A cost $400, A defers recognition of all of the remaining gain from the sale of the QSB stock.
(iv) The adjusted basis of A's interest in PRS is not increased by the $600 gain that was not recognized pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, but is increased by the $400 gain that was not recognized pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section. See paragraphs (b)(3)(i) and (c)(4)(i) of this section. PRS must decrease its basis in the replacement QSB stock by the $600 of partnership section 1045 gain that was allocated to A. See paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section. A must decrease A's basis in the replacement QSB stock purchased by A by the $400 not recognized pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section. See paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section.

# Example 9. Change in partner's interest in partnership while partnership holds QSB stock.
(i) On January 1, 2008, A, an individual, and X, a C corporation, form PRS, a partnership. A and X each contribute $500 to PRS and agree to share all partnership items equally. PRS purchases QSB stock on February 1, 2008, for $1,000. On August 2, 2008, A sells a 25 percent interest in PRS to Z. On July 10, 2009, A repurchases the 25 percent interest from Z for $500. PRS makes a timely election under section 754 for the 2008 taxable year. Under section 743(b), A has a positive basis adjustment of $250. On January 31, 2011, PRS sells the QSB stock for $3,000. PRS realizes $2,000 of gain from the sale of the QSB stock (none of which is treated as ordinary income) and allocates $1,000 of gain to each of A and X. On February 10, 2010, PRS purchases replacement QSB stock for $3,000. PRS makes an election to apply section 1045 under paragraph (b)(1) of this section with respect to the partnership section 1045 gain from the sale of QSB stock.
(ii) Of the $2,000 of realized gain from the sale of the QSB stock, PRS allocates $1,000 to A and $1,000 to X. However, A has a positive basis adjustment of $250 under section 743(b) as a result of the purchase of the 25 percent interest in PRS from Z; therefore, A's share of the gain is reduced to $750. Because A is an eligible partner under paragraph (g)(3) of this section, A may defer recognition of A's distributive share of gain from the sale of the QSB stock subject to the nonrecognition limitation described in paragraph (d) of this section. The smallest percentage interest that A held in PRS capital during the time that PRS held the QSB stock is 25 percent. Under the nonrecognition limitation, A may not defer more than 25 percent of the partnership gain realized from the sale of the QSB stock (determined without regard to any basis adjustment under section 734(b) or section 743(b), other than a basis adjustment described in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section). Because the partnership's realized gain determined without regard to A's basis adjustment under section 743(b) is $2,000, A may defer recognition of $500 (25 percent of $2,000) of the gain from the sale of the QSB stock. A must recognize the remaining $250 of that gain.

# Example 10. Sale by partner of QSB stock received in a liquidating distribution.
(i) On January 1, 2008, A, an individual, and X, a C corporation, form PRS, a partnership. A and X each contribute $1,500 to PRS and agree to share all partnership items equally. PRS purchases QSB stock on February 1, 2008, for $3,000. On May 1, 2008, when the QSB stock has appreciated in value to $4,000, A contributes $1,000 to PRS, increasing A's interest in PRS capital to 60 percent. On June 1, 2011, when the QSB stock is still worth $4,000, PRS makes a liquidating distribution of $3,000 worth of QSB stock to A. Under section 732, A's basis in the distributed QSB stock is $2,500. A sells the QSB stock on August 4, 2011, for $6,000, realizing a gain of $3,500 (none of which is treated as ordinary income). A purchases replacement QSB stock on August 30, 2011, for $5,500, and makes an election under section 1045 with respect to the August 4, 2011, sale of QSB stock.
(ii) A is an eligible partner under paragraph (g)(3) of this section. Therefore, under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, A is treated as having acquired the distributed QSB stock in the same manner as PRS and as having held the QSB stock since February 1, 2008, its original issue date. Because A purchased, within 60 days of A's sale of the QSB stock, replacement QSB stock, A is eligible to defer a portion of A's gain from the sale of the QSB stock. A must recognize gain, however, to the extent that A's amount realized on the sale of the QSB stock, $6,000, exceeds the cost of the replacement QSB stock purchased by A during the 60-day period beginning on the date of the sale of the QSB stock, $5,500. Accordingly, A must recognize $500 of the gain from the sale of the QSB stock. A defers recognition of the remaining $3,000 of gain to the extent that such gain does not exceed the distribution nonrecognition limitation under paragraph (e)(3) of this section.
(iii) Under paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section, A's nonrecognition limitation with respect to the sale of the QSB stock is A's section 1045 amount realized with respect to the stock, reduced by A's section 1045 adjusted basis with respect to the stock. A's amount realized from the sale is the product of A's amount realized from the sale, $6,000; and a fraction—
(
1
) The numerator of which is A's smallest percentage interest in PRS capital with respect to such stock, 50 percent; and
(
2
) The denominator of which is A's percentage interest in that type of partnership QSB stock immediately after the distribution, 75 percent (the value of the stock distributed to A, $3,000, divided by the value of all QSB stock of that type acquired by PRS, $4,000).
(iv) Therefore, A's section 1045 amount realized is $4,000 ($6,000 multiplied by 50/75). Because PRS distributed the QSB stock to A in liquidation of A's interest in PRS, A's section 1045 adjusted basis is the product of PRS' basis in all of the QSB stock of the type distributed, $3,000; A's smallest percentage interest in PRS capital with respect to QSB stock of the type distributed, 50 percent; and the percentage of the distributed QSB stock that was sold by A, 100 percent. Therefore, A's section 1045 adjusted basis is $1,500 (the product of $3,000, 50 percent, and 100 percent)) and A's nonrecognition limitation amount on the sale of the QSB stock is $2,500 ($4,000 section 1045 amount realized minus $1,500 section 1045 adjusted basis). Accordingly, A defers recognition of $2,500 of the remaining $3,000 gain from the sale of the QSB stock and must recognize $500 of the remaining $3,000 gain. Accordingly, A's total gain recognized from the sale of the QSB stock is $1,000.
(v) A's basis in the replacement QSB stock is $3,000 (cost of the replacement QSB stock, $5,500, reduced by the gain not recognized under section 1045, $2,500).

# Example 11. Sale by partner of QSB stock received in a nonliquidating distribution.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 10,
except that, on June 1, 2011, PRS distributes only $2,000 of the QSB stock to A, reducing A's interest in PRS capital from 60 percent to 33 percent. PRS' basis in the distributed QSB stock is $1,500. On November 1, 2011, A sells for $2,500 the QSB stock distributed by PRS to A and purchases, within 60 days of the date of sale of the QSB stock, replacement QSB stock for $2,500. A makes a timely election to apply section 1045 with respect to A's sale of the distributed QSB stock.
(ii) Under section 732, A's basis in the distributed QSB stock is $1,500. Therefore, A realizes a gain on the sale of the distributed QSB stock of $1,000. Because A made an election to apply section 1045 to the sale, and because A purchased, within 60 days of A's sale of the QSB stock, replacement QSB stock at a cost equal to the amount realized on the sale of the distributed QSB stock, A defers recognition of the gain from the sale of the QSB stock to the extent that such gain does not exceed the distribution nonrecognition limitation.
(iii) Under paragraph (e)(3) of this section, the nonrecognition limitation with respect to A's sale of the QSB stock is A's section 1045 amount realized reduced by A's section 1045 adjusted basis. Because PRS did not distribute all of the particular type of QSB stock and the distribution of the QSB stock to A was not in liquidation of A's interest in PRS, under paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(C) of this section A's section 1045 amount realized is $1,250 (A's amount realized from the sale of the distributed QSB stock, $2,500, multiplied by A's smallest percentage interest in PRS capital with respect to such stock, 50 percent). Under paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(B) of this section, A's section 1045 adjusted basis is the product of the partnership's basis in the QSB stock sold by the partner, $1,500, and A's smallest percentage interest in the partnership capital with respect to such stock, 50 percent. Therefore, A's section 1045 adjusted basis is $750 (50 percent of $1,500), and A's nonrecognition limitation amount on the sale of the QSB stock is $500 ($1,250 section 1045 amount realized minus $750 section 1045 adjusted basis). As this amount is less than the amount of gain that A is eligible to defer under section 1045, $1,000, A defers recognition of only $500 of the gain from the sale of the QSB stock. A must recognize the remaining $500 of that gain.
(iv) A's basis in the replacement QSB stock is $2,000 (cost of the replacement QSB stock, $2,500, reduced by the gain not recognized under section 1045, $500).

# Example 12. Contribution of replacement QSB stock to a partnership.
(i) On January 1, 2008, A, an individual, B, an individual, and X, a C corporation, form PRS, a partnership. A, B, and X each contribute $250 to PRS and agree to share all partnership items equally. On February 1, 2008, PRS purchases QSB stock for $750. PRS sells the QSB stock on November 3, 2008, for $1,050. PRS realizes $300 of gain from the sale of the QSB stock (none of which is treated as ordinary income) and allocates $100 of gain to each of its partners. PRS informs the partners that it does not intend to make an election under section 1045 with respect to the sale of the QSB stock. Each partner's share of the amount realized from the sale of the QSB stock is $350. On November 30, 2008, A, an eligible partner within the meaning of paragraph (g)(3) of this section, purchases replacement QSB stock for $350 and makes a section 1045 election under paragraph (c)(1) of this section. Subsequently, A transfers the replacement QSB stock to ABC, a partnership, in exchange for an interest in ABC.
(ii) Because A purchased within 60 days of PRS' sale of the QSB stock, replacement QSB stock for a cost equal to A's share of the partnership's amount realized on the sale of the QSB stock, and because A made a valid election to apply section 1045 with respect to A's share of the gain from PRS' sale of the QSB stock, A does not recognize A's $100 distributive share of the gain from PRS' sale of the QSB stock. Before the contribution of the replacement QSB stock to ABC, A's adjusted basis in the replacement QSB stock is $250 ($350 cost minus $100 nonrecognition amount). A does not recognize gain upon the contribution of QSB stock to ABC under section 721(a). Upon the contribution of the replacement QSB stock to ABC, A's basis in the ABC partnership interest is $250, and ABC's basis in the replacement QSB stock is $250. However, the replacement QSB stock does not qualify as QSB stock in ABC's hands. Neither A nor ABC will be eligible to defer gain under section 1045 on a subsequent sale of the replacement QSB stock.
(j)
Effective date/applicability—In general.
This section applies to sales of QSB stock on or after August 14, 2007.

# Special Rules
§ 1.1051-1
Basis of property acquired during affiliation.
(a)(1) The basis of property acquired by a corporation during a period of affiliation from a corporation with which it was affiliated shall be the same as it would be in the hands of the corporation from which acquired. This rule is applicable if the basis of the property is material in determining tax liability for any year, whether a separate return or a consolidated return is made in respect of such year. For the purpose of this section, the term
period of affiliation
means the period during which such corporations were affiliated (determined in accordance with the law applicable thereto), but does not include any taxable year beginning on or after January 1, 1922, unless a consolidated return was made, nor any taxable year after the taxable year 1928.
(2) The application of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example:
The X Corporation, the Y Corporation, and the Z Corporation were affiliated for the taxable year 1920. During that year the X Corporation transferred assets to the Y Corporation for $120,000 cash, and the Y Corporation in turn transferred the assets during the same year to the Z Corporation for $130,000 cash. The assets were acquired by the X Corporation in 1916 at a cost of $100,000. The basis of the assets in the hands of the Z Corporation is $100,000.
(b) The basis of property acquired by a corporation during any period, in the taxable year 1929 or any subsequent taxable year, in respect of which a consolidated return was made or was required under the regulations governing the making of consolidated returns, shall be determined in accordance with such regulations. The basis in the case of property held by a corporation during any period, in the taxable year 1929 or any subsequent taxable year, in respect of which a consolidated return is made or is required under the regulations governing the making of consolidated returns, shall be adjusted in respect of any items relating to such period in accordance with such regulations.
(c) Except as otherwise provided in the regulations promulgated under section 1502 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 or the regulations under section 141 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 or the Revenue Act of 1938 (52 Stat. 447), 1936 (49 Stat. 1652), 1934 (48 Stat. 683), 1932 (47 Stat. 169), or 1928 (45 Stat. 791), the basis of property after a consolidated return period shall be the same as the basis immediately prior to the close of such period.
§ 1.1052-1
Basis of property established by Revenue Act of 1932.
Section 1052(a) provides that if property was acquired after February 28, 1913, in any taxable year beginning before January 1, 1934, and the basis of the property, for the purposes of the Revenue Act of 1932 (47 Stat. 169), was prescribed by section 113(a) (6), (7), or (9) of that act, then for purposes of subtitle A of the Code, the basis shall be the same as the basis prescribed in the Revenue Act of 1932. For the rules applicable in determining the basis of stocks or securities under section 113(a)(9) of the Revenue Act of 1932 in case of certain distributions after December 31, 1923, and in any taxable year beginning before January 1, 1934, see 26 CFR (1939) 39.113 (a)(12)-1 (Regulations 118).
§ 1.1052-2
Basis of property established by Revenue Act of 1934.
Section 1052(b) provides that if property was acquired after February 28, 1913, in any taxable year beginning before January 1, 1936, and the basis of the property for the purposes of the Revenue Act of 1934 (48 Stat. 683) was prescribed by section 113(a) (6), (7), or (8) of that act, then for purposes of subtitle A of the Code, the basis shall be the same as the basis prescribed in the Revenue Act of 1934. For example, if after December 31, 1920, and in any taxable year beginning before January 1, 1936, property was acquired by a corporation by the issuance of its stock or securities in connection with a transaction which is not described in section 112(b)(5) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 but which is described in section 112(b)(5) of the Revenue Act of 1934, the basis of the property so acquired shall be the same as it would be in the hands of the transferor, with proper adjustments to the date of the exchange.
§ 1.1052-3
Basis of property established by the Internal Revenue Code of 1939.
Section 1052(c) provides that if property was acquired after February 28, 1913, in a transaction to which the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 applied and the basis thereof was prescribed by section 113(a) (6), (7), (8), (13), (15), (18), (19) or (23) of such Code, then for purposes of subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, the basis shall be the same as the basis prescribed in the Internal Revenue Code of 1939. In such cases, see section 113(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 and the regulations thereunder.
§ 1.1053-1
Property acquired before March 1, 1913.
(a)
Basis for determining gain.
In the case of property acquired before March 1, 1913, the basis as of March 1, 1913, for determining gain is the cost or other basis, adjusted as provided in section 1016 and other applicable provisions of chapter 1 of the Code, or its fair market value as of March 1, 1913, whichever is greater.
(b)
Basis for determining loss.
In the case of property acquired before March 1, 1913, the basis as of March 1, 1913, for determining loss is the basis determined in accordance with part II (section 1011 and following), subchapter O, chapter 1 of the Code, or other applicable provisions of chapter 1 of the Code, without reference to the fair market value as of March 1, 1913.
(c)
Example.
The application of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example:
(i) On March 1, 1908, a taxpayer purchased for $100,000, property having a useful life of 50 years. Assuming that there were no capital improvements to the property, the depreciation sustained on the property before March 1, 1913, was $10,000 (5 years @ $2,000), so that the original cost adjusted, as of March 1, 1913, for depreciation sustained prior to that date is $90,000. On that date the property had a fair market value of $94,500 with a remaining life of 45 years.
(ii) For the purpose of determining gain from the sale or other disposition of the property on March 1, 1954, the basis of the property is the fair market value of $94,500 as of March 1, 1913, adjusted for depreciation allowed or allowable after February 28, 1913, computed on $94,500. Thus, the substituted basis, $94,500, is reduced by the depreciation adjustment from March 1, 1913, to February 28, 1954, in the aggregate of $86,100 (41 years @ $2,100), leaving an adjusted basis for determining gain of $8,400 ($94,500 less $86,100).
(iii) For the purpose of determining loss from the sale or other disposition of such property on March 1, 1954, the basis of the property is its cost, adjusted for depreciation sustained before March 1, 1913, computed on cost, and the amount of depreciation allowed or allowable after February 28, 1913, computed on the fair market value of $94,500 as of March 1, 1913. In this example, the amount of depreciation sustained before March 1, 1913, is $10,000 and the amount of depreciation determined for the period after February 28, 1913, is $86,100. Therefore, the aggregate amount of depreciation for which the cost ($100,000) should be adjusted is $96,100 ($10,000 plus $86,100), and the adjusted basis for determining loss on March 1, 1954, is $3,900 ($100,000 less $96,100).
(d)
Fair market value.
The determination of the fair market value of property on March 1, 1913, is generally a question of fact and shall be established by competent evidence. In determining the fair market value of stock or other securities, due regard shall be given to the fair market value of the corporate assets as of such date, and other pertinent factors. In the case of property traded in on public exchanges,
actual sales on or near the basic date afford evidence of value. In general, the fair market value of a block or aggregate of a particular kind of property is not to be determined by a forced-sale price, or by an estimate of what a whole block or aggregate would bring if placed upon the market at one and the same time. In such a case the value should be determined by ascertaining as the basis the fair market value of each unit of the property. All relevant facts and elements of value as of the basic date should be considered in each case.
§ 1.1054-1
Certain stock of Federal National Mortgage Association.
(a)
In general.
The basis in the hands of the initial holder of a share of stock which is issued pursuant to section 303(c) of the Federal National Mortgage Association Charter Act (12 U.S.C., section 1718) in a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1959, shall be an amount equal to the issuance price of the stock reduced by the amount, if any, required by section 162(d) to be treated (with respect to such share) as an ordinary and necessary business expense. See section 162(d) and § 1.162-19. For purposes of this section the initial holder is the original purchaser who is issued stock of the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) pursuant to section 303(c) of the Act and who appears on the books of FNMA as the initial holder. See § 1.162-19.
(b)
Example.
The provisions of this section may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example:
Pursuant to section 303(c) of the Federal National Mortgage Association Charter Act a certificate of FNMA stock is issued to A as of January 1, 1961. The issuance price of the stock was $100 and the fair market value of the stock on the date of issue was $69. A was required by section 162(d) to treat $31 as a business expense for the year 1961. The basis of the share of stock in the hands of A, the initial holder, shall be $69, the amount paid for the stock ($100) reduced by $31.
[T.D. 6690, 28 FR 12254, Nov. 19, 1963]
§ 1.1055-1
General rule with respect to redeemable ground rents.
(a)
Character of a redeemable ground rent.
For purposes of subtitle A of the Code (1) a redeemable ground rent (as defined in section 1055(c) and paragraph (b) of this section) shall be treated as being in the nature of a mortgage, and (2) real property held subject to liabilities under such a redeemable ground rent shall be treated as held subject to liabilities under a mortgage. Thus, under section 1055(a) and this paragraph, the transfer of property subject to a redeemable ground rent has the same effect as the transfer of property subject to a mortgage, the acquisition of property subject to a redeemable ground rent is to be treated the same as the acquisition of property subject to a mortgage, and the holding of property subject to a redeemable ground rent is to be treated in the same manner as the holding of property subject to a mortgage. See section 163(c) for the treatment of any annual or periodic rental payment under a redeemable ground rent as interest.
(b)
Definition of redeemable ground rent.
For purposes of subtitle A of the Code, the term
redeemable ground rent
means only a ground rent with respect to which all the following conditions are met:
(1) There is a lease of land which is assignable by the lessee without the consent of the lessor.
(2) The term of the lease is for a period in excess of 15 years, taking into account all periods for which the lease may be renewed at the option of the lessee.
(3) The lessee has a present or future right to terminate the lease and to acquire the lessor's interest in the land (i.e., to redeem the ground rent) by the payment of a determined or determinable amount, which amount is referred to in §§ 1.1055-2, 1.1055-3, and 1.1055-4 as a
redemption price.
Such right must exist by virtue of State or local law. If the lessee's right to terminate the lease and to acquire the lessor's interest is not granted by State or local law but exists solely by virtue of a private agreement or privately created condition, the ground rent is not a
redeemable ground rent.
(4) The lessor's interest in the land subject to the lease is primarily a security interest to protect the payment to him of the annual or periodic rental payments due under the lease.
(c)
Effective date.
In general, the provisions of section 1055 and paragraph (a) of this section take effect on April 11, 1963, and apply with respect to taxable years ending on or after such date. See § 1.1055-3 for rules for determining the basis of real property acquired subject to liabilities under a redeemable ground rent regardless of when such property was acquired. See also § 1.1055-4 for rules for determining the basis of a redeemable ground rent in the hands of a holder who reserved or created such ground rent in connection with a transfer, occurring before April 11, 1963, of the right to hold real property subject to liabilities under such ground rent.
[T.D. 6821, 30 FR 6216, May 4, 1965]
§ 1.1055-2
Determination of amount realized on the transfer of the right to hold real property subject to liabilities under a redeemable ground rent.
In determining the amount realized from a transfer, occurring on or after April 11, 1963, of the right to hold real property subject to liabilities under a redeemable ground rent, such ground rent shall be accounted for in the same manner as a mortgage for an amount of money equal to the redemption price of the ground rent. The provisions of this section apply in respect of any such transfer even though such ground rent was created prior to April 11, 1963. For provisions relating to the determination of the amount of and recognition of gain or loss from the sale or other disposition of property, see section 1001 and the regulations thereunder.
[T.D. 6821, 30 FR 6217, May 4, 1965]
§ 1.1055-3
Basis of real property held subject to liabilities under a redeemable ground rent.
(a)
In general.
The provisions of section 1055(a) and paragraph (a) of § 1.1055-1 are applicable in determining the basis of real property held on or after April 11, 1963, in any case where the property at the time of acquisition was subject to liabilities under a redeemable ground rent. (See section 1055(b)(2).) Thus, if on or after April 11, 1963, a taxpayer holds real property which was subject to liabilities under a redeemable ground rent at the time he acquired it, the basis of such property in the hands of such taxpayer, regardless of when the property was acquired, will include the redeemable ground rent in the same manner as if it were a mortgage in an amount equal to the redemption price of such ground rent. Likewise, if on or after April 11, 1963, a taxpayer holds real property which was subject to liabilities under a redeemable ground rent at the time he acquired it and which has a substituted basis in his hands, the basis of the property in the hands of the taxpayer's predecessor in interest is to be determined by treating the redeemable ground rent in the same manner as a mortgage in an amount equal to the redemption price of such ground rent.
(b)
Illustrations.
The provisions of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
On April 11, 1963, taxpayer A held residential property which he acquired on January 15, 1963, for a purchase price of $10,000 and which, at the time he acquired it, was subject to a ground rent redeemable for a redemption price of $1,600. A's basis for the property includes the purchase price ($10,000) plus the redeemable ground rent in the same manner as if it were a mortgage for $1,600.

# Example 2.
In 1962, taxpayer X, a corporation, acquired real property subject to a redeemable ground rent in a transfer to which section 351 (relating to transfer of property to corporation controlled by transferor) applied and in which the basis of the property to X was the transferor's basis. X still held the property on April 11, 1963. The transferor's basis in the property is to be determined by treating the redeemable ground rent to which it was subject in the transferor's hands as if it were a mortgage.
[T.D. 6821, 30 FR 6217, May 4, 1965]
§ 1.1055-4
Basis of redeemable ground rent reserved or created in connection with transfers of real property before April 11, 1963.
(a)
In general.
In the case of a redeemable ground rent created or reserved in connection with a transfer, occurring before April 11, 1963, of the right to hold real property subject to liabilities under such ground rent, the basis of such ground rent on or after April 11, 1963, in the hands of the person who reserved or created the ground rent is the amount which was taken into account in respect of such ground rent in computing the amount realized
from the transfer of such real property. Thus, if no such amount was taken into account, such basis shall be determined without regard to section 1055. (See section 1055(b)(3).)
(b) The provisions of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
The taxpayer, who was in the business of building houses, purchased an undeveloped lot of land for $500 and built a house thereon at a cost of $10,000. Subsequently, he transferred the right to hold the lot improved by the house for a consideration of $12,000, and an annual ground rent for such property of $120 which was redeemable for a redemption price of $2,000. The taxpayer reported a $2,000 gain on the transfer, treating the amount realized as $12,000 and his cost allocable to the interest transferred as $10,000. Since the builder did not take the redeemable ground rent into account in computing gain on the transfer, his basis for such ground rent is $500 (the cost of the land not offset against the consideration received for the transfer). Thus, if he subsequently sells the redeemable ground rent (or if it is redeemed from him) for $2,000, he has no gain of $1,500 in the year of sale (or redemption).

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in Example 1 except that the builder reported a gain of $3,500 on the transfer, treating the amount realized as $14,000 ($12,000 cash plus $2,000 for the redeemable ground rent) and his costs as $10,500 ($10,000 for the house and $500 for the lot). Since the taxpayer took the entire amount of the redeemable ground rent into account in computing his gain, his basis for such ground rent is $2,000. Thus, if he subsequently sells the redeemable ground rent (or if it is redeemed from him) for $2,000, he has no gain or loss on the transaction.

# Example 3.
Assume the same facts as in Example 1 except that the builder reported a gain of $3,000 on the transfer. He computed this gain by treating the amount realized as $12,000 but treating his cost allocable to the interest transferred as $12,000/$14,000ths of his total $10,500 cost, or $9,000. Since the builder still has remaining $1,500 of unallocated cost, his basis for the redeemable ground rent is $1,500. Thus, if he subsequently sells the redeemable ground rent (or if it is redeemed from him) for $2,000, he has a gain of $500 in the year of sale (or redemption).
[T.D. 6821, 30 FR 6217, May 4, 1965]
§ 1.1059(e)-1
Non-pro rata redemptions.
(a)
In general.
Section 1059(d)(6) (exception where stock held during entire existence of corporation) and section 1059(e)(2) (qualifying dividends) do not apply to any distribution treated as an extraordinary dividend under section 1059(e)(1). For example, if a redemption of stock is not pro rata as to all shareholders, any amount treated as a dividend under section 301 is treated as an extraordinary dividend regardless of whether the dividend is a qualifying dividend.
(b)
Reorganizations.
For purposes of section 1059(e)(1), any exchange under section 356 is treated as a redemption and, to the extent any amount is treated as a dividend under section 356(a)(2), it is treated as a dividend under section 301.
(c)
Effective date.
This section applies to distributions announced (within the meaning of section 1059(d)(5)) on or after June 17, 1996.
[T.D. 8724, 62 FR 38028, July 16, 1997]
§ 1.1059A-1
Limitation on taxpayer's basis or inventory cost in property imported from related persons.
(a)
General rule.
In the case of property imported into the United States in a transaction (directly or indirectly) by a controlled taxpayer from another member of a controlled group of taxpayers, except for the adjustments permitted by paragraph (c) (2) of this section, the amount of any costs taken into account in computing the basis or inventory cost of the property by the purchasing U.S. taxpayer and which costs are also taken into account in computing the valuation of the property for customs purposes may not, for purposes of the basis or inventory cost, be greater than the amount of the costs used in computing the customs value. For purposes of this section, the terms
controlled taxpayer
and
group of controlled taxpayers
shall have the meaning set forth in § 1.482-1(a).
(b)
Definitions
—(1)
Import.
For purposes of section 1059A and this section only, the term
import
means the filing of the entry documentation required by the U.S. Customs Service to secure the release of imported merchandise from custody of the U.S. Customs Service.
(2)
Indirectly.
For purposes of this section,
indirectly
refers to a transaction between a controlled taxpayer and another member of the controlled group whereby property is imported through a person acting as an agent of,
or otherwise on behalf of, either or both related persons, or as a middleman or conduit for transfer of the property between a controlled taxpayer and another member of the controlled group. In the case of the importation of property indirectly, an adjustment shall be permitted under paragraph (c)(2) of this section for a commission or markup paid to the person acting as agent, middleman, or conduit, only to the extent that the commission or markup: is otherwise properly included in cost basis or inventory cost; was actually incurred by the taxpayer and not remitted, directly or indirectly, to the taxpayer or related party; and there is a substantial business reason for the use of a middleman, agent, or conduit.
(c)
Customs value
—(1)
Definition.
For purposes of this section only, the term
customs value
means the value required to be taken into account for purposes of determining the amount of any customs duties or any other duties which may be imposed on the importation of any property. Where an item or a portion of an item is not subject to any customs duty or is subject to a free rate of duty, such item or portion of such item shall not be subject to the provisions of section 1059A or this section. Thus, for example, the portion of an item that is an American good returned and not subject to duty (items 806.20 and 806.30, Tariff Schedules of the United States, 19 U.S.C. 1202); imports on which no duty is imposed that are valued by customs for statistical purposes only; and items subject to a zero rate of duty (19 U.S.C. 1202, General Headnote 3) are not subject to section 1059A or this section. Also, items subject only to the user fee under 19 U.S.C. 58(c), or the harbor maintenance tax imposed by 26 U.S.C. 4461, or only to both, are not subject to section 1059A or this section. This section imposes no limitation on a claimed basis or inventory cost in property which is less than the value used to compute the customs duty with respect to the same property. Section 1059A and this section have no application to imported property not subject to any customs duty based on value, including property subject only to a per item duty or a duty based on volume, because there is no customs value, within the meaning of this paragraph, with respect to such property.
(2)
Adjustments to customs value.
To the extent not otherwise included in customs value, a taxpayer, for purposes of determining the limitation on claimed basis or inventory cost of property under this section, may increase the customs value of imported property by the amounts incurred by it and properly included in inventory cost for—
(i) Freight charges,
(ii) Insurance charges,
(iii) The construction, erection, assembly, or technical assistance provided with respect to, the property after its importation into the United States, and
(iv) Any other amounts which are not taken into account in determining the customs value, which are not properly includible in customs value, and which are appropriately included in the cost basis or inventory cost for income tax purposes. See § 1.471-11 and section 263A.
Appropriate adjustments may also be made to customs values when the taxpayer has not allocated the value of assists to individual articles but rather has reported the value of assists on a periodic basis in accordance with 19 CFR 152.103(e). When 19 CFR 152.103(e) has been utilized for customs purposes, the taxpayer may adjust his customs values by allocating the value of the assists to all imported articles to which the assists relate. To the extent that an amount attributable to an adjustment permitted by this section is paid by a controlled taxpayer to another member of the group of controlled taxpayers, an adjustment is permitted under this section only to the extent that the amount incurred represents an arm's length charge within the meaning of § 1.482-1(d)(3).
(3)
Offsets to adjustments.
To the extent that a customs value is adjusted under paragraph (c)(2) of this section for purposes of calculating the limitation on claimed cost basis or inventory cost under this section, the amount of the adjustments must be offset (reduced) by amounts that properly reduce the cost basis of inventory and
that are not taken into account in determining customs value, such as rebates and other reductions in the price actually incurred, effected between the purchaser and related seller after the date of importation of the property.
(4)
Application of section 1059A to property having dutiable and nondutiable portions.
When an item of imported property is subiect to a duty upon the full value of the imported article, less the cost or value of American goods returned, and the taxpayer claims a basis or inventory cost greater than the customs value reported for the item, the claimed tax basis or inventory cost in the dutiable portion of the item is limited under section 1059A and this section to the customs value of the dutiable portion under paragraph (c)(1). The claimed tax basis or inventory cost in the nondutiable portion of the item is determined by multiplying the customs value of the nondutiable portion by a fraction the numerator of which is the amount by which the claimed basis or inventory cost of the item exceeds the customs value of the item and the denominator of which is the customs value of the item and adding this amount to the customs value of the nondutiable portion of the item. The claimed tax basis or inventory cost in the dutiable portion is determined by multiplying the customs value of the dutiable portion by a fraction the numerator of which is the amount by which the claimed basis or inventory cost of the item exceeds the customs value of the item and the denominator of which is the customs value of the item and adding this amount to the customs value of the dutiable portion of the item. However, the taxpayer may not claim a tax basis or inventory cost in the dutiable portion greater than the customs value of this portion of the item.
(5)
Allocation of adjustments to property having dutiable and nondutiable portions.
When an item of imported property is subject to a duty upon the full value of the imported article, less the cost or value of American goods returned, and the taxpayer establishes that the customs value may be increased by adjustments permitted under paragraph (c)(2) of this section for purposes of the section 1059A limitation, the taxpayer's basis or inventory cost of the dutiable portion of the item is determined by multiplying the customs value of the dutiable portion times the percentage that the adjustments represent of the total customs value of the item and adding this amount to the customs value of the dutiable portion of the item. The taxpayer's basis or inventory cost of the nondutiable portion of the item is determined in the same manner. The amount so determined for the dutiable portion of the item is the section 1059A limitation for this portion of the item.
(6)
Alternative method of demonstrating compliance.
In lieu of calculating all adjustments and offsets to adjustments to customs value for an item of property pursuant to paragraph (c) (2) and (3) of this section, a taxpayer may demonstrate compliance with this section and section 1059A by comparing costs taken into account in computing basis or inventory costs of the property and the costs taken into account in computing customs value at any time after importation, provided that in any such comparison the same costs are included both in basis or inventory costs and in customs value. If, on the basis of such comparison, the basis or inventory cost is equal to or less than the customs value, the taxpayer shall be deemed to have met the requirements of this section and section 1059A.
(7)
Relationship of section 1059A to section 482.
Neither this section nor section 1059A limits in any way the authority of the Commissioner to increase or decrease the claimed basis or inventory cost under section 482 or any other appropriate provision of law. Neither does this section or section 1059A permit a taxpayer to adjust upward its cost basis or inventory cost for property appropriately determined under section 482 because such basis or inventory cost is less than the customs value with respect to such property.
(8)
Illustrations.
The application of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Corporation X, a United States taxpayer, and Y Corporation are members of a group of controlled corporations. X pays $2,000 to Y for merchandise imported into the United States and an additional $150 for ocean freight and insurance. The customs
value of the shipment is determined to be the amount actually paid by X ($2,000) and does not include the charges for ocean freight and insurance. For purposes of computing the limitation on its inventory cost for the merchandise under section 1059A and this section, X is permitted, under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, to increase the customs value ($2,000) by amounts it paid for ocean freight and insurance charges ($150). Thus, the inventory cost claimed by X in the merchandise may not exceed $2,150.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in Example 1 except that, subsequent to the date of importation of the merchandise, Y grants to X a rebate of $200 of the purchase price. At the time of sale, the rebate was contingent upon the volume of merchandise ultimately bought by X from Y. The value of the merchandise, for customs purposes, is not decreased by the rebate paid to X by Y. Therefore, the customs value, for customs purposes, of the merchandise remains the same ($2,000). For purposes of computing its inventory cost, X was permitted, under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, to increase the customs value for purposes of section 1059A of $2,000 by the amounts it paid for ocean freight and insurance charges ($150). However, under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, X is required to reduce the amount of the customs value by the lesser of the amount of the rebate or the amount of any positive adjustments to the original customs value. The inventory price claimed by X may not exceed $2,000 ($2,000 customs value, plus $150 transportation adjustment, less $150 offsetting rebate adjustment). While X's limitation under section 1059A is $2,000, X may not claim a basis or inventory cost in the merchandise in excess of $1,950.
See
I.R.C. section 1012; and section 1.471-2.

# Example 3.
Corporation X, a United States taxpayer, and Y Corporation are members of a group of controlled corporations. X pays $10,000 to Y for merchandise imported into the United States. The merchandise is composed, in part, of American goods returned. The customs value of the merchandise, on which a customs duty is imposed, is determined to be $8,000 ($10,000, the amount declared by X, less $2,000, the value of the American goods returned). For income tax purposes, X claims a cost basis in the merchandise of $11,000. None of the adjustments permitted by paragraph (c)(2) of this section is applicable. The portion of the merchandise constituting American goods returned represented 20 percent of the total customs value of the merchandise. Since the cost basis claimed by X for income tax purposes represents a 10 percent increase over the customs valuation (before reduction for American goods returned), the claimed tax basis in the dutiable content is considered to be $8,800 and in the portion constituting American goods returned is $2,200. Since a customs duty was imposed only on the dutiable content of the merchandise, the limitation in section 1059A and this section is applicable only to the claimed tax basis in this portion of the merchandise. Accordingly, under paragraph (a) of this section, X is limited to a cost basis of $10,200 in the merchandise. This amount represents a cost basis of $8,000 in the dutiable content and of $2,200 in the portion of the merchandise constituting American goods returned.

# Example 4.
Assume the same facts as in Example 3 except that X establishes that it is entitled to increase its customs value by $1,000 in adjustments permitted by paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Since the adjustments to customs value that X is entitled to under paragraph (c)(2) of this section are 10 percent of the customs value, for purposes of determining the limitation under section 1059A and this section, both the dutiable content and the portion of the merchandise constituting American goods returned shall be increased to an amount 10 percent greater than the respective values determined for customs purposes, or $8,800 for the dutiable content and $2,200 for the portion of the merchandise constituting American goods returned. Accordingly, under paragraph (a) of this section, X is limited to a cost basis of $11,000 in the merchandise.

# Example 5.
Corporation X, a United States taxpayer, and Y Corporation are members of a group of controlled corporations. X pays $10,000 to Y for merchandise imported into the United States. The customs value of the merchandise, on which a customs duty is imposed, is determined to be $10,000. Subsequent to the date of importation of the merchandise, Y grants to X a rebate of $1,000 of the purchase price. The value of the merchandise, for customs purposes, is not decreased by the rebate paid to X by Y. Notwithstanding the fact that X correctly reported and paid customs duty on a value of $10,000 and that its limitation on basis or inventory cost under this section is $10,000, X may not claim a basis or inventory cost in the merchandise in excess of $9,000.
See
I.R.C. section 1012; and section 1.471-2.

# Example 6.
Corporation X, a United States taxpayer, and Y Corporation are members of a group of controlled corporations. X pays $5,000 to Y for merchandise imported into the United States. The merchandise is not subject to a customs duty or is subject to a free rate of duty and is valued by customs solely for statistical purposes. Accordingly, pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the merchandise is not subject to the provisions of section 1059A or this section.

# Example 7.
Assume the same facts as in Example 6, except that the merchandise is subject to a customs duty based on value and that the customs value (taking into account no costs other than the value of the goods) is determined to be $5,000. Assume further that
the $5,000 payment is only for the value of the goods, no other cost is reflected in that payment, and only the $5,000 payment to Y is reflected in X's inventory cost or basis prior to inclusion of any other amounts properly included in inventory or cost basis. Pursuant to paragraph (c)(6) of this section, X, by demonstrating these facts is deemed to meet the requirements of this section and section 1059A.

# Example 8.
Corporation X, a United States taxpayer, and Y Corporation are members of a group of controlled corporations. X pays $9 to Y for merchandise imported into the United States and an additional $1 for ocean freight. The customs value of the article does not include the $l paid for ocean freight. Furthermore, for customs purposes the value is calculated pursuant to computed value and is determined to be $8. For purposes of computing the limitation on its inventory cost for the article under section 1059A and this section, X is permitted, under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, to increase the customs value ($8) by the amount it paid for ocean freight ($1). Thus, the inventory cost claimed by X in the article may not exceed $9.
(9)
Averaged customs values.
In cases of transactions in which (i) an appropriate transfer price is properly determined for tax purposes by reference to events occurring after importation, (ii) the value for customs purposes of one article is higher and of a second article is lower than the actual transaction values, (iii) the relevant articles have been appraised on the basis of a value estimated at the time of importation in accordance with customs regulations, and (iv) the entries have been liquidated upon importation, the section 1059A limitation on the undervalued article may be increased up to the amount of actual transaction value by the amount of the duty overpaid on the overvalued article times a fraction the numerator of which is “1” and the denominator of which is the rate of duty on the undervalued article. This paragraph (c)(9) applies exclusively to cases of property imported in transactions that are open for tax purposes in which the actual transaction value cannot be determined and the entry has been liquidated for customs purposes on the basis of a value estimated at the time of importation in accordance with customs regulations; in these cases, the property is appropriately valued for tax purposes by reference to a formula, in existence at the time of importation, based on subsequent events and valued for customs purposes by a different formula. This paragraph (c)(9) does not apply where customs value is correctly determined for purposes of liquidating the entry and where the customs value is subsequently adjusted for tax purposes, for example by a rebate, under paragraph (c)(2) of this section. The application of paragraph (c)(9) may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example:
Corporation X, a United States taxpayer, and Y Corporation are members of a group of controlled corporations. X purchases Articles A and B from Y on consignment and imports the Articles into the United States. The purchase price paid by X will be determined as a percentage of the sale prices that X realizes. Rather than deferring liquidation, customs liquidates the entry on the basis of estimated values and the customs duties are paid by X. Ultimately, it is determined that Article A was undervalued and Article B was overvalued by X for customs purposes. The section 1059A limitation for Article A is computed as follows:
Article A
Article B
Finally-determined customs value
$9
$9
Transaction value
$10
$5
Duty rate
10%
5%
Customs duty paid
$.90
$.45
Duty overpaid or (underpaid)
($.10)
$.20
The section 1059A limitation on Article A may be increased by the amount of the duty over-paid on Article B, $.20, times 1/.10, up to the amount of the transaction value. Therefore, the section 1059A limitation on Article A is $9.00 plus $1.00, or a total of $10.00. The section 1059A limitation on Article B is reduced (but never below transaction value) by $2.00 to $7.00.
(d)
Finality of customs value and of other determinations of the U.S. Customs Service.
For purposes of section 1059A and this section, a taxpayer is bound by the finally-determined customs value and by every final determination made by the U.S. Customs Service, including, but not limited to, dutiable value, the value attributable to the cost or value of products of the United States, and classification of the product for purposes of imposing any duty. The customs value is considered to be finally determined, and all U.S. Customs Service determinations are considered final, when liquidation of the entry becomes final. For this purpose,
the term
liquidation
means the ascertainment of the customs duties occurring on the entry of the property, and liquidation of the entry is considered to become final after 90 days following notice of liquidation to the importer, unless a protest is filed. If the importer files a protest, the customs value will be considered finally determined and all other U.S. Customs Service determinations will be considered final either when a decision by the Customs Service on the protest is not contested after expiration of the period allowed to contest the decision or when a judgment of the Court of International Trade becomes final. For purposes of this section, any adjustments to the customs value resulting from a petition under 19 U.S.C. section 1516 (requests by interested parties unrelated to the importer for redetermination of the appraised value, classification, or the rate of duty imposed on imported merchandise) or reliquidation under 19 U.S.C. section 1521 (reliquidation by the Customs Service upon a finding that fraud was involved in the original liquidation) will not be taken into account. However, reliquidation under 19 U.S.C. section 1501 (voluntary reliquidation by the Customs Service within 90 days of the original liquidation to correct errors in appraisement, classification, or any element entering into a liquidation or reliquidation) or reliquidation under 19 U.S.C. section 1520(c)(1) (to correct a clerical error, mistake of fact, or other inadvertance within one year of a liquidation or reliquidation) will be taken into account in the same manner as, and take the place of, the original liquidation in determining customs value.
(e)
Drawbacks.
For purposes of this section, a drawback, that is, a refund or remission (in whole or in part) of a customs duty because of a particular use made (or to be made) of the property on which the duty was assessed or collected, shall not affect the determination of the customs value of the property.
(f)
Effective date.
Property imported by a taxpayer is subject to section 1059A and this section if the entry documentation required to be filed to obtain the release of the property from the custody of the United States Customs Service was filed after March 18, 1986. Section 1059A and this section will not apply to imported property where (1) the entry documentation is filed prior to September 3, 1987; and (2) the importation was liquidated under the circumstances described in paragraph (c)(9) of this section.

§ 1.1060-1
Special allocation rules for certain asset acquisitions.
(a)
Scope
—(1)
In general.
This section prescribes rules relating to the requirements of section 1060, which, in the case of an applicable asset acquisition, requires the transferor (the seller) and the transferee (the purchaser) each to allocate the consideration paid or received in the transaction among the assets transferred in the same manner as amounts are allocated under section 338(b)(5) (relating to the allocation of adjusted grossed-up basis among the assets of the target corporation when a section 338 election is made). In the case of an applicable asset acquisition described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, sellers and purchasers must allocate the consideration under the residual method as described in §§ 1.338-6 and 1.338-7 in order to determine, respectively, the amount realized from, and the basis in, each of the transferred assets. For rules relating to distributions of partnership property or transfers of partnership interests which are subject to section 1060(d), see § 1.755-2T.
(2)
Effective dates
—(i)
In general.
The provisions of this section apply to any asset acquisition occurring after March 15, 2001. However, paragraphs (b)(9) and (c)(5) of this section apply only to applicable asset acquisitions occurring on or after April 10, 2006. A purchaser or a seller may make an irrevocable election to apply the rules in §§ 1.338-11 (including the applicable provisions in §§ 1.197-2(g)(5), 1.381(c)(22)-1, 846 and 1060) to an applicable asset acquisition occurring before April 10, 2006. Paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section describes the time and manner of the election for the purchaser and paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section prescribes the time and manner of the election for the seller. The seller may make the election to apply the regulations retroactively
without regard to whether the purchaser also makes the election. For rules applicable to asset acquisitions on or before March 15, 2001,
see
§ 1.1060-1T in effect before March 16, 2001 (

(ii)
Time and manner of making the election for the purchaser.
The purchaser may make an election described in this paragraph (a)(2) by attaching a statement to its original or amended income tax return for the taxable year that includes the applicable asset sale. The statement must be entitled “Election to Retroactively Apply the Rules in § 1.338-11 (Including the Applicable Provisions in §§ 1.197-2(g)(5), 1.381(c)(22)-1, 846 and 1060) to an Applicable Asset Acquisition Completed Before April 10, 2006” and must include the following information—
(A) The name and E.I.N. for the purchaser; and
(B) The following declaration (or a substantially similar declaration): The purchaser has amended its income tax returns for the taxable year that includes the applicable asset acquisition and for all affected subsequent years to reflect the rules in § 1.338-11 (Including the Applicable Provisions in §§ 1.197-2(g)(5), 1.381(c)(22)-1,846 and 1060).
(iii)
Time and manner of making the election for the seller.
The seller may make an election described in this paragraph (a)(2) by attaching a statement to its original or amended income tax return for the taxable year that includes the applicable asset sale. The statement must be entitled “Election to retroactively apply the rules in § 1.338-11 (including the applicable provisions in §§ 1.197-2(g)(5), 1.381(c)(22)-1, 846 and 1060) to an applicable asset acquisition completed before April 10, 2006” and must include the following information—
(A) The name and E.I.N. for the seller; and
(B) The following declaration (or a substantially similar declaration): The seller has amended its income tax returns for the taxable year that includes the applicable asset acquisition and for all affected subsequent years to reflect the rules in § 1.338-11 (including the applicable provisions in §§ 1.197-2(g)(5), 1.381(c)(22)-1, 846 and 1060).

(b)
Applicable asset acquisition
—(1)
In general.
An applicable asset acquisition is any transfer, whether direct or indirect, of a group of assets if the assets transferred constitute a trade or business in the hands of either the seller or the purchaser and, except as provided in paragraph (b)(8) of this section, the purchaser's basis in the transferred assets is determined wholly by reference to the purchaser's consideration.
(2)
Assets constituting a trade or business
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of this section, a group of assets constitutes a trade or business if—
(A) The use of such assets would constitute an active trade or business under section 355; or
(B) Its character is such that goodwill or going concern value could under any circumstances attach to such group.
(ii)
Goodwill or going concern value.
Goodwill is the value of a trade or business attributable to the expectancy of continued customer patronage. This expectancy may be due to the name or reputation of a trade or business or any other factor. Going concern value is the additional value that attaches to property because of its existence as an integral part of an ongoing business activity. Going concern value includes the value attributable to the ability of a trade or business (or a part of a trade or business) to continue functioning or generating income without interruption notwithstanding a change in ownership. It also includes the value that is attributable to the immediate use or availability of an acquired trade or business, such as, for example, the use of the revenues or net earnings that otherwise would not be received during any period if the acquired trade or business were not available or operational.
(iii)
Factors indicating goodwill or going concern value.
In making the determination in this paragraph (b)(2), all the facts and circumstances surrounding the transaction are taken into account. Whether sufficient consideration is available to allocate to goodwill or going concern value after the residual method is applied is not relevant in determining whether goodwill or going concern value could attach to a group of assets. Factors to be considered include—
(A) The presence of any intangible assets (whether or not those assets are section 197 intangibles), provided, however, that the transfer of such an asset in the absence of other assets will not be a trade or business for purposes of section 1060;
(B) The existence of an excess of the total consideration over the aggregate book value of the tangible and intangible assets purchased (other than goodwill and going concern value) as shown in the financial accounting books and records of the purchaser; and
(C) Related transactions, including lease agreements, licenses, or other similar agreements between the purchaser and seller (or managers, directors, owners, or employees of the seller) in connection with the transfer.
(3)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section:

# Example 1.
S is a high grade machine shop that manufactures microwave connectors in limited quantities. It is a successful company with a reputation within the industry and among its customers for manufacturing unique, high quality products. Its tangible assets consist primarily of ordinary machinery for working metal and plating. It has no secret formulas or patented drawings of value. P is a company that designs, manufactures, and markets electronic components. It wants to establish an immediate presence in the microwave industry, an area in which it previously has not been engaged. P is acquiring assets of a number of smaller companies and hopes that these assets will collectively allow it to offer a broad product mix. P acquires the assets of S in order to augment its product mix and to promote its presence in the microwave industry. P will not use the assets acquired from S to manufacture microwave connectors. The assets transferred are assets that constitute a trade or business in the hands of the seller. Thus, P's purchase of S's assets is an applicable asset acquisition. The fact that P will not use the assets acquired from S to continue the business of S does not affect this conclusion.

# Example 2.
S, a sole proprietor who operates a car wash, both leases the building housing the car wash and sells all of the car wash equipment to P. S's use of the building and the car wash equipment constitute a trade or business. P begins operating a car wash in the building it leases from S. Because the assets transferred together with the asset leased are assets which constitute a trade or business, P's purchase of S's assets is an applicable asset acquisition.

# Example 3.
S, a corporation, owns a retail store business in State X and conducts activities in connection with that business enterprise that meet the active trade or business requirement of section 355. P is a minority shareholder of S. S distributes to P all the assets of S used in S's retail business in State X in complete redemption of P's stock in S held by P. The distribution of S's assets in redemption of P's stock is treated as a sale or exchange under sections 302(a) and 302(b)(3), and P's basis in the assets distributed to it is determined wholly by reference to the consideration paid, the S stock. Thus, S's distribution of assets constituting a trade or business to P is an applicable asset acquisition.

# Example 4.
S is a manufacturing company with an internal financial bookkeeping department. P is in the business of providing a financial bookkeeping service on a contract basis. As part of an agreement for P to begin providing financial bookkeeping services to
S, P agrees to buy all of the assets associated with S's internal bookkeeping operations and provide employment to any of S's bookkeeping department employees who choose to accept a position with P. In addition to selling P the assets associated with its bookkeeping operation, S will enter into a long term contract with P for bookkeeping services. Because assets transferred from S to P, along with the related contract for bookkeeping services, are a trade or business in the hands of P, the sale of the bookkeeping assets from S to P is an applicable asset acquisition.
(4)
Asymmetrical transfers of assets.
A purchaser is subject to section 1060 if—
(i) Under general principles of tax law, the seller is not treated as transferring the same assets as the purchaser is treated as acquiring;
(ii) The assets acquired by the purchaser constitute a trade or business; and
(iii) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(8) of this section, the purchaser's basis in the transferred assets is determined wholly by reference to the purchaser's consideration.
(5)
Related transactions.
Whether the assets transferred constitute a trade or business is determined by aggregating all transfers from the seller to the purchaser in a series of related transactions. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(8) of this section, all assets transferred from the seller to the purchaser in a series of related transactions are included in the group of assets among which the consideration paid or received in such series is allocated under the residual method. The principles of § 1.338-1(c) are also applied in determining which assets are included in the group of assets among which the consideration paid or received is allocated under the residual method.
(6)
More than a single trade or business.
If the assets transferred from a seller to a purchaser include more than one trade or business, then, in applying this section, all of the assets transferred (whether or not transferred in one transaction or a series of related transactions and whether or not part of a trade or business) are treated as a single trade or business.
(7)
Covenant entered into by the seller.
If, in connection with an applicable asset acquisition, the seller enters into a covenant (e.g., a covenant not to compete) with the purchaser, that covenant is treated as an asset transferred as part of a trade or business.
(8)
Partial non-recognition exchanges.
A transfer may constitute an applicable asset acquisition notwithstanding the fact that no gain or loss is recognized with respect to a portion of the group of assets transferred. All of the assets transferred, including the non-recognition assets, are taken into account in determining whether the group of assets constitutes a trade or business. The allocation of consideration under paragraph (c) of this section is done without taking into account either the non-recognition assets or the amount of money or other property that is treated as transferred in exchange for the non-recognition assets (together, the non-recognition exchange property). The basis in and gain or loss recognized with respect to the non-recognition exchange property are determined under such rules as would otherwise apply to an exchange of such property. The amount of the money and other property treated as exchanged for non-recognition assets is the amount by which the fair market value of the non-recognition assets transferred by one party exceeds the fair market value of the non-recognition assets transferred by the other (to the extent of the money and the fair market value of property transferred in the exchange). The money and other property that are treated as transferred in exchange for the non-recognition assets (and which are not included among the assets to which section 1060 applies) are considered to come from the following assets in the following order: first from Class I assets, then from Class II assets, then from Class III assets, then from Class IV assets, then from Class V assets, then from Class VI assets, and then from Class VII assets. For this purpose, liabilities assumed (or to which a non-recognition exchange property is subject) are treated as Class I assets. See
Example 1
in paragraph (d) of this section for an example of the application of section 1060 to a single transaction which is, in part, a non-recognition exchange.
(9)
Insurance business.
The mere reinsurance of insurance contracts by an
insurance company is not an applicable asset acquisition, even if it enables the reinsurer to establish a customer relationship with the owners of the reinsured contracts. However, a transfer of an insurance business is an applicable asset acquisition if the purchaser acquires significant business assets, in addition to insurance contracts, to which goodwill and going concern value could attach. For rules regarding the treatment of an applicable asset acquisition of an insurance business, see paragraph (c)(5) of this section.
(c)
Allocation of consideration among assets under the residual method
—(1)
Consideration.
The seller's consideration is the amount, in the aggregate, realized from selling the assets in the applicable asset acquisition under section 1001(b). The purchaser's consideration is the amount, in the aggregate, of its cost of purchasing the assets in the applicable asset acquisition that is properly taken into account in basis.
