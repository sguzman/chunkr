# Explanation
The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
Title 1 through Title 16
as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27
as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41
as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50
as of October 1
The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.

# LEGAL STATUS
The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

# HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, January 1, 2025), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

# EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.

# OMB CONTROL NUMBERS
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request.
Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.

# PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.

# “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.

# INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
What is incorporation by reference?
Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
What is a proper incorporation by reference?
The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
(b) The matter incorporated is adequately summarized in the preamble of the final rule and is available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?
If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or email fr.inspection@nara.gov.

# CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES
A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR
Index and Finding Aids.
This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.
An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

# REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

73 FR 63064, Oct. 23, 2008, unless otherwise noted. Redesignated at 84 FR 2427, Feb. 7, 2019
§ 301.1
Purpose and scope.
(a) Under section 436 of the Plant Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 7756), a State or political subdivision of a State may not impose prohibitions or restrictions upon the movement in interstate commerce of articles, means of conveyance, plants, plant products, biological control organisms, plant pests, or noxious weeds if the Secretary has issued a regulation or order to prevent the dissemination of the biological control organism, plant pest, or noxious weed within the United States. The only exceptions to this are:
(1) If the prohibitions or restrictions issued by the State or political subdivision of a State are consistent with and do not exceed the regulations or orders issued by the Secretary, or
(2) If the State or political subdivision of a State demonstrates to the Secretary and the Secretary finds that there is a special need for additional prohibitions or restrictions based on sound scientific data or a thorough risk assessment.
(b) The regulations in this subpart provide for the submission and consideration of special need requests when a State or a political subdivision of a State seeks to impose prohibitions or restrictions on the movement in interstate commerce of articles, means of conveyance, plants, plant products, biological control organisms, plant pests, or noxious weeds that are in addition to the prohibitions or restrictions imposed by this part or by a Federal Order.
§ 301.1-1
Definitions.
Administrator.
The Administrator, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), or any person authorized to act for the Administrator.
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS).

§ 301.1-2
Criteria for special need requests.
(a) A special need request, as described in § 301.1, may be generated by a State or a political subdivision of a State. If the request is generated by a political subdivision of a State, the request must be submitted to APHIS through the State. States may also collaborate with other States to submit multi-State special need requests. However, if submitted, the multi-State special need request must include information in sufficient detail to allow APHIS to analyze the impacts on each State on an individual basis. All special need requests must be signed by the executive official or officials or by a plant protection official or officials of the State(s) making the request and must contain the following:
(1) Data drawn from a scientifically sound detection survey, showing that the biological control organism, noxious weed, or plant pest of concern does
not exist in the State or political subdivision or, if already present in the State or political subdivision, the distribution of the biological control organism, noxious weed, or plant pest of concern;
(2) If the biological control organism, noxious weed, or plant pest is not present in the State or political subdivision, a risk analysis or other scientific data showing that the biological control organism, noxious weed, or plant pest could enter the State or political subdivision and become established;
(3) Specific information showing that, if introduced into or allowed to spread within the State or political subdivision, the biological control organism, noxious weed, or plant pest would harm or injure the environment or agricultural resources in the State or political subdivision. The request should contain detailed information, including quantitative estimates, if available, about what harm or injury would result from the introduction or dissemination of the biological control organism, noxious weed, or plant pest in the State or political subdivision;
(4) Specific information showing that the State or political subdivision has characteristics that make it particularly vulnerable to the biological control organism, noxious weed, or plant pest, such as unique plants, diversity of flora, historical concerns, or any other special basis for the request for additional restrictions or prohibitions; and
(5) Information detailing the proposed additional prohibitions or restrictions and scientific data demonstrating that the proposed additional prohibitions or restrictions are necessary and adequate, and that there is no less drastic action that is feasible and that would be adequate, to prevent the introduction or spread of the biological control organism, noxious weed, or plant pest in the State or political subdivision.
(b) All special need requests must be submitted to the Deputy Administrator for Plant Protection and Quarantine, APHIS, USDA, Jamie L. Whitten Federal Building, 14th Street and Independence Avenue, SW., Room 301-E, Washington, DC 20250.
§ 301.1-3
Action on special need requests.
(a) Upon receipt of a complete special need request submitted in accordance with § 301.1-2, APHIS will publish a notice in the
Federal Register
to inform the public of the special need request and to make the request and its supporting information available for review and comment for at least 60 days.
(b) Following the close of the comment period, APHIS will publish another notice announcing the Administrator's decision to either grant or deny the special need request. The Administrator's determination will be based upon the evaluation of the information submitted by the State or political subdivision of a State in support of its request and would take into account any comments received.
(1) If the Administrator grants the special need request, the State or political subdivision of a State will be authorized to impose only the specific prohibitions or restrictions identified in the request and approved by APHIS. APHIS will coordinate with the State, or with the State on behalf of the political subdivision of the State, to ensure that the additional prohibitions or restrictions are in accord with the special need exception granted by the Administrator.
(2) If the Administrator denies the special need request, the State or political subdivision of a State will be notified in writing of the reason for the denial and may submit any additional information the State or political subdivision of a State may have in order to request a reconsideration.
(c) If granted, a special need exception will be applicable for 2 years, at the end of which the State or political subdivision of a State must submit a request for renewal of the exception. A special need renewal request must address the same criteria as the initial request submitted under § 301.1-2 and must show that a special need still exists that warrants the continuation of the special need exception. The renewal must be submitted no sooner than 6 months and no later than 3 months prior to the end of the 2-year applicability period for the initial exception. Once a special need renewal
request has been received, APHIS will follow the same notice and comment process outlined in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. If, by the end of the 2-year applicability period, the State or political subdivision of a State does not submit a special need renewal request, the State's or political subdivision's special need exception will lapse and the State or political subdivision of a State will have to reapply for the special need exception.
(d) If the Administrator determines that there is a need for the withdrawal of a special need exception before the renewal date of the special need exception, the reasons for the withdrawal would be communicated to the State or to the political subdivision of the State and APHIS will publish a notice in the
Federal Register
to inform the public of the withdrawal of the special need exception and to make the information supporting the withdrawal available for review and comment for at least 60 days. Reasons for withdrawal of approval of a special need exception may include, but are not limited to, the availability of new scientific data or changes in APHIS regulations. Following the close of the comment period, APHIS will publish another notice announcing the Administrator's decision to either withdraw or uphold the special need exception. The Administrator's determination will be based upon the evaluation of the information submitted in support of the withdrawal and would take into account any comments received.

§ 301.32-2
Regulated articles.
(a)
List of regulated articles.
Certain berries, fruits, nuts, and vegetables are regulated articles for one or more species of fruit fly unless the berries, fruits, nuts, or vegetables are canned, dried, or frozen below −17.8 °C (0 °F). The relevant commodity (both botanical name and common name), as well as the fruit fly species for which it is a regulated article, is found at
www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/planthealth/plant-pest-and-disease-programs/pests-and-diseases/fruit-flies/fruit-flies-home.
(b)
Normal process for adding regulated articles.
(1) If the Administrator determines that an article not already listed at
www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/planthealth/plant-pest-and-disease-programs/pests-and-diseases/fruit-flies/fruit-flies-home
presents a risk of spreading one or more species of fruit flies, APHIS will publish a notice in the
Federal Register
proposing to designate the article as a regulated article for the relevant species of fruit flies. The notice will provide the basis for this determination and will request public comment.
(2) If no comments are received on the notice, or if the comments do not change the Administrator's determination, APHIS will publish a second notice in the
Federal Register
designating the article as a regulated article for the relevant species of fruit flies and listing it.
(c)
Soil and plants as regulated articles.
Soil is a regulated article if it is within the dripline of a regulated article that is listed at
www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/planthealth/plant-pest-and-disease-programs/pests-and-diseases/fruit-flies/fruit-flies-home
and that is annotated with an asterisk. Plants are regulated articles if they are producing or have produced species in the family Cucurbitaceae that are listed at

[88 FR 80003, Dec. 29, 2022]
§ 301.32-3
Quarantined areas.
(a)
Designation of quarantined areas.
In accordance with the criteria listed in paragraph (c) of this section, the Administrator will designate as a quarantined area each State, or each portion of a State, in which a fruit fly population subject to the regulations in this subpart has been found by an inspector, or in which the Administrator
has reason to believe that a fruit fly population is present, or that the Administrator considers necessary to quarantine because of its inseparability for quarantine enforcement purposes from localities in which a fruit fly population has been found. The Administrator will publish the description of the quarantined area on the Plant Protection and Quarantine Web site,
http://www.aphis.usda.gov/plant_health/plant_pest_info/fruit_flies/index.shtml.
The description of the quarantined area will include the date the description was last updated and a description of the changes that have been made to the quarantined area. The description of the quarantined area may also be obtained by request from any local office of PPQ; local offices are listed in telephone directories. After a change is made to the quarantined area, we will publish a notice in the
Federal Register
informing the public that the change has occurred and describing the change to the quarantined area.
(b)
Designation of an area less than an entire State as a quarantined area.
Less than an entire State will be designated as a quarantined area only if the Administrator determines that:
(1) The State has adopted and is enforcing restrictions on the intrastate movement of the regulated articles that are equivalent to those imposed by this subpart on the interstate movement of regulated articles; and
(2) The designation of less than the entire State as a quarantined area will prevent the interstate spread of the fruit fly.
(c)
Criteria for designation of a State, or a portion of a State, as a quarantined area.
A State, or a portion of a State, will be designated as a quarantined area when a fruit fly population has been found in that area by an inspector, when the Administrator has reason to believe that the fruit fly is present in that area, or when the Administrator considers it necessary to quarantine that area because of its inseparability for quarantine enforcement purposes from localities in which the fruit fly has been found.
(d)
Removal of a State, or a portion of a State, from quarantine.
A State, or a portion of a State, will be removed from quarantine when the Administrator determines that sufficient time has passed without finding additional flies or other evidence of infestation in the area to conclude that the fruit fly no longer exists in that area.
§ 301.32-4
Conditions governing the interstate movement of regulated articles from quarantined areas.
Any regulated article may be moved interstate from a quarantined area
1
only if moved under the following conditions:
1
Requirements under all other applicable Federal domestic plant quarantines and regulations must also be met.
(a) With a certificate or limited permit issued and attached in accordance with §§ 301.32-5 and 301.32-8;
(b) Without a certificate or limited permit if:
(1) The regulated article originated outside the quarantined area and is either moved in an enclosed vehicle or is completely enclosed by a covering adequate to prevent access by fruit flies (such as canvas, plastic, or other closely woven cloth) while moving through the quarantined area; and
(2) The point of origin of the regulated article is indicated on the waybill, and the enclosed vehicle or the enclosure that contains the regulated article is not opened, unpacked, or unloaded in the quarantined area; and
(3) The regulated article is moved through the quarantined area without stopping except for refueling or for traffic conditions, such as traffic lights or stop signs.
(c) Without a certificate or limited permit if the regulated article is moved:
(1) By the United States Department of Agriculture for experimental or scientific purposes;
(2) Pursuant to a permit issued by the Administrator for the regulated article;
(3) Under conditions specified on the permit and found by the Administrator to be adequate to prevent the spread of fruit flies; and
(4) With a tag or label bearing the number of the permit issued for the regulated article attached to the outside of the container of the regulated
article or attached to the regulated article itself if not in a container.
(d) Hass avocados that are grown or packed in an area quarantined for Mediterranean, Mexican, or sapote fruit fly and that are moving interstate from such an area are subject to the following additional requirements:
(1)
Orchard sanitation and safeguarding requirements.
(i) Hass avocado fruit that has fallen from the trees may not be included in field boxes of fruit to be packed for shipping.
(ii) Harvested Hass avocados must be placed in field boxes or containers of field boxes that are marked to show the location of the orchard. The avocados must be moved from the orchard to the packinghouse within 3 hours of harvest or they must be protected from fruit fly infestation until moved.
(iii) Hass avocados must be protected from fruit fly infestations during their movement from the orchard to the packinghouse and must be accompanied by a field record indicating the location of the orchard where the avocados originated.
(2)
Packinghouse requirements for Hass avocados packed within a quarantined area.
(i) All openings to the outside of the packinghouse must be covered by screening with openings of not more than 1.6 mm or by some other barrier that prevents insects from entering the packinghouse.
(ii) The packinghouse must have double doors at the entrance to the facility and at the interior entrance to the area where the avocados are packed.
(iii) If the Hass avocados were grown in an orchard within the quarantined area, the identity of the avocados must be maintained from field boxes or containers to the shipping boxes in the packinghouse so that the avocados can be traced back to the orchard in which they were grown. The avocados must be packed in boxes or crates that are clearly marked with the identity of the grower and the packinghouse.
(iv) Any boxes of Hass avocados packed in the quarantined area must be placed in a refrigerated truck or refrigerated container and remain in that truck or container while in transit through the quarantined area.

§ 301.38-3
Protected areas.
(a) The Administrator may designate as a protected area in accordance with paragraph (d)of this section any State that has eradicated rust-susceptible plants of the genera
Berberis, Mahoberberis,
and
Mahonia
under the cooperative Federal-State eradication program. In addition, the State must employ personnel with responsibility for the issuance and withdrawal of certificates in accordance with § 301.38-5, and maintain and enforce an inspection program under which every plant nursery within the State is inspected at least once each year to ensure that they are free of rust-susceptible plants. During the requisite nursery inspections, all nursery stock shall be examined to determine that it consists only of rust-resistant varieties of the genera
Berberis, Mahoberberis,
and
Mahonia,
and that the plants are true to type. Plants that do not meet this criteria must be destroyed.
(b) The Administrator may designate as a protected area any county within a State, rather than the entire State, if areas within the State have eradicated rust-susceptible plants of the genera
Berberis, Mahoberberis,
and
Mahonia
under the cooperative Federal-State program, and;
(1) The State employs personnel with responsibility for the issuance and withdrawal of certificates in accordance with § 301.38-5;
(2) The State is enforcing restrictions on the intrastate movement of the regulated articles that are equivalent to those imposed by this subpart on the interstate movement of regulated articles, as determined by the Administrator; and
(3) The State maintains and enforces an inspection program under which every plant nursery within the county is inspected at least once each year to ensure that plant nurseries within that area are free of rust-susceptible plants of the genera
Berberis, Mahoberberis,
and
Mahonia.
During the requisite nursery inspections, all nursery stock shall be examined to determine that it consists only of rust-resistant varieties of the genera
Berberis, Mahoberberis,
and
Mahonia,
and that the plants are true to type. Plants that do not meet this criteria must be destroyed.
(c) All seed used to propagate plants of the genera
Berberis, Mahoberberis,
and
Mahonia
in protected areas, and all seed used to propagate plants of the genera
Berberis, Mahoberberis,
and
Mahonia
that are certified as rust-resistant for interstate movement into protected areas, must be produced at properties where a State inspector has verified that no wild or domesticated rust-susceptible plants are growing at or within one-half mile of the property.
1
1
Persons performing the inspections must be able to recognize rust-susceptible varieties of
Berberis, Mahoberberis,
and
Mahonia.
Inspectors must work side by side, 10 to 20 feet apart, and walk outward away from the property a distance of one-half mile measured from the edge of the property, and observe all plants growing in the half-mile band. The distance between the inspectors may vary within this range, depending upon the visibility of the plant growth. In areas with low brush and flat terrain, the inspectors may be the maximum distance of 20 feet apart if they can observe all plants growing within 10 feet of them. In areas of high plant growth or hilly terrain, the inspectors must be closer together due to limited or obstructed visibility. Inspectors must observe all plants growing between themselves and
the mid-point of the distance between themselves and the next inspector. This process must be repeated so that the entire band, measured from the border of the property to the circumference of an imaginary circle having the property as its mid-point, is visually inspected in this manner.
(d) The Administrator will publish a list of all protected areas on the Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ) website at
www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/planthealth/plant-pest-and-disease-programs/pests-and-diseases/barberry/ct_barberry.
The list will include the date that the list was last updated. Lists of all protected areas may also be obtained by request from any local PPQ office; local offices are listed in telephone directories and on the internet at
www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/planthealth/ppq-program-overview/sphd.
After a change is made to the list of protected areas in accordance with this section, APHIS will publish a notice in the
Federal Register
informing the public that the change has occurred and describing the change to the protected areas.
(e) Each State that is a protected area or that encompasses a protected area must submit annually to the Administrator a written statement, signed by an inspector, assuring APHIS that all nursery inspections have been performed in accordance with this section. The statement must be submitted by January 1st of each year, and must include a list of the nurseries inspected and found free of rust-susceptible plants.
(f) The Administrator may remove a protected area from the list of designated protected areas at
www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/planthealth/plant-pest-and-disease-programs/pests-and-diseases/barberry/ct_barberry
if he or she determines that it no longer meets the criteria of paragraph (a) or (b)(1) through (3) of this section. A hearing will be held to resolve any conflict as to any material fact. Rules of practice for the hearing shall be adopted by the Administrator.

§ 301.45-2
Authorization to designate and terminate designation of quarantined areas.
(a) Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section, the Administrator will designate as a quarantined area each State or each portion of a State in which a gypsy moth infestation has been found by an inspector, or each portion of a State which the Administrator deems necessary to regulate because of its proximity to infestation or its inseparability for quarantine enforcement purposes from infested localities. The Administrator will publish a list of all quarantined areas on the Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ) website at
www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/planthealth/plant-pest-and-disease-programs/pests-and-diseases/gypsy-moth/ct_gypsy_moth.
The list will include the date that the list was last updated. Lists of all quarantined areas may also be obtained by request from any local PPQ office; local offices are listed in telephone directories and on the internet at
www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/planthealth/ppq-program-overview/sphd.
After a change is made to the list of quarantined areas, APHIS will publish a notice in the
Federal Register
informing the public that the change has occurred and describing the change to the quarantined areas. Notwithstanding the criteria in the preceding sentences, an area will not be listed as a quarantined area if the Administrator determines that:
(1) The area is subject to a gypsy moth eradication program conducted by the Federal Government or a State government in accordance with the Eradication, Suppression, and Slow the Spread alternative of the Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) on Gypsy Moth Suppression and Eradication Projects that was filed with the United States Environmental Protection Agency on January 16, 1996; and
(2) State or Federal delimiting trapping surveys conducted in accordance with Section II, “Survey Procedures—Gypsy Moth” of the Gypsy Moth Treatment Manual show that the average number of gypsy moths caught per trap is less than 10 and that the trapping surveys show that the eradication program is effectively diminishing the gypsy moth population of the area.
(b) Less than an entire State will be designated as a quarantined area only if the Administrator has determined that:
(1) The State has adopted and is enforcing a quarantine or regulation which imposes restrictions on the intrastate movement of the regulated articles which are substantially the same as those which are imposed with respect to the interstate movement of such articles under this subpart; and,
(2) The designation of less than the entire State as a quarantined area will be adequate to prevent the artificial interstate spread of infestations of the gypsy moth.
(c) Temporary designation of areas as quarantined areas. The Administrator or an inspector may temporarily designate any area in any State as a quarantined area in accordance with the criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section. An inspector will give written notice of the designation to the owner or person in possession of the area and thereafter, the interstate movement of any regulated article from such areas is subject to the applicable provisions of this subpart. As soon as practicable, each quarantined area will be added to the list at
www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/planthealth/plant-pest-and-disease-programs/pests-and-diseases/gypsy-moth/ct_gypsy_moth
or the designation will be terminated by the Administrator or an authorized inspector, and notice thereof shall be given to the owner or person in possession of the areas.
(d) Termination of designation as a quarantined area. The Administrator shall terminate the designation of any area as a quarantined area whenever the Administrator determines that the area no longer requires designation under the criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section. APHIS will publish a notice in the
Federal Register
informing the public that the change has occurred.

§ 301.48-2
Authorization to designate, and terminate designation of, regulated airports.
(a) An inspector may declare any airport within a quarantined State to be a regulated airport when he or she determines that adult populations of Japanese beetle exist during daylight hours at the airport to the degree that aircraft constitute a threat to spread the Japanese beetle and aircraft destined for the States listed in § 301.48(b) may be leaving the airport.
(b) An inspector shall terminate the designation provided for under paragraph (a) of this section when he or she determines that adult populations of Japanese beetle no longer exist at the airport to the degree that the aircraft pose a threat to spread the Japanese beetle.

§ 301.48-4
Conditions governing the interstate movement of regulated articles from quarantined States.
A regulated article may be moved interstate from a regulated airport to any State
1
designated in § 301.48(b) only if:
1
Requirements under all other applicable Federal domestic plant quarantines must be met.
(a) An inspector, upon visual inspection of the airport and/or the aircraft, determines that the regulated article does not present a threat to spread the Japanese beetle because adult beetle populations are not present; or
(b) The aircraft is opened and loaded only while it is enclosed inside a hangar that an inspector has determined to be free of and safeguarded against Japanese beetle; or
(c) The aircraft is loaded during the hours of 8:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. only or lands and departs during those hours and, in either situation, is kept completely closed while on the ground during the hours of 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m.; or
(d) If opened and loaded between the hours of 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m., the aircraft is inspected, treated, and safeguarded. Inspection, treatment, and safeguarding must be done either under a compliance agreement in accordance with § 301.48-8 or under the direct supervision of an inspector. On a case-by-case basis, inspectors will determine which of the following conditions, and any supplemental conditions deemed necessary by the Administrator to prevent the spread of Japanese beetle, are required:
(1) All openings of the aircraft must be closed or safeguarded during the hours of 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. by exclusionary devices or by other means approved by the Administrator.
(2) All cargo containers that have not been safeguarded in a protected area must be inspected immediately prior to and during the loading process. All personnel must check their clothing immediately prior to entering the aircraft. All Japanese beetles found must be removed and destroyed.
(3) All areas around doors and hatches or other openings in the aircraft must be inspected prior to removing the exclusionary devices. All Japanese beetles found must be removed and destroyed. All doors and hatches must be closed immediately after the exclusionary devices are moved away from the aircraft.
(4) Aircraft must be treated in accordance with part 305 of this chapter no more than 1 hour before loading. Particular attention should be paid to the ball mat area and the holes around the main entrance. The aircraft must then be aerated under safeguard conditions as required by part 305 of this chapter.
(5) Aircraft treatment records must be maintained by the applicator completing or supervising the treatment for a period of 2 years. These records must be provided upon request for review by an inspector. Treatment records shall include the pesticide used, the date of application, the location where the pesticide was applied (airport and aircraft), the amount of pesticide applied, and the name of the applicator.
(6) When a designated aircraft is replaced with an alternate one just prior to departure (the procedure known as “tail swapping”), the alternate aircraft must be inspected and all Japanese beetles must be removed. The aircraft must be safeguarded by closing all openings and hatches or by equipping the aircraft with exclusionary devices until the aircraft is ready for use. During loading, all treatment and safeguard requirements applicable to regularly scheduled aircraft must be implemented.
(7) Aircraft may be retreated in the noninfested State if live Japanese beetles are found.
(8) Notification of unscheduled commercial flights and of all military flights must be given at least 1 hour before departure to the appropriate person in the destination airport of any
of the States listed in § 301.48(b). Notification of arriving military flights should also be given to base commanders to facilitate the entrance of Federal and/or State inspectors onto the base if necessary.

Owners of fruit tree nurseries who meet the eligibility requirements of paragraph (a)(2) of this section will be compensated for up to 85 percent of the net revenues lost from their first and second year crops as the result of the issuance of an emergency action notification which will be calculated as follows:
(i)
First year crop.
The net revenue loss for trees that were expected to be sold in the year during which the emergency action notification was issued (
i.e.,
the first year crop) will be calculated as (
expected number of trees to be sold
) × (
average price per tree
) − (
digging, grading, and storage costs
) = net revenue lost for first year crop, where:
(A) The expected number of trees to be sold equals the number of trees in the field minus 2 percent culls minus 3 percent unsold trees; and
(B) The average price per tree is $5.22 for plum and apricot trees and $3.69 for peach and nectarine trees; and
(C) Digging, grading and storage costs are $0.10 per tree.
(ii)
Second year crop.
The net revenue loss for trees that would be expected to be sold in the year following the year during which the emergency action notification was issued (

or citrus greening, APHIS will publish a notice in the
Federal Register
proposing to designate the article as a regulated article for either or both of these pests. The notice will provide the basis for this determination, and will request public comment.
(2) If no comments are received on the notice, or if the comments do not change the Administrator's determination, APHIS will publish a second notice in the
Federal Register
designating the article as a regulated article and listing it.
(c)
Immediate designation of regulated articles.
An inspector may designate any other product, article, or means of conveyance as a regulated article for Asian citrus psyllid and/or citrus greening, if the inspector determines that it presents a risk of spreading these pests, and after the inspector provides written notification to the person in possession of the product, article, or means of conveyance that it is subject to the restrictions of this subpart.
(d)
Exemption after certain methods of processing.
The Administrator may determine that certain methods of processing render regulated articles such that they no longer present a risk of spreading Asian citrus psyllid or citrus greening. Such methods are found at
www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/planthealth/plant-pest-and-disease-programs/pests-and-diseases/citrus.
Articles processed in such a manner are exempt from the regulations in this subpart.

§ 301.80-2
Authorization to designate, and terminate designation of, regulated areas and suppressive or generally infested areas; and to exempt articles from certification, permit, or other requirements.
(a)
List of regulated areas and suppressive or generally infested areas.
The Deputy Administrator will list as a regulated area each quarantined State, or portion of a State, in which witchweed has been found or in which there is reason to believe that witchweed is present or which it is deemed necessary to regulate because of its proximity to infestation or its inseparability for quarantine enforcement purposes from infested localities. The Deputy Administrator may divide any regulated area into a suppressive area and generally infested area in accordance with definitions of these terms in § 301.80-1. The Deputy Administrator will publish a list of all regulated areas (the regulated areas list) on the PPQ website at
www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/planthealth/plant-pest-and-disease-programs/pests-and-diseases/SA_Weeds/SA_Noxious_Weeds_Program
. The list will include the date that the list was last updated. Lists of all regulated areas may also be obtained by request from any local PPQ office; local offices are listed in telephone directories and on the internet at
www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/planthealth/ppq-program-overview/sphd
. After a change is made to the list of regulated areas, APHIS will publish a notice in the
Federal Register
informing the public that the change has occurred and describing the change to the regulated areas. Less than an entire quarantined State will be designated as a regulated area only if the Deputy Administrator determines that:
(1) The State has adopted and is enforcing a quarantine which imposes restrictions on the intrastate movement of the regulated articles which are substantially the same as those which are imposed with respect to the interstate movement of such articles under this subpart; and
(2) The designation of less than the entire State as a regulated area will otherwise be adequate to prevent the interstate spread of witchweed.
(b)
Temporary designation of regulated areas and suppressive or generally infested areas.
The Deputy Administrator or an authorized inspector may temporarily designate any other premises in a quarantined State as a regulated area and may designate the regulated area or portions thereof as a suppressive or generally infested area, in accordance with the criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section for designating such area, by serving written notice thereof on the owner or person in possession of such premises, and thereafter the interstate movement of regulated articles from such premises by any person having notice of the designation shall be subject to the applicable provisions of this subpart. As soon as practicable, such premises shall be added to the regulated areas list.
(c)
Termination of designation as a regulated area and a suppressive or generally infested area.
The Deputy Administrator shall terminate the designation provided for under paragraph (a) of this section of any area designated as a regulated area, or a suppressive or a generally infested area within a regulated area, when the Deputy Administrator determines that such designation is no longer required under the criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section. Notification of this change in the list of regulated areas, or suppressive or generally infested areas within a regulated area, will be made in accordance with the process set forth in paragraph (a) of this section. The Deputy Administrator or an inspector shall terminate the designation provided for under paragraph (b) of this section of any premises designated as a regulated area or a suppressive or a generally infested area when the Deputy Administrator determines that such designation is no longer required under the criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section, and notice thereof shall be given to the owner or person in possession of the premises.
(d)
Exemption of articles from certification, permit, or other requirements.
The Deputy Administrator may determine that a regulated article has been produced, processed, cleaned, or otherwise handled in a manner that is sufficient to allow the article to move interstate without hazard of spread of witchweed,
provided that the article is not exposed to infestation after production, processing, cleaning, or other handling. The Deputy Administrator may also determine that a regulated article's intended use is such that it may be moved interstate without hazard of spread of witchweed. Such articles are exempt from the restrictions of this subpart. The list of regulated articles at
www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/planthealth/plant-pest-and-disease-programs/pests-and-diseases/SA_Weeds/SA_Noxious_Weeds_Program
is annotated to indicate the exemptions under this subpart.

§ 301.80-4
Issuance and cancellation of certificates and permits.
(a) Certificates may be issued for any regulated articles (except soil samples for processing, testing, or analysis) by an inspector if he determines that they are eligible for certification for movement to any destination under all Federal domestic plant quarantines applicable to such articles and:
(1) Have originated in noninfested premises in a regulated area and have not been exposed to infestation while within the regulated areas; or
(2) Have been treated to destroy infestation in accordance with the treatment manual; or
(3) Have been grown, produced, manufactured, stored, or handled in such a manner that no infestation would be transmitted thereby.
(b) Limited permits may be issued by an inspector to allow interstate movement of regulated articles (except soil samples for processing, testing, or analysis) not eligible for certification under this subpart, to specified destinations for limited handling, utilization, or processing, or for treatment in accordance with the treatment manual, when upon evaluation of the circumstances involved in each specific case he determines that such movement will not result in the spread of witchweed and requirements of other applicable Federal domestic plant quarantines have been met.
(c) Restricted destination permits may be issued by an inspector to allow the interstate movement (for other than scientific purposes) of regulated articles (except soil samples for processing, testing, or analysis) to any destination permitted under all applicable Federal domestic plant quarantines if such articles are not eligible for certification under all such quarantines but would otherwise qualify for certification under this subpart.
(d) Scientific permits to allow the interstate movement of regulated articles, and certificates or permits to allow the movement of soil samples for processing, testing, or analysis in emergency situations, may be issued by the Deputy Administrator under such conditions as may be prescribed in each specific case by the Deputy Administrator to prevent the spread of witchweed.
(e) Certificate, limited permit, and restricted destination permit forms may be issued by an inspector to any person for use by the latter for subsequent shipments of regulated articles (except soil samples for processing, testing, or analysis) provided such person is operating under a compliance agreement; and any such person may be authorized by an inspector to reproduce such forms on shipping containers or otherwise. Any such person may execute and issue the certificate forms, or reproductions of such forms, for the interstate movement of regulated articles from the premises of such person identified in the compliance agreement if such person has treated such regulated articles to destroy infestation in accordance with the treatment manual, and if such regulated articles are eligible for certification for movement to any destination under all Federal domestic plant quarantines applicable to such articles. Any such person may execute and issue the limited permit forms, or reproductions of such forms, for interstate movement of regulated articles to specified destinations when the inspector has made the determinations specified in paragraph (b) of this section.

[87 FR 80012, Dec. 29, 2022]
§ 301.81-3
Quarantined areas.
(a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the Administrator will list as a quarantined area each State or portion of a State determined to be infested with the imported fire ant. The Administrator will also list as a quarantined area an area that is uninfested but determined to be in proximity to an infestation or that is determined to be inseparable from an infested locality for quarantine purposes; such a determination will be based on projections of spread of imported fire ant around the periphery of the infestation, as determined by previous years' surveys; availability of natural habitats and host materials, within the uninfested acreage, suitable for establishment and survival of imported fire ant populations; and the necessity of including uninfested acreage within the quarantined area in order to establish readily identifiable boundaries. The Administrator will publish a list of all quarantined areas (the quarantine list) on the PPQ website at
www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/planthealth/plant-pest-and-disease-programs/pests-and-diseases/imported-fire-ants/ct_imported_fire_ants

www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/planthealth/ppq-program-overview/sphd
. After a change is made to the list of quarantined areas, APHIS will publish a notice in the
Federal Register
informing the public that the change has occurred and describing the change to the quarantined areas. Less than an entire State will be designated as a quarantined area only if the Administrator determines that:
(1) The State has adopted and is enforcing restrictions on the intrastate movement of the regulated articles that are equivalent to the interstate movement restrictions imposed by this subpart; and
(2) Designating less than the entire State as a quarantined area will prevent the spread of the imported fire ant.
(b) The Administrator or an inspector may temporarily designate any nonquarantined area as a quarantined area in accordance with the criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section. The Administrator will give written notice of this designation to the owner or person in possession of the nonquarantined area, or, in the case of publicly owned land, to the person responsible for the management of the nonquarantined area; thereafter, the interstate movement of any regulated article from an area temporarily designated as a quarantined area is subject to this subpart. As soon as practicable, this area either will be added to the quarantine list, or the Administrator will terminate the designation. The owner or person in possession of, or, in the case of publicly owned land, the person responsible for the management of, an area for which the designation is terminated will be given written
notice of the termination as soon as practicable.

§ 301.81-11
Imported fire ant detection, control, exclusion, and enforcement program for nurseries producing containerized plants.
This detection, control, exclusion, and enforcement program is designed to keep nurseries free of the imported fire ant and provides a basis to certify containerized nursery stock for interstate movement. Participating regulated establishments must be operating under a compliance agreement in accordance with § 301.81-6. Such compliance agreements shall state the specific requirements that a shipper agrees to follow to move plants in accordance with the requirements of the program. Certificates and a nursery identification number may be issued to the nursery for use on shipments of regulated articles.
(a)
Detection.
(1) Nursery owners are required to visually survey their entire premises twice monthly for the presence of imported fire ants.
(2) Nurseries participating in this program will be inspected by Federal or State inspectors at least twice per year. More frequent inspections may be necessary depending upon imported fire ant infestation levels immediately surrounding the nursery, the thoroughness of nursery management in maintaining imported-fire-ant-free premises, and the number of previous detections of imported fire ants in or near containerized plants. Inspections by Federal and State inspectors should be more frequent just before and during the peak shipping season. Any nurseries determined during nursery inspections to have imported fire ant colonies must be immediately treated to the extent necessary to eliminate the colonies.
(b)
Control.
Nursery plants that are shipped under this program must originate in a nursery that meets the requirements of this section. Nursery owners must implement a treatment program with registered bait and contact insecticides. The premises, including growing and holding areas, must be maintained free of the imported fire ant. As part of this treatment program, all exposed soil surfaces (including sod
and mulched areas) on property where plants are grown, potted, stored, handled, loaded, unloaded, or sold must be treated in accordance with part 305 of this chapter at least once every 6 months. The first application must be performed early in the spring. Followup treatments with a contact insecticide in accordance with part 305 of this chapter must be applied to eliminate all remaining colonies.
(c)
Exclusion.
(1) For plants grown on the premises, treatment of soil or potting media in accordance with part 305 of this chapter prior to planting is required.
(2) For plants received from outside sources, to prevent the spread into a nursery free of the imported fire ant by newly introduced, infested nursery plants, all plants must be:
(i) Obtained from nurseries that comply with the requirements of this section and that operate under a compliance agreement in accordance with § 301.81-6; or
(ii) Treated upon delivery in accordance with part 305 of this chapter, and within the specified number of days be either:
(A) Repotted in treated potting soil media;
(B) Retreated in accordance with part 305 of this chapter at the specified interval; or
(C) Shipped.
(d)
Enforcement.
(1) The nursery owner must maintain records of the nursery's surveys and treatments for the imported fire ant. These records must be made available to State and Federal inspectors upon request.
(2) If imported fire ants are detected in nursery stock during an inspection by a Federal or State inspector, issuance of certificates for movement will be suspended until necessary treatments are applied and the plants and nursery premises are determined to be free of the imported fire ant. A Federal or State inspector may declare a nursery to be free of the imported fire ant upon reinspection of the premises. This inspection must be conducted no sooner than 30 days after treatment. During this period, certification may be based upon treatments for plants in accordance with part 305 of this chapter.
(3) Upon notification by the department of agriculture in any State of destination that a confirmed imported fire ant infestation was found on a shipment from a nursery considered free of the imported fire ant, the department of agriculture in the State of origin must cease its certification of shipments from that nursery. An investigation by Federal or State inspectors will commence immediately to determine the probable source of the problem and to ensure that the problem is resolved. If the problem is an infestation, issuance of certification for movement on the basis of imported-fire-ant-free premises will be suspended until treatment and elimination of the infestation is completed. Reinstatement into the program will be granted upon determination that the nursery premises are free of the imported fire ant, and that all other provisions of this subpart are being followed.
(4) In cases where the issuance of certificates is suspended through oral notification, the suspension and the reasons for the suspension will be confirmed in writing within 20 days of the oral notification of the suspension. Any person whose issuance of certificates has been suspended may appeal the decision, in writing, within 10 days after receiving the written suspension notice. The appeal must state all of the facts and reasons that the person wants the Administrator to consider in deciding the appeal. A hearing may be held to resolve any conflict as to any material fact. Rules of practice for the hearing will be adopted by the Administrator. As soon as practicable, the Administrator will grant or deny the appeal, in writing, stating the reasons for the decision.

§ 301.85-2
Authorization for the Deputy Administrator to list regulated areas and suppressive or generally infested areas.
(a)
Criteria for designation and process for listing.
The Deputy Administrator will list as a regulated area each State or portion of a State in which golden nematode has been determined to be found or in which there is reason to believe that golden nematode is present, or which it is deemed necessary to regulate because of their proximity to infestation or their inseparability for quarantine enforcement purposes from infested localities. The Deputy Administrator may divide any regulated area into a suppressive area and a generally
infested area in accordance with the definitions of these terms in § 301.85-1. The Deputy Administrator will publish a list of all regulated areas, including the suppressive and generally infested areas therein, at
www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/planthealth/plant-pest-and-disease-programs/pests-and-diseases/golden-nematode/nematodes
. The list will include the date that the list was last updated. Lists of all regulated areas, including the suppressive and generally infested areas therein, may also be obtained by request from any local Plant Protection and Quarantine office; local offices are listed in telephone directories and on the internet at
www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/planthealth/ppq-program-overview/sphd
. After a change is made to the list of regulated areas, APHIS will publish a notice in the
Federal Register
informing the public that the change has occurred and describing the change to the regulated areas. Less than an entire State will be designated as a regulated area only if the Deputy Administrator determines that:
(1) The State has adopted and is enforcing restrictions on the intrastate movement of regulated articles that are equivalent to those imposed by this subpart on the interstate movement of regulated articles; and
(2) The designation of less than an entire State as a regulated area will be adequate to prevent the interstate spread of golden nematodes.
(b)
Temporary designation of regulated areas and suppressive or generally infested
areas.
The Deputy Administrator or an authorized inspector may temporarily designate any other premises in a quarantined State as a regulated area and a suppressive or generally infested area, in accordance with the criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section for listing such area, by serving written notice thereof on the owner or person in possession of such premises, and thereafter the interstate movement of regulated articles from such premises by any person having notice of the designation shall be subject to the applicable provisions of this subpart. As soon as practicable, such premises shall be added to the list of regulated areas if a basis then exists for their designation; otherwise the designation shall be terminated by the Deputy Administrator or an authorized inspector and notice thereof shall be given to the owner or person in possession of the premises.
(c)
Termination of designation as a regulated area and a suppressive or generally
infested area.
The Deputy Administrator shall terminate the designation provided for under paragraph (a) of this section of any area listed as a regulated area and suppressive or generally infested area when he or she determines that such designation is no longer required under the criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section.
(d)
Exemption of articles from certification, permit, or other requirements.
The Deputy Administrator may determine that a regulated article has been produced, processed, cleaned, or otherwise handled in a manner that is sufficient to allow the article to move interstate without hazard of spread of golden nematodes, provided that the article is not exposed to infestation after production, processing, cleaning, or other handling. The Deputy Administrator may also determine that a regulated article's intended use is such that it may be moved interstate without hazard of spread of golden nematodes. Such articles are exempt from the restrictions of this subpart. The list of regulated articles at
www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/planthealth/plant-pest-and-disease-programs/pests-and-diseases/golden-nematode/nematodes

§ 301.86-3
Quarantined areas.
(a)
Designation of quarantined areas.
In accordance with the criteria listed in paragraph (c) of this section, the Administrator will designate as a quarantined area each field that has been found to be infested with pale cyst nematode, each field that has been found to be associated with an infested field, and any area that the Administrator considers necessary to quarantine because of its inseparability for quarantine enforcement purposes from infested or associated fields. The Administrator will publish the description of the quarantined area on the Plant Protection and Quarantine Web site,
https://www.aphis.usda.gov/planthealth/pcn”
.The description of the quarantined area will include the date the description was last updated and a description of the changes that have been made to the quarantined area. The description of the quarantined area may also be obtained by request from any local office of PPQ; local offices are listed in telephone directories. After a change is made to the quarantined area, we will publish a notice in the
Federal Register
informing the public that the change has occurred and describing the change to the quarantined area.
(b)
Designation of an area less than an entire State as a quarantined area.
Less than an entire State will be designated as a quarantined area only if the Administrator determines that:
(1) The State has adopted and is enforcing restrictions on the intrastate movement of the regulated articles that are equivalent to those imposed by this subpart on the interstate movement of regulated articles; and
(2) The designation of less than the entire State as a quarantined area will prevent the interstate spread of the pale cyst nematode.
(c)
Criteria for designation of fields as infested fields and associated fields.
(1)
Infested fields.
A field will be designated as an infested field for pale cyst nematode upon a determination that viable pale cyst nematode is present in the field. The determination will be made in accordance with the criteria established by the Administrator for the designation of infested fields. The criteria are presented in a protocol document that may be viewed at
https://www.aphis.usda.gov/planthealth/pcn.
The protocol may also be obtained by request from any local office of Plant Protection and Quarantine; local offices are listed in telephone directories. Any substantive changes we propose to make to the protocol will be published for comment in the
Federal Register.
After we review the comments received, we will publish another notice in the
Federal Register
informing the public of any changes to the protocol.
(2)
Associated fields.
The Administrator will designate a field as an associated field when pale cyst nematode host crops, as listed in § 301.86-2(b), have been grown in the field in the last 10 years and
(i) The field shares a border with an infested field; or
(ii) The field came into contact with a regulated article listed in § 301.86-2 from an infested field within the last 10 years; or
(iii) Within the last 10 years, the field shared ownership, tenancy, seed, drainage or runoff, farm machinery, or other elements of shared cultural practices with an infested field that could allow spread of the pale cyst nematode, as determined by the Administrator.
(d)
Removal of fields from quarantine. (1) Infested fields.
An infested field will be removed from quarantine for pale cyst nematode upon a determination that no viable pale cyst nematode is detected in the field. The determination will be made in accordance with criteria established by the Administrator and sufficient to support removal of infested fields from quarantine. The criteria are presented in a
protocol document as provided in paragraph (d)(4) of this section along with information for viewing the protocol.
(2)
Associated fields.
An associated field will be removed from quarantine for pale cyst nematode once surveys are completed and pale cyst nematode is not detected in the field. The determination will be made in accordance with criteria established by the Administrator and sufficient to support removal of associated fields from quarantine. The criteria are presented in a protocol document as provided in paragraph (d)(4) of this section along with information for viewing the protocol.
(3)
Removal of other areas from quarantine.
If the Administrator has quarantined any area other than infested or associated fields because of its inseparability for quarantine enforcement purposes from infested or associated fields, as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, that area will be removed from quarantine when the relevant infested or associated fields are removed from quarantine.
(4)
Protocol for removal of fields from quarantine.
The Administrator will remove infested and associated fields, and other areas as provided in this section, from quarantine for pale cyst nematode in accordance with the protocols published on the Plant Protection and Quarantine website at

§ 301.87-2
Regulated articles.
(a)
List of regulated articles.
The Deputy Administrator has determined that certain articles present a risk of spread of sugarcane diseases. A list of all such articles is found on the internet at
www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/planthealth/plant-pest-and-disease-programs/pests-and-diseases/plant-disease/sugarcane
. Lists of all regulated articles may also be obtained by request from any local Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ) office; local offices are listed in telephone directories and on the internet at
www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/planthealth/ppq-program-overview/sphd
.
(b)
Normal process for designating additional regulated articles.
(1) If the Deputy Administrator determines that an article not already listed at
www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/planthealth/plant-pest-and-disease-programs/pests-and-diseases/plant-disease/sugarcane
presents a risk of spread of sugarcane diseases, APHIS will publish a notice in the
Federal Register
proposing to designate the article as a regulated article for sugarcane diseases. The notice will provide the basis for this determination, and will request public comment.
(2) If no comments are received on the notice, or if the comments do not change the Deputy Administrator's determination, APHIS will publish a second notice in the
Federal Register
designating the article as a regulated article for sugarcane diseases and listing it.
(c)
Immediate designation of regulated articles.
Any other article, product, or means of conveyance not already listed in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section may be designated a regulated article on an immediate basis if an inspector determines that it presents a risk of spread of sugarcane diseases and provides actual notification to the person in possession of the article, product, or means of conveyance that it is now subject to the restrictions of this subpart.

§ 301.89-2
Regulated articles.
(a)
List of regulated articles.
The Administrator has determined that certain articles present a risk of spreading
Karnal bunt. A list of all such articles is found on the internet at
www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/planthealth/plant-pest-and-disease-programs/pests-and-diseases/karnal-bunt/ct_karnal_bunt
. Lists of all regulated articles may also be obtained by request from any local Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ) office; local offices are listed in telephone directories and on the internet at
www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/planthealth/ppq-program-overview/sphd
.
(b)
Normal process for designating additional regulated articles.
(1) If the Administrator determines that an article not already listed presents a risk of spreading Karnal bunt, APHIS will publish a notice in the
Federal Register
proposing to designate the article as a regulated article for Karnal bunt. The notice will provide the basis for this determination, and will request public comment.
(2) If no comments are received on the notice, or if the comments do not change the Administrator's determination, APHIS will publish a second notice in the
Federal Register
designating the article as a regulated article for Karnal bunt and listing it.
(c)
Immediate designation of regulated articles.
Any other article, product, or means of conveyance not already listed in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section may be designated a regulated article on an immediate basis if an inspector determines that it presents a risk of spreading Karnal bunt, and notifies the person in possession of the article, product, or means of conveyance that it is now subject to the restrictions of this subpart.
[87 FR 80016, Dec. 29, 2022]
§ 301.89-3
Regulated areas.
(a)
Designation.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the Administrator will list as a regulated area each State or portion of a State if it is determined to be infected with Karnal bunt or if it is in proximity to an infestation or inseparable from the infected locality for regulatory purposes based on the following: Projections of the spread of Karnal bunt along the periphery of the infestation, the availability of natural habitats and host materials within the noninfected acreage that are suitable for establishment and survival of Karnal bunt, and the necessity of including uninfected acreage within the regulated area in order to establish readily identifiable boundaries. The Administrator will publish a list of all regulated areas (the regulated areas list) on the PPQ website at
www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/planthealth/plant-pest-and-disease-programs/pests-and-diseases/karnal-bunt/ct_karnal_bunt
. The list will include the date that the list was last updated. Lists of all regulated areas may also be obtained by request from any local PPQ office; local offices are listed in telephone directors and on the internet at
www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/planthealth/ppq-program-overview/sphd
. After a change is made to the list of regulated areas, APHIS will publish a notice in the
Federal Register
informing the public that the change has occurred and describing the change to regulated areas.
(b)
Designation of less than an entire State as a regulated area.
Less than an entire State will be designated as a regulated area only if the Administrator:
(1)(i) Determines that the State has adopted and is enforcing restrictions on the intrastate movement of the regulated articles that are equivalent to the movement restrictions imposed by this subpart; and
(ii) Determines that designating less than the entire State as a regulated area will prevent the spread of Karnal bunt; or
(2) Exercises his or her extraordinary emergency authority under 7 U.S.C. 7715.
(c)
Temporary designation of regulated areas.
The Administrator or an inspector may temporarily designate any nonregulated area as a regulated area in accordance with the criteria specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section. The Administrator will give written notice of this designation to the owner or person in possession of the nonregulated area, or, in the case of publicly owned land, to the person responsible for the management of the nonregulated area. Thereafter, the movement of any regulated article from an area temporarily designated as
a regulated area is subject to this subpart. As soon as practicable, this area either will be added to the regulated areas list, or the Administrator will terminate the designation. The owner or person in possession of, or, in the case of publicly owned land, the person responsible for the management of, an area for which the designation is terminated will be given written notice of the termination as soon as practicable.
(d)
Regulated fields.
The Administrator will classify a field or area as a regulated area when:
(1) It is a field planted with seed from a lot found to contain a bunted wheat kernel; or
(2) It is a distinct definable area that contains at least one field that was found during survey to contain a bunted wheat kernel (the distinct definable area may include an area where Karnal bunt is not known to exist but where intensive surveys are required because of the area's proximity to a field found during survey to contain a bunted kernel); or
(3) It is a distinct definable area that contains at least one field that has been determined to be associated with grain at a handling facility containing a bunted kernel of a host crop (the distinct definable area may include an area where Karnal bunt is not known to exist but where intensive surveys are required because of the area's proximity to the field associated with the bunted kernel at the handling facility).
(e)
Release from regulation.
A field known to have been infected with Karnal bunt, as well as any non-infected acreage surrounding the field, will be released from regulation if:
(1) The field has been permanently removed from crop production; or
(2) The field is tilled at least once per year for a total of 5 years (the years need not be consecutive). After tilling, the field may be planted with a crop or left fallow. If the field is planted with a host crop, the crop must test negative, through the absence of bunted kernels, for Karnal bunt.
[87 FR 80016, Dec. 29, 2022]
§ 301.89-4
Planting.
Any wheat, durum wheat, or triticale that originates within a regulated area must be tested and found free from bunted wheat kernels and spores before it may be used as seed within or outside a regulated area.
[69 FR 8096, Feb. 23, 2004]
§ 301.89-5
Movement of regulated articles from regulated areas.
(a) Any regulated article may be moved from a regulated area into or through an area that is not regulated only if moved under the following conditions:

(iv) The article has not been combined or commingled with other articles so as to lose its individual identity;
(b) When an inspector has probable cause to believe a person or means of conveyance is moving a regulated article, the inspector is authorized to stop the person or means of conveyance to determine whether a regulated article is present and to inspect the regulated article. Articles found to be infected by an inspector, and articles not in compliance with the regulations in this subpart, may be seized, quarantined, treated, subjected to other remedial measures, destroyed, or otherwise disposed of. Any treatments will be in accordance with part 305 of this chapter.

Growers, handlers, and seed companies are eligible to receive compensation from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) for the 1999-2000 and subsequent crop seasons to mitigate losses or expenses incurred because of the Karnal bunt regulations and emergency actions, as follows:
(a)
Growers, handlers, and seed companies in areas under first regulated crop season.
Growers, handlers, and seed companies are eligible to receive compensation for the loss in value of their wheat in accordance with paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section if: The wheat was grown in a State where the Secretary has declared an extraordinary emergency; and the wheat was grown in an area of that State that became regulated for Karnal bunt after the crop was planted, or for which an Emergency Action Notification (PPQ Form 523) was issued after the crop was planted; and the wheat was grown in an area that remained regulated or under Emergency Action Notification at the time the wheat was sold. Growers and handlers of wheat grown in Oklahoma during the 2000-2001 growing season are eligible to receive compensation if the wheat was commingled in storage with wheat that meets the above requirements of this paragraph. Growers, handlers, and seed companies in areas under the first regulated crop season are eligible for compensation for 1999-2000 or subsequent crop season wheat and for wheat inventories in their possession that were unsold at the time the area became regulated. The compensation provided in this paragraph is for wheat grain, certified wheat seed, wheat held back from harvest by a grower in the 2000-2001 growing season for use as seed in the next growing season, and wheat grown with the intention of producing certified wheat seed.
(1)
Growers.
Growers of wheat in an area under the first regulated crop season, who sell wheat that was tested by APHIS and found positive for Karnal bunt prior to sale, or that was tested by APHIS and found positive for
Karnal bunt after sale and the price received by the grower is contingent on the test results, are eligible to receive compensation as described in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (a)(1)(ii) of this section. However, compensation for positive-testing wheat will not exceed $1.80 per bushel under any circumstances.
(i) If the wheat was grown under contract and a price was determined in the contract before the area where the wheat was grown became regulated, compensation will equal the contract price minus the actual price received by the grower.
(ii) If the wheat was not grown under contract or a price was determined in the contract after the area where the wheat was grown became regulated, compensation will equal the estimated market price for the relevant class of wheat (meaning type of wheat, such as durum or hard red winter) minus the actual price received by the grower. The estimated market price will be calculated by APHIS for each class of wheat, taking into account the prices offered by relevant terminal markets (animal feed, milling, or export) during the harvest months for the area, with adjustments for transportation and other handling costs. Separate estimated market prices will be calculated for certified wheat seed and wheat grown with the intention of producing certified wheat seed, and wheat grain.
(2)
Handlers and seed companies.
Handlers and seed companies who sell wheat grown in an area under the first regulated crop season are eligible to receive compensation only if the wheat was not tested by APHIS prior to purchase by the handler or seed company, but was tested by APHIS and found positive for Karnal bunt after purchase by the handler or seed company, as long as the price to be paid is not contingent on the test results. Compensation will equal the estimated market price for the relevant class of wheat (meaning type of wheat, such as durum or hard red winter) minus the actual price received by the handler or seed company. The estimated market price will be calculated by APHIS for each class of wheat, taking into account the prices offered by relevant terminal markets (animal feed, milling, or export) during the harvest months for the area, with adjustments for transportation and other handling costs. Separate estimated market prices will be calculated for certified wheat seed and wheat grown with the intention of producing certified wheat seed, and wheat grain. However, compensation will not exceed $1.80 per bushel under any circumstances.
(b)
Growers, handlers, and seed companies in previously regulated areas.
For the 1999-2000 crop season and the 2000-2001 crop season only, growers, handlers, and seed companies are eligible to receive compensation for the loss in value of their wheat in accordance with paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section if: The wheat was grown in a State where the Secretary has declared an extraordinary emergency; and the wheat was grown in an area of that State that became regulated for Karnal bunt before the crop was planted, or for which an Emergency Action Notification (PPQ Form 523) was issued before the crop was planted; and the wheat was grown in an area that remained regulated or under Emergency Action Notification at the time the wheat was sold. Growers, handlers, and seed companies in previously regulated areas will not be eligible for compensation for wheat from the 2001-2002 and subsequent crop seasons; except that, for growers or handlers of wheat harvested in any field in the Texas counties of Archer, Baylor, Throckmorton, and Young during the 2000-2001 crop season that has not been found to contain a bunted wheat kernel, this requirement applies to compensation for wheat from the 2002-2003 and subsequent crop seasons. The compensation provided in this paragraph is for wheat grain, certified wheat seed, and wheat grown with the intention of producing certified wheat seed.
(1)
Growers.
Growers of wheat in a previously regulated area who sell wheat that was tested by APHIS and found positive for Karnal bunt prior to sale, or that was tested by APHIS and found positive for Karnal bunt after sale and the price received by the grower is contingent on the test results, are eligible to receive compensation at the rate of $.60 per bushel of positive testing wheat.
(2)
Handlers and seed companies.
Handlers and seed companies who sell wheat grown in a previously regulated area are eligible to receive compensation only if the wheat was not tested by APHIS prior to purchase by the handler, but was tested by APHIS and found positive for Karnal bunt after purchase by the handler or seed company, as long as the price to be paid by the handler or seed company is not contingent on the test results. Compensation will be at the rate of $.60 per bushel of positive testing wheat.
(c)
To claim compensation.
Compensation payments to growers, handlers, and seed companies under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section will be issued by the Farm Service Agency (FSA). Claims for compensation for the 1999-2000 crop season must be received by FSA on or before December 4, 2001. Claims for compensation for subsequent crop seasons must be received by FSA on or before March 1 of the year following that crop season. The Administrator may extend the deadline, upon request in specific cases, when unusual and unforeseen circumstances occur that prevent or hinder a claimant from requesting compensation on or before these dates. To claim compensation, a grower, handler, or seed company must complete and submit to the local FSA county office the following documents:
(1)
Growers, handlers, and seed companies.
A grower, handler, or seed company must submit a Karnal Bunt Compensation Claim form, provided by FSA. If the wheat was grown in an area that is not a regulated area, but for which an Emergency Action Notification (PPQ Form 523) (EAN) has been issued, the grower, handler, or seed company must submit a copy of the EAN. Growers, handlers, and seed companies must also submit a copy of the Karnal bunt certificate issued by APHIS that shows the Karnal bunt test results, and verification as to the actual (not estimated) weight of the wheat that tested positive (such as a copy of a facility weigh ticket, or other verification). For compensation claims for wheat seed, a grower or seed company must submit documentation showing that the wheat is either certified seed or was grown with the intention of producing certified seed (this documentation may include one or more of the following types of documents: an application to the State seed certification agency for field inspection; a bulk sale certificate; certification tags or labels issued by the State seed certification agency; or a document issued by the State seed certification agency verifying that the wheat is certified seed);
(2)
Growers.
In addition to the documents required in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, growers must submit a copy of the receipt for the final sale of the wheat, showing the total bushels sold and the total price received by the grower. Growers compensated under paragraph (b)(1) of this section (previously regulated areas) whose wheat was not tested prior to sale must submit documentation showing that the price paid to the grower was contingent on test results (such as a copy of the receipt for the final sale of the wheat or a copy of the contract the grower has for the wheat, if this information appears on those documents).
(3)
Handlers and seed companies.
In addition to the documents required in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, handlers and seed companies must submit a copy of the receipt for the final sale of the wheat, showing the total bushels sold and the total price received by the handler or seed company. The handler or seed company must also submit documentation showing that the price paid or to be paid to the grower is not contingent on the test results (such as a copy of the receipt for the purchase of the wheat or a copy of the contract the handler or seed company has with the grower, if this information appears on those documents).

§ 301.89-16
Compensation for grain storage facilities, flour millers, National Survey participants, and certain custom harvesters and equipment owners or lessees for the 1999-2000 and subsequent crop seasons.
Owners of grain storage facilities, flour millers, and participants in the National Karnal Bunt Survey are eligible to receive compensation from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) for the 1999-2000and subsequent crop seasons to mitigate losses or expenses incurred because of the Karnal bunt regulations and emergency actions, as follows:
(a)
Decontamination of grain storage facilities.
Owners of grain storage facilities that are in States where the Secretary has declared an extraordinary emergency, and who have decontaminated their grain storage facilities pursuant to either an Emergency Action Notification (PPQ Form 523) issued by an inspector or a letter issued by an inspector ordering decontamination of the facilities, are eligible to be compensated, on a one time only basis for each facility for each covered crop year wheat, for up to 50 percent of the direct cost of decontamination. However, compensation will not exceed $20,000 per grain storage facility (as defined in § 301.89-1). General clean-up, repair, and refurbishment costs are excluded from compensation. Compensation payments will be issued by APHIS. To claim compensation, the owner of the grain storage facility must submit to an inspector records demonstrating that decontamination was performed on all structures, conveyances, or materials ordered by APHIS to be decontaminated. The records must include a copy of the Emergency Action Notification or the letter from an inspector ordering decontamination, contracts with individuals or companies hired to perform the decontamination, receipts for equipment and materials purchased to perform the decontamination, time sheets for employees of the grain storage facility who performed activities connected to the decontamination, and any other documentation that helps show the cost to the owner and that decontamination has been completed. Claims for compensation for the 1999-2000 crop season must be received by APHIS on or before December 4, 2001. Claims for compensation for the 2000-2001 crop season and beyond must be received by March 1 of the year following that crop season. The Administrator may extend these deadlines upon written request in specific cases, when unusual and unforeseen circumstances occur that prevent or hinder a claimant from requesting compensation on or before these dates.
(b)
Flour millers.
Flour millers who, in accordance with a compliance agreement with APHIS, heat treat millfeed that is required by APHIS to be heat treated are eligible to be compensated at the rate of $35.00 per short ton of millfeed. The amount of millfeed compensated will be calculated by multiplying the weight of wheat from the regulated area received by the miller by 25 percent (the average percent of millfeed derived from a short ton of grain). Compensation payments will be issued by APHIS. To claim compensation, the miller must submit to an inspector verification as to the actual (not estimated) weight of the wheat (such as a copy of a facility weigh ticket or a copy of the bill of lading for the wheat, if the actual weight appears on those documents, or other verification). Flour millers must also submit verification that the millfeed was heat treated (such as a copy of the limited permit under which the wheat was moved to a treatment facility and a copy of the bill of lading accompanying that movement; or a copy of PPQ Form 700 (which includes certification of processing) signed by the inspector who monitors the mill). Claims for compensation for the 1999-2000 crop season must be received by APHIS on or before December 4, 2001. Claims for compensation for the 2000-2001 crop season and beyond must be received by March 1 of the year following that crop season. The Administrator may extend these deadlines upon written request in specific cases, when unusual and unforeseen circumstances occur that prevent or hinder a claimant from requesting compensation on or before these dates.
(c)
National Karnal Bunt Survey participants.
If a grain storage facility participating in the National Karnal Bunt Survey tests positive for Karnal bunt, the facility will be regulated, and may be ordered decontaminated, pursuant to either an Emergency Action Notification (PPQ Form 523) issued by an inspector or a letter issued by an inspector ordering decontamination of the facility. If the Secretary has declared an extraordinary emergency in the State in which the grain storage facility is located, the owner will be eligible for compensation as follows:
(1)
Loss in value of positive wheat.
The owner of the grain storage facility will be compensated for the loss in value of positive wheat. Compensation will equal the estimated market price for the relevant class of wheat minus the actual price received for the wheat. The estimated market price will be calculated by APHIS for each class of wheat, taking into account the prices offered by relevant terminal markets (animal feed, milling, or export) during the relevant time period for that facility, with adjustments for transportation and other handling costs. However, compensation will not exceed $1.80 per bushel under any circumstances. Compensation payments for loss in value of wheat will be issued by the Farm Service Agency (FSA). To claim compensation, the owner of the facility must submit to the local FSA office a Karnal Bunt Compensation Claim form, provided by FSA. The owner of the facility must also submit to FSA a copy of the Emergency Action Notification or letter from an inspector under which the facility is or was quarantined; verification as to the actual (not estimated) weight of the wheat (such as a copy of a facility weigh ticket or a copy of the bill of lading for the wheat, if the actual weight appears on those documents, or other verification); and a copy of the receipt for the final sale of the wheat, showing the total bushels sold and the total price received by the owner of the grain storage facility. Claims for compensation for the 1999-2000 crop season must be received by APHIS on or before December 4, 2001. Claims for compensation for the 2000-2001 crop season and beyond must be received by March 1 of the year following that crop season. The Administrator may extend these deadlines upon written request in specific cases, when unusual and unforeseen circumstances occur that prevent or hinder a claimant from requesting compensation on or before these dates.
(2)
Decontamination of grain storage facilities.
The owner of the facility will be compensated on a one time only basis for each grain storage facility for each covered crop year wheat for the direct costs of decontamination of the facility at the same rate described under
paragraph (a) of this section (up to 50 per cent of the direct costs of decontamination, not to exceed $20,000 per grain storage facility). Compensation payments for decontamination of grain storage facilities will be issued by APHIS, and claims for compensation must be submitted in accordance with the provisions in paragraph (a) of this section. Claims for compensation for the 1999-2000 crop season must be received by APHIS on or before December 4, 2001. Claims for compensation for the 2000-2001 crop season and beyond must be received by March 1 of the year following that crop season. The Administrator may extend these deadlines upon written request in specific cases, when unusual and unforeseen circumstances occur that prevent or hinder a claimant from requesting compensation on or before these dates.
(d)
Special allowances for custom harvesters and equipment owners or lessees for costs related to cleaning and disinfection of mechanized harvesting and other equipment in Archer, Baylor, Throckmorton, and Young Counties, TX, in the 2000-2001 crop season.
All claims for compensation under this paragraph § 301.89-16(d) must be received by APHIS on or before September 6, 2005. The Administrator may extend this deadline upon written request in specific cases, when unusual and unforeseen circumstances occur that prevent or hinder a claimant from requesting compensation on or before this date. All compensation payments made under this paragraph § 301.89-16(d) will be issued by APHIS. Claims for compensation should be sent to Plant Protection and Quarantine, APHIS, USDA, 304 West Main Street, Olney, TX 76374.

§ 301.91-2
Regulated articles.
(a)
List of regulated articles.
The Deputy Administrator has determined that certain articles present a risk of spreading European larch canker. A list of all such regulated articles is found on the internet at
www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/planthealth/plant-pest-and-disease-programs/pests-and-diseases/plant-disease/elc/european-larch-canker
. Lists of all regulated articles may also be obtained by request from any local Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ) office; local offices are listed in telephone directories and on the internet at
www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/planthealth/ppq-program-overview/sphd
.
(b)
Normal process for designating additional regulated articles.
(1) If the Deputy Administrator determines that an article not already listed at
www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/planthealth/plant-pest-and-disease-programs/pests-and-diseases/plant-disease/elc/european-larch-canker
presents a risk of spreading European larch canker, APHIS will publish a notice in the
Federal Register
proposing to designate the article as a regulated article for European larch canker. The notice will provide the basis for this determination, and will request public comment.
(2) If no comments are received on the notice, or if the comments do not change the Deputy Administrator's determination, APHIS will publish a second notice in the
Federal Register
designating the article as a regulated article for European larch canker and listing it.
(c)
Immediate designation of regulated articles.
An inspector may designate any other product, article, or means of conveyance as a regulated article for European larch canker, if the inspector determines that it presents a risk of spreading European larch canker, and after the inspector provides actual notification to the person in possession of the product, article, or means of conveyance that it is subject to the restrictions of this subpart.
[87 FR 80017, Dec. 29, 2022]
§ 301.91-3
Regulated areas.
(a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the Deputy Administrator will list as a regulated area each State, or each portion of a State, in which European larch canker has been found by an inspector, or in which the Deputy Administrator has reason to believe that European larch canker is present, or any portion of a quarantined State which the Deputy Administrator deems necessary to regulate because of its proximity to a European larch canker infestation or its inseparability for quarantine enforcement purpose from localities in which European larch canker occurs. The Deputy Administrator will publish a list of all regulated areas (the regulated areas list) on the PPQ website at
www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/planthealth/plant-pest-and-disease-programs/pests-and-diseases/plant-disease/elc/european-larch-canker
. The list will include the date that the list was last updated. Lists of all regulated areas may also be obtained by request from any local PPQ office; local offices are listed in telephone directories and on the internet at
www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/planthealth/ppq-program-overview/sphd
. After a change is made to the list of regulated areas, APHIS will publish a notice in the
Federal Register
informing the public that the change has occurred and describing the change to the regulated areas. Less than an entire quarantined State will be designated as a regulated area only if the Deputy Administrator determines that:
(1) The State has adopted and is enforcing a quarantine or regulation which imposes restrictions on the intrastate movement of the regulated articles which are substantially the same as those which are imposed with respect to the interstate movement of such articles under this subpart; and
(2) The designation of less than the entire State as a regulated area will otherwise be adequate to prevent the
artificial interstate spread of European larch canker.
(b) The Deputy Administrator or an inspector may temporarily designate any nonregulated area in a quarantined State as a regulated area in accordance with the criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section. The Deputy Administrator will give a copy of this subpart along with written notice of the temporary designation to the owner or person in possession of the nonregulated area, or, in the case of publicly owned land, to the person responsible for the management of the nonregulated area.

(1) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the Administrator will designate as a quarantined area each State or portion of a State in which
Phytophthora ramorum
has been confirmed by an inspector to be established in the natural environment, in which the Administrator has reason to believe that
Phytophthora ramorum
is present in the natural environment, or that the Administrator considers it necessary to quarantine because of its inseparability for quarantine enforcement purposes from localities in which
Phytophthora ramorum
has been found in the natural environment. The Administrator will publish a list of all quarantined areas (the quarantine list) on the PPQ website at
www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/planthealth/plant-pest-and-disease-programs/pests-and-diseases/phytophthora-ramorum/sod

. After a change is made to the list of quarantined areas, APHIS will publish a notice in the
Federal Register
informing the public that the change has occurred and describing the change to the quarantined areas. Less than an entire State will be designated as a quarantined area only if the Administrator determines that:
(i) The State has adopted and is enforcing restrictions on the intrastate movement of regulated, restricted, and associated articles that are substantially the same as those imposed by this subpart on the interstate movement of regulated, restricted, and associated articles; and
(ii) The designation of less than the entire State as a quarantined area will prevent the interstate spread of
Phytophthora ramorum
.
(2) The Administrator or an inspector may temporarily designate any nonquarantined area as a quarantined area in accordance with the criteria in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The Administrator or the inspector will give a copy of this subpart along with a written notice for the temporary designation to the owner or person in possession of the nonquarantined area. Thereafter, the interstate movement of any regulated, restricted, or associated article from the area temporarily designated as a quarantined area will be subject to this subpart. As soon as practicable, this area will be added to the quarantine list or the designation will be terminated by the Administrator or an inspector. The owner or person in possession of an area for which designation is terminated will be given notice of the termination as soon as practicable.
(b)
Regulated establishments
—(1)
Designation.
The Administrator will designate a nursery that is not located in a quarantined area for
Phytophthora ramorum
as a regulated establishment for
Phytophthora ramorum
if the nursery ships regulated, restricted, or associated articles interstate and sources of
Phytophthora ramorum
are detected on nursery stock, or in soil, growing media, pots used for nursery stock, standing water, drainage water, water used for irrigation, or any other regulated, restricted, or associated articles at the nursery.
(2)
Deregulation.
The Administrator will withdraw regulation of a regulated establishment if, for 3 consecutive years, each time the nursery is inspected by an inspector, it is found free
of sources of
Phytophthora ramorum
inoculum.

§ 305.6
Cold treatment requirements.
(a)
Certification of treatment facilities.
All facilities or locations used for refrigerating fruits or vegetables in accordance with the cold treatment schedules in the PPQ Treatment Manual or in another treatment schedule approved in accordance with § 305.2 must be certified by APHIS. Recertification of the facility or carrier is required every 3 years, or as often as APHIS directs, depending on treatments performed, commodities handled, and operations conducted at the facility. A facility will only be certified or recertified if the Administrator determines that the location of the facility is such that those Federal agencies involved in its operation and oversight have adequate resources to conduct the necessary operations at the facility, that the pest risks can be managed at that location, and that the facility meets all criteria for approval. Other agencies that have regulatory oversight and requirements must concur in writing with the establishment of the facility prior to APHIS approval. In order to be certified, facilities and carriers must:
(1) Be capable of keeping treated and untreated fruits, vegetables, or other articles separate so as to prevent reinfestation of articles and spread of pests;
(2) Be capable of preventing the escape and spread of pests while regulated articles are at the facility; and
(3) Have equipment that is adequate to effectively perform cold treatment.
(b)(1)
Location of facilities.
Where certified cold treatment facilities are available, an approved cold treatment may be conducted for any imported regulated article either prior to shipment to the United States or in the United States. For any regulated article moved interstate from Hawaii or U.S. territories, cold treatment may be conducted either prior to movement to the mainland United States or in the mainland United States. Cold treatment facilities may be located in any State on the mainland United States. For cold treatment facilities located in the area south of 39° latitude and west of 104° longitude, the following additional conditions must be met:
(i) Prospective facility operators must submit a detailed layout of the facility site and its location to APHIS. APHIS will evaluate plant health risks based on the proposed location and layout of the facility site. APHIS will only approve a proposed facility if the Administrator determines that regulated articles can be safely transported to the facility from the port of entry or points of origin in the United States.
(ii) The government of the State in which the facility is to be located must concur in writing with the location of the facility or, if it does not concur, must provide a written explanation of concern based on pest risks. In instances where the State government does not concur with the proposed facility location, and provides a written explanation of concern based on pest risks, APHIS and the State must agree on a strategy to resolve the pest risk
concerns prior to APHIS approval. If the State does not provide a written explanation of concern based on pest risks, then State concurrence will not be required before APHIS approves the facility location.
(iii) Untreated articles may not be removed from their packaging prior to treatment under any circumstances.
(iv) The facility must have contingency plans, approved by APHIS, for safely destroying or disposing of regulated articles if the facility is unable to properly treat a shipment.
(v) The facility may only treat articles approved by APHIS for treatment at the facility. Approved articles will be listed in the compliance agreement required in paragraph (f) of this section.
(vi) Arrangements for treatment must be made before the departure of a consignment from its port of entry or points of origin in the United States. APHIS and the facility must agree on all parameters, such as time, routing, and conveyance, by which the consignment will move from the port of entry or points of origin in the United States to the treatment facility. If APHIS and the facility cannot reach agreement in advance on these parameters then no consignments may be moved to that facility until an agreement has been reached.
(vii) Regulated articles must be conveyed to the facility in a refrigerated (via motorized refrigeration equipment) conveyance at a temperature that minimizes the mobility of the pests of concern for the article.
(viii) The facility must apply all post-treatment safeguards required for certification under paragraph (a) of this section before releasing the articles.
(ix) The facility must remain locked when not in operation.
(x) The facility must maintain and provide APHIS with an updated map identifying places where horticultural or other crops are grown within 4 square miles of the facility. Proximity of host material to the facility will necessitate trapping or other pest monitoring activities, funded by the facility, to help prevent establishment of any escaped pests of concern, as approved by APHIS; these activities will be listed in the compliance agreement required in paragraph (f) of this section. The treatment facility must have a pest management plan within the facility.
(xi) The facility must comply with any additional requirements including, but not limited to, the use of pest-proof packaging and container seals, that APHIS may require to prevent the escape of plant pests during transport to and from the cold treatment facility itself, for a particular facility based on local conditions, and for any other risk factors of concern. These activities will be listed in the compliance agreement required in paragraph (f) of this section.
(2) For articles that are moved interstate from areas quarantined for fruit flies, cold treatment facilities may be located either within or outside of the quarantined area. If the articles are treated outside the quarantined area, they must be accompanied to the facility by a limited permit issued in accordance with § 301.32-5(b) of this chapter and must be moved in accordance with any safeguards determined to be appropriate by APHIS.
(c)
Cold treatment enclosures.
All enclosures, in which cold treatment is performed, including refrigerated containers, must:
(1) Be capable of maintaining the highest temperature of the treatment schedule under which the fruit will be treated specified in the PPQ Treatment Manual or in another approved treatment schedule before the treatment begins and holding fruit at or below the treatment temperature during the treatment.
(2) Maintain fruit pulp temperatures according to treatment schedules with no more than a 0.39 °C (0.7 °F) variation in temperature between two consecutive hourly readings.
(3) Be structurally sound and adequate to maintain required temperatures.
(d)
Treatment procedures.
(1) All material, labor, and equipment for cold treatment performed on a vessel must be provided by the vessel or vessel agent. An official authorized by APHIS monitors, manages, and advises in order to ensure that the treatment procedures are followed.
(2) Refrigeration must be completed in the container, compartment, or room in which it is begun.
(3) Fruit that may be cold treated must be safeguarded to prevent cross-contamination or mixing with other infested fruit.
(4) Fruit intended for in-transit cold treatment must be precooled to no more than the highest temperature of the treatment schedule under which the fruit will be treated prior to beginning treatment. The in-transit treatment enclosure may not be used for precooling unless an official authorized by APHIS approves the loading of the fruit in the treatment enclosure as adequate to allow for fruit pulp temperatures to be taken prior to beginning treatment. If the fruit is precooled outside the treatment enclosure, an official authorized by APHIS will take pulp temperatures manually from a sample of the fruit as the fruit is loaded for in-transit cold treatment to verify that precooling was completed. If the pulp temperatures for the sample are 0.28 °C (0.5 °F) or more above the highest temperature of the treatment schedule under which the fruit will be treated, the pallet from which the sample was taken will be rejected and returned for additional precooling until the fruit reaches the highest temperature of the treatment schedule under which the fruit will be treated. If fruit is precooled in the treatment enclosure, or if treatment is conducted at a cold treatment facility in the United States, the fruit must be precooled to the highest temperature of the treatment schedule under which the fruit will be treated, as verified by an official authorized by APHIS, prior to beginning treatment.
(5) Breaks, damage, etc., in the treatment enclosure that preclude maintaining correct temperatures must be repaired before the enclosure is used. An official authorized by APHIS must approve loading of compartment, number and placement of temperature probes or sensors, and initial fruit temperature readings before beginning the treatment. Hanging decks and hatch coamings within vessels may not be used as enclosures for in-transit cold treatment without prior written approval from APHIS. Double-stacking of pallets is not allowed.
(6) Only the same type of fruit in the same type of package may be treated together in a container; no mixture of fruits in containers may be treated. A numbered seal must be placed on the doors of the loaded container and may be removed only at the port of destination by an official authorized by APHIS.
(7) Temperature recording devices used during treatment must be secured using measures approved by APHIS as adequate to ensure the security and integrity of cold treatment data. The devices must be able to record the date, time, and sensor number and automatic and continuous records of the temperature during all calibrations and during treatment. Recording devices must be capable of generating temperature charts for verification by an inspector. If records of calibrations or treatments are found to have been manipulated, the vessel or container in which the treatment is performed may be suspended from conducting cold treatments until proper equipment is installed and an official authorized by APHIS has recertified it. APHIS' decision to recertify a vessel or container will take into account the severity of the infraction that led to suspension.
(8) A minimum of four temperature probes or sensors is required for vessel holds used as treatment enclosures. A minimum of three temperature probes or sensors is required for other treatment enclosures. An official authorized by APHIS will have the option to require that additional temperature probes or sensors be used, depending on the size of the treatment enclosure.
(9) Fruit pulp temperatures must be maintained at the temperature specified in the treatment schedule with no more than a 0.39 °C (0.7 °F) variation in temperature between two consecutive hourly readings. Failure to comply with this requirement will result in invalidation of the treatment unless an official authorized by APHIS can verify that the pulp temperature was maintained at or below the treatment temperature for the duration of the treatment.
(10) The time required to complete the treatment begins when all temperature probes reach the prescribed cold treatment schedule temperature. Refrigeration continues until the vessel arrives at the port of destination and the fruit is released for unloading by an inspector even though this may prolong the period required for the cold treatment.
(11) Temperatures must be recorded at intervals no longer than 1 hour apart. Gaps of longer than 1 hour will invalidate the treatment or indicate treatment failure unless an official authorized by APHIS can verify that the pulp temperature was maintained at or below the treatment temperature for the duration of the treatment.
(12) Cold treatment is not completed until so declared by an official authorized by APHIS or the certifying official of the foreign country; consignments of treated commodities may not be discharged until APHIS clearance has been fully completed, including review and approval of treatment record charts.
(13) Cold treatment of fruits in break bulk vessels or containers must be initiated by an official authorized by APHIS if there is not a treatment technician who has been trained to initiate cold treatments for either break bulk vessels or containers.
(14) An official authorized by APHIS may perform audits to ensure that the treatment procedures comply with the regulations in this section and that the treatment is administered in accordance with the treatment schedules in the PPQ Treatment Manual or in accordance with another approved treatment schedule. The official authorized by APHIS must be given the appropriate materials and access to the facility, container, or vessel necessary to perform the audits.
(15) An inspector will sample and cut fruit from each consignment after it has been cold treated to monitor treatment effectiveness. If a single live pest of concern in any stage of development is found, the consignment will be held until an investigation is completed and appropriate remedial actions have been implemented. If APHIS determines at any time that the safeguards contained in this section do not appear to be effective against the pests of concern, APHIS may suspend the importation of fruits from the originating country and conduct an investigation into the cause of the deficiency. APHIS may waive the sampling and cutting requirement of paragraph (d)(15) of this section, provided that the national plant protection organization (NPPO) of the exporting country has conducted such sampling and cutting in the exporting country as part of a biometric sampling protocol approved by APHIS.
(16) The cold treatments required for the entry of fruit are considered necessary for the elimination of plant pests, and no liability shall attach to the U.S. Department of Agriculture or to any officer or representative of that Department in the event injury results to fruit offered for entry in accordance with these instructions. In prescribing cold treatments of certain fruits, it should be emphasized that inexactness and carelessness in applying the treatments may result in injury to the fruit or its rejection for entry.
(e)
Monitoring.
Treatment must be monitored by an inspector to ensure proper administration of the treatment. An inspector must also approve the recording devices and sensors used to monitor temperatures and conduct an operational check of the equipment before each use and ensure sensors are calibrated. An inspector may approve, adjust, or reject the treatment. Facilities must be located within the local commuting area for APHIS employees for inspection purposes. Facilities treating imported articles must also be located within an area over which the U.S. Department of Homeland Security is assigned authority to accept entries of merchandise, to collect duties, and to enforce the provisions of the customs and navigation laws in force.
(f)
Compliance agreements.
Any person who operates a facility where cold treatment is conducted for phytosanitary purposes must sign a compliance agreement with APHIS.
(1)
Compliance agreements with importers and facility operators for cold treatment in the United States.
If cold treatment of imported articles is conducted in the United States, both the importer and the operator of the cold treatment facility or the person who conducts the
cold treatment must sign compliance agreements with APHIS. In the importer compliance agreement, the importer must agree to comply with any additional requirements found necessary by APHIS to ensure the shipment is not diverted to a destination other than an approved treatment facility and to prevent escape of plant pests from the articles to be treated during their transit from the port of first arrival to the cold treatment facility in the United States. In the facility compliance agreement, the facility operator or person conducting the cold treatment must agree to comply with the requirements of this section and any additional requirements found necessary by APHIS to prevent the escape of any pests of concern that may be associated with the articles to be treated.
(2)
Compliance agreements with cold treatment facilities outside the United States.
If cold treatment of imported articles is conducted outside the United States, the operator of the cold treatment facility must sign a compliance agreement or an equivalent agreement with APHIS and the NPPO of the country in which the facility is located. In this agreement, the facility operator must agree to comply with the requirements of this section, and the NPPO of the country in which the facility is located must agree to monitor that compliance and inform the Administrator of any noncompliance.
(3)
Cold treatment facilities treating articles moved interstate from Hawaii and U.S. territories.
Cold treatment facilities treating articles moved interstate from Hawaii and the U.S. territories must complete a compliance agreement with APHIS as provided in § 318.13-3(d) of this chapter.

(4) Irradiation facilities treating articles moved interstate from areas quarantined only for Asian citrus psyllid, and not for citrus greening, must complete a compliance agreement with APHIS as provided in § 301.76-8 of this chapter.
(d)
Certified facility.
The irradiation treatment facility must be certified by APHIS. Recertification is required in the event of an increase in the amount of radioisotope, a decrease in the amount of radioisotope for a reason other than natural decay, a major modification to equipment that affects the delivered dose, or a change in the owner or managing entity of the facility. Recertification also may be required in cases where a significant variance in dose delivery has been measured by the dosimetry system. In order to be certified, a facility must:
(1) Be capable of administering the minimum absorbed ionizing radiation doses specified in the PPQ Treatment Manual or in another treatment schedule approved in accordance with § 305.2 to the regulated articles;
1
1
The maximum absorbed ionizing radiation dose and the irradiation of food is regulated by the Food and Drug Administration under 21 CFR part 179.
(2) Be constructed so as to provide physically separate locations for treated and untreated articles, except that articles traveling by conveyor directly into the irradiation chamber may pass through an area that would otherwise be separated. The locations must be separated by a permanent physical barrier such as a wall or chain link fence 6 or more feet high to prevent transfer of cartons, or some other means approved during certification to prevent reinfestation of articles and spread of pests.
(3) If the facility is to be used to treat imported articles and is located in the United States, the facility will only be certified if APHIS determines that regulated articles will be safely transported to the facility from the port of arrival without significant risk that plant pests will escape in transit or while the regulated articles are at the facility.
(e)
Monitoring and interagency agreements.
Treatment must be monitored by an inspector. This monitoring will include inspection of treatment records and unannounced inspections of the facility by an inspector, and may include inspection of articles prior to or after irradiation. Facilities must be located within the local commuting area for APHIS employees for inspection purposes.
(1)
Irradiation facilities treating imported articles; irradiation treatment framework equivalency workplan.
Facilities shall be located within an area over which the U.S. Department of
Homeland Security is assigned authority to accept entries of merchandise, to collect duties, and to enforce the provisions of the customs and navigation laws in force. The NPPO of a country from which articles are to be imported into the United States in accordance with this section must sign a framework equivalency workplan with APHIS. In this plan, both the NPPO and APHIS will specify the following items for their respective countries:
(A) Citations for any requirements that apply to the importation of irradiated fruits and vegetables;
(B) The type and amount of inspection, monitoring, or other activities that will be required in connection with allowing the importation of irradiated fruits and vegetables into that country; and
(C) Any other conditions that must be met to allow the importation of irradiated fruits and vegetables into that country.
(2)
Irradiation facilities located in foreign countries.
Facilities in foreign countries that carry out irradiation operations must notify the Director of Preclearance, PPQ, APHIS, 4700 River Road Unit 140, Riverdale, MD 20737-1236, of scheduled operations at least 30 days before operations commence, except where otherwise provided in the facility preclearance workplan. To ensure the appropriate level of monitoring, before articles may be imported in accordance with this section, the following agreements must be signed, in addition to the irradiation treatment framework equivalency workplan required in paragraph (e)(1) of this section:
(i)
Facility preclearance workplan.
Prior to commencing importation into the United States of articles treated at a foreign irradiation facility, APHIS and the NPPO of the country from which articles are to be imported must jointly develop a preclearance workplan that details the activities that APHIS and the foreign NPPO will carry out in connection with each irradiation facility to verify the facility's compliance with the requirements of this section. Typical activities to be described in this workplan may include frequency of visits to the facility by APHIS and foreign plant protection inspectors, methods for reviewing facility records, and methods for verifying that facilities are in compliance with the requirements for separation of articles, packaging, labeling, and other requirements of this section. This facility preclearance workplan will be reviewed and renewed by APHIS and the foreign NPPO on an annual basis.
(ii)
Trust fund agreement.
Irradiated articles may be imported into the United States in accordance with this section only if the NPPO of the country in which the irradiation facility is located or a private export group has entered into a trust fund agreement with APHIS. That agreement requires the NPPO or the private export group to pay, in advance of each shipping season, all costs that APHIS estimates it will incur in providing inspection and treatment monitoring services at the irradiation facility during that shipping season. Those costs include administrative expenses and all salaries (including overtime and the Federal share of employee benefits), travel expenses (including per diem expenses), and other incidental expenses incurred by APHIS in performing these services. The agreement will describe the general nature and scope of APHIS services provided at irradiation facilities covered by the agreement, such as whether APHIS inspectors will monitor operations continuously or intermittently, and will generally describe the extent of inspections APHIS will perform on articles prior to and after irradiation. The agreement requires the NPPO or private export group to deposit a certified or cashier's check with APHIS for the amount of those costs, as estimated by APHIS. If the deposit is not sufficient to meet all costs incurred by APHIS, the agreement further requires the NPPO or the private export group to deposit with APHIS a certified or cashier's check for the amount of the remaining costs, as determined by APHIS, before any more articles irradiated in that country may be imported into the United States. After a final audit at the conclusion of each shipping season, any overpayment of funds would be returned to the NPPO or the private export group or held on account until needed, at the
option of the NPPO or the private export group.
(3)
Irradiation facilities located within the United States.
Facilities located within the United States must notify an inspector at least 24 hours (excluding Saturday, Sunday, and Federal holidays) before scheduled operations.
2
If the facility will be used to treat imported articles, the NPPO of the country from which the articles are to be imported into the United States in accordance with this section must also sign the irradiation treatment framework equivalency workplan required in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
2
Inspectors are assigned to local offices of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, which are listed in telephone directories.
(f)
Packaging.
Articles that are irradiated in accordance with this section must be packaged in cartons in the following manner:
(1) Irradiated articles may not be packaged for shipment in a carton with nonirradiated articles.
(2) For all imported articles irradiated prior to arrival in the United States, all articles moved interstate from Hawaii or U.S. territories and irradiated prior to arrival in the mainland United States, and all regulated articles to be moved interstate from an area quarantined for fruit flies or Asian citrus psyllid that are treated within the quarantined area:
(i) The fruits and vegetables must be packaged either:
(A) In insect-proof cartons that have no openings that will allow the entry of the pests of concern. The cartons must be sealed with seals that will visually indicate if the cartons have been opened. The cartons may be constructed of any material that prevents entry or oviposition (if applicable) by the pests of concern into the articles in the carton;
3
or
3
If there is a question as to the adequacy of a carton, send a request for approval of the carton, together with a sample carton, to the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Plant Protection and Quarantine, Center for Plant Health Inspection and Technology, 1730 Varsity Drive, Suite 400, Raleigh, NC 27606-5202.
(B) In noninsect-proof cartons that are stored immediately after irradiation in a room completely enclosed by walls or screening that completely precludes access by the pests of concern. If stored in noninsect-proof cartons in a room that precludes access by the pests of concern, prior to leaving the room, each pallet of cartons must be completely enclosed in polyethylene shrink wrap, or another solid or netting covering that completely precludes access to the cartons by the pests of concern.
(ii) To preserve the integrity of treated lots, each pallet-load of cartons containing the fruits and vegetables must be secured before leaving the irradiation facility in one of the following ways:
(A) With polyethylene shrink wrap;
(B) With net wrapping; or
(C) With strapping.
(iii) Packaging must be labeled in a manner that allows an inspector to determine treatment lot numbers, packing and treatment facility identification and location, and dates of packing and treatment.
(A) For imported articles that are treated prior to arrival in the United States, pallets that remain intact as one unit until entry into the United States may have one such label per pallet. Pallets that are broken apart into smaller units prior to or during entry into the United States, or that will be broken apart into smaller units after entry into the United States, must have the required label information on each individual carton.
(B) For articles moved interstate from Hawaii or U.S. territories that are treated prior to arrival in the mainland United States, pallets that remain intact as one unit until entry into the mainland United States may have one such label per pallet. Pallets that are broken apart into smaller units prior to or during entry into the mainland United States, or that will be broken apart into smaller units after entry into the mainland United States, must have the required label information on each individual carton.
(3) For all articles imported to be irradiated upon arrival in the United States, moved interstate from Hawaii or U.S. territories to be irradiated upon arrival in the mainland United States, or moved interstate from areas
quarantined for fruit flies or Asian citrus psyllid to be irradiated outside the quarantined area, the articles must be packed in cartons that have no openings that will allow the exit of the pests of concern and that are sealed with seals that will visually indicate if the cartons have been opened. They may be constructed of any material that prevents the pests of concern from exiting the carton. Cartons of untreated articles must be shipped in shipping containers sealed prior to their shipment with seals that will visually indicate if the shipping containers have been opened.
(g)
Containers or vans.
Containers or vans that will transport treated articles must be free of pests of concern prior to loading the treated articles.
(h)
Certification of treatment for articles treated outside the United States.
For each consignment treated in an irradiation facility outside the United States, a phytosanitary certificate, with the treatment section completed and issued by the NPPO, must accompany the consignment.
(i)
Dosage.
The regulated articles must receive the minimum absorbed ionizing radiation dose specified in the PPQ Treatment Manual or in another approved treatment schedule.
(j)
Dosimetry systems at the irradiation facility.
(1) Dosimetry must indicate the doses needed to ensure that all the articles will receive the minimum dose prescribed.
(2) The absorbed dose, as measured using an accurate dosimetry system, must meet or exceed the absorbed dose for the pest(s) of concern required by the PPQ Treatment Manual or by another approved treatment schedule.
(3) When designing the facility's dosimetry system and procedures for its operation, the facility operator must address guidance and principles from the International Standards Organization/American Society for Testing and Materials standard
4
or an equivalent standard recognized by APHIS.
4
Designation ISO/ASTM 51261-2002(E), “Standard Guide for Selection and Calibration of Dosimetry Systems for Radiation Processing,” American Society for Testing and Materials,
Annual Book of ASTM Standards.
(k)
Records.
An irradiation processor must maintain records of each treated lot for 1 year following the treatment date, and must make these records available for inspection by an inspector during normal business hours (8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, except holidays). These records must include the lot identification, scheduled process, evidence of compliance with the scheduled process, ionizing energy source, source calibration, dosimetry, dose distribution in the product, and the date of irradiation.
(l)
Request for initial certification and inspection of facility.
Persons requesting initial certification of an irradiation treatment facility must submit the request for approval in writing to the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Plant Protection and Quarantine, Center for Plant Health Inspection and Technology, 1730 Varsity Drive, Suite 400, Raleigh, NC 27606-5202. The initial request must identify the owner, location, and radiation source of the facility, and the applicant must supply additional information about the facility construction, treatment protocols, and operations upon request by APHIS if APHIS requires additional information to evaluate the request. Before the Administrator determines whether an irradiation facility is eligible for certification, an inspector will make a personal inspection of the facility to determine whether it complies with the standards of this section.
(m)
Denial and withdrawal of certification.
(1) The Administrator will withdraw the certification of any irradiation treatment facility upon written request from the irradiation processor.
(2) The Administrator will deny or withdraw certification of an irradiation treatment facility when any provision of this section is not met. Before withdrawing or denying certification, the Administrator will inform the irradiation processor in writing of the reasons for the proposed action and provide the irradiation processor with an opportunity to respond. The Administrator will give the irradiation processor an opportunity for a hearing regarding any dispute of a material fact, in accordance with rules of practice that will be adopted for the proceeding.
However, the Administrator will suspend certification pending final determination in the proceeding if he or she determines that suspension is necessary to prevent the spread of any dangerous insect. The suspension will be effective upon oral or written notification, whichever is earlier, to the irradiation processor. In the event of oral notification, written confirmation will be given to the irradiation processor within 10 days of the oral notification. The suspension will continue in effect pending completion of the proceeding and any judicial review of the proceeding.
(n)
Department not responsible for damage.
This treatment is approved to assure quarantine security against the plant pests listed in the PPQ Treatment Manual or the plant pests for which another treatment schedule is approved in accordance with § 305.2. From the literature available, the articles authorized for treatment under this section are believed tolerant to the treatment; however, the facility operator and shipper are responsible for determination of tolerance. The Department of Agriculture and its inspectors assume no responsibility for any loss or damage resulting from any treatment prescribed or monitored. Additionally, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is responsible for ensuring that irradiation facilities are constructed and operated in a safe manner. Further, the Food and Drug Administration is responsible for ensuring that irradiated foods are safe and wholesome for human consumption.
(o)
Substitution of irradiation for other treatments.
Treatment of fruits and vegetables that are from foreign localities, from Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, or from domestic areas under quarantine with irradiation in accordance with this section may be substituted for other approved treatments if the target pests of the other approved treatments are approved for treatment with irradiation in the PPQ Treatment Manual or approved for treatment with irradiation in accordance with § 305.2.

(3)
Other fruits and vegetables.
Fruits and vegetables not already authorized for interstate movement as described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section may be authorized for interstate movement only after:
(i) APHIS has analyzed the pest risk posed by the interstate movement of a fruit or vegetable and has determined that the risk posed by each quarantine pest associated with the fruit or vegetable can be reasonably mitigated by the application of one or more phytosanitary measures;
(ii) APHIS has made its pest risk analysis and determination available for public comment for at least 60 days through a notice published in the
Federal Register

§ 318.13-5
Pest-free areas.
Certain fruits or vegetables may be moved interstate provided that the fruits or vegetables originate from an area that is free of a specific pest or pests. In some cases, fruits or vegetables may only be moved interstate if the area of origin is free of all plant pests that attack the fruits or vegetables. In other cases, fruits or vegetables may be moved interstate if the area of origin is free of one or more plant pests that attack the fruit or vegetable and the risk posed by the remaining plant pests that attack the fruit or vegetable is mitigated by other specific phytosanitary measures contained in the regulations in this subpart.
(a)
Application of standards for pest-free areas.
APHIS will make a determination of an area's pest-free status based on information provided by the State. The information used to make this determination will include trapping and surveillance data, survey protocols, and protocols for actions to be performed upon detection of a pest.
(b)
Survey protocols.
APHIS must approve the survey protocol used to determine and maintain pest-free status, as well as protocols for actions to be performed upon detection of a pest. Pest-free areas are subject to audit by APHIS to verify their status.
(c)
Determination of pest freedom.
(1) For an area to be considered free of a specified pest for the purposes of this subpart, the Administrator must determine, and announce in a notice published in the
Federal Register
for a public comment period of 60 days, that the area meets the criteria of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
(2) The Administrator will announce his or her decision in a subsequent
Federal Register
notice. If appropriate, APHIS will allow movement of the regulated article from a pest-free area because:
(i) No comments were received on the notice or
(ii) The comments on the notice did not affect the overall conclusions of the notice and the Administrator's determination of risk.
(d)
Decertification of pest-free areas; reinstatement.
If a pest is detected in an area that is designated as free of that pest, APHIS will publish in the
Federal Register
a notice announcing that the pest-free status of the area in question has been withdrawn and that interstate movement of host crops for the pest in question is subject to application of an approved treatment for the pest. If a treatment for the pest is not available, interstate movement of the host crops would be prohibited. In order for a decertified pest-free area to be reinstated, it would have to meet the criteria of paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section.
(e)
General requirements for the interstate movement of regulated articles from pest-free areas
—(1)
Labeling.
Each box of fruits or vegetables that is moved interstate from a pest-free area under this subpart must be clearly labeled with:
(i) The name of the orchard or grove of origin, or the name of the grower; and
(ii) The name of the municipality and State or territory in which the fruits or vegetables were produced; and
(iii) The type and amount of fruits or vegetables the box contains.
(2)
Compliance agreement.
Persons wishing to move fruits or vegetables from a pest-free area in Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, or the U.S. Virgin Islands must enter into a compliance agreement with APHIS in accordance with § 318.13-3(d).
(3)
Safeguarding.
If fruits or vegetables are moved from a pest-free area into or through an area that is not free of that pest, the fruits or vegetables must be safeguarded during the time they are present in a non-pest-free area by being covered with insect-proof mesh screens or plastic tarpaulins, including while in transit to the packinghouse and while awaiting packaging. If
fruits or vegetables are moved through an area that is not free of that pest during transit to a port, they must be packed in insect-proof cartons or containers or be covered by insect-proof mesh or plastic tarpaulins during transit to the port and subsequent movement into or through the United States. These safeguards described in this section must remain intact until the fruits or vegetables reach their final destination.

Cut blooms of gardenia are also eligible for interstate movement with treatment in accordance with part 305 of this chapter.
(1) The grower's production area must be inspected annually by an inspector and found free of green scale. If green scale is found during an inspection, a 2-month ban will be placed on the interstate movement of cut blooms of gardenia from that production area. Near the end of the 2 months, an inspector will reinspect the grower's production area to determine whether green scale is present. If reinspection determines that the production area is free of green scale, shipping may resume. If reinspection determines that green scale is still present in the production area, another 2-month ban on shipping will be placed on the interstate movement of gardenia from that production area. Each ban will be followed by reinspection in the manner specified, and the production area must be found free of green scale prior to interstate movement.
(2) The grower must establish a buffer area surrounding gardenia production areas. The buffer area must extend 20 feet from the edge of the production area. Within the buffer area, the growing of gardenias and the following green scale host plants is prohibited: Ixora, ginger (
Alpinia purpurata
), plumeria, coffee, rambutan, litchi, guava, citrus, anthurium, avocado, banana, cocoa, macadamia, celery,
Pluchea indica,
mango, orchids, and annona.
(3) An inspector must visually inspect the cut blooms of gardenias in each consignment prior to interstate movement from Hawaii to the mainland United States. If the inspector does not detect green scale in the consignment, the inspector will certify the consignment in accordance with § 318.13-3(b). If the inspector finds green scale in a consignment, that consignment will be ineligible for interstate movement from Hawaii.

§ 318.47
Notice of quarantine.
(a) The Secretary of Agriculture having previously quarantined Hawaii and Puerto Rico on account of the pink bollworm of cotton (Pectinophora gossypiella Saunders) and the cotton blister mite (Eriophyes gossypii Banks), insect pests new to and not widely prevalent or distributed within and throughout the United States, now determines that it is necessary to extend the quarantine to prevent the spread of these insects from the Virgin Islands of the United States, where they are known to occur.
(b) Under the authority of sections 411, 412, 414, and 434 of the Plant Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 7711, 7712, 7714, and 7754), Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands of the United States are quarantined to prevent the spread of the aforementioned insect pests.
(c) All parts and products of plants of the genus Gossypium, such as seeds including seed cotton; cottonseed; cotton lint, linters, and other forms of cotton fiber; cottonseed hulls, cake, meal, and other cottonseed products, except oil; cotton waste; and all other unmanufactured parts of cotton plants; and all second-hand burlap and other fabric which have been used, or are of the kinds ordinarily used, for wrapping or containing cotton, are hereby prohibited movement from the Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands of the United States into or through any other State, Territory or District of the United States, in manner or method or under conditions other than those prescribed in the regulations hereinafter made or amendments thereto:
Provided,
That whenever the Deputy Administrator of the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs shall find that existing conditions as to the pest risk involved in the movement of the articles to which the regulations supplemental hereto apply, make it safe to modify, by making less stringent, the restrictions contained in any such regulations, he shall set forth and publish such findings in administrative instructions, specifying the manner in which the regulations should be made less stringent, whereupon such modification shall become effective.
(d) As used in this subpart, unless the context otherwise requires, the term
State, Territory, or District of the United States
means State, the District of Columbia, Alaska, Guam, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, or the Virgin Islands of the United States.

# Subpart C—Controlled Import Permits

# Source:
78 FR 25568, May 2, 2013, unless otherwise noted. Redesignated at 84 FR 2428, Feb. 7, 2019.
§ 319.6
Controlled import permits.
(a)
Definitions.
Administrator.
The Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, United States Department of Agriculture, or any employee of the United States Department of Agriculture delegated to act in his or her stead.
Developmental purposes.
The evaluation, monitoring, or verification of plant material for plant health risks and/or the adaptability of the material for certain uses or environments.
Experimental purposes.
Scientific testing which utilizes collected data and employs analytical processes under controlled conditions to create qualitative or quantitative results.
Therapeutic purposes.

(b)
Purpose and scope.
The regulations in this part prohibit or restrict the importation into the United States of certain plants, plant products, and other articles to prevent the introduction and dissemination of plant pests and noxious weeds within and throughout the United States. The regulations in this subpart provide a process under which a controlled import permit (CIP) may be issued to authorize the importation, for experimental, therapeutic, or developmental purposes, of an article whose importation is prohibited under this part. A CIP may also be issued to authorize, for those same purposes, the importation of an article under conditions that differ from those prescribed in the relevant regulations in this part.
(c)
Application process.
Applications for a CIP are available without charge from the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ), Permit Unit, 4700 River Road Unit 136, Riverdale, MD 20737-1236, or from local PPQ offices. Applications may be submitted by mail, by fax, or electronically and must be submitted at least 60 days prior to arrival of the article at the port of entry. Mailed applications must be submitted to the address above, faxed applications may be submitted to 301-734-4300, and electronic applications may be submitted through the ePermits Web site at
https://epermits.aphis.usda.gov/epermits.
(1) The completed application for a CIP must provide the following information:
(i) Name, address in the United States, and contact information of the applicant;
(ii) Identity (common and botanical [genus and species] names) of the plant material to be imported, quantity of importation, country of origin, and country shipped from;
(iii) Intended experimental, therapeutic, or developmental purpose for the importation; and
(iv) Intended ports of export and entry, means of conveyance, and estimated date of arrival.
(2) APHIS may issue a CIP if the Administrator determines that the plant pest risks associated with the plant material and its intended experimental, therapeutic, or developmental use can be effectively mitigated. The CIP will contain the applicable conditions for importation and subsequent handling of the plant material if it is deemed eligible to be imported into the United States, including the specifications for the facility where the plant will be held. The plant material may be
imported only if all applicable requirements are met.
(d)
Shipping conditions.
Consignments of plant material to be offered for importation under a CIP must meet the following requirements, unless otherwise specified under the conditions of the CIP:
(1) The plant material must be selected from apparently disease-free and pest-free sources.
(2) The plant material must be free of soil, other foreign matter or debris, other prohibited plants, noxious weed seeds, and living organisms such as parasitic plants, pathogens, insects, snails, and mites.
(3) Fungicides, insecticides, and other treatments such as coatings, dips, or sprayings must not be applied before shipment, unless otherwise specified. Plant materials may be refused entry if they are difficult or hazardous to inspect because of the presence of such treatments. Plant materials must not be wrapped or otherwise packaged in a manner that impedes or prevents adequate inspection or treatment.
(4) The plant material must be moved in an enclosed container or one completely enclosed by a covering adequate to prevent the possible escape or introduction of plant pests during shipment. Any packing material used in the consignment of the plant material must meet the requirements of § 319.37-11, and wood packing material used in the consignment must meet the requirements of § 319.40-3(b) and (c).
(5) Consignments may be shipped as cargo, by mail or air freight, or hand-carried, as specified in the conditions of the CIP.
(6) The plant material must be offered for importation at the port of entry or plant inspection station as specified in the conditions of the CIP.
(7) A copy of the CIP must accompany each consignment, and all consignments must be labeled in accordance with instructions in the CIP.
(8) Each consignment must be accompanied by an invoice or packing list indicating its contents.
(e)
Post-importation conditions.
(1) At the approved facility where the plant material will be maintained following its importation, plant material imported under a CIP must be identified and labeled as quarantined material to be used only in accordance with a valid CIP.
(2) Plant material must be stored in a secure place or in the manner indicated in the CIP and be under the supervision and control of the permit holder. During regular business hours, properly identified officials, either Federal or State, must be allowed to inspect the plant material and the facilities in which the plant material is maintained.
(3) The permit holder must keep the permit valid for the duration of the authorized experimental, therapeutic, or developmental purpose. The PPQ Permit Unit must be informed of a change in contact information for the permit holder within 10 business days of such change.
(4) Plant material imported under a CIP must not be moved or distributed to another person without prior authorization from the PPQ Permit Unit.
(5) Should the permit holder leave the institution in which the plant material imported under a CIP is kept, the plant material must be destroyed unless, prior to the departure of the original permit holder, another person assumes responsibility for the continued maintenance of the plant material and such person obtains a new CIP for the plant material. Should the permit holder be otherwise unavailable to maintain the plant material for which the CIP was issued, the plant material must be destroyed unless another person assumes responsibility for the continued maintenance of the plant material and such person obtains a new CIP for the plant material. Permission to move or distribute plant material that was authorized for importation under a CIP to another person must be obtained by contacting the PPQ Permit Unit.
(6) CIPs issued by APHIS are valid for a period of 1 year. The permittee may request the existing permit be renewed for up to an additional 2 years prior to the expiration of the CIP and if no adverse indications exist from the previous year.
(f) Failure to comply with all of the conditions specified in the CIP or any
applicable regulations or administrative instructions, or forging, counterfeiting, or defacing permits or shipping labels, may result in immediate revocation of the permit, denial of future permits, and civil or criminal penalties for the permit holder.
(g)
Denial, withdrawal, cancellation, or revocation of permit.
The Administrator may deny a permit application in accordance with § 319.7-3, and a permit may be withdrawn, canceled, or revoked in accordance with § 319.7-4.
(1)
Action upon cancellation or revocation of permit.
Upon cancellation or revocation of a permit, the permittee must surrender, destroy, or remove all regulated plant material covered by the permit in accordance with § 319.7-4(e).
(2)
Appeal of denial or revocation.
Any person whose application for a permit has been denied or whose permit has been revoked may appeal the denial or revocation in accordance with § 319.7-5.

Covers.
(a) Entry of covers (including bags, slit bags, and parts of bags) which have been used as containers for cotton grown or processed in countries other
than the United States may be authorized either (1) through a Mexican border port named in the permit for vacuum fumigation by an approved method in that part of the United States within the generally infested pink bollworm regulated area; or (2) through a northern port or a port in the State of California subject to vacuum fumigation by an approved method or without vacuum fumigation when the covers are to be moved to an approved mill or plant for utilization. When such covers are forwarded from a northern port to a mill or plant in California for utilization, or from a California port to another California or northern port for vacuum fumigation thereat or for movement to a mill or plant for utilization such movement shall be made by an all-water route unless the bales are compressed to a density of 20 pounds or more per cubic foot in which case the bales may be moved overland in van-type trucks or box cars if all-water transportation is not available. Such overland movement may be made only after approved surface treatment or under such other conditions as may be deemed necessary and are prescribed by the inspector. When such covers arrive at a port other than a northern, California, or Mexican border port they will be required to be transported therefrom immediately in bond by an all-water route to a northern or California port where approved vacuum fumigation facilities are available for vacuum fumigation thereat by an approved method or for forwarding therefrom to an approved mill or plant for utilization.
(b) American cotton bagging, commonly known as coarse gunny, which has been used to cover only cotton grown or processed in the United States, may be authorized entry at any port under permit and upon compliance with §§ 319.8-4 and 319.8-5, without fumigation or other treatment. Marking patches of the finer burlaps or other fabrics when attached to bales of such bagging may be disregarded if, in the judgment of the inspector, they do not present a risk of carrying live pink bollworms, golden nematode cysts or flag smut spores.
(c) Bags, slit bags, parts of bags, and other covers which have been used as containers for root crops or are of a kind ordinarily used as containers for root crops may be authorized entry subject to immediate treatment in such manner and according to such method as the inspector may select from administratively authorized procedures known to be effective under the conditions under which the treatment is applied, and subject to any additional safeguard measures that may be prescribed by the inspector pursuant to § 319.8-24, or that he may prescribe in regard to the manner of discharge from the carrier and conveyance to the place of treatment:
Provided,
That such covers may be authorized entry from Canada without treatment as prescribed in this paragraph unless the covers are found to be contaminated.
(d) Bags, slit bags, parts of bags, and other covers that have been used as containers for wheat or wheat products that have not been so processed as to have destroyed all flag smut disease spores, or that have been used as containers for field seeds separated from wheat during the process of screening, and which arrive from a country named in § 319.59-2(a)(2) of this part, if intended for reuse in this country as grain containers may be authorized entry, subject to immediate treatment at the port of arrival. If such covers are not intended to be reused in this country as grain containers their entry may be authorized subject to movement for utilization to an approved mill or plant the owner or operator of which has executed an appropriate agreement with the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs similar to that described in § 319.8-8(a)(2). Covers coming within this paragraph only, may be entered without permit other than the authorization provided in this paragraph and without other restriction under this subpart upon presentation to an inspector of satisfactory evidence that they have been used only for grains exported from the United States and are being returned empty without use abroad and that while abroad they have been handled in a manner to prevent their contamination.
(e) When upon arrival at a port of entry any shipment of bags, slit bags, parts of bags, or other covers, is found to include one or more bales containing
material the importation of which is regulated by paragraph (a), (c), or (d) of this section, the entire shipment, or any portion thereof, may be required by the inspector to be treated as specified in the applicable paragraph.
(f) If upon their arrival at a port of entry covers are classified by the inspector as coming within more than one paragraph of this section, they will be authorized entry only upon compliance with such requirements of the applicable paragraphs as the inspector may deem necessary to prevent the introduction of plant diseases and insect pests.
(g) Notwithstanding the provisions of any other paragraph of this section the entry from any country of bags, slit bags, parts of bags, and other covers will be authorized without treatment but upon compliance with other applicable sections of this subpart if the inspector finds that they have obviously not been used in a manner that would contaminate them or when in the inspector's opinion there is otherwise no plant pest risk associated with their entry.

(i) APHIS will issue a notice after the close of the public comment period indicating that the taxon will be added to the list of taxa not authorized for importation pending pest risk analysis if:
(A) No comments were received on the data sheet;
(B) The comments on the data sheet revealed that no changes to the data sheet were necessary; or
(C) Changes to the data sheet were made in response to public comments, but the changes did not affect APHIS' determination that the taxon poses a risk of introducing a quarantine pest into the United States.
(ii) If comments present information that leads us to determine that the importation of the taxon does not pose a risk of introducing a quarantine pest into the United States, APHIS will not add the taxon to the list of plants for planting whose importation is not authorized pending pest risk analysis. APHIS will issue a notice giving public notice of this determination after the close of the comment period.
(c)
Criterion for listing a taxon of plants for planting as a quarantine pest.
A taxon will be added to the list of taxa whose importation is not authorized pending pest risk analysis if scientific evidence causes APHIS to determine that the taxon is a quarantine pest.
(d)
Criteria for listing a taxon of plants for planting as a host of a quarantine pest.
A taxon will be added to the list of taxa whose importation is not authorized pending pest risk analysis if scientific evidence causes APHIS to determine that the taxon is a host of a quarantine pest. The following criteria
must be fulfilled in order to make this determination:
(1) The plant pest in question must be determined to be a quarantine pest; and
(2) The taxon of plants for planting must be determined to be a host of that quarantine pest.
(e)
Removing a taxon from the list of taxa not authorized pending pest risk analysis.
(1) Requests to remove a taxon from the list of taxa whose importation is not authorized pending pest risk analysis (NAPPRA) must be made in accordance with § 319.5. APHIS will conduct a pest risk analysis in response to such a request. The pest risk analysis will examine the risk associated with the importation of that taxon as well as measures available to mitigate that risk. The pest risk analysis may analyze importation of the taxon from a specific area, country, or countries, or from all areas of the world. The conclusions of the pest risk analysis will apply accordingly.
(2) If the pest risk analysis indicates that the taxon is a quarantine pest or a host of a quarantine pest and the Administrator determines that there are no measures available that adequately mitigate the risk of introducing a quarantine pest into the United States through the taxon's importation, we will continue to list the taxon as not authorized for importation pending pest risk analysis. We will publish a notice making the pest risk analysis available for comment. If comments cause us to change our determination, we will publish another notice in accordance with either paragraph (e)(3) or (4) of this section, as appropriate. If comments do not cause us to change our determination, we will publish a second notice responding to the comments and affirming our determination that the taxon should continue to be listed as NAPPRA.
(3) If the pest risk analysis supports a determination that importation of the taxon be allowed subject to taxon-specific restrictions, APHIS will publish a notice making the pest risk analysis available to the public for comment in accordance with the process in § 319.37-20(c).
(4) If the pest risk analysis supports a determination that importation of the taxon be allowed subject to the general restrictions of this subpart, APHIS will publish a notice announcing our intent to remove the taxon from the list of taxa whose importation is not authorized pending pest risk analysis and making the pest risk analysis supporting the taxon's removal available for public comment.
(i) APHIS will issue a notice after the close of the public comment period indicating that the importation of the taxon will be subject only to the general restrictions of this subpart if:
(A) No comments were received on the pest risk analysis;
(B) The comments on the pest risk analysis revealed that no changes to the pest risk analysis were necessary; or
(C) Changes to the pest risk analysis were made in response to public comments, but the changes did not affect the overall conclusions of the analysis and the Administrator's determination that the importation of the taxon does not pose a risk of introducing a quarantine pest into the United States.
(ii) If information presented by commenters indicates that the pest risk analysis needs to be revised, APHIS will issue a notice after the close of the public comment period indicating that the importation of the taxon will continue to be listed as not authorized pending pest risk analysis while the information presented by commenters is analyzed and incorporated into the pest risk analysis. APHIS will subsequently publish a new notice announcing the availability of the revised pest risk analysis.
(5) APHIS may also remove a taxon from the list of taxa whose importation is not authorized pending pest risk analysis when APHIS determines that the evidence used to add the taxon to the list was erroneous (for example, involving a taxonomic misidentification).
(f)
Controlled import permits.
Any plants for planting whose importation is not authorized pending pest risk analysis in accordance with this section may be imported or offered for entry into the United States if:
(1) Imported for experimental, therapeutic, or developmental purposes
under the conditions specified in a controlled import permit issued in accordance with § 319.6;
(2) Imported at the National Plant Germplasm Inspection Station, Building 580, Beltsville Agricultural Research Center East, Beltsville, MD 20705 or through any USDA plant inspection station listed in the Plants for Planting Manual;
(3) Imported pursuant to a controlled import permit issued for such plants for planting and kept on file at the port of entry;
(4) Imported under conditions specified on the controlled import permit and found by the Administrator to be adequate to prevent the introduction into the United States of quarantine pests,
i.e.,
conditions of treatment, processing, growing, shipment, disposal; and
(5) Imported with a controlled import tag or label securely attached to the outside of the container containing the plants for planting or securely attached to the plant itself if not in a container, and with such tag or label bearing a controlled import permit number corresponding to the number of the controlled import permit issued for such plants for planting.

§ 319.37-6
Phytosanitary certificates.
(a)
Phytosanitary certificates.
Any plants for planting offered for importation into the United States must be accompanied by a phytosanitary certificate, except as described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. The phytosanitary certificate must identify the genus of the plants for planting it accompanies. When the importation of individual species or cultivars within a genus is restricted in accordance with § 319.37-20, the phytosanitary certificate must also identify the species or cultivar of the plants for planting it accompanies. Otherwise, identification of the species is strongly preferred, but not required. Intergeneric and interspecific hybrids must be designated by placing the multiplication sign “×” between the names of the parent taxa. If the hybrid is named, the multiplication sign may instead be placed before the name of an intergeneric hybrid or before the epithet in the name of an interspecific hybrid.
(b)
Small lots of seed.
Lots of seed may be imported without a phytosanitary certificate required by paragraph (a) of this section under the following conditions:
(1) The importation of the seed is authorized by a written permit issued in accordance with § 319.37-5.
(2) The seed is not listed as not authorized pending pest risk analysis, as provided in § 319.37-4; is not of any noxious weed species listed in part 360 of this chapter; is not subject to restrictions on specific types of plants for planting as provided in § 319.37-20; is not restricted under the regulations in parts 330 and 340 of this chapter; and meets the requirements of part 361 of this chapter.

§ 319.37-8
Ports of entry: Approved ports, notification of arrival, inspection, and refusal of entry.
(a)
Approved ports of entry.
Any plants for planting required to be imported under a written permit in accordance with § 319.37-5(a), if not precleared, must be imported or offered for importation only at a USDA plant inspection station, unless the Plants for Planting Manual indicates otherwise. Ports of entry through which plants for planting must pass through before arriving at these USDA plant inspection stations are listed in the Plants for Planting Manual. All other plants for planting may be imported or offered for importation at any Customs designated port of entry indicated in 19 CFR 101.3(b)(1). Exceptions may be listed in § 330.104 of this chapter. Plants for planting that are required to be imported under a written permit that are
also precleared in the country of export are not required to enter at an inspection station and may enter through any Customs port of entry. Exceptions may be listed in § 330.104 of this chapter.
(b)
Notification upon arrival at the port of entry.
Promptly upon arrival of any plants for planting at a port of entry, the importer shall notify the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs of the arrival by such means as a manifest, Customs entry document, commercial invoice, waybill, a broker's document, or a notice form provided for that purpose.
(c)
Inspection and treatment.
Any plants for planting may be sampled and inspected by an inspector at the port of first arrival and/or under preclearance inspection arrangements in the country in which the plants for planting were grown, and must undergo treatment in accordance with part 305 of this chapter if treatment is ordered by the inspector. Any plants for planting found upon inspection to contain or be contaminated with quarantine pests that cannot be eliminated by treatment will be denied entry at the first United States port of arrival and must be destroyed or shipped to a point outside the United States.
(d)
Disposition of plants for planting not in compliance with this subpart.
The importer of any plants for planting denied entry for noncompliance with this subpart must, at the importer's expense and within the time specified in an emergency action notification (PPQ Form 523), destroy, ship to a point outside the United States, treat in accordance with part 305 of this chapter, or apply other safeguards to the plants for planting, as prescribed by an inspector, to prevent the introduction into the United States of quarantine pests. In choosing which action to order and in setting the time limit for the action, the inspector shall consider the degree of pest risk presented by the plant pest associated with the plants for planting, whether the plants for planting are a host of the pest, the types of other host materials for the pest in or near the port, the climate and season at the port in relation to the pest's survival range, and the availability of treatment facilities for the plants for planting.
(e)
Removal of plants for planting from port of first arrival.
No person shall remove any plants for planting from the port of first arrival unless and until notice is given to the collector of customs by the inspector that the plants for planting has satisfied all requirements under this subpart.

§ 319.37-9
Treatment of plants for planting; costs and charges for inspection and treatment; treatments applied outside the United States.
(a) The services of a Plant Protection and Quarantine inspector during regularly assigned hours of duty and at the usual places of duty shall be furnished without cost to the importer.
2
No charge will be made to the importer for Government-owned or -controlled special inspection facilities and equipment used in treatment, but the inspector may require the importer to furnish any special labor, chemicals, packing materials, or other supplies required in handling an importation under the regulations in this subpart. The Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs will not be responsible for any costs or charges, other than those indicated in this section.
2
Provisions relating to costs for other services of an inspector are contained in part 354 of this chapter.
(b) Any treatment performed in the United States on plants for planting must be performed at the time of importation into the United States. Treatment shall be performed by an inspector or under an inspector's supervision at a Government-operated special inspection facility, except that an importer may have such treatment performed at a nongovernmental facility if the treatment is performed at nongovernment expense under the supervision of an inspector and in accordance with part 305 of this chapter and in accordance with any treatment required by an inspector as an emergency measure in order to prevent the dissemination of any quarantine pests. However, treatment may be performed
at a nongovernmental facility only in cases of unavailability of government facilities and only if, in the judgment of an inspector, the plants for planting can be transported to such nongovernmental facility without the risk of introduction into the United States of quarantine pests.
(c) Any treatment performed outside the United States must be monitored and certified by an APHIS inspector or an official from the NPPO of the exporting country. If monitored and certified by an official of the NPPO of the exporting country, then a phytosanitary certificate must be issued with the following declaration: “The consignment of (fill in taxon) has been treated in accordance with 7 CFR part 305.” During the entire interval between treatment and export, the consignment must be stored and handled in a manner that prevents any infestation by quarantine pests.

Growing media.
(a) Any plants for planting at the time of importation or offer for importation into the United States shall be free of sand, soil, earth, and other growing media, except as provided in paragraph (b), (c), or (d) of this section.
(b)(1) Plants for planting from Canada may be imported in any growing medium, except as restricted in the Plants for Planting Manual. Restrictions on growing media for specific types of plants for planting imported from Canada will be added, changed, or removed in accordance with § 319.37-20.
(2) Plants for planting from an area of Canada regulated by the national plant protection organization of Canada for a soil-borne plant pest may only be imported in an approved growing medium if the phytosanitary certificate accompanying it contains an additional declaration that the plant was grown in a manner to prevent infestation by that soil-borne plant pest.
(c) Certain types of plants for planting growing solely in certain growing media listed in the Plants for Planting Manual may be imported established in such growing media. The Administrator has determined that the importation of the specified types of plants for planting in these growing media does not pose a risk of introducing quarantine pests into the United States. If the Administrator determines that a new growing medium may be added to the list of growing media in which imported plants for planting may be established, or that a growing medium currently listed for such purposes is no longer suitable for establishment of imported plants for planting, APHIS will publish in the
Federal Register
a notice that announces our proposed determination and requests comment on the change. After the close of the comment period, APHIS will publish another notice informing the public of the Administrator's decision on the change to the list of growing media in which imported types of plants for planting may be established.
(d) Certain types of plants for planting, as listed in the Plants for Planting Manual, may be imported when they are established in a growing medium approved by the Administrator and they are produced in accordance with additional requirements specified in the Plants for Planting Manual. Changes to the list of plants for planting that may be imported in growing media, and to the requirements for the importation of those types of plants for planting, will be made in accordance with § 319.37-20.

[Reserved]
§ 319.37-20
Restrictions on the importation of specific types of plants for planting.
(a)
Plant type-specific restrictions.
In addition to the general restrictions in this subpart, the Administrator may impose additional restrictions on the importation of specific types of plants for planting necessary to effectively mitigate the risk of introducing quarantine pests into the United States through the importation of specific plants for planting. Additional restrictions may be placed on the importation of the entire plant or on certain plant parts. A list of the types of plants for planting whose importation is subject to additional restrictions, and the specific restrictions that apply to the importation of each type of plants for planting, may be found in the Plants for Planting Manual.
(b)
Basis for changing restrictions.
The Administrator may determine that it is necessary to add, change, or remove restrictions on the importation of a specific type of plants for planting, based on the risk of introducing a quarantine pest through the importation of that type of plants for planting. The Administrator will make this determination based on the findings of a pest risk analysis or on other scientific evidence.
(c)
Process for adding, changing, or removing restrictions.
Restrictions on the importation of a specific type of plants for planting beyond the general restrictions in §§ 319.37-5 through 319.37-11 will be changed through the following process:
(1)
Document describing restrictions.
APHIS will publish in the
Federal Register
a notice that announces our proposed determination that it is necessary to add, change, or remove restrictions on the importation of a specific type of plants for planting. This notice will make available for public comment a document describing the restrictions that the Administrator has determined are necessary and how these restrictions will mitigate the risk of introducing quarantine pests into the United States.
(2)
Response to comments.
APHIS will issue a second notice after the close of the public comment period on the notice described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. This notice will inform the public of the specific restrictions, if any, that the Administrator has determined to be necessary in order to mitigate the risk of introducing quarantine pests into the United States through the importation of the type of plants for planting. In response to the public comments submitted, the Administrator may implement the restrictions described in the document made available by the initial notice, amend the restrictions in response to public comment, or determine that changes to the restrictions on the importation of the type of plants for planting are unnecessary.
(d)
Previously imposed restrictions on specific types of plants for planting.
Types of plants for planting whose importation was subject to specific restrictions by specific regulation as of April 18, 2018, will continue to be subject to those restrictions, except as changed in accordance with the process specified in paragraph (c) of this section. The restrictions are found in the Plants for Planting Manual.
§ 319.37-21
Integrated pest risk management measures.
If a type of plants for planting is a host of a quarantine pest or pests, APHIS may require the type of plants for planting to be produced in accordance with integrated pest risk management measures as a condition of importation. This section sets out a general framework for integrated pest risk management measures. When APHIS determines that integrated measures are necessary to mitigate risk, APHIS will use this framework to develop integrated pest risk management measures that mitigate the quarantine pest risks associated with that type of plants for planting through the process described in § 319.37-20.
(a)
Responsibilities of the place of production.
The place of production is responsible for identifying, developing, and implementing procedures that meet the requirements of both the NPPO of the exporting country and APHIS. Participants in the export program must be approved by the NPPO or its designee and APHIS. Approval will be conferred by the NPPO or its designee and APHIS after the participant meets the conditions required for integrated pest risk management. Approval will be withdrawn if the participant fails to meet the conditions at any time. All documentation required under paragraphs (a)(5) and (6) of this section will be maintained by the exporting place of production and made available to official representatives of the NPPO of the exporting country and APHIS upon request. The place of production must be open to necessary and reasonable audit, monitoring, and evaluation of compliance by the NPPO of the exporting country and APHIS. The management of the place of production will be responsible for complying with the integrated pest risk management measures. Management must specify the roles and responsibilities of its personnel to perform program activities. The place of production must notify the NPPO of the exporting country of deficiencies detected during internal audits. The NPPO of the exporting country will be responsible for ensuring that the place of production is in compliance with the integrated pest risk management measures.
(1)
Pest management program.
The place of production must develop and implement an approved pest management program that contains ongoing pest monitoring and procedures for the exclusion and control of plant pests. The place of production must obtain material used to produce plants for planting from sources that are free of quarantine pests and that are approved by the NPPO of the exporting country and APHIS. All sources of plants for planting and the phytosanitary status of those plants must be well-documented and the program for producing plants for planting carefully monitored.
(2)
Training.
A training program approved by the NPPO of the exporting country and APHIS must be established, documented, and regularly conducted at the place of production. The training program must ensure that all those involved in the export program possess specific knowledge related to the relevant components of the program and a general understanding of its requirements.
(3)
Internal audits.
The place of production must perform, or designate parties to perform internal audits that ensure that a plan approved and documented by APHIS and the NPPO of the exporting country is being followed and is achieving the appropriate level of pest management.
(4)
Traceability.
The place of production must implement a procedure approved by APHIS and the NPPO of the exporting country or its designee that documents and identifies plants from propagation through harvest and sale to ensure that plants can be traced forward and back from the place of production. Depending on the nature of the quarantine pests, the system may need to account for:
(i) The origin and pest status of mother stock;
(ii) The year of propagation and the place of production of all plant parts that make up the plants for planting intended for export;
(iii) Geographic location of the place of production;
(iv) Location of plants for planting within the place of production;
(v) The plant taxon; and
(vi) The purchaser's identity.
(5)
Documentation of program procedures.
The place of production must develop a manual approved by the NPPO of the exporting country and APHIS that guides the place of production's operation and that includes the following components:
(i) Administrative procedures (including roles and responsibilities and training procedures);
(ii) Pest management plan;
(iii) Place of production internal audit procedures;
(iv) Management of noncompliant product or procedures;
(v) Traceability procedures; and
(vi) Recordkeeping systems.
(6)
Records.
A place of production must maintain records on its premises as specified by APHIS and the NPPO of the exporting country. These records must be made available to APHIS and the NPPO of the exporting country upon request. These documents include all the elements described in this paragraph (a) and copies of all internal and external audit documents and reports.
(b)
Responsibilities of APHIS and the NPPO of the exporting country.
APHIS and the NPPO of the exporting country are responsible for collaborating to establish program requirements, including workplans and compliance agreements as necessary, for recognizing and implementing particular import programs. Technically justified modifications to the program may be negotiated. The administration of program requirements must include such elements as clarification of terminology, testing and retesting requirements, eligibility, the nomenclature of certification levels, horticultural management, isolation and sanitation requirements, inspection, documentation, identification and labeling, quality assurance, noncompliance and remedial measures, and postentry quarantine requirements. The criteria for approving, suspending, removing, and reinstating approval for a particular program should be jointly developed and agreed upon by APHIS and the NPPO of the exporting country. Information should be exchanged between APHIS and the NPPO of the exporting country through officially designated points of contact.
(c)
Responsibilities of the NPPO of the exporting country.
(1) The NPPO of the exporting country must provide sufficient information to APHIS to support the evaluation and acceptance of export programs. This may include:
(i) Specific identification of the commodity, place of production, and expected volume and frequency of consignments;
(ii) Relevant production, harvest, packing, handling, and transport details;
(iii) Pests associated with the plant including prevalence, distribution, and damage potential;

(e)
External audits.
APHIS and the NPPO of the exporting country will agree to the requirements for external audits.
(1)
APHIS audits.
APHIS will evaluate the integrated pest risk management measures of the NPPO of the exporting country before acceptance. This could consist of documentation review, site visits, and inspection and testing of plants produced under the system. Following approval, APHIS or its designee will monitor and periodically audit the system to ensure that it continues to meet the stated objectives. Audits will include inspection of imported plants for planting, site visits, and review of the integrated pest risk management measures and internal audit processes of the place of production and the NPPO of the exporting country.
(2)
Audits by the NPPO of the exporting country.
The NPPO must arrange for audits of the exporting system. Audits may be conducted by the NPPO or its designee and may consist of inspection and testing of plants for planting and the documentation and management practices as they relate to the program. Audits should verify that:

(2) Regulatory responses to program failures will be based on existing bilateral agreements. Contingency plans may be established in advance to ensure that alternative measures are available in the event that all or part of a program fails. APHIS will specify the consequences of noncompliance to the NPPO of the exporting country. The NPPO must specify the consequences of noncompliance to the participants in the program. These may vary depending on the nature and severity of the infraction. In addition, remedial measures should be specified to enable a suspended or decertified place of production or plant broker to become eligible for reinstatement or recertification.
(3) Places of production or plant brokers that do not meet the conditions of the program must be suspended. Plants for planting must not be exported from a place of production or a plant broker that has failed to meet the program requirements.
(4) The effectiveness of remedial measures taken must be verified before reinstatement to the program by the exporting NPPO and, where appropriate, by APHIS.

§ 319.37-22
Trust fund agreements.
If APHIS personnel need to be physically present in an exporting country or region to facilitate the exportation of plants for planting and APHIS services are to be funded by the NPPO of the exporting country or a private export group, then the NPPO or the private export group must enter into a trust fund agreement with APHIS that is in effect at the time APHIS' services are needed. Under the agreement, the NPPO of the exporting country or the private export group must pay in advance all estimated costs that APHIS expects to incur in providing inspection services in the exporting country. These costs will include administrative expenses incurred in conducting the services and all salaries (including overtime and the Federal share of employee benefits), travel expenses (including per diem expenses), and other incidental expenses incurred by the inspectors in performing services. The agreement must require the NPPO of the exporting country or region or a private export group to deposit a certified or cashier's check with APHIS for the amount of those costs, as estimated by APHIS. The agreement must
further specify that, if the deposit is not sufficient to meet all costs incurred by APHIS, the NPPO of the exporting country or a private export group must deposit with APHIS, before the services will be completed, a certified or cashier's check for the amount of the remaining costs, as determined by APHIS. After a final audit at the conclusion of each shipping season, any overpayment of funds would be returned to the NPPO of the exporting country or region or a private export group, or held on account.

(2) APHIS will evaluate history of past plant pest interceptions or introductions (including data from foreign countries) associated with the regulated article.
(b)
Cataloging quarantine pests.
For the regulated article specified in an application, APHIS will determine what plant pests or potential plant pests are associated with the type of tree from which the regulated article was derived, in the country and locality from which the regulated article is to be exported. A plant pest that meets one of the following criteria is a quarantine pest and will be further evaluated in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section:
(1) Non-indigenous plant pest not present in the United States;
(2) Non-indigenous plant pest, present in the United States and capable of further dissemination in the United States;
(3) Non-indigenous plant pest that is present in the United States and has reached probable limits of its ecological range, but differs genetically from the plant pest in the United States in a way that demonstrates a potential for greater damage potential in the United States;
(4) Native species of the United States that has reached probable limits of its ecological range, but differs genetically from the plant pest in the United States in a way that demonstrates a potential for greater damage potential in the United States; or
(5) Non-indigenous or native plant pest that may be able to vector another plant pest that meets one of the criteria in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section.
(c)
Determining which quarantine pests to assess.
(1) APHIS will divide quarantine pests identified in paragraph (b) of this section into groups depending upon where the plant pest is most likely to be found. The plant pests would be grouped as follows:
(i) Plant pests found on the bark;
(ii) Plant pests found under the bark; and
(iii) Plant pests found in the wood.
(2) APHIS will subdivide each of the groups in paragraph (c)(1) of this section into associated taxa.
(3) APHIS will rank the plant pests in each group in paragraph (c)(2) of this section according to plant pest risk, based on the available biological information and demonstrated plant pest importance.
(4) APHIS will identify any plant pests ranked in paragraph (c)(3) of this section for which plant pest risk assessments have previously been performed in accordance with this section. APHIS will conduct individual plant pest risk assessments for the remaining plant pests, starting with the highest ranked plant pest(s) in each group.
(5) The number of plant pests in each group to be evaluated through individual plant pest risk assessment will be based on biological similarities of members of the group as they relate to measures taken in connection with the importation of the regulated article to mitigate the plant pest risk associated with the regulated article. For example, if the plant pest risk assessment for the highest ranked plant pest indicates a need for a mitigation measure that would result in the same reduction of risk for other plant pests ranked in the group, the other members need not be subjected to individual plant pest risk assessment.
(d)
Conducting individual plant pest risk assessments.
APHIS will evaluate each of the plant pests identified in paragraph (c)(4) of this section by:
(1) Estimation of the probability of the plant pest being on, with, or in the regulated article at the time of importation;
(2) Estimation of the probability of the plant pest surviving in transit on the regulated article and entering the United States undetected;
(3) Estimation of the probability of the plant pest colonizing once it has entered into the United States;
(4) Estimation of the probability of the plant pest spreading beyond any colonized area; and
(5) Estimation of the damage to plants that could be expected upon introduction and dissemination within the United States of the plant pest.
(e)
Estimating unmitigated overall plant pest risk.
APHIS will develop an estimation of the overall plant pest risk associated with importing the regulated article based on compilation of individual plant pest risk assessments performed in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.
(f)
Evaluating available requirements to determine whether they would allow safe importation of the regulated article.
The requirements of this subpart, and any other requirements relevant to the regulated article and plant pests involved, will be compared with the individual plant pest risk assessments in order to determine whether particular conditions on the importation of the regulated article would reduce the plant pest risk to an insignificant level. If APHIS determines that the imposition of particular conditions on the importation of the regulated article could reduce the plant pest risk to an insignificant level, and determines that sufficient APHIS resources are available to implement or ensure implementation of the conditions, APHIS will implement rulemaking to allow importation of the requested regulated article under the conditions identified by the plant pest risk assessment process.

(d) Other conditions of entry as applying to the certain classes of articles enumerated in § 319.41-1 are:
(1)
Broomcorn.
All importations of broomcorn shall be so baled as to prevent breakage and scattering in connection with the necessary handling and sterilization; if in the judgment of the inspector they are not so baled, entry may be refused. All importations of broomcorn shall be subject to such sterilization or other treatment in accordance with part 305 of this chapter as the inspector may require.
(2)
Articles made of broomcorn.
Brooms or similar articles made of broomcorn shall be subject to sterilization unless their manufacture involves the substantial elimination of stems or such treatment of the included stems as in the judgment of the inspector shall preclude such articles from being the means of carriage of the European corn borer and of other injurious insects and plant diseases.
(3)
Shelled corn and other seeds.
If shipments of shelled corn and seeds of the other plants from countries other than those named in § 319.41-1 (b)(2) are found upon inspection at the port of arrival to be appreciably fouled with cobs or other portions of the plants the inspector may require sterilization or other treatment in accordance with part 305 of this chapter or may refuse entry.

§ 319.56-4
Authorization of certain fruits and vegetables for importation.
(a)
Determination by the Administrator.
No fruit or vegetable is authorized importation into the United States unless the Administrator has determined that the risk posed by each quarantine pest associated with the fruit or vegetable can be reasonably mitigated by the application of one or more phytosanitary measures designated by the Administrator and the fruit or vegetable is imported into the United States in accordance with, and as stipulated in, the permit issued by the Administrator.

(3)
Other fruits and vegetables.
Fruits and vegetables not already authorized for importation as described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section may be authorized importation only after:
(i) APHIS has analyzed the pest risk posed by the importation of a fruit or vegetable from a specified foreign region and has determined that the risk posed by each quarantine pest associated with the fruit or vegetable can be reasonably mitigated by the application of one or more phytosanitary measures;
(ii) APHIS has made its pest risk analysis and determination available for public comment for at least 60 days through a notice published in the
Federal Register
; and
(iii) The Administrator has announced his or her decision in a subsequent
Federal Register
notice to authorize the importation of the fruit or vegetable subject to the phytosanitary measures specified in the notice.
(4)
Changes to phytosanitary measures.
(i) If the Administrator determines that the phytosanitary measures required for a fruit or vegetable that has been authorized importation under this subpart are no longer sufficient to reasonably mitigate the pest risk posed by the fruit or vegetable, APHIS will prohibit or further restrict importation of the fruit or vegetable. APHIS will also publish a notice in the
Federal Register
advising the public of its finding. The notice will specify the amended importation requirements, provide an effective date for the change, and will invite public comment on the subject.
(ii) If the Administrator determines that any of the phytosanitary measures required for a fruit or vegetable that has been authorized importation under this subpart are no longer necessary to reasonably mitigate the pest risk posed by the fruit or vegetable, APHIS will make new pest risk documentation available for public comment, in accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of this section, prior to allowing importation of the fruit or vegetable subject to the phytosanitary measures specified in the notice.

§ 319.56-5
Pest-free areas.
As provided elsewhere in this subpart, certain fruits and vegetables may be imported into the United States provided that the fruits or vegetables originate from an area that is free of a specific pest or pests. In some cases, fruits or vegetables may only be imported if the area of export is free of all quarantine pests that attack the fruit or vegetable. In other cases, fruits and
vegetables may be imported if the area of export is free of one or more quarantine pests that attack the fruit or vegetable, and provided that the risk posed by the remaining quarantine pests that attack the fruit or vegetable is mitigated by other specific phytosanitary measures contained in the regulations in this subpart.
(a)
Application of international standard for pest free areas.
APHIS requires that determinations of pest-free areas be made in accordance with the criteria for establishing freedom from pests found in International Standard for Phytosanitary Measures No. 4, “Requirements for the establishment of pest free areas.” The international standard was established by the International Plant Protection Convention of the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization and is incorporated by reference in § 300.5 of this chapter.
(b)
Survey protocols.
APHIS must approve the survey protocol used to determine and maintain pest-free status, as well as protocols for actions to be performed upon detection of a pest. Pest-free areas are subject to audit by APHIS to verify their status.
(c)
Determination of pest freedom.
(1) For an area to be considered free of a specified pest for the purposes of this subpart, the Administrator must determine, and announce in a notice or rule published in the
Federal Register
for 60 days public comment, that the area meets the criteria of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
(2) The Administrator will announce his or her decision in a subsequent
Federal Register
notice. If appropriate, APHIS would begin issuing permits for importation of the fruit or vegetable from a pest-free area because:
(i) No comments were received on the notice or
(ii) The comments on the notice did not affect the overall conclusions of the notice and the Administrator's determination of risk.
(d)
Decertification of pest-free areas; reinstatement.
If a pest is detected in an area that is designated as free of that pest, APHIS would publish in the
Federal Register
a notice announcing that the pest-free status of the area in question has been withdrawn, and that imports of host crops for the pest in question are subject to application of an approved treatment for the pest. If a treatment for the pest is not available, importation of the host crops would be prohibited. In order for a decertified pest-free area to be reinstated, it would have to meet the criteria of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
(e)
General requirements for fruits and vegetables imported from pest-free areas.
(1)
Labeling.
Each box of fruits or vegetables that is imported into the United States from a pest-free area under this subpart must be clearly labeled with:
(i) The name of the orchard or grove of origin, or the name of the grower; and
(ii) The name of the municipality and State in which the fruits or vegetables were produced; and
(iii) The type and amount of fruit the box contains.
(2)
Phytosanitary certificate.
A phytosanitary certificate must accompany the imported fruits or vegetables, and must contain an additional declaration that the fruits originate from a pest-free area that meets the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
(3)
Safeguarding.
If fruits or vegetables are moved from a pest-free area into or through an area that is not free of that pest, the fruits or vegetables must be safeguarded during the time they are present in a non-pest-free area by being covered with insect-proof mesh screens or plastic tarpaulins, including while in transit to the packinghouse and while awaiting packaging. If fruits or vegetables are moved through an area that is not free of that pest during transit to a port, they must be packed in insect-proof cartons or containers or be covered by insect-proof mesh or plastic tarpaulins during transit to the port and subsequent export to the United States. These safeguards described in this section must be intact upon arrival in the United States.
(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control numbers 0579-0049, 0579-0316 and 0579-0293)
§ 319.56-6
Trust fund agreements.
If APHIS personnel need to be physically present in an exporting country or region to facilitate the exportation of fruits or vegetables and APHIS services are to be funded by the national plant protection organization (NPPO) of the exporting country or a private export group, then the NPPO or the private export group must enter into a trust fund agreement with APHIS that is in effect at the time the fruits or vegetables are exported. Under the agreement, the NPPO of the exporting country or the private export group must pay in advance all estimated costs that APHIS expects to incur in providing inspection services in the exporting country. These costs will include administrative expenses incurred in conducting the services and all salaries (including overtime and the Federal share of employee benefits), travel expenses (including per diem expenses), and other incidental expenses incurred by the inspectors in performing services. The agreement must require the NPPO of the exporting country or region or a private export group to deposit a certified or cashier's check with APHIS for the amount of those costs, as estimated by APHIS. The agreement must further specify that, if the deposit is not sufficient to meet all costs incurred by APHIS, the NPPO of the exporting country or a private export group must deposit with APHIS, before the services will be completed, a certified or cashier's check for the amount of the remaining costs, as determined by APHIS. After a final audit at the conclusion of each shipping season, any overpayment of funds would be returned to the NPPO of the exporting country or region or a private export group, or held on account.

§ 322.15
APHIS review of permit applications; denial or revocation of permits.
(a)
Review of permit applications to import restricted organisms
—(1)
Consultation.
During our review of your permit application, we may consult with any Federal officials; appropriate officials of any State, Territory, or other jurisdiction in the United States in charge of research or regulatory programs relative to bees; and any other qualified governmental or private research laboratory, institution, or individual. We will conduct these consultations to gain information on the risks associated with the importation of the restricted organisms.
(2)
Review by destination State.
We will transmit a copy of your permit application, along with our anticipated decision on the application, to the appropriate regulatory official in the destination State for review and recommendation. A State's response, which we will consider before taking final action on the permit application, may take one of the following forms:
(i) The State recommends that we issue the permit;
(ii) The State recommends that we issue the permit with specified additional conditions;
(iii) The State recommends that we deny the permit application and provides scientific, risk-based reasons supporting that recommendation; or
(iv) The State makes no recommendation, thereby concurring with our decision regarding the issuance of the permit.
4
4
If a State regulatory official does not respond within 20 business days, we will conclude that the State has chosen to make no recommendation regarding the issuance of the permit.
(b)
Results of review.
After a complete review of your application, we will either:
(1) Issue you a written permit with, if applicable, certain specific conditions
listed for the importation of the restricted organisms you applied to import. You must initial each condition on the proposed permit and return the proposed permit conditions to the Permit Unit before we will issue you a signed valid permit; or
(2) Notify you that your application has been denied and provide reasons for the denial.
(c)
Denial of permit applications.
APHIS will deny an application for a permit to import a restricted organism regulated under this subpart when, in its opinion, such movement would involve a danger of dissemination of an exotic bee disease or parasite, or an undesirable species or subspecies of honeybee. Danger of such dissemination may be deemed to exist when:
(1) Existing safeguards against dissemination are inadequate and no adequate safeguards can be arranged; or
(2) The potential for disseminating an exotic bee disease or parasite, or an undesirable species or subspecies of honeybee, with the restricted organism outweighs the probable benefits that could be derived from the proposed movement and use of the restricted organism; or
(3) When you, as a previous permittee, failed to maintain the safeguards or otherwise observe the conditions prescribed in a previous permit and have failed to demonstrate your ability or intent to observe them in the future; or
(4) The proposed movement of the restricted organism is adverse to the conduct of an eradication, suppression, control, or regulatory program of APHIS.
(5) APHIS may also deny a permit to import restricted organisms:
(i) To a person who has previously failed to comply with any APHIS regulation, except:
(A) A permit revoked in an investigation concerning that failure has been reinstated on appeal, at the discretion of APHIS; or
(B) All measures ordered by APHIS to correct the failure, including but not limited to, payment of penalties or restitution, have been complied with to the satisfaction of APHIS.
(ii) To a person who has previously failed to comply with any international or Federal regulation or instruction concerning the importation of prohibited or restricted foreign agricultural products; or
(iii) If the application for a permit contains information that is found to be materially false, fraudulent, deceptive, or misrepresentative.
(d)
Cancellation of permits.
(1) APHIS may cancel any outstanding permit whenever:
(i) We receive information subsequent to the issuance of the permit of circumstances that would constitute cause for the denial of an application for permit under paragraph (c) of this section; or
(ii) You, as the permittee, fail to maintain the safeguards or otherwise observe the conditions specified in the permit or in any applicable regulations.
(2) Upon cancellation of a permit, you must either:
(i) Surrender all restricted organisms to an APHIS inspector; or
(ii) Destroy all restricted organisms under the supervision of an APHIS inspector.
(e)
Appealing the denial of permit applications or revocation of permits.
If your permit application has been denied or your permit has been revoked, APHIS will inform you in writing, including by electronic methods, as promptly as circumstances permit and will include the reasons for the denial or revocation.

(b)
Inspection of premises.
Prior to issuing a permit to import restricted organisms, we will inspect the apiary or containment facility where you intend to contain the restricted organisms. In order to approve the apiary or containment facility, an inspector must determine that adequate safeguards are in place to prevent the release of diseases or parasites of bees, or of undesirable species or strains of honeybees. We will use the following criteria to determine whether adequate safeguards are in place:
(1)
Enclosed containment facilities.
(i) Will the facility's entryways, windows, and other structures, including water, air, and waste handling systems, contain the restricted organisms, parasites and pathogens, and prevent the entry of other organisms and unauthorized visitors?
(ii) Does the facility have operational and procedural safeguards in place to prevent the escape of the restricted organisms, parasites, and pathogens, and to prevent the entry of other organisms and unauthorized visitors?
(iii) Does the facility have a means of inactivating or sterilizing restricted organisms and any breeding materials, pathogens, parasites, containers, or other material?
(2)
Containment apiaries.
(i) Is the apiary located in an area devoid of indigenous bees and sufficiently isolated to prevent contact between indigenous bees and imported restricted organisms? Is the area extending from the apiary to the nearest indigenous bees constantly unsuitable for foraging individuals of the imported restricted organisms?
(ii) Does the apiary have sufficient physical barriers to prevent the entry of unauthorized visitors?
(iii) Does the apiary have operational and procedural safeguards in place to prevent the escape of the restricted organisms, parasites, and pathogens, and to prevent the entry of other organisms and unauthorized visitors?
(iv) Does the apiary have a means of inactivating or sterilizing restricted organisms, and any hives, wax, pathogens, parasites, containers, or other materials?
(3) Containment apiaries for honeybees resulting from germ plasm imported from nonapproved regions.
(i) Does the apiary have sufficient physical barriers to prevent the entry of unauthorized visitors?
(ii) Are there sufficient physical barriers (
e.g.
, excluders) in hives in the apiary to prevent the escape of all adult queen and drone honeybees resulting from the germ plasm?
(iii) Does the apiary have operational and procedural safeguards in place to prevent the escape of all queen and drone honeybees resulting from the germ plasm?
(iv) Does the apiary have a means of destroying colonies of honeybees with undesirable characteristics that may result from imported germ plasm?
(c)
Holding in containment.
(1) If we issue a permit for importing restricted organisms into an approved containment facility or apiary, you may not remove or release the restricted organisms, or the progeny or germ plasm
resulting from the restricted organisms, from the apiary or facility without our prior approval.
(2) You must allow us to inspect the apiary or facility and all documents associated with the importation or holding of restricted organisms at any time to determine whether safeguards are being maintained to prevent the release of the restricted organisms, their progeny and germ plasm, parasites, and pathogens.
(3) You must inform us immediately, but no later than 24 hours after detection, if restricted organisms escape from the facility
(d)
Release from containment apiary or facility.
(1) After rearing the restricted organisms in an approved containment facility or apiary through at least 4 months of active reproduction with no evidence of nonindigenous parasites or pathogens or of undesirable characteristics, you may submit a request to us for the release of the bees. The request must include:
(i) Inspection protocols;
(ii) Inspection frequencies;
(iii) Names and titles of inspectors;
(iv) Complete information, including laboratory reports, on detection of diseases and parasites in the population;
(v) Complete notes and observations on behavior, such as aggressiveness and swarming; and
(vi) Any other information or data relating to bee diseases, parasites, or adverse species or subspecies.
(2) Mail your request for release to the Permit Unit, PPQ, APHIS, 4700 River Road Unit 133, Riverdale, MD 20737-1236, or fax to (301) 734-8700.
(3) When we receive a complete request for release from containment, we will evaluate the request and determine whether the bees may be released. Our evaluation may include an environmental assessment or environmental impact statement prepared in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act. We may conduct an additional inspection of the bees during our evaluation of the request. You will receive a written statement as soon as circumstances allow that approves or denies your request for release of the bees.
