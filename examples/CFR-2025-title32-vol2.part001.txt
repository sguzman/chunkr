In most cases where civilian providers provide medical care and payment for such care has been by a TRICARE contractor, initial identification of potential third-party payers will be by the TRICARE contractor. In such cases, the TRICARE contractor is responsible for conducting a preliminary investigation and referring the case to designated appropriate claims authorities of the Uniformed Services.
(2)
Processing TRICARE claims.
When the TRICARE contractor initially identifies a claim as involving a potential third-party payer, it shall request additional information concerning the circumstances of the injury or disease and/or the identify of any potential third-party payer from the beneficiary or other responsible party unless adequate information is submitted with the claim. The TRICARE claim will be suspended and no payment issued pending receipt of the requested information. If the requested information is not received, the claim will be denied. A TRICARE beneficiary may expedite the processing of his or her TRICARE claim by submitting appropriate information with the first claim for treatment of an accidental injury. Third-party payer information normally is required only once concerning any single accidental injury on episode of care. Once the third-party payer information pertaining to a single incident or episode of care is received, subsequent claims associated with the same incident or episode of care may be processed to payment in the usual manner. If, however, the requested third-party payer information is not received, subsequent claims involving the same incident or episode of care will be suspended or denied as stated above.
(3)
Ascertaining total potential liability.
It is essential that the appropriate claims responsible for asserting the claim against the third-party payer receive from the TRICARE contractor a report of all amounts expended by the United States for care resulting from the incident upon which potential liability in the third party is based (including amounts paid by TRICARE for both inpatient and outpatient care). Prior to assertion and final settlement of a claim, it will be necessary for the responsible claims authority to secure from the TRICARE contractor updated information to insure that all amounts expended under TRICARE are included in the government's claim. It is equally important that information on future medical payments be obtained through the investigative process and included as a part of the government's claim. No TRICARE-related claim will be settled, compromised or waived without full consideration being given to the possible future medical payment aspects of the individual case.
(j)
Reporting requirements.
Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 1079a, all refunds and other amounts collected in the administration of TRICARE shall be credited to the appropriation available for that program for the fiscal year in which the refund or amount is collected. Therefore, the Department of Defense requires an annual report stating the number and dollar amount of claims asserted against, and the number and dollar amount of recoveries from third-party payers (including FMCRA recoveries) arising from the operation of the TRICARE. To facilitate the preparation of this report and to maintain program integrity, the following reporting requirements are established:
(1)
TRICARE contractors.
Each TRICARE contractor shall submit on or before January 31 of each year an annual report to the Director, TRICARE Management Activity, or a designee, covering the 12 months of the previous calendar year. This report shall contain, as a minimum, the number and total dollar of cases of potential third-party payer/FMCRA liability referred to uniformed services claims authorities for further investigation and collection. These figures are to be itemized by the states and uniformed services to which the cases are referred.
(2)
Uniformed Services.
Each uniformed service will submit to the Director, TRICARE Management Activity, or designee, an annual report covering the 12 calendar months of the previous year, setting forth, as a minimum, the number and total dollar amount of cases involving TRICARE payments received from TRICARE contractors, the number and dollar amount of cases involving TRICARE payments received from other sources, and the number and dollar amount of claims actually asserted against, and the dollar amount of recoveries from, third-payment payers or under the FMCRA. The report, itemized by state and foreign claims jurisdictions, shall be provided no later than February 28 of each year.
(3)
Implementation of the reporting requirements.
The Director, TRICARE Management Activity, or a designee shall issue guidance for implementation of the reporting requirements prescribed by this section.
[68 FR 6619, Feb. 10, 2003]
§ 199.13
TRICARE Dental Program.
(a)
General provisions
—(1)
Purpose.
This section prescribes guidelines and policies for the delivery and administration of the TRICARE Dental Program (TDP) of the Uniformed Services of the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, the Marine Corps, the Coast Guard, the Commissioned Corps of the U.S. Public Health Service (USPHS) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Corps. The TDP is a premium based indemnity dental insurance coverage plan that is available to specified categories of individuals who are qualified for these benefits by virtue of their relationship to one of the seven (7) Uniformed Services and their voluntary decision to accept enrollment in the plan and cost share (when applicable) with the Government in the premium cost of the benefits. The TDP is authorized by 10 U.S.C. 1076a, TRICARE dental program, and this section was previously titled the “Active Duty Dependents Dental Plan”. The TDP incorporates the former 10 U.S.C. 1076b, Selected Reserve dental insurance, and the section previously titled the “TRICARE Selected Reserve Dental Program”, § 199.21.
(2)
Applicability
—(i)
Geographic scope.
(A) The TDP is applicable geographically within the fifty (50) States of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. These areas are collectively referred to as the “CONUS (or Continental United States) service area”.
(B) Extension of the TDP to areas outside the CONUS service area. In accordance with the authority cited in 10 U.S.C. 1076a(h), the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) (ASD(HA)) may extend the TDP to areas other than those areas specified in paragraph (a)(2)(i)(A) of this section for the eligible members and eligible dependents of members of the Uniformed Services. These areas are collectively referred to as the “OCONUS (or outside the Continental United States) service area”. In extending the TDP outside the CONUS service area, the ASD(HA), or designee, is authorized to establish program elements, methods of administration and payment rates and procedures to providers that are different from those in effect for the CONUS service area to the extent the ASD(HA), or designee, determines necessary for the effective and efficient operation of the TDP. This includes provisions for preauthorization of care if the needed services are not available in a Uniformed Service overseas dental treatment facility and payment by the Department of certain cost-shares (or co-payments) and other portions of a provider's billed charges for certain beneficiary categories. Other differences may occur based on limitations in the
availability and capabilities of the Uniformed Service overseas dental treatment facility and a particular nation's civilian sector providers in certain areas. These differences include varying licensure and certification requirements of OCONUS providers, Uniformed Service provider selection criteria and local results of provider selection, referral, beneficiary pre-authorization and marketing procedures, and care for beneficiaries residing in distant areas. The Director, Office of Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (OCHAMPUS) shall issue guidance, as necessary, to implement the provisions of paragraph (a)(2)(i)(B). Beneficiaries will be eligible for the same TDP benefits in the OCONUS service area although services may not be available or accessible in all OCONUS countries.
(ii)
Agency.
The provisions of this section apply throughout the Department of Defense (DoD), the United States Coast Guard, the USPHS and NOAA.
(iii)
Exclusion of benefit services performed in military dental care facilities.
Except for emergency treatment, dental care provided outside the United States, services incidental to noncovered services, and services provided under paragraph (a)(2)(iv), dependents of active duty, Selected Reserve and Individual Ready Reserve members enrolled in the TDP may not obtain those services that are benefits of the TDP in military dental care facilities, as long as those covered benefits are available for cost-sharing under the TDP. Enrolled dependents of active duty, Selected Reserve and Individual Ready Reserve members may continue to obtain noncovered services from military dental care facilities subject to the provisions for space available care.
(iv)
Exception to the exclusion of services performed in military dental care facilities.
(A) Dependents who are 12 years of age or younger and are covered by a dental plan established under this section may be treated by postgraduate dental residents in a dental treatment facility of the uniformed services under a graduate dental education program accredited by the American Dental Association if
(
1
) Treatment of pediatric dental patients is necessary in order to satisfy an accreditation standard of the American Dental Association that is applicable to such program, or training in pediatric dental care is necessary for the residents to be professionally qualified to provide dental care for dependent children accompanying members of the uniformed services outside the United States; and
(
2
) The number of pediatric patients at such facility is insufficient to support satisfaction of the accreditation or professional requirements in pediatric dental care that apply to such programs or students.
(B) The total number of dependents treated in all facilities of the uniformed services under paragraph (a)(2)(iv) in a fiscal year may not exceed 2,000.
(3)
Authority and responsibility
—(i)
Legislative authority
—(A)
Joint regulations.
10 U.S.C. 1076a authorized the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and the Secretary of Transportation, to prescribe regulations for the administration of the TDP.
(B)
Administration.
10 U.S.C. 1073 authorizes the Secretary of Defense to administer the TDP for the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps under DoD jurisdiction, the Secretary of Transportation to administer the TDP for the Coast Guard, when the Coast Guard is not operating as a service in the Navy, and the Secretary of Health and Human Services to administer the TDP for the Commissioned Corps of the USPHS and the NOAA Corps.
(ii)
Organizational delegations and assignments
—(A)
Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) (ASD(HA)).
The Secretary of Defense, by 32 CFR part 367, delegated authority to the ASD(HA) to provide policy guidance, management control, and coordination as required for all DoD health and medical resources and functional areas including health benefit programs. Implementing authority is contained in 32 CFR part 367. For additional implementing authority see § 199.1. Any guidelines or policy necessary for implementation of this § 199.13 shall be issued by the Director, OCHAMPUS.
(B)
Evidence of eligibility.
DoD, through the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS), is responsible for establishing and maintaining a listing of persons eligible to receive benefits under the TDP.
(4)
Preemption of State and local laws.
(i) Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 1103 and section 8025 (fourth proviso) of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 1994, DoD has determined that, in the administration of 10 U.S.C. chapter 55, preemption of State and local laws relating to health insurance, prepaid health plans, or other health care delivery or financing methods is necessary to achieve important Federal interests, including, but not limited to, the assurance of uniform national health programs for Uniformed Service beneficiaries and the operation of such programs at the lowest possible cost to DoD, that have a direct and substantial effect on the conduct of military affairs and national security policy of the United States. This determination is applicable to the dental services contracts that implement this section.
(ii) Based on the determination set forth in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section, any State or local law relating to health or dental insurance, prepaid health or dental plans, or other health or dental care delivery or financing methods is preempted and does not apply in connection with the TDP contract. Any such law, or regulation pursuant to such law, is without any force or effect, and State or local governments have no legal authority to enforce them in relation to the TDP contract. (However, DoD may, by contract, establish legal obligations on the part of the dental plan contractor to conform with requirements similar or identical to requirements of State or local laws or regulations.)
(iii) The preemption of State and local laws set forth in paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section includes State and local laws imposing premium taxes on health or dental insurance carriers or underwriters or other plan managers, or similar taxes on such entities. Such laws are laws relating to health insurance, prepaid health plans, or other health care delivery or financing methods, within the meaning of the statutes identified in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section. Preemption, however, does not apply to taxes, fees, or other payments on net income or profit realized by such entities in the conduct of business relating to DoD health services contracts, if those taxes, fees, or other payments are applicable to a broad range of business activity. For purposes of assessing the effect of Federal preemption of State and local taxes and fees in connection with DoD health and dental services contracts, interpretations shall be consistent with those applicable to the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program under 5 U.S.C. 8909(f).
(5)
Plan funds
—(i)
Funding sources.
The funds used by the TDP are appropriated funds furnished by the Congress through the annual appropriation acts for DoD, the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Transportation and funds collected by the Uniformed Services or contractor through payroll deductions or through direct billing as premium shares from beneficiaries.
(ii)
Disposition of funds.
TDP funds are paid by the Government (or in the case of direct billing, by the beneficiary) as premiums to an insurer, service, or prepaid dental care organization under a contract negotiated by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, under the provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) (48 CFR chapter 1).
(iii)
Plan.
The Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee provides an insurance policy, service plan, or prepaid contract of benefits in accordance with those prescribed by law and regulation; as interpreted and adjudicated in accord with the policy, service plan, or contract and a dental benefits brochure; and as prescribed by requirements of the dental plan contractor's contract with the Government.
(iv)
Contracting out.
The method of delivery of the TDP is through a competitively procured contract. The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, is responsible for negotiating, under provisions of the FAR, a contract for dental benefits insurance or prepayment that includes responsibility for:
(A) Development, publication, and enforcement of benefit policy, exclusions, and limitations in compliance
with the law, regulation, and the contract provisions;
(B) Adjudicating and processing claims; and conducting related supporting activities, such as enrollment, disenrollment, collection of premiums, eligibility verification, provider relations, and beneficiary communications.
(6)
Role of Health Benefits Advisor (HBA).
The HBA is appointed (generally by the commander of an Uniformed Services medical treatment facility) to serve as an advisor to patients and staff in matters involving the TDP. The HBA may assist beneficiaries in applying for benefits, in the preparation of claims, and in their relations with OCHAMPUS and the dental plan contractor. However, the HBA is not responsible for the TDP's policies and procedures and has no authority to make benefit determinations or obligate the TDP's funds. Advice given to beneficiaries by HBAs as to determination of benefits or level of payment is not binding on OCHAMPUS or the dental plan contractor.
(7)
Right to information.
As a condition precedent to the provision of benefits hereunder, the Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, shall be entitled to receive information from an authorized provider or other person, institution, or organization (including a local, State, or United States Government agency) providing services or supplies to the beneficiary for which claims for benefits are submitted. While establishing enrollment and eligibility, benefits, and benefit utilization and performance reporting information standards, the Government has established and does maintain a system of records for dental information under the TDP. By contract, the Government audits the adequacy and accuracy of the dental plan contractor's system of records and requires access to information and records to meet plan accountabilities, to assist in contractor surveillance and program integrity investigations and to audit OCONUS financial transactions where the Department has a financial stake. Such information and records may relate to attendance, testing, monitoring, examination, or diagnosis of dental disease or conditions; or treatment rendered; or services and supplies furnished to a beneficiary; and shall be necessary for the accurate and efficient administration and payment of benefits under this plan. To assist in claims adjudication, grievance and fraud investigations, and the appeals process, and before an interim or final determination can be made on a claim of benefits, a beneficiary or active duty, Selected Reserve or individual Ready Reserve member must provide particular additional information relevant to the requested determination, when necessary. Failure to provide the requested information may result in denial of the claim and inability to effectively investigate the grievance or fraud or process the appeal. The recipient of such information shall in every case hold such records confidential except when:
(i) Disclosure of such information is necessary to the determination by a provider or the dental plan contractor of beneficiary enrollment or eligibility for coverage of specific services;
(ii) Disclosure of such information is authorized specifically by the beneficiary;
(iii) Disclosure is necessary to permit authorized Government officials to investigate and prosecute criminal actions;
(iv) Disclosure constitutes a routine use of a routine use of a record which is compatible with the purpose for which it was collected. This includes a standard and acceptable business practice commonly used among dental insurers which is consistent with the principle of preserving confidentiality of personal information and detailed clinical data. For example, the release of utilization information for the purpose of determining eligibility for certain services, such as the number of dental prophylaxis procedures performed for a beneficiary, is authorized;
(v) Disclosure is pursuant to an order from a court of competent jurisdiction; or
(vi) Disclosure by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, is for the purpose of determining the applicability of, and implementing the provisions of, other dental benefits coverage or entitlement.
(8)
Utilization review and quality assurance.
Claims submitted for benefits under the TDP are subject to review by
the Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, for quality of care and appropriate utilization. The Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, is responsible for appropriate utilization review and quality assurance standards, norms, and criteria consistent with the level of benefits.
(b)
Definitions.
For most definitions applicable to the provisions of this section, refer to Sec. 199.2. The following definitions apply only to this section:
(1)
Assignment of benefits.
Acceptance by a nonparticipating provider of payment directly from the insurer while reserving the right to charge the beneficiary or active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member for any remaining amount of the fees for services which exceeds the prevailing fee allowance of the insurer.
(2)
Authorized provider.
A dentist, dental hygienist, or certified and licensed anesthetist specifically authorized to provide benefits under the TDP in paragraph (f) of this section.
(3)
Beneficiary.
A dependent of an active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member, or a member of the Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve, who has been enrolled in the TDP, and has been determined to be eligible for benefits, as set forth in paragraph (c) of this section.
(4)
Beneficiary liability.
The legal obligation of the beneficiary, his or her estate, or responsible family member to pay for the costs of dental care or treatment received. Specifically, for the purposes of services and supplies covered by the TDP, beneficiary liability including cost-sharing amounts or any amount above the network maximum allowable charge where the provider selected by the beneficiary is not a participating provider or a provider within an approved alternative delivery system. In cases where a nonparticipating provider does not accept assignment of benefits.
(5)
By report.
Dental procedures which are authorized as benefits only in unusual circumstances requiring justification of exceptional conditions related to otherwise authorized procedures. These services are further defined in paragraph (e) of this section.
(6)
Contingency operation.
Defined in 10 U.S.C. 101(a)(13) as a military operation designated as a contingency operation by the Secretary of Defense or a military operation that results in the exercise of authorities for ordering Reserve Component members to active duty without their consent and is therefore automatically a contingency operation.
(7)
Cost-share.
The amount of money for which the beneficiary (or active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member) is responsible in connection with otherwise covered dental services (other than disallowed amounts) as set forth in paragraph (e) of this section. A cost-share may also be referred to as a “co-payment.”
(8)
Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS).
The automated system that is composed of two (2) phases:
(i) Enrolling all active duty, Reserve and retired service members, their dependents, and the dependents of deceased service members; and
(ii) Verifying their eligibility for health care benefits in the direct care facilities and through the TDP.
(9)
Dental hygienist.
Practitioner in rendering complete oral prophylaxis services, applying medication, performing dental radiography, and providing dental education services with a certificate, associate degree, or bachelor's degree in the field, and licensed by an appropriate authority.
(10)
Dentist.
Doctor of Dental Medicine (D.M.D.) or Doctor of Dental Surgery (D.D.S.) who is licensed to practice dentistry by an appropriate authority.
(11)
Diagnostic services.
Category of dental services including:
(i) Clinical oral examinations;
(ii) Radiographic examinations; and
(iii) Diagnostic laboratory tests and examinations provided in connection with other dental procedures authorized as benefits of the TDP and further defined in paragraph (e) of the section.

The etiology, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases and injuries affecting the dental pulp, tooth root, and periapical tissue as further defined in paragraph (e) of this section.
(13)
Initial determination.
A formal written decision on a TDP claim, a request for TDP benefit pre-determination, a request by a provider for approval as an authorized provider, or a decision suspending, excluding or terminating a provider as an authorized provider under the TDP. Rejection of a claim or pre-determination, or of a request for benefit or provider authorization for failure to comply with administrative requirements, including failure to submit reasonably requested information, is not an initial determination. Responses to general or specific inquiries regarding TDP benefits are not initial determinations.
(14)
Nonparticipating provider.
A dentist or dental hygienist that furnished dental services to a TDP beneficiary, but who has not agreed to participate in the contractor's network and accept reimbursement in accordance with the contractor's network agreement. A nonparticipating provider looks to the beneficiary or active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member for final responsibility for payment of his or her charge, but may accept payment (assignment of benefits) directly from the insurer or assist the beneficiary in filing the claim for reimbursement by the dental plan contractor. Where the nonparticipating provider does not accept payment directly from the insurer, the insurer pays the beneficiary or active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member, not the provider.
(15)
Oral and maxillofacial surgery.
Surgical procedures performed in the oral cavity as further defined in paragraph (e) of this section.
(16)
Orthodontics.
The supervision, guidance, and correction of the growing or mature dentofacial structures, including those conditions that require movement of teeth or correction of malrelationships and malformations of their related structures and adjustment of relationships between and among teeth and facial bones by the application of forces and/or the stimulation and redirection of functional forces within the craniofacial complex as further defined in paragraph (e) of this section.
(17)
Participating provider.
A dentist or dental hygienist who has agreed to participate in the contractor's network and accept reimbursement in accordance with the contractor's network agreement as the total charge (even though less than the actual billed amount), including provision for payment to the provider by the beneficiary (or active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member) or any cost-share for covered services.
(18)
Party to the initial determination.
Includes the TDP, a beneficiary of the TDP and a participating provider of services whose interests have been adjudicated by the initial determination. In addition, provider who has been denied approval as an authorized TDP provider is a party to the initial determination, as is a provider who is suspended, excluded or terminated as an authorized provider, unless the provider is excluded or suspended by another agency of the Federal Government, a state, or a local licensing authority.
(19)
Periodontics.
The examination, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases affecting the supporting structures of the teeth as further defined in paragraph (e) of this section.

Restoration of teeth including those procedures commonly described as amalgam restorations, resin restorations, pin retention, and stainless steel crowns for primary teeth as further defined in paragraph (e) of this section.
(c)
Eligibility and enrollment
—(1)
General.
10 U.S.C. 1076a, 1072(2)(A), (D), or (I), 1072(6), 10143 and 10144 set forth those persons who are eligible for voluntary enrollment in the TDP. A determination that a person is eligible for voluntary enrollment does not automatically entitle that person to benefit payments. The person must be enrolled in accordance with the provisions set forth in this section and meet any additional eligibility requirements in this part in order for dental benefits to be extended.
(2)
Eligibility
—(i)
Persons eligible.
Eligibility for the TDP is continuous in situations where the sponsor or member changes status between any of these eligible categories and there is no break in service or transfer to a non-eligible status.
(A) A person who bears one of the following relationships to an active duty member (under a call or order that does not specify a period of thirty (30) days or less) or a member of the Selected Reserve (as specified in 10 U.S.C. 10143) or Individual Ready Reserve (as specified in 10 U.S.C. 10144):
(
1
)
Spouse.
A lawful husband or wife, regardless of whether or not dependent upon the active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member.
(
2
)
Child.
To be eligible, the child must be unmarried and meet one of the requirements set forth in section 199.3(b)(2)(ii)(A)-(F) or 199.3(b)(2)(ii)(H).
(B) A member of the Selected Reserve of the Ready Reserve (as specified in 10 U.S.C. 10143).
(C) A member of the Individual Ready Reserve of the Ready Reserve (as specified in 10 U.S.C. 10144(b)) who is subject to being ordered to active duty involuntarily in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 12304.
(D) All other members of the Individual Ready Reserve of the Ready Reserve (as specified in 10 U.S.C. 10144(a)).
(ii)
Determination of eligibility status and evidence of eligibility
—(A)
Eligibility determination responsibility of the Uniformed Services.
Determination of a person's eligibility for the TDP is the responsibility of the member's Uniformed Service. For the purpose of program integrity, the appropriate Uniformed Service shall, upon request of the Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, review the eligibility of a specified person when there is reason to question the eligibility status. In such cases, a report on the result of the review and any action taken will be submitted to the Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee.
(B)
Procedures for determination of eligibility.
Uniformed Service identification cards do not distinguish eligibility for the TDP. Procedures for the determination of eligibility are identified in § 199.3(f)(2), except that Uniformed Service identification cards do not provide evidence of eligibility for the TDP. Although OCHAMPUS and the dental plan contractor must make determinations concerning a member or dependent's eligibility in order to ensure proper enrollment and proper disbursement of appropriated funds, ultimate responsibility for resolving a member or dependent's eligibility rests with the Uniformed Services.
(C)
Evidence of eligibility required.
Eligibility and enrollment in the TDP will be verified through the DEERS. Eligibility and enrollment information established and maintained in the DEERS file is the only acceptable evidence of TDP eligibility and enrollment. It is the responsibility of the active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member or TDP beneficiary, parent, or legal representative, when appropriate, to provide adequate evidence for entry into the DEERS file to establish eligibility for the TDP, and to ensure that all changes in status that may affect eligibility are reported immediately to the appropriate Uniformed Service for action. Ineligibility for benefits is presumed in the absence of prescribed eligibility evidence in the DEERS file.
(3)
Enrollment
—(i)
Previous plans
—(A)
Basic Active Duty Dependents Dental Benefit Plan.
The Basic Active Duty Dependents Dental Plan was effective from August 1, 1987, up to the date of implementation of the Expanded Active Duty Dependents Dental Benefit Plan. The Basic Active Duty Dependents Dental Benefit Plan terminated upon implementation of the expanded plan.
(B)
Expanded Active Duty Dependents Dental Benefit Plan.
The Expanded Active Duty Dependents Dental Benefit Plan (also known as the TRICARE
Family Member Dental Plan) was effective from August 1, 1993, up to the date of implementation of the TDP. The Expanded Active Duty Dependents Dental Benefit Plan terminates upon implementation of the TDP.
(ii)
TRICARE Dental Program (TDP)
—(A)
Election of coverage.
(
1
) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(A)(2) of this section, active duty, Selected Reserve and Individual Ready Reserve service members may voluntarily elect to enroll their eligible dependents and members of the Selected Reserve and Individual Ready Reserve may voluntarily elect to enroll themselves following implementation of the TDP. In order to obtain TDP coverage, written or telephonic election by the active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member must be made and will be accomplished by submission or telephonic completion of an application to the dental plan contractor. This election can also be accomplished via electronic means.
(
2
) Eligible dependents of active duty members enrolled in the Expanded Active Duty Dependents Dental Benefit Plan at the time of implementation of the TDP will automatically be enrolled in the TDP. Eligible members of the Selected Reserve enrolled in the TRICARE Selected Reserve Dental Program at the time of implementation of the TDP will automatically be enrolled in the TDP. No election to enroll in the TDP will be required by the active duty or Selected Reserve member.
(B)
Premiums
—(
1
) Enrollment will be by either single or family premium as defined as follows:
(
i
) Single premium. One (1) covered eligible dependent or one (1) covered eligible Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member.
(
ii
) Family premium. Two (2) or more covered eligible dependents. Under the family premium, all eligible dependents of the active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member are enrolled.
(
2
)
Exceptions.
(
i
) An active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member may elect to enroll only those eligible dependents residing in one (1) location when the active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member has eligible dependents residing in two or more geographically separate locations (e.g., children living with a divorced spouse; a child attending college).
(
ii
) Instances where a dependent of an active duty member requires a hospital or special treatment environment (due to a medical, physical handicap, or mental condition) for dental care otherwise covered by the TDP, the dependent may be excluded from TDP enrollment and may continue to receive care from a military treatment facility.
(
iii
) A member of the Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve may enroll separately from his or her eligible dependents. A member of the Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve does not have to be enrolled in order for his or her eligible dependents to enroll under the TDP.
(C)
Enrollment period
—(
1
)
General.
Enrollment of eligible dependents or members is for a period of one (1) year followed by month-to-month enrollment as long as the active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member chooses to continue enrollment. Active duty members may enroll their eligible dependents and eligible members of the Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve may enroll themselves or their eligible dependents in the TDP provided there is an intent to remain on active duty or as a member of the Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve (or any combination thereof without a break in service or transfer to a non-eligible status) for a period of not less than one (1) year by the service member and their parent Uniformed Service. Beneficiaries enrolled in the TDP must remain enrolled for a minimum period of one (1) year unless one of the conditions for disenrollment specified in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(E) of this section is met.
(
2
)
Special enrollment period for Reserve component members ordered to active duty in support of contingency operations.
The mandatory twelve (12) month enrollment period does not apply to Reserve component members ordered to active duty (other than for training) in support of a contingency operation as designated by the Secretary of Defense. Affected Reserve component members
may enroll in the TDP only if their orders specify that they are ordered to active duty in support of a contingency operation, as defined by 10 U.S.C., for a period of thirty-one (31) days or more. An affected Reserve component member must elect to enroll in the TDP and complete the enrollment application within thirty (30) days following entry on active duty or within sixty (60) days following implementation of the TDP. Following enrollment, beneficiaries must remain enrolled, with the member paying premiums, until the end of the member's active duty period in support of the contingency operation or twelve (12) months, whichever occurs first unless one of the conditions for disenrollment specified in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(E) of this section is met.

)
Reserve component members separated from active duty in support of a contingency operation.
When a member of a reserve component who is separated from active duty to which called or ordered in support of a contingency operation if the active duty is for more than 30 days, the member becomes eligible for Transitional Health Care pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 1145(a) and the member is entitled to dental care to which a member of the uniformed services on active duty for more than 30 days is entitled. Thus the member has no requirement for the TDP and is not eligible to purchase the TDP. Upon the termination of Transitional Health Care
eligibility, the member regains TDP eligibility and is reenrolled, if previously enrolled.
(

)
Dependents of members separated from active duty in support of a contingency operation.
Dependents of a member of a reserve component who is separated from active duty to which called or ordered in support of a contingency operation if the active duty is active for more than 30 days maintain their eligibility and previous enrollment, subject to eligibility, enrollment and disenrollment provisions described in this section and in the TDP contract. During the member's Transitional Health Care eligibility, the dependents are considered family members of Reserve Component members.
(
iii
)
Members separated from active duty and not covered by 10 U.S.C. 1145(a)(2)(B).
When the previously enrolled active duty member is transferred back to the Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve, and is not covered by 10 U.S.C. 1145(a)(2)(B), without a break in service, the member regains TDP eligibility and is reenrolled; however, enrolled dependents maintain their eligibility and previous enrollment subject to eligibility, enrollment and disenrollment provisions described in this section and in the TDP contract.
(

)
Survivor eligibility.
Eligible dependents of active duty members who die while on active duty for a period of more than 30 days and eligible dependents of members of the Ready Reserve (
i.e.,
Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve, as specified in 10 U.S.C. 10143 and 10144(b) respectively) who die, shall be eligible for survivor enrollment in the TDP. During the period of survivor enrollment, the government will pay both the government and the eligible dependent's portion of the premium share. This survivor enrollment shall be up to (3) three years from the date of the member's death, except that, in the case of a dependent of the deceased who is described in 10 U.S.C. 1072(2)(D) or (I), the period of survivor enrollment shall be the longer of the following periods beginning on the date of the member's death:

Changes in status of dependent
—(
i
)
Divorce.
A spouse separated from an active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member by a final divorce decree loses all eligibility based on his or her former marital relationship as of 11:59 p.m. of the last day of the month in which the divorce becomes final. The eligibility of the active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member's own children (including adopted and eligible illegitimate children) is unaffected by the divorce. An unadopted stepchild, however, loses eligibility with the termination of the marriage, also as of 11:59 p.m. of the last day of the month in which the divorce becomes final.
(
ii
)
Annulment.
A spouse whose marriage to an active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member is dissolved by annulment loses eligibility as of 11:59 p.m. of the last day of the month in which the court grants the annulment order. The fact that the annulment legally declares the entire marriage void from its inception does not affect the termination date of eligibility. When there are children, the eligibility of the active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member's own
children (including adopted and eligible illegitimate children) is unaffected by the annulment. An unadopted stepchild, however, loses eligibility with the annulment of the marriage, also as of 11:59 p.m. of the last day of the month in which the court grants the annulment order.
(
iii
)
Adoption.
A child of an active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member who is adopted by a person, other than a person whose dependents are eligible for TDP benefits while the active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member is living, thereby severing the legal relationship between the child and the active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member, loses eligibility as of 11:59 p.m. of the last day of the month in which the adoption becomes final.
(
iv
)
Marriage of child.
A child of an active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member who marries a person whose dependents are not eligible for the TDP, loses eligibility as of 11:59 p.m. on the last day of the month in which the marriage takes place. However, should the marriage be terminated by death, divorce, or annulment before the child is twenty-one (21) years old, the child again become eligible for enrollment as a dependent as of 12:00 a.m. of the first day of the month following the month in which the occurrence takes place that terminates the marriage and continues up to age twenty-one (21) if the child does not remarry before that time. If the marriage terminates after the child's 21st birthday, there is no reinstatement of eligibility.
(
v
)
Disabling illness or injury of child age 21 or 22 who has eligibility based on his or her student status.
A child twenty-one (21) or twenty-two (22) years old who is pursuing a full-time course of higher education and who, either during the school year or between semesters, suffers a disabling illness or injury with resultant inability to resume attendance at the institution remains eligible for the TDP for six (6) months after the disability is removed or until the student passes his or her 23rd birthday, whichever occurs first. However, if recovery occurs before the 23rd birthday and there is resumption of a full-time course of higher education, the TDP can be continued until the 23rd birthday. The normal vacation periods during an established school year do not change the eligibility status of a dependent child twenty-one (21) or twenty-two (22) years old in full-time student status. Unless an incapacitating condition existed before, and at the time of, a dependent child's 21st birthday, a dependent child twenty-one (21) or twenty-two (22) years old in student status does not have eligibility related to mental or physical incapacity as described in § 199.3(b)(2)(iv)(C)(

)
Option to disenroll as a result of a change in active duty station.
When an active duty member transfers with enrolled dependents to a duty station where space-available dental care for the enrolled dependents is readily available at the local Uniformed Service dental treatment facility, the active duty member may elect, within ninety (90) calendar days of the transfer, to disenroll their dependents from the TDP. If the active duty member is later transferred to a duty station where dental care for the dependents is not available in the local Uniformed Service dental treatment facility, the active duty member may reenroll their eligible dependents in the TDP provided the member, as of the date of reenrollment, otherwise meets the requirements for enrollment, including the intent to remain on active duty for a period of not less than one (1) year. This disenrollment provision does not apply to enrolled dependents of members of the Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve or to enrolled members of the Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve.
(

)
Option to disenroll due to transfer to OCONUS service area.
When an enrolled dependent of an active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member or an enrolled Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member relocates to locations within the OCONUS service area, the active
duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member may elect, within ninety (90) calendar days of the relocation, to disenroll their dependents from the TDP, or in the case of enrolled members of the Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve, to disenroll themselves from the TDP. The active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member may reenroll their eligible dependents, or in the case of members of the Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve, may reenroll themselves in the TDP provided the member, as of the date of reenrollment, otherwise meets the requirements for enrollment, including the intent to remain on active duty or as a member of the Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve (or any combination thereof without a break in service or transfer to a non-eligible status) for a period of not less than one (1) year.
(

)
Option to disenroll after an initial one (1) year enrollment.
When a dependent's enrollment under an active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member or a Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member's own enrollment has been in effect for a continuous period of one (1) year, the active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member may disenroll their dependents, or in the case of enrolled members of the Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve may disenroll themselves at any time following procedures as set up by the dental plan contractor. Subsequent to the disenrollment, the active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member may reenroll their eligible dependents, or in the case of members of the Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve may reenroll themselves, for another minimum period of one (1) year. If, during any one (1) year enrollment period, the active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member disenrolls their dependents, or in the case of members of the Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve disenrolls themselves, for reasons other than those listed in this paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(E) or fails to make premium payments, dependents enrolled under the active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member, or enrolled members of the Selected Reserve and Individual Ready Reserve, will be subject to a lock-out period of twelve (12) months. Following this period of time, active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve members will be able to reenroll their eligible dependents, or members of the Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve will be able to reenroll themselves, if they so choose. The twelve (12) month lock-out period applies to enrolled dependents of a Reserve component member who disenrolls for reasons other than those listed in this paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(E) or fails to make premium payments after the member has enrolled pursuant to paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(C) of this section.

) TRICARE Dental Program coverage shall terminate for members who no longer qualify for the TRICARE Dental Program as specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, with one exception. If a member is involuntarily separated from the Selected Reserve under other than adverse conditions, as characterized by the Secretary concerned, and TRICARE Dental Program coverage is in effect for the member and/or the family on the last day of his or her membership in the Selected Reserve; then the TRICARE Dental Program coverage that was actually in effect may terminate no earlier than 180 days after the date on which the member is separated from the Selected Reserve. This exception expires December 31, 2018.

When more than twenty-five (25) percent or more than two hundred (200) enrollees in a specific five (5) digit zip code area are unable to obtain a periodic or initial (non-emergency) dentistry appointment with a network provider within twenty-one (21) calendar days and within thirty-five (35) miles of the enrollee's place of residence, then the TRICARE Management Activity (TMA) will designate that area as “non-compliant with the access standard.” Once so designated, the dental program contractor will reimburse the beneficiary, or active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member, or the nonparticipating provider selected by enrollees in that area (or a subset of the area or nearby zip codes in other five (5) digit zip code areas as determined by TMA) at the level of the provider's usual fees less the applicable enrollee cost-share, if any. TMA shall determine when such area becomes compliant with the access standards. This access standard and associated liability does not apply to care received in the OCONUS service area.
(iii)
Maximum coverage amounts.
Beneficiaries are subject to an annual maximum coverage amount for non-orthodontic dental benefits and a lifetime maximum coverage amount for orthodontics as established by the ASD (HA) or designee.
(f)
Authorized providers
—(1)
General.
Beneficiaries may seek covered services from any provider who is fully licensed and approved to provide dental care or covered anesthesia benefits in the state where the provider is located. This includes licensed dental hygienists, practicing within the scope of their licensure, subject to any restrictions a state licensure or legislative body imposes regarding their status as independent providers of care.
(2)
Authorized provider status does not guarantee payment of benefits.
The fact that a provider is “authorized” is not to be construed to mean that the TDP will automatically pay a claim for services or supplies provided by such a provider. The Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, also must determine if the patient is an eligible beneficiary, whether the services or supplies billed are authorized and medically necessary, and whether any of the authorized exclusions of otherwise qualified providers presented in this section apply.
(3)
Utilization review and quality assurance.
Services and supplies furnished by providers of care shall be subject to utilization review and quality assurance standards, norms, and criteria established under the TDP. Utilization review and quality assurance assessments shall be performed under the TDP consistent with the nature and level of benefits of the plan, and shall include analysis of the data and findings by the dental plan contractor from other dental accounts.
(4)
Provider required.
In order to be considered benefits, all services and supplies shall be rendered by, prescribed by, or furnished at the direction of, or on the order of a TDP authorized provider practicing within the scope of his or her license.
(5)
Participating provider.
An authorized provider may elect to participate as a network provider in the dental plan contractor's network and any such election will apply to all TDP beneficiaries. The authorized provider may not participate on a claim-by-claim basis. The participating provide must agree to accept, within one (1) day of a request for appointment, beneficiaries in need of emergency palliative treatment. Payment to the participating provider is based on the methodology specified in paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section. The fee or charge determinations are binding upon the provider in accordance with the dental plan contractor's procedures for participation in the network. Payment is made directly to the participating provider, and the participating provider may only charge the beneficiary the applicable percent cost-share of the dental plan contractor's allowable charge for those benefit categories as specified in paragraph (e) of this section, in addition to the full charges for any services not authorized as benefits.
(6)
Nonparticipating provider.
An authorized provider may elect to not participate for all TDP beneficiaries and request the beneficiary or active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member to pay any amount of the provider's billed charge in excess of the dental plan contractor's determination of allowable charges (to include the appropriate cost-share). Neither the Government nor the dental plan contractor shall have any responsibility for any amounts over the allowable charges as determined by the dental plan contractor, except where the dental plan contractor is unable to identify a participating provider of care within thirty-five (35) miles of the beneficiary's place of residence with appointment availability within twenty-one (21) calendar days. In such instances of the nonavailability of a participating provider and in accordance with the provisions of the dental contract, the nonparticipating provider located within thirty-five (35) miles of the beneficiary's place of residence shall be paid his or her usual fees (either by the beneficiary or the dental plan contractor if the beneficiary elected assignment of benefits), less the percent cost-share as specified in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section.
(i)
Assignment of benefits.
A nonparticipating provider may accept assignment of benefits for claims (for beneficiaries certifying their willingness to make such assignment of benefits) by filing the claims completed with the assistance of the beneficiary or active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member for direct payment by the dental plan contractor to the provider.
(ii)
No assignment of benefits.
A nonparticipating provider for all beneficiaries may request that the beneficiary or active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member file the claim directly with the dental plan contractor, making arrangements with the beneficiary or active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member for direct payment by the beneficiary or active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member.
(7)
Alternative delivery system
—(i)
General.
Alternative delivery systems may be established by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, as authorized providers. Only dentists, dental hygienists and licensed anesthetists shall be authorized to provide or direct the provision of authorized services and supplies in an approved alternative delivery system.
(ii)
Defined.
An alternative delivery system may be any approved arrangement for a preferred provider organization, capitation plan, dental health maintenance or clinic organization, or other contracted arrangement which is approved by OCHAMPUS in accordance with requirements and guidelines.
(iii)
Elective or exclusive arrangement.
Alternative delivery systems may be established by contract or other arrangement on either an elective or exclusive basis for beneficiary selection of participating and authorized providers in accordance with contractual requirements and guidelines.
(iv)
Provider election of participation.
Otherwise authorized providers must be provided with the opportunity of applying for participation in an alternative delivery system and of achieving participation status based on reasonable criteria for timeliness of application, quality of care, cost containment, geographic location, patient availability, and acceptance of reimbursement allowance.
(v)
Limitation on authorized providers.
Where exclusive alternative delivery systems are established, only providers participating in the alternative delivery system are authorized providers of care. In such instances, the TDP shall continue to pay beneficiary claims for services rendered by otherwise authorized providers in accordance with established rules for reimbursement of nonparticipating providers where the beneficiary has established a patient relationship with the nonparticipating provider prior to the TDP's proposal to subcontract with the alternative delivery system.
(vi)
Charge agreements.
Where the alternative delivery system employs a discounted fee-for-service reimbursement methodology or schedule of charges or rates which includes all or most dental services and procedures recognized by the American Dental Association's Council on Dental Care Program's Code on Dental Procedures and Nomenclature, the discounts or schedule of charges or rates for all dental services and procedures shall be extended by its participating providers to beneficiaries of the TDP as an incentive for beneficiary participation in the alternative delivery system.
(g)
Benefit payment
—(1)
General.
TDP benefits payments are made either directly to the provider or to the beneficiary or active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member, depending on the manner in which the claim is submitted or the terms of the subcontract of an alternative delivery system with the dental plan contractor.
(2)
Benefit payment.
Beneficiaries are not required to utilize participating providers. For beneficiaries who do use these participating providers, however, these providers shall not balance bill any amount in excess of the maximum payment allowed by the dental plan contractor for covered services. Beneficiaries using nonparticipating providers may be balance-billed amounts in excess of the dental plan contractor's determination of allowable charges. The following general requirements for the TDP benefit payment methodology shall be met, subject to
modifications and exceptions approved by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee:
(i) Nonparticipating providers (or the Beneficiaries or active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve members for unassigned claims) shall be reimbursed at the lesser of the provider's actual charge: Or the network maximum allowable charge for similar services for that same locality (region) or state, whichever is lower, subject to the exception listed in paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section, less any cost-share amount due for authorized services. The network maximum allowable charge is the maximum negotiated fee between the dental contractor and any TDP participating provider for similar services covered by the dental plan in that same locality (region) or state.
(ii) Participating providers shall be reimbursed in accordance with the contractor's network agreements, less any cost-share amount due for authorized services.
(3)
Fraud, abuse, and conflict of interest.
The provisions of § 199.9 shall apply except for § 199.9(e). All references to “CHAMPUS contractors”, “CHAMPUS beneficiaries” and “CHAMPUS providers” in § 199.9 shall be construed to mean the “dental plan contractor”, “TDP beneficiaries” and “TPD providers” respectively for the purposes of this section. Examples of fraud include situations in which ineligible persons not enrolled in the TDP obtain care and file claims for benefits under the name and identification of a beneficiary; or when providers submit claims for services and supplies not rendered to Beneficiaries; or when a participating provider bills the beneficiary for amounts over the dental plan contractor's determination of allowable charges; or when a provider fails to collect the specified patient cost-share amount.
(h)
Appeal and hearing procedures.
The provisions of § 199.10 shall apply except where noted in this section. All references to “CHAMPUS contractors”, “CHAMPUS beneficiaries”, “CHAMPUS participating providers” and “CHAMPUS Explanation of Benefits” in § 199.10 shall be construed to mean the “dental plan contractor”, “TDP beneficiaries”, “TDP participating providers” and “Dental Explanation of Benefits or DEOB” respectively for the purposes of this section. References to “OCHAMPUSEUR” in § 199.10 are not applicable to the TDP or this section.

See § 199.10(a)(1)(i).
(B)
Effect of initial determination.
See § 199.10(a)(1)(ii).
(ii)
Participation in an appeal.
Participation in an appeal is limited to any party to the initial determination, including OCHAMPUS, the dental plan contractor, and authorized representatives of the parties. Any party to the initial determination, except OCHAMPUS and the dental plan contractor, may appeal an adverse determination. The appealing party is the party who actually files the appeal.
(A)
Parties to the initial determination.
See §§ 199.10(a)(2)(i) and 199.10(a)(2)(i) (A), (B), (C) and (E). In addition, a third party other than the dental plan contractor, such as an insurance company, is not a party to the initial determination and is not entitled to appeal, even though it may have an indirect interest in the initial determination.
(B)
Representative.
See § 199.10(a)(2)(ii).

(iv)
Evidence in appeal and hearing cases.
See § 199.10(a)(4).
(v)
Late filing.
If a request for reconsideration, formal review, or hearing is filed after the time permitted in this section, written notice shall be issued denying the request. Late filing may be permitted only if the appealing party reasonably can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the dental plan contractor, or the Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, that timely filing of the request was not feasible due to extraordinary circumstances over which the appealing party had no practical control. Each request for an exception to the filing requirement will be considered on its own merits. The decision of the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, on the request for an exception to the filing requirement shall be final.
(vi)
Appealable issue.
See §§ 199.10(a)(6), 199.10(a)(6)(i), 199.10(a)(6)(iv), including
§§ 199.10(a)(6)(iv) (A) and (C), and 199.10(a)(6)(v) for an explanation and examples of non-appealable issues. Other examples of issues that are not appealable under this section include:
(A) The amount of the dental plan contractor-determined allowable charge since the methodology constitutes a limitation on benefits under the provisions of this section.
(B) Certain other issues on the basis that the authority for the initial determination is not vested in OCHAMPUS. Such issues include but are not limited to the following examples:
(
1
) A determination of a person's enrollment in the TDP is the responsibility of the dental plan contractor and ultimate responsibility for resolving a beneficiary's enrollment rests with the dental plan contractor. Accordingly, a disputed question of fact concerning a beneficiary's enrollment will not be considered an appealable issue under the provisions of this section, but shall be resolved in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section and the dental plan contractor's enrollment policies and procedures.
(
2
) Decisions relating to the issuance of a nonavailability statement (NAS) in each case are made by the Uniformed Services. Disputes over the need for an NAS or a refusal to issue an NAS are not appealable under this section. The one exception is when a dispute arises over whether the facts of the case demonstrate a dental emergency for which an NAS is not required. Denial of payment in this one situation is an appealable issue.
(
3
) Any decision or action on the part of the dental plan contractor to include a provider in their network or to designate a provider as participating is not appealable under this section. Similarly, any decision or action on the part of the dental plan contractor to exclude a provider from their network or to deny participating provider status is not appealable under this section.
(vii)
Amount in dispute
—(A)
General.
An amount in dispute is required for an adverse determination to be appealed under the provisions of this section, except as set forth or further explained in § 199.10(a)(7)(ii), (iii) and (iv).
(B)
Calculated amount.
The amount in dispute is calculated as the amount of money the dental plan contractor would pay if the services involved in the dispute were determined to be authorized benefits of the TDP. Examples of amounts of money that are excluded by this section from payments for authorized benefits include, but are not limited to:
(
1
) Amounts in excess of the dental plan contractor's—determined allowable charge.
(
2
) The beneficiary's cost-share amounts.
(
3
) Amounts that the beneficiary, or parent, guardian, or other responsible person has no legal obligation to pay.
(
4
) Amounts excluded under the provisions of § 199.8 of this part.
(viii)
Levels of appeal.
See § 199.10(a)(8)(i). Initial determinations involving the sanctioning (exclusion, suspension, or termination) of TDP providers shall be appealed directly to the hearing level.

§ 199.14
Provider reimbursement methods.
(a)
Hospitals.
The CHAMPUS-determined allowable cost for reimbursement of a hospital shall be determined on the basis of one of the following methodologies.
(1)
CHAMPUS Diagnosis Related Group (DRG)-based payment system.
Under the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system, payment for the operating costs of inpatient hospital services furnished by hospitals subject to the system is made on the basis of prospectively-determined rates and applied on a per discharge basis using DRGs. Payments under this system will include a differentiation for urban (using large urban and other urban areas) and rural hospitals and an adjustment for area wage differences and indirect medical education costs. Additional payments will be made for capital costs, direct medical education costs, and outlier cases.
(i)
General
—(A)
DRGs used.
The CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system will use the same DRGs used in the most recently available grouper for the Medicare Prospective Payment System, except as necessary to recognize distinct characteristics of CHAMPUS beneficiaries and as described in instructions issued by the Director, OCHAMPUS.
(B)
Assignment of discharges to DRGs.
(
1
) The classification of a particular discharge shall be based on the patient's age, sex, principal diagnosis (that is, the diagnosis established, after study, to be chiefly responsible for causing the patient's admission to the hospital), secondary diagnoses, procedures performed and discharge status. In addition, for neonatal cases (other than normal newborns) the classification shall also account for birthweight, surgery and the presence of multiple, major and other neonatal problems, and shall incorporate annual updates to these classification features.
(
2
) Each discharge shall be assigned to only one DRG regardless of the number of conditions treated or services furnished during the patient's stay.
(C)
Basis of payment
—(
1
)
Hospital billing.
Under the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system, hospitals are required to submit claims (including itemized charges) in accordance with § 199.7(b). The CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary will assign the appropriate DRG to the claim based on the information contained in the claim. Any request from a hospital for reclassification of a claim to a higher weighted DRG must be submitted, within 60 days from the date of the initial payment, in a manner prescribed by the Director, OCHAMPUS.
(
2
)
Payment on a per discharge basis.
Under the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system, hospitals are paid a predetermined amount per discharge for inpatient hospital services furnished to CHAMPUS beneficiaries.
(
3
)
Pricing of claims.
All final claims with discharge dates of September 30, 2014, or earlier that are reimbursed under the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system are to be priced as of the date of admission, regardless of when the claim is submitted. All final claims with discharge dates of October 1, 2014, or later that are reimbursed under the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system are to be priced as of the date of discharge.
(
4
)
Payment in full.
The DRG-based amount paid for inpatient hospital services is the total CHAMPUS payment for the inpatient operating costs (as described in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(C)(
5
) of this section) incurred in furnishing services covered by the CHAMPUS. The full prospective payment amount is payable for each stay during which there is at least one covered day of
care, except as provided in paragraph (a)(1)(iii)(E)(
1
)(
i
)(
A
) of this section.
(
5
)
Inpatient operating costs.
The CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system provides a payment amount for inpatient operating costs, including:
(
i
) Operating costs for routine services, such as the costs of room, board, and routine nursing services;
(
ii
) Operating costs for ancillary services, such as hospital radiology and laboratory services (other than physicians' services) furnished to hospital inpatients;
(
iii
) Special care unit operating costs; and
(
iv
) Malpractice insurance costs related to services furnished to inpatients.
(
6
)
Discharges and transfers
—(
i
)
Discharges.
A hospital inpatient is discharged when:
(
A
) The patient is formally released from the hospital (release of the patient to another hospital as described in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(C)(
6
)(
ii
) of this section, or a leave of absence from the hospital, will not be recognized as a discharge for the purpose of determining payment under the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system);
(
B
) The patient dies in the hospital; or
(
C
) The patient is transferred from the care of a hospital included under the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system to a hospital or unit that is excluded from the prospective payment system.
(
ii
)
Transfers.
Except as provided under paragraph (a)(1)(i)(C)(
6
)(
i
) of this section, a discharge of a hospital inpatient is not counted for purposes of the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system when the patient is transferred:
(
A
) From one inpatient area or unit of the hospital to another area or unit of the same hospital;
(
B
) From the care of a hospital included under the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system to the care of another hospital paid under this system;
(
C
) From the care of a hospital included under the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system to the care of another hospital that is excluded from the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system because of participation in a statewide cost control program which is exempt from the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system under paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(A) of this section; or
(
D
) From the care of a hospital included under the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system to the care of a uniformed services treatment facility.
(
iii
)
Payment in full to the discharging hospital.
The hospital discharging an inpatient shall be paid in full under the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system.
(
iv
)
Payment to a hospital transferring an inpatient to another hospital.
If a hospital subject to the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system transfers an inpatient to another such hospital, the transferring hospital shall be paid a per diem rate (except that in neonatal cases, other than normal newborns, the hospital will be paid at 125 percent of that per diem rate), as determined under instructions issued by TSO, for each day of the patient's stay in that hospital, not to exceed the DRG-based payment that would have been paid if the patient had been discharged to another setting. For admissions occurring on or after October 1, 1995, the transferring hospital shall be paid twice the per diem rate for the first day of any transfer stay, and the per diem amount for each subsequent day, up to the limit described in this paragraph.
(
v
)
Additional payments to transferring hospitals.
A transferring hospital may qualify for an additional payment for extraordinary cases that meet the criteria for long-stay or cost outliers.
(D)
DRG system updates.
The CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system is modeled on the Medicare Prospective Payment System (PPS) and uses annually updated items and numbers from the Medicare PPS as provided for in this part and in instructions issued by the Director, DHA. The effective date of these items and numbers shall not correspond to that under Medicare PPS but shall be delayed until January 1, to align with TRICARE's program year reporting. This allows for an administrative simplicity that optimizes healthcare delivery by reducing existing administrative burden and costs.
(ii)
Applicability of the DRG system
—(A)
Areas affected.
The CHAMPUS DRG-
based payment system shall apply to hospitals' services in the fifty states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, except that any state which has implemented a separate DRG-based payment system or similar payment system in order to control costs and is exempt from the Medicare Prospective Payment System may be exempt from the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system if it requests exemption in writing, and provided payment under such system does not exceed payment which would otherwise be made under the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system.
(B)
Services subject to the DRG-based payment system.
All normally covered inpatient hospital services furnished to CHAMPUS beneficiaries by hospitals are subject to the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system.
(C)
Services exempt from the DRG-based payment system.
The following hospital services, even when provided in a hospital subject to the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system, are exempt from the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system. The services in paragraphs (a)(1)(ii)(C)(
1
) through (a)(1)(ii)(C)(
4
) and (a)(1)(ii)(C)(
7
) through (a)(1)(ii)(C)(

(
1
)
Psychiatric hospitals.
A psychiatric hospital which is exempt from the Medicare Prospective Payment System is also exempt from the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system. In order for a psychiatric hospital which does not participate in Medicare to be exempt from the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system, it must meet the same criteria (as determined by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee) as required for exemption from the Medicare Prospective Payment System as contained in 42 CFR 412.23.
(
2
)
Inpatient Rehabilitation Facilities (IRF).
Prior to implementation of the IRF PPS methodology described in paragraph (a)(10) of this section, an inpatient rehabilitation facility which is exempt from the Medicare prospective payment system is also exempt from the TRICARE DRG-based payment system.
(
3
)

(
4
)
Long Term Care Hospitals.
Prior to implementation of the LTCH PPS methodology described in paragraph (a)(9) of this section, a long-term care hospital which is exempt from the Medicare prospective payment system is also exempt from the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system.
(
5
)
Hospitals within hospitals.
A hospital within a hospital which is exempt from the Medicare prospective payment system is also exempt from the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system. In order for a hospital within a hospital which does not participate in Medicare to be exempt from the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system, it must meet the same criteria (as determined by the Director, TSO, or a designee) as required for exemption from the Medicare Prospective Payment System as contained in 42 CFR 412.22 and the criteria for one or more of the excluded hospital classifications described in § 412.23 of Title 42 CFR.
(
6
)

By completing the participation agreement, the hospital agrees to participate on all CHAMPUS inpatient claims and to accept the CHAMPUS-determined allowable amount as payment in full for these claims. Any hospital which does not participate in Medicare and does not complete a participation agreement with TRICARE will not be authorized to provide services to TRICARE beneficiaries.
(F)
Substance Use Disorder Rehabilitation facilities.
With admissions on or after July 1, 1995, substance use disorder rehabilitation facilities, authorized under § 199.6(b)(4)(xiv), are subject to the DRG-based payment system.
(iii)
Determination of payment amounts.
The actual payment for an individual claim under the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system is calculated by multiplying the appropriate adjusted standardized amount (adjusted to account for area wage differences using the wage indexes used in the Medicare program) by a weighting factor specific to each DRG.
(A)
Calculation of DRG weights
—(
1
)
Grouping of charges.
All discharge records in the database shall be grouped by DRG.
(
2
) Remove DRGs. Those DRGs that represent discharges with invalid data or diagnoses insufficient for DRG assignment purposes are removed from the database.
(
3
)
Indirect medical education standardization.
To standardize the charges for the cost effects of indirect medical education factors, each teaching hospital's charges will be divided by 1.0 plus the following ratio on a hospital-specific basis:
EC15NO91.042
(
4
)
Wage level standardization.
To standardize the charge records for area wage differences, each charge record will be divided into labor-related and nonlabor-related portions, and the labor-related portion shall be divided by the most recently available Medicare wage index for the area. The labor-related and nonlabor-related portions will then be added together.
(
5
)
Elimination of statistical outliers.
All unusually high or low charges shall be removed from the database.
(
6
)
Calculation of DRG average charge.
After the standardization for indirect medical education, and area wage differences, an average charge for each DRG shall be computed by summing charges in a DRG and dividing that sum by the number of records in the DRG.
(
7
)
Calculation of national average charge per discharge.
A national average charge per discharge shall be calculated by summing all charges and dividing that sum by the total number of records from all DRG categories.
(
8
)
DRG relative weights.
DRG relative weights shall be calculated for each DRG category by dividing each DRG average charge by the national average charge.
(B)
Empty and low-volume DRGs.
For any DRG with less than ten (10) occurrences in the CHAMPUS database, the Director, TSO, or designee, has the authority to consider alternative methods for estimating CHAMPUS weights in these low-volume DRG categories.
(C)
Updating DRG weights.
The CHAMPUS DRG weights shall be updated or adjusted as follows:
(
1
) DRG weights shall be recalculated annually using CHAMPUS charge data and the methodology described in paragraph (a)(1)(iii)(A) of this section.
(
2
) When a new DRG is created, CHAMPUS will, if practical, calculate a weight for it using an appropriate charge sample (if available) and the methodology described in paragraph (a)(1)(iii)(A) of this section.
(

) In the case of any other change under Medicare to an existing DRG weight (such as in connection with technology changes), CHAMPUS shall adjust its weight for that DRG in a manner comparable to the change made by Medicare.
(D)
Calculation of the adjusted standardized amounts.
The following procedures shall be followed in calculating the CHAMPUS adjusted standardized amounts. (
1
) Differentiate large urban and other area charges. All charges in the database shall be sorted into large urban and other area groups (using the same definitions for these categories used in the Medicare program. The following procedures will be applied to each group.
(
2
)
Indirect medical education standardization.
To standardize the charges for the cost effects of indirect medical education factors, each teaching hospital's charges will be divided by 1.0 plus the following ratio on a hospital-specific basis:
EC15NO91.043
(
3
)
Wage level standardization.
To standardize the charge records for area wage differences, each charge record will be divided into labor-related and nonlabor-related portions, and the labor-related portion shall be divided by the most recently available Medicare wage index for the area. The labor-related and nonlabor-related portions will then be added together.
(
4
)
Apply the cost to charge ratio.
Each charge is to be reduced to a representative cost by using the Medicare cost to charge ratio. This amount shall be increased by 1 percentage point in order to reimburse hospitals for bad debt expenses attributable to CHAMPUS beneficiaries.
(
5
) Preliminary base year standardized amount. A preliminary base year standardized amount shall be calculated by summing all costs in the database applicable to the large urban or other area group and dividing by the total number of discharges in the respective group.
(
6
)
Update for inflation.
The preliminary base year standardized amounts shall be updated using an annual update factor equal to 1.07 to produce fiscal year 1988 preliminary standardized amounts. Therefore, any development of a new standardized amount will use an inflation factor equal to the hospital market basket index used by the Health Care Financing Administration in their Prospective Payment System.
(
7
) The preliminary standardized amounts, updated for inflation, shall be divided by a system standardization factor so that total DRG outlays, given the database distribution across hospitals and diagnosis, are equal to the total charges reduced to costs.
(
8
)
Labor and nonlabor portions of the adjusted standardized amounts.
The adjusted standardized amounts shall be divided into labor and nonlabor portions in accordance with the Medicare division of labor and nonlabor portions.
(E)
Adjustments to the DRG-based payments amounts.
The following adjustments to the DRG-based amounts (the weight multiplied by the adjusted standardized amount) will be made. Additional adjustments to DRG amounts are included in paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this section.
(
1
)
Outliers.
The DRG-based payment to a hospital shall be adjusted for atypical cases. These outliers are those cases that have either an unusually short length-of-stay or extremely long length-of-stay or that involve extraordinarily high costs when compared to most discharges classified in the same DRG. Cases which qualify as both a length-of-stay outlier and a cost outlier shall be paid at the rate which results in the greater payment.
(
i
)
Length-of-stay outliers.
Length-of-stay outliers shall be identified and paid by the fiscal intermediary when the claims are processed.
(
A
)
Short-stay outliers.
Any discharge with a length-of-stay (LOS) less than 1.94 standard deviations from the DRG's arithmetic LOS shall be classified as a short-stay outlier. Short-stay outliers shall be reimbursed at 200 percent of the per diem rate for the DRG for each covered day of the hospital stay, not to exceed the DRG amount. The per diem rate shall equal the DRG amount divided by the arithmetic mean length-of-stay for the DRG.
(
B
)
Long-stay outliers.
Any discharge (except for neonatal services and services in children's hospitals) which has a length-of-stay (LOS) exceeding a threshold established in accordance with the criteria used for the Medicare Prospective Payment System as contained in 42 CFR 412.82 shall be classified as a long-stay outlier. Any discharge for neonatal services or for services in a children's hospital which has a LOS exceeding the lesser of 1.94 standard deviations or 17 days from the DRG's arithmetic mean LOS also shall be classified as a long-stay outlier. Long-stay outliers shall be reimbursed the DRG-based amount plus a percentage (as established for the Medicare Prospective Payment System) of the
per diem rate for the DRG for each covered day of care beyond the long-stay outlier threshold. The per diem rate shall equal the DRG amount divided by the arithmetic mean LOS for the DRG. For admissions on or after October 1, 1997, the long stay outlier has been eliminated for all cases except children's hospitals and neonates. For admissions on or after October 1, 1998, the long stay outlier has been eliminated for children's hospitals and neonates.
(
ii
)
Cost outliers.
Additional payment for cost outliers shall be made only upon request by the hospital.
(
A
) Cost outliers except those in children's hospitals or for neonatal services. Any discharge which has standardized costs that exceed a threshold established in accordance with the criteria used for the Medicare Prospective Payment System as contained in 42 CFR 412.84 shall qualify as a cost outlier. The standardized costs shall be calculated by multiplying the total charges by the factor described in paragraph (a)(1)(iii)(D)(
4
) of this section and adjusting this amount for indirect medical education costs. Cost outliers shall be reimbursed the DRG-based amount plus a percentage (as established for the Medicare Prospective Payment System) of all costs exceeding the threshold. Effective with admissions occurring on or after October 1, 1997, the standardized costs are no longer adjusted for indirect medical education costs.
(
B
) Cost outliers in children's hospitals for neonatal services. Any discharge for services in a children's hospital or for neonatal services which has standardized costs that exceed a threshold of the greater of two times the DRG-based amount or $13,500 shall qualify as a cost outlier. The standardized costs shall be calculated by multiplying the total charges by the factor described in paragraph (a)(1) (iii) (D) (
4
) of this section (adjusted to include average capital and direct medical education costs) and adjusting this amount for indirect medical education costs. Cost outliers for services in children's hospitals and for neonatal services shall be reimbursed the DRG-based amount plus a percentage (as established for the Medicare Prospective Payment System) of all costs exceeding the threshold. Effective with admissions occurring on or after October 1, 1998, standardized costs are no longer adjusted for indirect medical education costs. In addition, CHAMPUS will calculate the outlier payments that would have occurred at each of the 59 Children's hospitals under the FY99 outlier policy for all cases that would have been outliers under the FY94 policies using the most accurate data available in September 1998. A ratio will be calculated which equals the level of outlier payments that would have been made under the FY94 outlier policies and the outlier payments that would be made if the FY99 outlier policies had applied to each of these potential outlier cases for these hospitals. The ratio will be calculated across all outlier claims for the 59 hospitals and will not be hospital specific. The ratio will be used to increase cost outlier payments in FY 1999 and FY 2000, unless the hospital has a negotiated agreement with a managed care support contractor which would affect this payment. For hospitals with managed care support agreements which affect these payments, CHAMPUS will apply these payments if the increased payments would be consistent with the agreements. In FY 2000 the ratio of outlier payments (long stay and cost) that would have occurred under the FY 94 policy and actual cost outlier payments made under the FY 99 policy will be recalculated. If the ratio has changed significantly, the ratio will be revised for use in FY 2001 and thereafter. In FY 2002, the actual cost outlier cases in FY 2000 and 2001 will be reexamined. The ratio of outlier payments that would have occurred under the FY94 policy and the actual cost outlier payments made under the FY 2000 and FY 2001 policies. If the ratio has changed significantly, the ratio will be revised for use in FY 2003.
(
C
)
Cost outliers for burn cases.
All cost outliers for DRGs related to burn cases shall be reimbursed the DRG-based amount plus a percentage (as established for the Medicare Prospective Payment System) of all costs exceeding the threshold. The standardized costs and thresholds for these cases shall be calculated in accordance with
§ 199.14(a)(1)(iii)(E)(
1
)(
ii
)(
A
) and § 199.14(a)(1)(iii)(E)(
1
)(
ii
)(
B
).
(
2
)
Wage adjustment.
CHAMPUS will adjust the labor portion of the standardized amounts according to the hospital's area wage index.
(
3
)
Indirect medical education adjustment.
The wage adjusted DRG payment will also be multiplied by 1.0 plus the hospital's indirect medical education ratio.
(
4
)
Children's hospital differential.
With respect to claims from children's hospitals, the appropriate adjusted standardized amount shall also be adjusted by a children's hospital differential.
(
i
)
Qualifying children's hospitals.
Hospitals qualifying for the children's hospital differential are hospitals that are exempt from the Medicare Prospective Payment System, or, in the case of hospitals that do not participate in Medicare, that meet the same criteria (as determined by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee) as required for exemption from the Medicare Prospective Payment System as contained in 42 CFR 412.23.
(
ii
)
Calculation of differential.
The differential shall be equal to the difference between a specially calculated children's hospital adjusted standardized amount and the adjusted standardized amount for fiscal year 1988. The specially calculated children's hospital adjusted standardized amount shall be calculated in the same manner as set forth in § 199.14(a)(1)(iii)(D), except that:
(
A
) The base period shall be fiscal year 1988 and shall represent total estimated charges for discharges that occurred during fiscal year 1988.
(
B
) No cost to charge ratio shall be applied.
(
C
) Capital costs and direct medical education costs will be included in the calculation.
(
D
) The factor used to update the database for inflation to produce the fiscal year 1988 base period amount shall be the applicable Medicare inpatient hospital market basket rate.
(
iii
)
Transition rule.
Until March 1, 1992, separate differentials shall be used for each higher volume children's hospital (individually) and for all other children's hospitals (in the aggregate). For this purpose, a higher volume hospital is a hospital that had 50 or more CHAMPUS discharges in fiscal year 1988.
(
iv
)
Hold harmless provision.
At such time as the weights initially assigned to neonatal DRGs are recalibrated based on sufficient volume of CHAMPUS claims records, children's hospital differentials shall be recalculated and appropriate retrospective and prospective adjustments shall be made. To the extent practicable, the recalculation shall also include reestimated values of other factors (including but not limited to direct education and capital costs and indirect education factors) for which more accurate data became available.
(
v
)
No update for inflation.
The children's hospital differential, calculated (and later recalculated under the hold harmless provision) for the base period of fiscal year 1988, shall not be updated for subsequent fiscal years.
(
vi
)
Administrative corrections.
In connection with determinations pursuant to paragraph (a)(1)(iii) (E)(
4
)(
iii
) of this section, any children's hospital that believes OCHAMPUS erroneously failed to classify the hospital as a high volume hospital or incorrectly calculated (in the case of a high volume hospital) the hospital's differential may obtain administrative corrections by submitting appropriate documentation to the Director, OCHAMPUS (or a designee).
(F)
Updating the adjusted standardized amounts.
Beginning in FY 1989, the adjusted standardized amounts will be updated by the Medicare annual update factor, unless the adjusted standardized amounts are recalculated.
(G)
Annual cost pass-throughs
—(
1
)
Capital costs.
When requested in writing by a hospital, CHAMPUS shall reimburse the hospital its share of actual capital costs as reported annually to the CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary. Payment for capital costs shall be made annually based on the ratio of CHAMPUS inpatient days for those beneficiaries subject to the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system to total inpatient days applied to the hospital's total allowable capital costs. Reductions in payments for capital costs which are required under Medicare
shall also be applied to payments for capital costs under CHAMPUS.
(
i
)
Costs included as capital costs.
Allowable capital costs are those specified in Medicare Regulation § 413.130, as modified by § 412.72.
(
ii
)
Services, facilities, or supplies provided by supplying organizations.
If services, facilities, or supplies are provided to the hospital by a supplying organization related to the hospital within the meaning of Medicare Regulation § 413.17, then the hospital must include in its capital-related costs, the capital-related costs of the supplying organization. However, if the supplying organization is not related to the provider within the meaning of § 413.17, no part of the change to the provider may be considered a capital-related cost unless the services, facilities, or supplies are capital-related in nature and:
(
A
) The capital-related equipment is leased or rented by the provider;
(
B
) The capital-related equipment is located on the provider's premises; and
(
C
) The capital-related portion of the charge is separately specified in the charge to the provider.
(
2
)
Direct medical education costs.
When requested in writing by a hospital, CHAMPUS shall reimburse the hospital its actual direct medical education costs as reported annually to the CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary. Such teaching costs must be for a teaching program approved under Medicare Regulation § 413.85. Payment for direct medical education costs shall be made annually based on the ratio of CHAMPUS inpatient days for those beneficiaries subject to the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system to total inpatient days applied to the hospital's total allowable direct medical education costs. Allowable direct medical education costs are those specified in Medicare Regulation § 413.85.
(
3
) Information necessary for payment of capital and direct medical education costs. All hospitals subject to the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system, except for children's hospitals, may be reimbursed for allowed capital and direct medical education costs by submitting a request to the CHAMPUS contractor. Beginning October 1, 1998, such request shall be filed with CHAMPUS on or before the last day of the twelfth month following the close of the hospitals' cost reporting period, and shall cover the one-year period corresponding to the hospital's Medicare cost-reporting period. The first such request may cover a period of less than a full year—from the effective date of the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system to the end of the hospital's Medicare cost-reporting period. All costs reported to the CHAMPUS contractor must correspond to the costs reported on the hospital's Medicare cost report. An extension of the due date for filing the request may only be granted if an extension has been granted by HCFA due to a provider's operations being significantly adversely affected due to extraordinary circumstances over which the provider has no control, such as flood or fire. (If these costs change as a result of a subsequent audit by Medicare, the revised costs are to be reported to the hospital's CHAMPUS contractor within 30 days of the date the hospital is notified of the change). The request must be signed by the hospital official responsible for verifying the amounts and shall contain the following information.
(
i
) The hospital's name.
(
ii
) The hospital's address.
(
iii
) The hospital's CHAMPUS provider number.
(
iv
) The hospital's Medicare provider number.
(
v
) The period covered—this must correspond to the hospital's Medicare cost-reporting period.
(
vi
) Total inpatient days provided to all patients in units subject to DRG-based payment.
(
vii
) Total allowed CHAMPUS inpatient days provided in units subject to DRG-based payment.
(
viii
) Total allowable capital costs.
(
ix
) Total allowable direct medical education costs.
(
x
) Total full-time equivalents for:
(
A
) Residents.
(
B
) Interns.
(
xi
) Total inpatient beds as of the end of the cost-reporting period. If this has changed during the reporting period, an explanation of the change must be provided.
(
xii
) Title of official signing the report.
(
xiii
) Reporting date.
(
xiv
) The report shall contain a certification statement that any changes to the items in paragraphs (a)(1)(iii)(G)(
3
)(
vi
), (
vii
), (
viii
), (
ix
), or (
x
), which are a result of an audit of the hospital's Medicare cost-report, shall be reported to CHAMPUS within thirty (30) days of the date the hospital is notified of the change.
(iv)
Special Programs and Incentive Payments.
(A)
Additional payment for new medical services and technologies.
TRICARE will make New Technology Add On Payments (NTAPs) adjustments to DRGs as provided in paragraphs (a)(1)(iv)(A)(
1
) through (a)(1)(iv)(A)(
11
) of this section. The Director, Defense Health Agency (DHA), shall provide notice of the issuance of policies and guidelines adopting such adjustments together with any variations deemed necessary to address unique issues involving the beneficiary population or program administration.
(
1
)
Adoption of Medicare NTAPs.
For TRICARE covered services and supplies, TRICARE will adopt Medicare NTAPs as implemented under 42 CFR 412.87 under the same conditions as published by the Centers for Medicare
Medicaid Services, except for pediatric cases.
(
2
)
Pediatric cases.
For pediatric NTAP DRGs, the TRICARE NTAP adjustment shall be modified to be set at 100 percent of the costs in excess of the Medicare Severity-Diagnosis Related Group (MS-DRG) payment. As used in this paragraph, pediatric is defined as services and supplies provided to individuals under the age of 18, or who are being treated in a children's hospital or in a pediatric ward.
(
3
)
TRICARE designated NTAP adjustments.
For categories of TRICARE covered services and supplies for which Medicare has not established an NTAP adjustment for DRGs, the Director, DHA may designate a TRICARE NTAP adjustment through a process using criteria to identify and select such new technology services/supplies similar to that utilized by Medicare under 42 CFR 412.87. The Director, DHA may then designate a TRICARE NTAP reimbursement adjustment through a process using a methodology similar to the Medicare methodology outlined in 42 CFR 412.88. This discretionary authority to designate TRICARE NTAP adjustments shall apply to services and supplies typically provided to TRICARE beneficiaries age 64 or younger when Medicare has not established an NTAP adjustment for such services/supplies. As with other discretionary authority under this part, a decision to designate a TRICARE category of services/supplies for an NTAP adjustment to DRGs and the amount of such an adjustment are not subject to the appeal and hearing procedures of § 199.10. The Director, DHA, shall select which new technologies may be designated as TRICARE NTAPs and will publish this list based on the eligibility criteria and reimbursement methodology provided in paragraphs (a)(1)(iv)(A)(
4
) through (a)(1)(iv)(A)(
11
) of this section.
(
4
)
Eligibility requirements and reimbursement methodology for TRICARE designated NTAP adjustments.
A new medical service or technology represents an advance that substantially improves, relative to technologies previously available, the diagnosis or treatment of TRICARE beneficiaries. The totality of the circumstances is considered when making a determination that a new medical service or technology represents an advance that substantially improves, relative to services or technologies previously available, the diagnosis or treatment of TRICARE beneficiaries.
(
5
)
Criteria for improvement.
A determination that a new medical service or technology represents an advance that substantially improves, relative to services or technologies previously available, the diagnosis or treatment of TRICARE beneficiaries means one or more of the following:
(
i
) The new medical service or technology offers a treatment option for a patient population unresponsive to, or ineligible for, currently available treatments.
(
ii)
The new medical service or technology offers the ability to diagnose a medical condition in a patient population where that medical condition is currently undetectable, or offers the ability to diagnose a medical condition earlier in a patient population than allowed by currently available methods
and there must also be evidence that use of the new medical service or technology to make a diagnosis affects the management of the patient.
(
iii
) The use of the new medical service or technology significantly improves clinical outcomes relative to services or technologies previously available as demonstrated by one or more of the following seven outcomes: A reduction in at least one clinically significant adverse event, including a reduction in mortality or a clinically significant complication; A decreased rate of at least one subsequent diagnostic or therapeutic intervention; A decreased number of future hospitalizations or physician visits; A more rapid beneficial resolution of the disease process treatment including, but not limited to, a reduced length of stay or recovery time; An improvement in one or more activities of daily living; An improved quality of life; or A demonstrated greater medication adherence or compliance.
(
iv
) The totality of the information otherwise demonstrates that the new medical service or technology substantially improves, relative to technologies previously available, the diagnosis or treatment of TRICARE beneficiaries.
(
6
)
Evidence.
Evidence from scientific literature may be sufficient to establish that a new medical service or technology represents an advance that substantially improves, relative to services or technologies previously available, the diagnosis or treatment of TRICARE beneficiaries.
(
7
)
Prevalence.
The medical condition diagnosed or treated by the new medical service or technology may have a low prevalence among TRICARE beneficiaries.
(
8
)
Subpopulation.
The new medical service or technology may represent an advance that substantially improves, relative to services or technologies previously available, the diagnosis or treatment of a subpopulation of patients with the medical condition diagnosed or treated by the new medical service or technology.
(
9
)
Newness criteria.
A medical service or technology may be considered new within 2 or 3 years after the point at which data begin to become available reflecting the inpatient hospital code assigned to the new service or technology (depending on when a new code is assigned and data on the new service or technology becomes available for DRG recalibration). After TRICARE has recalibrated the DRGs, based on available data, to reflect the costs of an otherwise new medical service or technology, the medical service or technology will no longer be considered “new” under the criterion of this section.
(
10
)
Payment methodology.
For discharges involving new medical services or technologies that meet the criteria specified in paragraphs (a)(1)(iv)(A)(
4
) through (a)(1)(iv)(A)(
9
) and that are approved as TRICARE NTAPs per paragraph (a)(1)(iv)(A)(
11
) of this section, TRICARE payment will be the lesser of:
(
i
) The CMS designated percentage of the estimated costs of the new technology or medical service, as published in 42 CFR 412.88; or
(
ii
) The CMS designated percentage of the difference between the full DRG payment and the hospital's estimated cost for the case, as published in 42 CFR 412.88.
(
11
)
Publication and timing.
TRICARE may consider whether a new medical service or technology meets the eligibility criteria specified in paragraphs (a)(1)(iv)(A)(
4
) through (a)(1)(iv)(A)(
9
) of this section and announce the results on the NTAP website. In doing so, TRICARE only considers, for add-on payments for a particular fiscal year, an application for which the new medical device or product has received FDA marketing authorization by July 1 prior to the particular fiscal year; or the application is submitted under an alternative pathway to the FDA for which conditional NTAP approval for FDA marketing authorization is granted before July 1 of the fiscal year for which the applicant applied for new technology add-on payments.
(B)
Hospital Value Based Purchasing.
TRICARE will adopt the Medicare Hospital Value Based Purchasing (HVBP) Program adjustments to DRGs to incentivize hospitals as implemented under 42 CFR 412.160, when determined by the ASD(HA), as practicable. The Director, DHA, shall provide notice of
the issuance of policies and guidelines adopting such adjustments together with any variations deemed necessary to address unique issues involving the beneficiary population or program administration.
(C)
Additional payment for new COVID-19 Treatments.
TRICARE will adopt the Medicare New COVID-19 Treatments Add-On Payments (NCTAP) adjustment to DRGs. New COVID-19 treatments shall be reimbursed the lesser of (1) 65 percent of the operating outlier threshold for the claim or (2) 65 percent of the amount by which the costs of the case exceed the standard DRG payment for an individual treated using new COVID-19 treatments discharged during the Secretary of Health and Human Services' declared public health emergency (PHE) through the end of the FY in which the PHE terminates.
(2)
CHAMPUS mental health per diem payment system.
The CHAMPUS mental health per diem payment system shall be used to reimburse for inpatient mental health hospital care in specialty psychiatric hospitals and units. Payment is made on the basis of prospectively determined rates and paid on a per diem basis. The system uses two sets of per diems. One set of per diems applies to hospitals and units that have a relatively higher number of CHAMPUS discharges. For these hospitals and units, the system uses hospital-specific per diem rates. The other set of per diems applies to hospitals and units with a relatively lower number of CHAMPUS discharges. For these hospitals and units, the system uses regional per diems, and further provides for adjustments for area wage differences and indirect medical education costs and additional pass-through payments for direct medical education costs.
(i)
Applicability of the mental health per diem payment system
—(A)
Hospitals and units covered.
The CHAMPUS mental health per diem payment system applies to services covered (see paragraph (a)(2)(i)(B) of this section) that are provided in Medicare prospective payment system (PPS) exempt psychiatric specialty hospitals and all Medicare PPS exempt psychiatric specialty units of other hospitals. In addition, any psychiatric hospital that does not participate in Medicare, or any other hospital that has a psychiatric specialty unit that has not been so designated for exemption from the Medicare prospective payment system because the hospital does not participate in Medicare, may be designated as a psychiatric hospital or psychiatric specialty unit for purposes of the CHAMPUS mental health per diem payment system upon demonstrating that it meets the same criteria (as determined by the Director, OCHAMPUS) as required for the Medicare exemption. The CHAMPUS mental health per diem payment system does not apply to mental health services provided in other hospitals.
(B)
Services covered.
Unless specifically exempted, all covered hospitals' and units' inpatient claims which are classified into a mental health DRG (DRG categories 425-432, but not DRG 424) or an alcohol/drug abuse DRG (DRG categories 433-437) shall be subject to the mental health per diem payment system.
(ii)
Hospital-specific per diems for higher volume hospitals and units.
This paragraph describes the per diem payment amounts for hospitals and units with a higher volume of CHAMPUS discharges.
(A)(
1
)
Per diem amount.
A hospital-specific per diem amount shall be calculated for each hospital and unit with a higher volume of CHAMPUS discharges. The base period per diem amount shall be equal to the hospital's average daily charge in the base period. The base period amount, however, may not exceed the cap described in paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(B) of this section. The base period amount shall be updated in accordance with paragraph (a)(2)(iv) of this section.
(
2
) In states that have implemented a payment system in connection with which hospitals in that state have been exempted from the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system pursuant to paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(A) of this section, psychiatric hospitals and units may have per diem amounts established based on the payment system applicable to such hospitals and units in the state. The per diem amount, however,
may not exceed the cap amount applicable to other higher volume hospitals.
(B)
Cap
—(
1
) As it affects payment for care provided to patients prior to April 6, 1995, the base period per diem amount may not exceed the 80th percentile of the average daily charge weighted for all discharges throughout the United States from all higher volume hospitals.
(
2
) Applicable to payments for care provided to patients on or after April 6, 1996, the base period per diem amount may not exceed the 70th percentile of the average daily charge weighted for all discharges throughout the United States from all higher volume hospitals. For this purpose, base year charges shall be deemed to be charges during the period of July 1, 1991 to June 30, 1992, adjusted to correspond to base year (FY 1988) charges by the percentage change in average daily charges for all higher volume hospitals and units between the period of July 1, 1991 to June 30, 1992 and the base year.
(C)
Review of per diem.
Any hospital or unit which believes OCHAMPUS calculated a hospital-specific per diem which differs by more than $5.00 from that calculated by the hospital or unit may apply to the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, for a recalculation. The burden of proof shall be on the hospital.
(iii)
Regional per diems for lower volume hospitals and units.
This paragraph describes the per diem amounts for hospitals and units with a lower volume of CHAMPUS discharges.
(A)
Per diem amounts.
Hospitals and units with a lower volume of CHAMPUS patients shall be paid on the basis of a regional per diem amount, adjusted for area wages and indirect medical education. Base period regional per diems shall be calculated based upon all CHAMPUS lower volume hospitals' claims paid during the base period. Each regional per diem amount shall be the quotient of all covered charges divided by all covered days of care, reported on all CHAMPUS claims from lower volume hospitals in the region paid during the base period, after having standardized for indirect medical education costs and area wage indexes and subtracted direct medical education costs. Regional per diem amounts are adjusted in accordance with paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(C) of this section. Additional pass-through payments to lower volume hospitals are made in accordance with paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(D) of this section. The regions shall be the same as the Federal census regions.
(B)
Review of per diem amount.
Any hospital that believes the regional per diem amount applicable to that hospital has been erroneously calculated by OCHAMPUS by more than $5.00 may submit to the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, evidence supporting a different regional per diem. The burden of proof shall be on the hospital.
(C)
Adjustments to regional per diems.
Two adjustments shall be made to the regional per diem rates.
(
1
)
Area wage index.
The same area wage indexes used for the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system (see paragraph (a)(1)(iii)(E)(
2
) of this section) shall be applied to the wage portion of the applicable regional per diem rate for each day of the admission. The wage portion shall be the same as that used for the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system.
(
2
)
Indirect medical education.
The indirect medical education adjustment factors shall be calculated for teaching hospitals in the same manner as is used in the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system (see paragraph (a)(1)(iii)(E)(
3
) of this section) and applied to the applicable regional per diem rate for each day of the admission.
(D)
Annual cost pass-through for direct medical education.
In addition to payments made to lower volume hospitals under paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section, CHAMPUS shall annually reimburse hospitals for actual direct medical education costs associated with services to CHAMPUS beneficiaries. This reimbursement shall be done pursuant to the same procedures as are applicable to the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system (see paragraph (a)(1)(iii)(G) of this section).
(iv)
Base period and update factors
—(A)
Base period.
The base period for calculating the hospital-specific and regional per diems, as described in paragraphs (a)(2)(ii) and (a)(2)(iii) of this section, is Federal fiscal year 1988. Base period calculations shall be based
on actual claims paid during the period July 1, 1987 through May 31, 1988, trended forward to represent the 12-month period ending September 30, 1988 on the basis of the Medicare inpatient hospital market basket rate.
(B)
Alternative hospital-specific data base.
Upon application of a higher volume hospital or unit to the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, the hospital or unit may have its hospital-specific base period calculations based on claims with a date of discharge (rather than date of payment) between July 1, 1987 through May 31, 1988 if it has generally experienced unusual delays in claims payments and if the use of such an alternative data base would result in a difference in the per diem amount of at least $5.00. For this purpose, the unusual delays means that the hospital's or unit's average time period between date of discharge and date of payment is more than two standard deviations longer than the national average.
(C)
Update factors
—(
1
) The hospital-specific per diems and the regional per diems calculated for the base period pursuant to paragraphs (a)(2)(ii) of this section shall remain in effect for federal fiscal year 1989; there will be no additional update for fiscal year 1989.
(
2
) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(C)(
3
) of this section, for subsequent federal fiscal years, each per diem shall be updated by the Medicare Inpatient Prospective Payment System update factor.
(
3
) As an exception to the update required by paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(C)(
2
) of this section, all per diems in effect at the end of fiscal year 1995 shall remain in effect, with no additional update, throughout fiscal years 1996 and 1997. For fiscal year 1998 and thereafter, the per diems in effect at the end of fiscal year 1997 will be updated in accordance with paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(C)(
2
).
(
4
) Hospitals and units with hospital-specific rates will be notified of their respective rates prior to the beginning of each Federal fiscal year. New hospitals shall be notified at such time as the hospital rate is determined. The actual amount of each regional per diem that will apply in any Federal fiscal year shall be posted to the Agency's official Web site at the start of that fiscal year.
(v)
Higher volume hospitals.
This paragraph describes the classification of and other provisions pertinent to hospitals with a higher volume of CHAMPUS patients.
(A)
In general.
Any hospital or unit that had an annual rate of 25 or more CHAMPUS discharges of CHAMPUS patients during the period July 1, 1987 through May 31, 1988 shall be considered a higher volume hospital has 25 or more CHAMPUS discharges, that hospital shall be considered to be a higher volume hospital during Federal fiscal year 1989 and all subsequent fiscal years. All other hospitals and units covered by the CHAMPUS mental health per diem payment system shall be considered lower volume hospitals.
(B)
Hospitals that subsequently become higher volume hospitals.
In any Federal fiscal year in which a hospital, including a new hospital (see paragraph (a)(2)(v)(C) of this section), not previously classified as a higher volume hospital has 25 or more CHAMPUS discharges, that hospital shall be considered to be a higher volume hospital during the next Federal fiscal year and all subsequent fiscal years. The hospital specific per diem amount shall be calculated in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, except that the base period average daily charge shall be deemed to be the hospital's average daily charge in the year in which the hospital had 25 or more discharges, adjusted by the percentage change in average daily charges for all higher volume hospitals and units between the year in which the hospital had 25 or more CHAMPUS discharges and the base period. The base period amount, however, may not exceed the cap described in paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(B) of this section.
(C)
Special retrospective payment provision for new hospitals.
For purposes of this paragraph, a new hospital is a hospital that qualifies for the Medicare exemption from the rate of increase ceiling applicable to new hospitals which are PPS-exempt psychiatric hospitals. Any new hospital that becomes a higher volume hospital, in addition to qualifying prospectively as a higher
volume hospital for purposes of paragraph (a)(2)(v)(B) of this section, may additionally, upon application to the Director, OCHAMPUS, receive a retrospective adjustment. The retrospective adjustment shall be calculated so that the hospital receives the same government share payments it would have received had it been designated a higher volume hospital for the federal fiscal year in which it first had 25 or more CHAMPUS discharges and the preceding fiscal year (if it had any CHAMPUS patients during the preceding fiscal year). Such new hospitals must agree not to bill CHAMPUS beneficiaries for any additional costs beyond that determined initially.
(D)
Review of classification.
Any hospital or unit which OCHAMPUS erroneously fails to classify as a higher volume hospital may apply to the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, for such a classification. The hospital shall have the burden of proof.
(vi)
Payment for hospital based professional services.
Lower volume hospitals and units may not bill separately for hospital based professional mental health services; payment for those services is included in the per diems. Higher volume hospitals and units, whether they billed CHAMPUS separately for hospital based professional mental health services or included those services in the hospital's billing to CHAMPUS, shall continue the practice in effect during the period July 1, 1987 to May 31, 1988 (or other data base period used for calculating the hospital's or unit's per diem), except that any such hospital or unit may change its prior practice (and obtain an appropriate revision in its per diem) by providing to OCHAMPUS notice in accordance with procedures established by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee.
(vii)
Leave days.
CHAMPUS shall not pay for days where the patient is absent on leave from the specialty psychiatric hospital or unit. The hospital must identify these days when claiming reimbursement. CHAMPUS shall not count a patients's leave of absence as a discharge in determining whether a facility should be classified as a higher volume hospital pursuant to paragraph (a)(2)(v) of this section.
(viii)
Exemptions from the CHAMPUS mental health per diem payment system.
The following providers and procedures are exempt from the CHAMPUS mental health per diem payment system.
(A)
Non-specialty providers.
Providers of inpatient care which are not either psychiatric hospitals or psychiatric specialty units as described in paragraph (a)(2)(i)(A) of this section are exempt from the CHAMPUS mental health per diem payment system. Such providers should refer to paragraph (a)(1) of this section for provisions pertinent to the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system.
(B)
DRG 424.
Admissions for operating room procedures involving a principal diagnosis of mental illness (services which group into DRG 424) are exempt from the per diem payment system. They will be reimbursed pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
(C)
Non-mental health services.
Admissions for non-mental health procedures in specialty psychiatric hospitals and units are exempt from the per diem payment system. They will be reimbursed pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
(D)
Sole community hospitals (SCHs).
Prior to implementation of the SCH reimbursement method described in paragraph (a)(7) of this section, any hospital that has qualified for special treatment under the Medicare prospective payment system as an SCH and has not given up that classification is exempt.
(E)
Hospitals outside the U.S.
A hospital is exempt if it is not located in one of the 50 states, the District of Columbia or Puerto Rico.
(ix)
Payment for psychiatric and substance use disorder rehabilitation partial hospitalization services, intensive outpatient psychiatric and substance use disorder services and opioid treatment services
—(A)
Per diem payments.
Psychiatric and substance use disorder partial hospitalization services, intensive outpatient psychiatric and substance use disorder services and opioid treatment services authorized by § 199.4(b)(9), (b)(10), and (b)(11), respectively, and provided by institutional providers authorized under § 199.6(b)(4)(xii),
(b)(4)(xviii) and (b)(4)(xix), respectively, are reimbursed on the basis of prospectively determined, all-inclusive per diem rates pursuant to the provisions of paragraphs (a)(2)(ix)(A)(
1
) through (
3
) of this section, with the exception of hospital-based psychiatric and substance use disorder and opioid services which are reimbursed in accordance with provisions of paragraph (a)(6)(ii) of this section and freestanding opioid treatment programs when reimbursed on a fee-for-service basis as specified in paragraph (a)(2)(ix)(A)(
3
)(
ii
) of this section. The per diem payment amount must be accepted as payment in full, subject to the outpatient cost-sharing provisions under § 199.4(f), for institutional services provided, including board, routine nursing services, group therapy, ancillary services (
e.g.,
music, dance, and occupational and other such therapies), psychological testing and assessment, overhead and any other services for which the customary practice among similar providers is included in the institutional charges, except for those services which may be billed separately under paragraph (a)(2)(ix)(B) of this section. Per diem payment will not be allowed for leave days during which treatment is not provided.
(
1
)
Partial hospitalization programs.
For any full-day partial hospitalization program (minimum of 6 hours), the maximum per diem payment amount is 40 percent of the average inpatient per diem amount per case established under the TRICARE mental health per diem reimbursement system during the fiscal year for both high and low volume psychiatric hospitals and units [as defined in paragraph (a)(2) of this section]. Intensive outpatient services provided in a PHP setting lasting less than 6 hours, with a minimum of 2 hours, will be paid as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(ix)(A)(2) of this section. PHP per diem rates will be updated annually by the Medicare update factor used for their Inpatient Prospective Payment System.
(
2
)
Intensive outpatient programs.
For intensive outpatient programs (IOPs) (minimum of 2 hours), the maximum per diem amount is 75 percent of the rate for a full-day partial hospitalization program as established in paragraph (a)(2)(ix)(A)(1) of this section. IOP per diem rates will be updated annually by the Medicare update factor used for their Inpatient Prospective Payment System.
(
3
)
Opioid treatment programs.
Opioid treatment programs (OTPs) authorized by § 199.4(b)(11) and provided by providers authorized under § 199.6(b)(4)(xix) will be reimbursed based on the variability in the dosage and frequency of the drug being administered and in related supportive services.
(
i
)
Weekly all-inclusive per diem rate.
Methadone OTPs will be reimbursed the lower of the billed charge or the weekly all-inclusive per diem rate (the weekly national all-inclusive rate adjusted for locality), including the cost of the drug and related services (
i.e.,
the costs related to the initial intake/assessment, drug dispensing and screening and integrated psychosocial and medical treatment and support services). The bundled weekly per diem payments will be accepted as payment in full, subject to the outpatient cost-sharing provisions under § 199.4(f). The methadone per diem rate for OTPs will be updated annually by the Medicare update factor used for their Inpatient Prospective Payment System.
(
ii
)
Exceptions to per diem reimbursement.
When providing other medications which are more likely to be prescribed and administered in an office-based opioid treatment setting, but which are still available for treatment of substance use disorders in an outpatient treatment program setting, OTPs will be reimbursed on a fee-for-service basis (
i.e.,
separate payments will be allowed for both the medication and accompanying support services), subject to the outpatient cost-sharing provisions under § 199.4(f). OTPs' rates will be updated annually by the Medicare update factor used for their Inpatient Prospective Payment System.
(
iii
)
Discretionary authority.
The Director, TRICARE, will have discretionary authority in establishing the reimbursement methodologies for new drugs and biologicals that may become available for the treatment of substance use disorders in OTPs. The type of reimbursement (
e.g.,
fee-for-service versus bundled per diem payments) will be dependent on the variability of the
dosage and frequency of the medication being administered, as well as the support services.
(B)
Services which may be billed separately.
Psychotherapy sessions and non-mental health related medical services not normally included in the evaluation and assessment of PHP, IOP or OTPs, provided by authorized independent professional providers who are not employed by, or under contract with, PHP, IOP or OTPs for the purposes of providing clinical patient care are not included in the per diem rate and may be billed separately. This includes ambulance services when medically necessary for emergency transport.
(3)
Reimbursement for inpatient services provided by a CAH.
(i) For admissions on or after December 1, 2009, inpatient services provided by a CAH, other than services provided in psychiatric and rehabilitation distinct part units, shall be reimbursed at allowable cost (
i.e.,
101 percent of reasonable cost) under procedures, guidelines, and instructions issued by the Director, DHA, or designee. This does not include any costs of physicians' services or other professional services provided to CAH inpatients. Inpatient services provided in psychiatric distinct part units would be subject to the TRICARE mental health payment system. Inpatient services provided in rehabilitation distinct part units would be subject to billed charges. Upon implementation of TRICARE's IRF PPS, inpatient services provided in rehabilitation distinct part units would be subject to the TRICARE IRF PPS methodology in paragraph (a)(10) of this section.
(ii) The percentage amount stated in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section is subject to possible upward adjustment based on a inpatient GTMCPA for TRICARE network hospitals deemed essential for military readiness and support during contingency operations under paragraph (a)(8) of this section.
(4) The allowable cost for authorized care in all hospitals not subject to the TRICARE DRG-based payment system, the TRICARE mental health per-diem system, the TRICARE reasonable cost method for CAHs, the TRICARE reimbursement rules for SCHs, the TRICARE LTCH-PPS, or the TRICARE IRF PPS shall be determined on the basis of billed charges or set rates.
(i) The actual charge for such service made to the general public; or
(ii) The allowed charge applicable to the policyholders or subscribers of the CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary for comparable services under comparable circumstances, when extended to CHAMPUS beneficiaries by consent or agreement; or
(iii) The allowed charge applicable to the citizens of the community or state as established by local or state regulatory authority, excluding title XIX of the Social Security Act or other welfare program, when extended to CHAMPUS beneficiaries by consent or agreement.
(5)
CHAMPUS discount rates.
The CHAMPUS-determined allowable cost for authorized care in any hospital may be based on discount rates established under paragraph (l) of this section.
(6)
Hospital outpatient services.
This paragraph (a)(6) identifies and clarifies payment methods for certain outpatient services, including emergency services, provided by hospitals.
(i)
Outpatient Services Not Subject to Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS).
The following are payment methods for outpatient services that are either provided in an OPPS exempt hospital or paid outside the OPPS payment methodology under existing fee schedules or other prospectively determined rates in a hospital subject to OPPS reimbursement.
(A)
Laboratory services.
TRICARE payments for hospital outpatient laboratory services including clinical laboratory services are based on the allowable charge method under paragraph (j)(1) of the section. In the case of laboratory services for which the CMAC rates are established under that paragraph, a payment rate for the technical component of the laboratory services is provided. Hospital charges for an outpatient laboratory service are reimbursed using the CMAC technical component rate.
(B)
Rehabilitation therapy services.
Rehabilitation therapy services provided on an outpatient basis by hospitals are
paid on the same basis as rehabilitation therapy services covered by the allowable charge method under paragraph (j)(1) of this section.
(C)
Venipuncture.
Routine venipuncture services provided on an outpatient basis by hospitals are paid on the same basis as such services covered by the allowable charge method under paragraph (j)(1) of this section. Routine venipuncture services provided on an outpatient basis by institutional providers other than hospitals are also paid on this basis.
(D)
Radiology services.
TRICARE payments for hospital outpatient radiology services are based on the allowable charge method under paragraph (j)(1) of the section. In the case of radiology services for which the CMAC rates are established under that paragraph, a payment rate for the technical component of the radiology services is provided. Hospital charges for an outpatient radiology service are reimbursed using the CMAC technical component rate.
(E)
Diagnostic services.
TRICARE payments for hospital outpatient diagnostic services are based on the allowable charge method under paragraph (j)(1) of the section. In the case of diagnostic services for which the CMAC rates are established under that paragraph, a payment rate for the technical component of the diagnostic services is provided. Hospital charges for an outpatient diagnostic service are reimbursed using the CMAC technical component rate.
(F)
Ambulance services.
Ambulance services provided on an outpatient basis by hospitals are paid on the same basis as ambulance services covered by the allowable charge method under paragraph (j)(1) of this section.
(G)
Durable medical equipment (DME) and supplies.
Durable medical equipment and supplies provided on an outpatient basis by hospitals are paid on the same basis as durable medical equipment and supplies covered by the allowable charge method under paragraph (j)(1) of this section.
(H)
Oxygen and related supplies.
Oxygen and related supplies provided on an outpatient basis by hospitals are paid on the same basis as oxygen and related supplies covered by the allowable charge method under paragraph (j)(1) of this section.
(I)
Drugs administered other than by oral method.
Drugs administered other than by oral method provided on an outpatient basis by hospitals are paid on the same basis as drugs administered other than by oral method covered by the allowable charge method under paragraph (j)(1) of this section.
(J)
Professional provider services.
TRICARE payments for hospital outpatient professional provider services rendered in an emergency room, clinic, or hospital outpatient department, etc., are based on the allowable charge method under paragraph (j)(1) of the section. In the case of professional services for which the CMAC rates are established under that paragraph, a payment rate for the professional component of the services is provided. Hospital charges for an outpatient professional service are reimbursed using the CMAC professional component rate. If the professional outpatient hospital services are billed by a professional provider group, not by the hospital, no payment shall be made to the hospital for these services.
(K)
Facility charges.
TRICARE payments for hospital outpatient facility charges that would include the overhead costs of providing the outpatient service would be paid as billed. For the definition of facility charge, see § 199.2(b).
(L)
Ambulatory surgery services.
Hospital outpatient ambulatory surgery services shall be paid in accordance with § 199.14(d).
(ii)
Outpatient services subject to OPPS
—(A)
General.
Outpatient services provided in hospitals subject to Medicare OPPS as specified in 42 CFR 413.65 and 42 CFR 419.20, to include cancer and children's hospitals, will be paid in accordance with the provisions outlined in sections 1833t of the Social Security Act and its implementing Medicare regulation (42 CFR part 419) subject to exceptions as authorized by this paragraph (a)(6)(ii).
(B) Under the above governing provisions, TRICARE will recognize to the extent practicable, in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 1089(j)(2), Medicare's OPPS reimbursement methodology to include
specific coding requirements, ambulatory payment classifications (APCs), nationally established APC amounts and associated adjustments (
e.g.,
discounting across geographical regions and outlier calculations).
(C) While TRICARE intends to remain as true as possible to Medicare's basic OPPS methodology, there will be some deviations required to accommodate TRICARE's unique benefit structure and beneficiary population as authorized under the provisions of 10 U.S.C. 1079(j)(2).
(D) TRICARE is also authorized to deviate from Medicare's basic OPPS methodology to establish special reimbursement methods, amounts, and procedures to encourage use of high-value products and discourage use of low-value products with respect to pharmaceutical agents provided as part of medical services from authorized providers. Therefore, drugs administered other than oral method provided on an outpatient basis by hospitals are paid on the same basis as drugs administered other than oral method covered by the allowable charge method under paragraph (j)(1) of this section.
(E)
Temporary transitional payment adjustments (TTPAs).
Temporary transitional payment adjustments will be in place for all hospitals, both network and non-network, except for cancer and children's hospitals, in order to buffer the initial decline in payments upon implementation of TRICARE's OPPS.
(
1
)
For network hospitals.
The temporary transitional payment adjustments will cover a four-year period. The four-year transition will set higher payment percentages for the ten Ambulatory Payment Classification (APC) codes 604-609 and 613-616, with reductions in each of the transition years. For non-network hospitals, the adjustments will cover a three year period, with reductions in each of the transition years. For network hospitals, under the TTPAs, the APC payment level for the five clinic visit APCs would be set at 175 percent of the Medicare APC level, while the five ER visit APCs would be increased by 200 percent in the first year of OPPS implementation. In the second year, the APC payment levels would be set at 150 percent of the Medicare APC level for clinic visits and 175 percent for ER APCs. In the third year, the APC visit amounts would be set at 130 percent of the Medicare APC level for clinic visits and 150 percent for ER APCs. In the fourth year, the APC visit amounts would be set at 115 percent of the Medicare APC level for clinic visits and 130 percent for ER APCs. In the fifth year, the TRICARE and Medicare payment levels for the 10 APC visit codes would be identical.
(
2
)
For non-network hospitals.
Under the TTPAs, the APC payment level for the five clinic and ER visit APCs would be set at 140 percent of the Medicare APC level in the first year of OPPS implementation. In the second year, the APC payment levels would be set at 125 percent of the Medicare APC level for clinic and ER visits. In the third year, the APC visit amounts would be set at 110 percent of the Medicare APC level for clinic and ER visits. In the fourth year, the TRICARE and Medicare payment levels for the 10 APC visit codes would be identical.
(
3
) An additional general temporary military contingency payment adjustment (GTMCPA) will also be available at the discretion of the Director, or a designee, at any time after implementation to adopt, modify and/or extend temporary adjustments to OPPS payments for TRICARE network hospitals deemed essential for military readiness and deployment in time of contingency operations. Any GTMCPAs to OPPS payments shall be made only on the basis of a determination that it is impracticable to support military readiness or contingency operations by making OPPS payments in accordance with the same reimbursement rules implemented by Medicare. For cancer and children's hospitals to qualify for the GTMCPA, they must meet the criteria in paragraphs (a)(6)(ii)(E)(
3
)(
i
) through (
iii
) of this section. Cancer and children's hospitals that meet these criteria will be eligible to receive up to 115 percent of the hospital's costs for OPPS services. The criteria for adopting, modifying, and/or extending deviations and/or adjustments to OPPS payments shall be issued through
CHAMPUS policies, instructions, procedures and guidelines as deemed appropriate by the Director, or a designee. GTMCPAs may also be extended to non-network hospitals on a case-by-case basis for specific procedures where it is determined that the procedures cannot be obtained timely enough from a network hospital. For such case-by-case extensions, “Temporary” might be less than three years at the discretion of the Director, or designee. The GTMCPA qualification criteria for cancer and children's hospitals follow:
(
i
) Have 10 percent or more of its revenue come from TRICARE for care of ADSMs and ADDs;
(
ii
) Have 10,000 or more of its TRICARE visits paid under the OPPS for ADSMs and ADDs annually; and
(
iii
) Be deemed as essential for TRICARE operations.
(
4
)
For cancer and children's hospitals.
There are no temporary transitional payment adjustments in place. Reimbursement will be on the basis of OPPS, however, payments shall be adjusted so that these providers receive 100 percent of their costs. Adjustments shall be made on an annual basis, and within 180 days of the end of the OPPS year (OPPS Year is defined as April 1 through March 30) DHA will calculate the hospital's costs, utilizing the hospital-specific outpatient cost-to-charge ratio (CCR). The costs shall be calculated by multiplying the hospital's billed charges for OPPS services by the CCR. If the hospital's costs, as calculated by DHA, exceeded the payment that had been made under OPPS, the hospital shall receive an annual payment adjustment so that the hospital receives 100% of their costs.
(iii)
Outpatient Services Subject to CAH Reasonable Cost Method.
For services on or after December 1, 2009, outpatient services provided by a CAH, shall be reimbursed at 101 percent of reasonable cost. This does not include any costs of physician services or other professional services provided to CAH outpatients.
(iv)
CAH Ambulance Services.
Effective for services provided on or after December 1, 2009, payment for ambulance services furnished by a CAH or an entity that is owned and operated by a CAH is the reasonable costs of the CAH or the entity in furnishing those services, but only if the CAH or the entity is the only provider or supplier of ambulance services located within a 35-mile drive of the CAH or the entity as specified under 42 CFR part 413.70(b)(5)(ii).
(7)
Reimbursement for inpatient services provided by an SCH.
(i) In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 1079(j)(2), TRICARE payment methods for institutional care shall be determined, to the extent practicable, in accordance with the same reimbursement rules as those that apply to payments to providers of services of the same type under Medicare. TRICARE's SCH reimbursements approximate Medicare's for SCHs. Inpatient services provided by an SCH, other than services provided in psychiatric and rehabilitation distinct part units, shall be reimbursed through a two-step process.
(ii) The first step referred to in paragraph (a)(7)(i) of this section will be to calculate the TRICARE allowable cost by multiplying the applicable TRICARE percentage by the billed charge amount on each institutional inpatient claim. The applicable TRICARE percentage is the greater of: the SCH's most recently available cost-to-charge ratio (CCR) from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' (CMS') inpatient Provider Specific File (after the ratio has been converted to a percentage), or the TRICARE allowed-to-billed ratio, defined as the ratio of the TRICARE allowed amounts (including discounts) to the amount of billed charges for TRICARE inpatient admissions at the SCH in FY 2012 (after it has been converted to a percentage). The TRICARE allowed-to-billed ratio in FY 2012 shall be reduced as follows (after the ratio has been converted to a percentage):
(A) In the first year of implementation, 10 percentage points for network SCHs and 15 percentage points for non-network SCHs.
(B) In the second year of implementation, 20 percentage points for network SCHs and 30 percentage points for non-network SCHs.
(C) In the third year of implementation, 30 percentage points for network SCHs and 45 percentage points for non-network SCHs.
(D) In the fourth year of implementation, 40 percentage points for network SCHs and 60 percentage points for non-network SCHs.
(E) In the fifth year of implementation, 50 percentage points for network SCHs and 75 percentage points for non-network SCHs.
(F) In the sixth year of implementation, 60 percentage points for network SCHs and 90 percentage points for non-network SCHs.
(G) In the seventh year of implementation, 70 percentage points for network SCHs and 100 percentage points for non-network SCHs.
(H) In the eighth year of implementation, 80 percentage points for network SCHs and 100 percentage points for non-network SCHs.
(I) In the ninth year of implementation, 90 percentage points for network SCHs and 100 percentage points for non-network SCHs.
(J) In the tenth year of implementation, 100 percentage points for network SCHs and 100 percentage points for non-network SCHs.
(iii) The second step referred to in paragraph (a)(7)(i) of this section is a year-end adjustment. The year-end adjustment will compare the aggregate allowable costs over a 12-month period under paragraph (a)(7)(ii) of this section to the aggregate amount that would have been allowed for the same care using the TRICARE DRG-method (under paragraph (a)(1) of this section). In the event that the DRG method amount is the greater, the year-end adjustment will be the amount by which it exceeds the aggregate allowable costs. In addition, the year-end adjustment also may incorporate a possible upward adjustment for inpatient services based on a GTMCPA for TRICARE network hospitals under paragraph (a)(8) of this section.
(iv) At the end of an SCH's transition period, when the SCH reaches its Medicare CCR, a special allowable cost shall be applicable for discharges that group to inpatient nursery and labor/delivery DRGs. For these discharges, instead of using the percentage of the SCH's Medicare cost-to-charge ratio (as described in paragraph (a)(7)(ii) of this section), the percentage will be 130 percent of the Medicare CCR.
(v) The SCH reimbursement provisions of paragraphs (a)(7)(i) through (iv) of this section do not apply to any costs of physician services or other professional services provided to SCH inpatients (which are subject to individual provider payment provisions of this section), inpatient services provided in psychiatric distinct part units (which are subject to the CHAMPUS mental health per-diem payment system), or inpatient services provided in rehabilitation distinct part units (which are reimbursed on the basis of billed charges or set rates).
(vi) The SCH payment system under this paragraph (a)(7) applies to hospitals classified by CMS as Essential Access Community Hospitals (EACHs).
(vii) The SCH payment system under this paragraph (a)(7) does not apply to hospitals in States that are paid by Medicare and TRICARE under a cost containment waiver.
(8)
General temporary military contingency payment adjustment for SCHs and CAHs.
(i) Payments under paragraph (a) of this section for inpatient services provided by SCHs and CAHs may be supplemented by a GTMCPA. This is a year-end discretionary, temporary adjustment that the TMA Director may approve based on all the following criteria:
(A) The hospital serves a disproportionate share of ADSMs and ADDs;
(B) The hospital is a TRICARE network hospital;
(C) The hospital's actual costs for inpatient services exceed TRICARE payments or other extraordinary economic circumstance exists; and,
(D) Without the GTMCPA, DoD's ability to meet military contingency mission requirements will be significantly compromised.
(ii) Policy and procedural instructions implementing the GTMCPA will be issued as deemed appropriate by the Director, TMA, or a designee. As with other discretionary authority under this Part, a decision to allow or deny a GTMCPA to a hospital is not subject to the appeal and hearing procedures of § 199.10.
(9)
Reimbursement for inpatient services provided by a Long Term Care Hospital (LTCH).
(i) In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 1079(i)(2), TRICARE payment methods
for institutional care shall be determined, to the extent practicable, in accordance with the same reimbursement rules as those that apply to payments to providers of services of the same type under Medicare. The TRICARE-LTC-DRG reimbursement methodology shall be in accordance with Medicare's Medicare Severity Long Term Care Diagnosis Related Groups (MS-LTC-DRGs) as found in regulation at 42 CFR part 412, subpart O. Inpatient services provided in hospitals subject to the Medicare LTCH Prospective Payment System (PPS) and classified as LTCHs and also as specified in 42 CFR parts 412 and 413 will be paid in accordance with the provisions outlined in sections 1886(d)(1)(B)(IV) and 1886(m)(6) of the Social Security Act and its implementing Medicare regulation (42 CFR parts 412, 413, and 170) to the extent practicable. Under the above governing provisions, TRICARE will recognize, to the extent practicable, in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 1079(i)(2), Medicare's LTCH PPS methodology to include the relative weights, inpatient operating and capital costs of furnishing covered services (including routine and ancillary services), interrupted stay policy, short-stay and high cost outlier payments, site-neutral payments, wage adjustments for variations in labor-related costs across geographical regions, cost-of-living adjustments, payment adjustments associated with the quality reporting program, method of payment for preadmission services, and updates to the system. TRICARE will not be adopting Medicare's 25 percent threshold payment adjustment.
(ii) Implementation of the TRICARE LTCH PPS will include a gradual transition to full implementation of the Medicare LTCH PPS rates as follows:
(A) For the first 12 months following implementation, the TRICARE LTCH PPS allowable cost will be 135 percent of Medicare LTCH PPS amounts.
(B) For the second 12 months of implementation, TRICARE LTCH PPS allowable cost will be 115 percent of the Medicare LTCH PPS amounts.
(C) For the third 12 months of implementation, and subsequent years, TRICARE LTCH PPS allowable cost will be 100 percent of the Medicare LTCH PPS amounts.
(iii)
Exemption.
The TRICARE LTCH PPS methodology under this paragraph does not apply to hospitals in States that are reimbursed by Medicare and TRICARE under a waiver that exempts them from Medicare's inpatient prospective payment system or the TRICARE DRG-based payment system, to Children's Hospitals, or to Neoplastic Disease Care Hospitals, respectively.
(10)
Reimbursement for inpatient services provided by Inpatient Rehabilitation Facilities (IRF).
(i) In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 1079(i)(2), TRICARE payment methods for institutional care shall be determined to the extent practicable, in accordance with the same reimbursement rules as those that apply to payments to providers of services of the same type under Medicare. The TRICARE IRF PPS reimbursement methodology shall be in accordance with Medicare's IRF PPS as found in 42 CFR part 412. Inpatient services provided in IRFs subject to the Medicare IRF prospective payment system (PPS) and classified as IRFs and also as specified in 42 CFR 412.604 will be paid in accordance with the provisions outlined in section 1886(j) of the Social Security Act and its implementing Medicare regulation found at 42 CFR part 412, subpart P to the extent practicable. Under the above governing provisions, TRICARE will recognize, to the extent practicable, in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 1079(i)(2), Medicare's IRF PPS methodology to include the relative weights, payment rates covering all operating and capitals costs of furnishing rehabilitative services adjusted for wage variations in labor-related costs across geographical regions, adjustments for the 60 percent compliance threshold, teaching adjustment, rural adjustment, high-cost outlier payments, low income payment adjustment, payment adjustments associated with the quality reporting program, and updates to the system.
(ii) Implementation of the TRICARE IRF PPS will include a gradual transition to full implementation of the Medicare IRF PPS rates as follows:
(A) For the first 12 months of implementation, the TRICARE IRF PPS allowable cost will be 135 percent of Medicare IRF PPS amounts.
(B) For the second 12 months of implementation, the TRICARE IRF PPS allowable cost will be 115 percent of the Medicare IRF PPS amounts.
(C) For the third 12 months of implementation, and subsequent years, the TRICARE IRF PPS allowable cost will be 100 percent of the Medicare IRF PPS amounts.
(iii) The IRF PPS allowable cost in paragraph (a)(10)(ii) of this section may be supplemented by an inpatient general temporary military contingency payment adjustment (GTMCPA) for TRICARE authorized IRFs.
(A) This is a year-end discretionary, temporary adjustment that the Director, DHA (or designee) may approve based on the following criteria:
(
1
) The IRF serves a disproportionate share of ADSMs and ADDs;
(
2
) The IRF is a TRICARE network hospital;
(
3
) The IRF's actual costs for inpatient services exceed TRICARE payments or other extraordinary economic circumstance exists; and
(
4
) Without the GTMCPA, DoD's ability to meet military contingency mission requirements will be significantly compromised.
(B) Policy and procedural instructions implementing the GTMCPA will be issued as deemed appropriate by the Director, DHA (or designee). As with other discretionary authority under this part, a decision to allow or deny a GTMCPA to an IRF is not subject to the appeal and hearing procedures of § 199.10.
(iv)
Exemption.
The TRICARE IRF PPS methodology under this paragraph does not apply to hospitals in States that are reimbursed by Medicare and TRICARE under a waiver that exempts them from Medicare's inpatient prospective payment system or the TRICARE DRG-based payment system, to Children's hospitals, or to VA hospitals, respectively.
(b)
Skilled nursing facilities (SNFs)
—(1)
Use of Medicare prospective payment system and rates.
TRICARE payments to SNFs are determined using the same methods and rates used under the Medicare prospective payment system for SNFs under 42 CFR part 413, subpart J, except for children under age ten. SNFs receive a per diem payment of a predetermined Federal payment rate appropriate for the case based on patient classification (using the RUG classification system), urban or rural location of the facility, and area wage index.
(2)
Payment in full.
The SNF payment rates represent payment in full (subject to any applicable beneficiary cost shares) for all costs (routine, ancillary, and capital-related) associated with furnishing inpatient SNF services to TRICARE beneficiaries other than costs associated with operating approved educational activities.
(3)
Education costs.
Costs for approved educational activities shall be subject to separate payment under procedures established by the Director, TRICARE Management Activity. Such procedures shall be similar to procedures for payments for direct medical education costs of hospitals under paragraph (a)(1)(iii)(G)(
2
) of this section.
(4)
Resident assessment data.
SNFs are required to submit the same resident assessment data as is required under the Medicare program. (The residential assessment is addressed in the Medicare regulations at 42 CFR 483.20.) SNFs must submit assessments according to an assessment schedule. This schedule must include performance of patient assessments on the 5th, 14th, and 30th days of SNF care and at each successive 30 day interval of SNF admissions that are longer than 30 days. It must also include such other assessments that are necessary to account for changes in patient care needs. TRICARE pays a default rate for the days of a patient's care for which the SNF has failed to comply with the assessment schedule.
(c)
Reimbursement of Freestanding End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) facilities.
(1) This paragraph (c)(1) establishes payment methods for dialysis provided by TRICARE authorized freestanding ESRD facilities. TRICARE shall reimburse a single, flat, per-session fee to TRICARE authorized freestanding ESRD facilities rendering hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis for treatment of ESRD or AKI. The flat, per-session fee will apply to renal dialysis services furnished in the ESRD facility or in a patient's home. All renal dialysis items
and services furnished in the ESRD facility or in a patient's home are included in the flat per-session rate, except for those items and services listed in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.
(i) Services included in the flat per-session rate must be furnished by an authorized TRICARE ESRD institutional provider:
(A) Institutional charges (e.g., charges for facility use, use or treatment rooms, and general nursing services);
(B) Routine laboratory services related to the dialysis session;
(C) Pharmaceuticals and supplies related to the dialysis;
(D) Home dialysis support services identified at 42 CFR 494.100;
(E) Purchase and delivery of all necessary home dialysis supplies; and
(F) Dialysis training for days 1-120.
(ii) Services which may be billed separately:
(A) Evaluation and management services provided by authorized individual professional providers. These services will continue to be reimbursed using existing reimbursement systems (e.g., CMAC).
(B) Drugs, supplies, and devices listed by Medicare as eligible for Transitional Drug Add-on Payment Adjustment and Transitional Add-on Payment Adjustment for New and Innovative Equipment and Supplies under the Medicare ESRD PPS. These services will continue to be reimbursed using existing reimbursement systems (e.g., CMAC).
(C) Professional services, supplies, and pharmaceuticals unrelated to dialysis care (e.g., if a flu shot is administered at the same time as dialysis treatment). These services will continue to be reimbursed using existing reimbursement systems (e.g., CMAC).
(iii) Establishment of the flat rate:
(A)
Per session rate for treatment days 1-120.
The flat, per-session rate shall be equal to the current Medicare base rate, multiplied by the current Medicare adjustment factor applied to individuals aged 44-69 (7% for CY 22), and further multiplied by the current Medicare adjustment factor for the date of onset (32.7% for CY 2022). The Medicare factors utilized in subsequent years will be based on modifications made under 42 CFR part 413, subpart H, Medicare ESRD PPS.
(B)
Per session rate for treatment day 121 and beyond.
The flat, per-session rate shall be equal to the Medicare base rate, multiplied by the Medicare adjustment factor applied to individuals aged 44-69. The Medicare factors utilized in subsequent years will be based on modifications made under 42 CFR part 413, subpart H, Medicare ESRD PPS.
(C)
Wage adjustment.
The per-session rates in paragraphs (c)(1)(iii)(A) and (B) of this section shall be wage adjusted using the wage adjustment factors and labor-related shares published in the most recent Medicare ESRD Final Rule at the time the annual per-session rates are posted.
(D)
Annual updates.
The per session rates will be updated within 90 days of publication of new Medicare base rates, and published to the TRICARE website at
www.health.mil.
(E)
Dialysis training.
To account for training services and supplies, dialysis training sessions will receive a home dialysis training add-on payment for day treatment days 121 and after. The training add-on payment will not apply to treatment days 1-120, as the onset adjustment factor of 32.7% is applied to the per-session rate for treatment days 1-120.
(2) The reimbursement methods established in paragraph (c)(1) of this section applies to freestanding ESRD facilities meeting the requirements established for TRICARE authorized freestanding ESRD facilities in § 199.6. For purposes of cost-sharing and copayments, treatment provided by freestanding ESRD facilities are considered outpatient specialty visits. The applicable copayments and cost-shares described in §§ 199.4 and 199.17(k)(2)(iii) shall apply. Hospital-based ESRD facilities are not subject to the provisions of this paragraph, and will continue to be reimbursed utilizing other applicable reimbursement systems (e.g., the Outpatient Prospective Payment System).
(d)
Payment of institutional facility costs for ambulatory surgery.
In general, TRICARE pays for institutional facility costs for ambulatory surgery on the basis of prospectively determined
amounts, as provided in this paragraph, with the exception of ambulatory surgery procedures performed in hospital outpatient departments or CAHs, which are to be reimbursed in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (a)(6)(ii) or (iii) of this section. Surgical services provided in Ambulatory Surgery Centers (ASCs) as defined in § 199.2(b) will be paid in accordance with the provisions outlined in section 1833(t) of the Social Security Act and its implementing Medicare regulation (42 CFR part 416). TRICARE will recognize, to the extent practicable, in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 1079(i)(2), Medicare's ASC reimbursement methodology to include specific coding requirements, prospectively determined rates, discounts for multiple surgical procedures, the scope of ASC services, covered surgical procedures, and the basis of payment as described in 42 CFR part 416 with the exception that TRICARE will implement no transitional payments. Payments to ASCs for covered procedures and services will be based on the lesser of the billed charge or the ASC payment rate. Payment for ambulatory surgery procedures is limited to those procedures that are reimbursed by Medicare in ASCs, with the exception of dental procedures that are covered by the TRICARE program, as described in § 199.4. In the absence of a Medicare ASC fee schedule rate, the payment for a covered dental procedure in ASCs will be based on the same rate under TRICARE's OPPS.
(e)
Reimbursement of Birthing Centers.
(1) Reimbursement for maternity care and childbirth services furnished by an authorized birthing center shall be limited to the lower of the CHAMPUS established all-inclusive rate or the center's most-favored all-inclusive rate.
(2) The all-inclusive rate shall include the following to the extent that they are usually associated with a normal pregnancy and childbirth: Laboratory studies, prenatal management, labor management, delivery, post-partum management, newborn care, birth assistant, certified nurse-midwife professional services, physician professional services, and the use of the facility.
(3) The CHAMPUS established all-inclusive rate is equal to the sum of the CHAMPUS area prevailing professional charge for total obstetrical care for a normal pregnancy and delivery and the sum of the average CHAMPUS allowable institutional charges for supplies, laboratory, and delivery room for a hospital inpatient normal delivery. The CHAMPUS established all-inclusive rate areas will coincide with those established for prevailing professional charges and will be updated concurrently with the CHAMPUS area prevailing professional charge database.
(4) Extraordinary maternity care services, when otherwise authorized, may be reimbursed at the lesser of the billed charge or the CHAMPUS allowable charge.
(5) Reimbursement for an incomplete course of care will be limited to claims for professional services and tests where the beneficiary has been screened but rejected for admission into the birthing center program, or where the woman has been admitted but is discharged from the birthing center program prior to delivery, adjudicated as individual professional services and items.
(6) The beneficiary's share of the total reimbursement to a birthing center is limited to the cost-share amount plus the amount billed for non-covered services and supplies.
(f)
Reimbursement of Residential Treatment Centers.
The CHAMPUS rate is the per diem rate that CHAMPUS will authorize for all mental health services rendered to a patient and the patient's family as part of the total treatment plan submitted by a CHAMPUS-approved RTC, and approved by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee.
(1) The all-inclusive per diem rate for RTCs operating or participating in CHAMPUS during the base period of July 1, 1987, through June 30, 1988, will be the lowest of the following conditions:
(i) The CHAMPUS rate paid to the RTC for all-inclusive services as of June 30, 1988, adjusted by the Consumer Price Index—Urban (CPI-U) for medical care as determined applicable by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee; or
(ii) The per diem rate accepted by the RTC from any other agency or organization (public or private) that is high enough to cover one-third of the total patient days during the 12-month period ending June 30, 1988, adjusted by the CPI-U; or

# Note:
The per diem rate accepted by the RTC from any other agency or organization includes the rates accepted from entities such as Government contractors in CHAMPUS demonstration projects.
(iii) An OCHAMPUS determined capped per diem amount not to exceed the 80th percentile of all established CHAMPUS RTC rates nationally, weighted by total CHAMPUS days provided at each rate during the base period discussed in paragraph (f)(1) of this section.
(2) The all-inclusive per diem rates for RTCs which began operation after June 30, 1988, or began operation before July 1, 1988, but had less than 6 months of operation by June 30, 1988, will be calculated based on the lower of the per diem rate accepted by the RTC that is high enough to cover one-third of the total patient days during its first 6 to 12 consecutive months of operation, or the CHAMPUS determined capped amount. Rates for RTCs beginning operation prior to July 1, 1988, will be adjusted by an appropriate CPI-U inflation factor for the period ending June 30, 1988. A period of less than 12 months will be used only when the RTC has been in operation for less than 12 months. Once a full 12 months is available, the rate will be recalculated.
(3) For care on or after April 6, 1995, the per diem amount may not exceed a cap of the 70th percentile of all established Federal fiscal year 1994 RTC rates nationally, weighted by total CHAMPUS days provided at each rate during the first half of Federal fiscal year 1994, and updated to FY95. For Federal fiscal years 1996 and 1997, the cap shall remain unchanged. For Federal fiscal years after fiscal year 1997, the cap shall be adjusted by the Medicare update factor for hospitals and units exempt from the Medicare prospective payment system.
(4) All educational costs, whether they include routine education or special education costs, are excluded from reimbursement except when appropriate education is not available from, or not payable by, a cognizant public entity.
(i) The RTC shall exclude educational costs from its daily costs.
(ii) The RTC's accounting system must be adequate to assure CHAMPUS is not billed for educational costs.
(iii) The RTC may request payment of educational costs on an individual case basis from the Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, when appropriate education is not available from, or not payable by, a cognizant public entity. To qualify for reimbursement of educational costs in individual cases, the RTC shall comply with the application procedures established by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, including, but not limited to, the following:
(A) As part of its admission procedures, the RTC must counsel and assist the beneficiary and the beneficiary's family in the necessary procedures for assuring their rights to a free and appropriate public education.
(B) The RTC must document any reasons why an individual beneficiary cannot attend public educational facilities and, in such a case, why alternative educational arrangements have not been provided by the cognizant public entity.
(C) If reimbursement of educational costs is approved for an individual beneficiary by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, such educational costs shall be shown separately from the RTC's daily costs on the CHAMPUS claim. The amount paid shall not exceed the RTC's most-favorable rate to any other patient, agency, or organization for special or general educational services whichever is appropriate.
(D) If the RTC fails to request CHAMPUS approval of the educational costs on an individual case, the RTC agrees not to bill the beneficiary or the beneficiary's family for any amounts disallowed by CHAMPUS. Requests for payment of educational costs must be referred to the Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee for review and a determination of the applicability of CHAMPUS benefits.
(5) Subject to the applicable RTC cap, adjustments to the RTC rates may be made annually.
(i) For Federal fiscal years through 1995, the adjustment shall be based on the Consumer Price Index-Urban (CPI-U) for medical care as determined applicable by the Director, OCHAMPUS.
(ii) For purposes of rates for Federal fiscal years 1996 and 1997:
(A) For any RTC whose 1995 rate was at or above the thirtieth percentile of all established Federal fiscal year 1995 RTC rates normally, weighted by total CHAMPUS days provided at each rate during the first half of Federal fiscal year 1994, that rate shall remain in effect, with no additional update, throughout fiscal years 1996 and 1997; and
(B) For any RTC whose 1995 rate was below the 30th percentile level determined under paragraph (f)(5)(ii)(A) of this section, the rate shall be adjusted by the lesser of: the CPI-U for medical care, or the amount that brings the rate up to that 30th percentile level.
(iii) For subsequent Federal fiscal years after fiscal year 1997, RTC rates shall be updated by the Medicare update factor for hospitals and units exempt from the Medicare prospective payment system.
(6) For care provided on or after July 1, 1995, CHAMPUS will not pay for days in which the patient is absent on leave from the RTC. The RTC must identify these days when claiming reimbursement.
(g)
Reimbursement of hospice programs.
Hospice care will be reimbursed at one of four predetermined national CHAMPUS rates based on the type and intensity of services furnished to the beneficiary. A single rate is applicable for each day of care except for continuous home care where payment is based on the number of hours of care furnished during a 24-hour period. These rates will be adjusted for regional differences in wages using wage indices for hospice care.
(1)
National hospice rates.
CHAMPUS will use the national hospice rates for reimbursement of each of the following levels of care provided by or under arrangement with a CHAMPUS approved hospice program:
(i)
Routine home care.
The hospice will be paid the routine home care rate for each day the patient is at home, under the care of the hospice, and not receiving continuous home care. This rate is paid without regard to the volume or intensity of routine home care services provided on any given day.
(ii)
Continuous home care.
The hospice will be paid the continuous home care rate when continuous home care is provided. The continuous home care rate is divided by 24 hours in order to arrive at an hourly rate.
(A) A minimum of 8 hours of care must be provided within a 24-hour day starting and ending at midnight.
(B) More than half of the total actual hours being billed for each 24-hour period must be provided by either a registered or licensed practical nurse.
(C) Homemaker and home health aide services may be provided to supplement the nursing care to enable the beneficiary to remain at home.
(D) For every hour or part of an hour of continuous care furnished, the hourly rate will be reimbursed to the hospice up to 24 hours a day.
(iii)
Inpatient respite care.
The hospice will be paid at the inpatient respite care rate for each day on which the beneficiary is in an approved inpatient facility and is receiving respite care.
(A) Payment for respite care may be made for a maximum of 5 days at a time, including the date of admission but not counting the date of discharge. The necessity and frequency of respite care will be determined by the hospice interdisciplinary group with input from the patient's attending physician and the hospice's medical director.
(B) Payment for the sixth and any subsequent days is to be made at the routine home care rate.
(iv)
General inpatient care.
Payment at the inpatient rate will be made when general inpatient care is provided for pain control or acute or chronic symptom management which cannot be managed in other settings. None of the other fixed payment rates (i.e., routine home care) will be applicable for a day on which the patient receives general inpatient care except on the date of discharge.
(v)
Date of discharge.
For the day of discharge from an inpatient unit, the appropriate home care rate is to be paid unless the patient dies as an inpatient. When the patient is discharged deceased, the inpatient rate (general or
respite) is to be paid for the discharge date.
(2)
Use of Medicare rates.
CHAMPUS will use the most current Medicare rates to reimburse hospice programs for services provided to CHAMPUS beneficiaries. It is CHAMPUS' intent to adopt changes in the Medicare reimbursement methodology as they occur; e.g., Medicare's adoption of an updated, more accurate wage index.
(3)
Physician reimbursement.
Payment is dependent on the physician's relationship with both the beneficiary and the hospice program.
(i)
Physicians employed by, or contracted with, the hospice.
(A) Administrative and supervisory activities (i.e., establishment, review and updating of plans of care, supervising care and services, and establishing governing policies) are included in the adjusted national payment rate.
(B) Direct patient care services are paid in addition to the adjusted national payment rate.
(
1
) Physician services will be reimbursed an amount equivalent to 100 percent of the CHAMPUS' allowable charge; i.e., there will be no cost-sharing and/or deductibles for hospice physician services.
(
2
) Physician payments will be counted toward the hospice cap limitation.
(ii)
Independent attending physician.
Patient care services rendered by an independent attending physician (a physician who is not considered employed by or under contract with the hospice) are not part of the hospice benefit.
(A) Attending physician may bill in his/her own right.
(B) Services will be subject to the appropriate allowable charge methodology.
(C) Reimbursement is not counted toward the hospice cap limitation.
(D) Services provided by an independent attending physician must be coordinated with any direct care services provided by hospice physicians.
(E) The hospice must notify the CHAMPUS contractor of the name of the physician whenever the attending physician is not a hospice employee.
(iii)
Voluntary physician services.
No payment will be allowed for physician services furnished voluntarily (both physicians employed by, and under contract with, the hospice and independent attending physicians). Physicians may not discriminate against CHAMPUS beneficiaries; e.g., designate all services rendered to non-CHAMPUS patients as volunteer and at the same time bill for CHAMPUS patients.
(4)
Unrelated medical treatment.
Any covered CHAMPUS services not related to the treatment of the terminal condition for which hospice care was elected will be paid in accordance with standard reimbursement methodologies; i.e., payment for these services will be subject to standard deductible and cost-sharing provisions under the CHAMPUS. A determination must be made whether or not services provided are related to the individual's terminal illness. Many illnesses may occur when an individual is terminally ill which are brought on by the underlying condition of the ill patient. For example, it is not unusual for a terminally ill patient to develop pneumonia or some other illness as a result of his or her weakened condition. Similarly, the setting of bones after fractures occur in a bone cancer patient would be treatment of a related condition. Thus, if the treatment or control of an upper respiratory tract infection is due to the weakened state of the terminal patient, it will be considered a related condition, and as such, will be included in the hospice daily rates.
(5)
Cap amount.
Each CHAMPUS-approved hospice program will be subject to a cap on aggregate CHAMPUS payments from November 1 through October 31 of each year, hereafter known as “the cap period.”
(i) The cap amount will be adjusted annually by the percent of increase or decrease in the medical expenditure category of the Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers (CPI-U).
(ii) The aggregate cap amount (i.e., the statutory cap amount times the number of CHAMPUS beneficiaries electing hospice care during the cap period) will be compared with total actual CHAMPUS payments made during the same cap period.
(iii) Payments in excess of the cap amount must be refunded by the hospice program. The adjusted cap amount
will be obtained from the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) prior to the end of each cap period.
(iv) Calculation of the cap amount for a hospice which has not participated in the program for an entire cap year (November 1 through October 31) will be based on a period of at least 12 months but no more than 23 months. For example, the first cap period for a hospice entering the program on October 1, 1994, would run from October 1, 1994 through October 31, 1995. Similarly, the first cap period for hospice providers entering the program after November 1, 1993 but before November 1, 1994 would end October 31, 1995.
(6)
Inpatient limitation.
During the 12-month period beginning November 1 of each year and ending October 31, the aggregate number of inpatient days, both for general inpatient care and respite care, may not exceed 20 percent of the aggregate total number of days of hospice care provided to all CHAMPUS beneficiaries during the same period.
(i) If the number of days of inpatient care furnished to CHAMPUS beneficiaries exceeds 20 percent of the total days of hospice care to CHAMPUS beneficiaries, the total payment for inpatient care is determined follows:
(A) Calculate the ratio of the maximum number of allowable inpatient days of the actual number of inpatient care days furnished by the hospice to Medicare patients.
(B) Multiply this ratio by the total reimbursement for inpatient care made by the CHAMPUS contractor.
(C) Multiply the number of actual inpatient days in excess of the limitation by the routine home care rate.
(D) Add the amounts calculated in paragraphs (g)(6)(i) (B) and (C) of this section.
(ii) Compare the total payment for inpatient care calculated in paragraph (g)(6)(i)(D) of this section to actual payments made to the hospice for inpatient care during the cap period.
(iii) Payments in excess of the inpatient limitation must be refunded by the hospice program.
(7)
Hospice reporting responsibilities.
The hospice is responsible for reporting the following data within 30 days after the end of the cap period:
(i) Total reimbursement received and receivable for services furnished CHAMPUS beneficiaries during the cap period, including physician's services not of an administrative or general supervisory nature.
(ii) Total reimbursement received and receivable for general inpatient care and inpatient respite care furnished to CHAMPUS beneficiaries during the cap period.
(iii) Total number of inpatient days furnished to CHAMPUS hospice patients (both general inpatient and inpatient respite days) during the cap period.
(iv) Total number of CHAMPUS hospice days (both inpatient and home care) during the cap period.
(v) Total number of beneficiaries electing hospice care. The following rules must be adhered to by the hospice in determining the number of CHAMPUS beneficiaries who have elected hospice care during the period:
(A) The beneficiary must not have been counted previously in either another hospice's cap or another reporting year.
(B) The beneficiary must file an initial election statement during the period beginning September 28 of the previous cap year through September 27 of the current cap year in order to be counted as an electing CHAMPUS beneficiary during the current cap year.
(C) Once a beneficiary has been included in the calculation of a hospice cap amount, he or she may not be included in the cap for that hospice again, even if the number of covered days in a subsequent reporting period exceeds that of the period where the beneficiary was included.
(D) There will be proportional application of the cap amount when a beneficiary elects to receive hospice benefits from two or more different CHAMPUS-certified hospices. A calculation must be made to determine the percentage of the patient's length of stay in each hospice relative to the total length of hospice stay.
(8)
Reconsideration of cap amount and inpatient limit.
A hospice dissatisfied with the contractor's calculation and application of its cap amount and/or inpatient limitation may request and obtain a contractor review if the amount
of program reimbursement in controversy—with respect to matters which the hospice has a right to review—is at least $1000. The administrative review by the contractor of the calculation and application of the cap amount and inpatient limitation is the only administrative review available. These calculations are not subject to the appeal procedures set forth in § 199.10. The methods and standards for calculation of the hospice payment rates established by CHAMPUS, as well as questions as to the validity of the applicable law, regulations or CHAMPUS decisions, are not subject to administrative review, including the appeal procedures of § 199.10.
(9)
Beneficiary cost-sharing.
There are no deductibles under the CHAMPUS hospice benefit. CHAMPUS pays the full cost of all covered services for the terminal illness, except for small cost-share amounts which
may be
collected by the individual hospice for outpatient drugs and biologicals and inpatient respite care.
(i) The patient is responsible for 5 percent of the cost of outpatient drugs or $5 toward each prescription, whichever is less. Additionally, the cost of prescription drugs (drugs or biologicals) may not exceed that which a prudent buyer would pay in similar circumstances; that is, a buyer who refuses to pay more than the going price for an item or service and also seeks to economize by minimizing costs.
(ii) For inpatient respite care, the cost-share for each respite care day is equal to 5 percent of the amount CHAMPUS has estimated to be the cost of respite care, after adjusting the national rate for local wage differences.
(iii) The amount of the individual cost-share liability for respite care during a hospice cost-share period may not exceed the Medicare inpatient hospital deductible applicable for the year in which the hospice cost-share period began. The individual hospice cost-share period begins on the first day an election is in effect for the beneficiary and ends with the close of the first period of 14 consecutive days on each of which an election is not in effect for the beneficiary.
(h)
Reimbursement of Home Health Agencies (HHAs).
HHAs will be reimbursed using the same methods and rates as used under the Medicare HHA prospective payment system under Section 1895 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395fff) and 42 CFR Part 484, Subpart E except as otherwise necessary to recognize distinct characteristics of TRICARE beneficiaries and as described in instructions issued by the Director, TMA. Under this methodology, an HHA will receive a fixed case-mix and wage-adjusted national 60-day episode payment amount as payment in full for all costs associated with furnishing home health services to TRICARE-eligible beneficiaries with the exception of osteoporosis drugs and DME. The full case-mix and wage-adjusted 60-day episode amount will be payment in full subject to the following adjustments and additional payments:
(1)
Split percentage payments.
The initial percentage payment for initial episodes is paid to an HHA at 60 percent of the case-mix and wage adjusted 60-day episode rate. The residual final payment for initial episodes is paid at 40 percent of the case-mix and wage adjusted 60-day episode rate subject to appropriate adjustments. The initial percentage payment for subsequent episodes is paid at 50 percent of the case-mix and wage-adjusted 60-day episode rate. The residual final payment for subsequent episodes is paid at 50 percent of the case-mix and wage-adjusted 60-day episode rate subject to appropriate adjustments.
(2)
Low-utilization payment.
A low utilization payment is applied when a HHA furnishes four or fewer visits to a beneficiary during the 60-day episode. The visits are paid at the national per-visit amount by discipline updated annually by the applicable market basket for each visit type.
(3)
Partial episode payment (PEP).
A PEP adjustment is used for payment of an episode of less than 60 days resulting from a beneficiary's elected transfer to another HHA prior to the end of the 60-day episode or discharge and readmission of a beneficiary to the same HHA before the end of the 60-day episode. The PEP payment is calculated by multiplying the proportion of the 60-day episode during which the beneficiary remained under the care of the
original HHA by the beneficiary's assigned 60-day episode payment.
(4)
Significant change in condition (SCIC).
The full-episode payment amount is adjusted if a beneficiary experiences a significant change in condition during the 60-day episode that was not envisioned in the initial treatment plan. The total significant change in condition payment adjustment is a proportional payment adjustment reflecting the time both prior to and after the patient experienced a significant change in condition during the 60-day episode. The initial percentage payment provided at the start of the 60-day episode will be adjusted at the end of the episode to reflect the first and second parts of the total SCIC adjustment determined at the end of the 60-day episode. The SCIC payment adjustment is calculated in two parts:
(i) The first part of the SCIC payment adjustment reflects the adjustment to the level of payment prior to the significant change in the patient's condition during the 60-day episode.
(ii) The second part of the SCIC payment adjustment reflects the adjustment to the level of payment after the significant change in the patient's condition occurs during the 60-day episode.
(5)
Outlier payment.
Outlier payments are allowed in addition to regular 60-day episode payments for beneficiaries generating excessively high treatment costs. The following methodology is used for calculation of the outlier payment:
(i) TRICARE makes an outlier payment for an episode whose estimated cost exceeds a threshold amount for each case-mix group.
(ii) The outlier threshold for each case-mix group is the episode payment amount for that group, the PEP adjustment amount for the episode or the total significant change in condition adjustment amount for the episode plus a fixed dollar loss amount that is the same for all case-mix groups.
(iii) The outlier payment is a proportion of the amount of estimated cost beyond the threshold.
(iv) TRICARE imputes the cost for each episode by multiplying the national per-visit amount of each discipline by the number of visits in the discipline and computing the total imputed cost for all disciplines.
(v) The fixed dollar loss amount and the loss sharing proportion are chosen so that the estimated total outlier payment is no more than the predetermined percentage of total payment under the home health PPS as set by the Centers for Medicare
Medicaid Services (CMS).
(6)
Services paid outside the HHA prospective payment system.
The following are services that receive a separate payment amount in addition to the prospective payment amount for home health services:
(i)
Durable medical equipment (DME).
Reimbursement of DME is based on the same amounts established under the Medicare Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics and Supplies (DMEPOS) fee schedule under 42 CFR part 414, subpart D.
(ii)
Osteoporosis drugs.
Although osteoporosis drugs are subject to home health consolidated billing, they continue to be paid on a cost basis, in addition to episode payments.
(7)
Accelerated payments.
Upon request, an accelerated payment may be made to an HHA that is receiving payment under the home health prospective payment system if the HHA is experiencing financial difficulties because there is a delay by the contractor in making payment to the HHA. The following are criteria for making accelerated payments:
(i)
Approval of payment.
An HHA's request for an accelerated payment must be approved by the contractor and TRICARE Management Activity (TMA).
(ii)
Amount of payment.
The amount of the accelerated payment is computed as a percentage of the net payment for unbilled or unpaid covered services.
(iii)
Recovery of payment.
Recovery of the accelerated payment is made by recoupment as HHA bills are processed or by direct payment by the HHA.
(8)
Assessment data.
Beneficiary assessment data, incorporating the use of the current version of the OASIS items, must be submitted to the contractor for payment under the HHA prospective payment system.
(9)
Administrative review.
An HHA is not entitled to judicial or administrative review with regard to:
(i) Establishment of the payment unit, including the national 60-day prospective episode payment rate, adjustments and outlier payment.
(ii) Establishment of transition period, definition and application of the unit of payment.
(iii) Computation of the initial standard prospective payment amounts.
(iv) Establishment of case-mix and area wage adjustment factors.
(i)
Changes in Federal Law affecting Medicare.
With regard to paragraph (b) and (h) of this section, the Department of Defense must, within the time frame specified in law and to the extent it is practicable, bring the TRICARE program into compliance with any changes in Federal Law affecting the Medicare program that occur after the effective date of the DoD rule to implement the prospective payment systems for skilled nursing facilities and home health agencies.
(j) Reimbursement of individual health care professionals and other non-institutional, non-professional providers. The CHAMPUS-determined reasonable charge (the amount allowed by CHAMPUS) for the service of an individual health care professional or other non-institutional, non-professional provider (even if employed by or under contract to an institutional provider) shall be determined by one of the following methodologies, that is, whichever is in effect in the specific geographic location at the time covered services and supplies are provided to a CHAMPUS beneficiary.
(1)
Allowable charge method
—(i)
Introduction
—(A)
In general.
The allowable charge method is the preferred and primary method for reimbursement of individual health care professionals and other non-institutional health care providers (covered by 10 U.S.C. 1079(h)(1)). The allowable charge for authorized care shall be the lower of the billed charge or the local CHAMPUS Maximum Allowable Charge (CMAC).
(B)
CHAMPUS Maximum Allowable Charge.
Beginning in calendar year 1992, prevailing charge levels and appropriate charge levels will be calculated on a national level. There will then be calculated a national CHAMPUS Maximum Allowable Charge (CMAC) level for each procedure, which shall be the lesser of the national prevailing charge level or the national appropriate charge level. The national CMAC will then be adjusted for localities in accordance with paragraph (j)(1)(iv) of this section.
(C)
Limits on balance billing by nonparticipating providers.
Nonparticipating providers may not balance bill a beneficiary an amount which exceeds the applicable balance billing limit. The balance billing limit shall be the same percentage as the Medicare limiting charge percentage for nonparticipating physicians. The balance billing limit may be waived by the Director, OCHAMPUS on a case-by-case basis if requested by the CHAMPUS beneficiary (or sponsor) involved. A decision by the Director to waive or not waive the limit in any particular case is not subject to the appeal and hearing procedures of § 199.10.
(D)
Special rule for TRICARE Prime Enrollees.
In the case of a TRICARE Prime enrollee (see section 199.17) who receives authorized care from a non-participating provider, the CHAMPUS determined reasonable charge will be the CMAC level as established in paragraph (j)(1)(i)(B) of this section plus any balance billing amount up to the balance billing limit as referred to in paragraph (j)(1)(i)(C) of this section. The authorization for such care shall be pursuant to the procedures established by the Director, OCHAMPUS (also referred to as the TRICARE Support Office).
(E)
Special rule for certain TRICARE Standard Beneficiaries.
In the case of dependent spouse or child, as defined in paragraphs (b)(2)(ii)(A) through (F) and (b)(2)(ii)(H)(1), (2), and (4) of § 199.3, of a Reserve Component member serving on active duty pursuant to a call or order to active duty for a period of more than 30 days in support of a contingency operation under a provision of law referred to in section 101(a)(13)(B) of title 10, United States Code, the Director, TRICARE Management Activity, may authorize non-participating providers the allowable charge to be the CMAC level as established in paragraph (j)(l)(i)(B) of this section plus
any balance billing amount up to the balance billing limit as referred to in paragraph (j)(l)(i)(C) of this section.
(ii)
Prevailing charge level.
(A) Beginning in calendar year 1992, the prevailing charge level shall be calculated on a national basis.
(B) The national prevailing charge level referred to in paragraph (j)(1)(ii)(A) of this section is the level that does not exceed the amount equivalent to the 80th percentile of billed charges made for similar services during the base period. The 80th percentile of charges shall be determined on the basis of statistical data and methodology acceptable to the Director, OCHAMPUS (or a designee).
(C) For purposes of paragraph (j)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, the base period shall be a period of 12 calendar months and shall be adjusted once a year, unless the Director, OCHAMPUS, determines that a different period for adjustment is appropriate and publishes a notice to that effect in the
Federal Register.
(iii)
Appropriate charge level.
Beginning in calendar year 1992, the appropriate charge level shall be calculated on a national basis. The appropriate charge level for each procedure is the product of the two-step process set forth in paragraphs (j)(1)(iii) (A) and (B) of this section. This process involves comparing the prior year's CMAC with the fully phased in Medicare fee. For years after the Medicare fee has been fully phased in, the comparison shall be to the current year Medicare fee. For any particular procedure for which comparable Medicare fee and CHAMPUS data are unavailable, but for which alternative data are available that the Director, OCHAMPUS (or designee) determines provide a reasonable approximation of relative value or price, the comparison may be based on such alternative data.
(A)
Step 1: Procedures classified.
All procedures are classified into one of three categories, as follows:
(
1
)
Overpriced procedures.
These are the procedures for which the prior year's national CMAC exceeds the Medicare fee.
(
2
)
Other procedures.
These are procedures subject to the allowable charge method that are not included in either the overpriced procedures group or the underpriced procedures group.
(
3
)
Underpriced procedures.
These are the procedures for which the prior year's national CMAC is less than the Medicare fee.
(B)
Step 2: Calculating appropriate charge levels.
For each year, appropriate charge levels will be calculated by adjusting the prior year's CMAC as follows:
(
1
) For overpriced procedures, the appropriate charge level for each procedure shall be the prior year's CMAC, reduced by the lesser of: the percentage by which it exceeds the Medicare fee or fifteen percent.
(
2
) For other procedures, the appropriate charge level for each procedure shall be the same as the prior year's CMAC.
(
3
) For underpriced procedures, the appropriate charge level for each procedure shall be the prior year's CMAC, increased by the lesser of: the percentage by which it is exceeded by the Medicare fee or the Medicare Economic Index.
(C)
Special rule for cases in which the CHAMPUS appropriate charge was prematurely reduced.
In any case in which a recalculation of the Medicare fee results in a Medicare rate higher than the CHAMPUS appropriate charge for a procedure that had been considered an overpriced procedure, the reduction in the CHAMPUS appropriate charge shall be restored up to the level of the recalculated Medicare rate.
(D)
Special rule for cases in which the national CMAC is less than the Medicare rate.

# Note:
This paragraph will be implemented when CMAC rates are published.
In any case in which the national CMAC calculated in accordance with paragraphs (j)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section is less than the Medicare rate, the Director, TSO, may determine that the use of the Medicare Economic Index under paragraph (j)(1)(iii)(B) of this section will result in a CMAC rate below the level necessary to assure that beneficiaries will retain adequate access to health care services. Upon making such a determination, the Director, TSO, may increase the national
CMAC to a level not greater than the Medicare rate.
(iv)
Calculating CHAMPUS Maximum Allowable Charge levels for localities
—(A)
In general.
The national CHAMPUS Maximum Allowable Charge level for each procedure will be adjusted for localities using the same (or similar) geographical areas and the same geographic adjustment factors as are used for determining allowable charges under Medicare.
(B)
Special locality-based phase-in provision
—(
1
)
In general.
Beginning with the recalculation of CMACS for calendar year 1993, the CMAC in a locality will not be less than 72.25 percent of the maximum charge level in effect for that locality on December 31, 1991. For recalculations of CMACs for calendar years after 1993, the CMAC in a locality will not be less than 85 percent of the CMAC in effect for that locality at the end of the prior calendar year.
(
2
)
Exception.
The special locality-based phase-in provision established by paragraph (j)(1)(iv)(B)(
1
) of this section shall not be applicable in the case of any procedure code for which there were not CHAMPUS claims in the locality accounting for at least 50 services.
(C)
Special locality-based waivers of reductions to assure adequate access to care.
Beginning with the recalculation of CMACs for calendar year 1993, in the case of any procedure classified as an overpriced procedure pursuant to paragraph (j)(1)(iii)(A)(
1
) of this section, a reduction in the CMAC in a locality below the level in effect at the end of the previous calendar year that would otherwise occur pursuant to paragraphs (j)(1)(iii) and (j)(1)(iv) of this section may be waived pursuant to paragraph (j)(1)(iii)(C) of this section.
(
1
)
Waiver based on balanced billing rates.
Except as provided in paragraph (j)(1)(iv)(C)(
2
) of this section such a reduction will be waived if there has been excessive balance billing in the locality for the procedure involved. For this purpose, the extent of balance billing will be determined based on a review of all services under the procedure code involved in the prior year (or most recent period for which data are available). If the number of services for which balance billing was not required was less than 60 percent of all services provided, the Director will determine that there was excessive balance billing with respect to that procedure in that locality and will waive the reduction in the CMAC that would otherwise occur. A decision by the Director to waive or not waive the reduction is not subject to the appeal and hearing procedures of § 199.10.
(
2
)
Exception.
As an exception to the paragraph (j)(1)(iv)(C)(
1
) of this section, the waiver required by that paragraph shall not be applicable in the case of any procedure code for which there were not CHAMPUS claims in the locality accounting for at least 50 services. A waiver may, however, be granted in such cases pursuant to paragraph (j)(1)(iv)(C)(
3
) of this section.
(
3
)
Waiver based on other evidence that adequate access to care would be impaired.
The Director, OCHAMPUS may waive a reduction that would otherwise occur (or restore a reduction that was already taken) if the Director determines that available evidence shows that the reduction would impair adequate access. For this purpose, such evidence may include consideration of the number of providers in the locality who provide the affected services, the number of such providers who are CHAMPUS Participating Providers, the number of CHAMPUS beneficiaries in the area, and other relevant factors. Providers or beneficiaries in a locality may submit to the Director, OCHAMPUS a petition, together with appropriate documentation regarding relevant factors, for a determination that adequate access would be impaired. The Director, OCHAMPUS will consider and respond to all such petitions. Petitions may be filed at any time. Any petition received by the date which is 120 days prior to the implementation of a recalculation of CMACs will be assured of consideration prior to that implementation. The Director, OCHAMPUS may establish procedures for handling petitions. A decision by the Director to waive or not waive a reduction is not subject to the appeal and hearing procedures of § 199.10.
(D)
Special locality-based exception to applicable CMACs to assure adequate beneficiary access to care.
In addition to the authority to waive reductions
under paragraph (j)(1)(iv)(C) of this section, the Director may authorize establishment of higher payment rates for specific services than would otherwise be allowable, under paragraph (j)(1) of this section, if the Director determines that available evidence shows that access to health care services is severely impaired. For this purpose, such evidence may include consideration of the number of providers in the locality who provide the affected services, the number of providers who are CHAMPUS participating providers, the number of CHAMPUS beneficiaries in the locality, the availability of military providers in the location or nearby, and any other factors the Director determines relevant.
(
1) Procedure.
Providers or beneficiaries in a locality may submit to the Director, a petition, together with appropriate documentation regarding relevant factors, for a determination that adequate access to health care services is severely impaired. The Director, will consider and respond to all petitions. A decision to authorize a higher payment amount is subject to review and determination or modification by the Director at any time if circumstances change so that adequate access to health care services would no longer be severely impaired. A decision by the Director, to authorize, not authorize, terminate, or modify authorization of higher payment amounts is not subject to the appeal and hearing procedures of § 199.10 of the part.
(
2) Establishing the higher payment rate(s).
When the Director, determines that beneficiary access to health care services in a locality is severely impaired, the Director may establish the higher payment rate(s) as he or she deems appropriate and cost-effective through one of the following methodologies to assure adequate access:
(
i
) A percent factor may be added to the otherwise applicable payment amount allowable under paragraph (j)(1) of this section;
(
ii
) A prevailing charge may be calculated, by applying the prevailing charge methodology of paragraph (j)(1)(ii) of this section to a specific locality (which need not be the same as the localities used for purposes of paragraph (j)(1)(iv)(A) of this section; or another government payment rate may be adopted, for example, an applicable state Medicaid rate).
(
3) Application of higher payment rates.
Higher payment rates defined under paragraph (j)(1)(iv)(D) of this section may be applied to all similar services performed in a locality, or, if circumstances warrant, a new locality may be defined for application of the higher payments. Establishment of a new locality may be undertaken where access impairment is localized and not pervasive across the existing locality. Generally, establishment of a new, more specific locality will occur when the area is remote so that geographical characteristics and other factors significantly impair transportation through normal means to health care services routinely available within the existing locality.
(E)
Special locality-based exception to applicable CMACs to ensure an adequate TRICARE Prime preferred network.
The Director, may authorize reimbursements to health care providers participating in a TRICARE preferred provider network under § 199.17(p) of this part at rates higher than would otherwise be allowable under paragraph (j)(1) of this section, if the Director, determines that application of the higher rates is necessary to ensure the availability of an adequate number and mix of qualified health care providers in a network in a specific locality. This authority may only be used to ensure adequate networks in those localities designated by the Director, as requiring TRICAR preferred provider networks, not in localities in which preferred provider networks have been suggested or established but are not determined by the Director to be necessary. Appropriate evidence for determining that higher rates are necessary may include consideration of the number of available primary care and specialist providers in the network locality, availability (including reassignment) of military providers in the location or nearby, the appropriate mix of primary care and specialists needed to satisfy demand and meet appropriate patient access standards (appointment/waiting time, travel distance, etc.), the efforts that have been made to create
an adequate network, other cost-effective alternatives, and other relevant factors. The Director, may establish procedures by which exceptions to applicable CMACs are requested and approved or denied under paragraph (j)(1)(iv)(E) of this section. A decision by the Director, to authorize or deny an exception is not subject to the appeal and hearing procedures of § 199.10. When the Director, determines that it is necessary and cost-effective to approve a higher rate or rates in order to ensure the availability of an adequate number of qualified health care providers in a network in a specific locality, the higher rate may not exceed the lesser of the following:
(
1
) The amount equal to the local fee for service charge for the service in the service area in which the service is provided as determined by the Director, based on one or more of the following payment rates:
(
i
) Usual, customary, and reasonable;
(
ii
) The Health Care Financing Administration's Resource Based Relative Value Scale;
(
iii
) Negotiated fee schedules;
(
iv
) Global fees; or
(
v
) Sliding scale individual fee allowances.
(
2
) The amount equal to 115 percent of the otherwise allowable charge under paragraph (j)(1) of the section for the service.
(v)
Special rules for 1991.
(A) Appropriate charge levels for care provided on or after January 1, 1991, and before the 1992 appropriate levels take effect shall be the same as those in effect on December 31, 1990, except that appropriate charge levels for care provided on or after October 7, 1991, shall be those established pursuant to this paragraph (j)(1)(v) of this section.
(B) Appropriate charge levels will be established for each locality for which an appropriate charge level was in effect immediately prior to October 7, 1991. For each procedure, the appropriate charge level shall be the prevailing charge level in effect immediately prior to October 7, 1991, adjusted as provided in (j)(1)(v)(B) (
1
) through (
3
) of this section.
(
1
) For each overpriced procedure, the level shall be reduced by fifteen percent. For this purpose, overpriced procedures are the procedures determined by the Physician Payment Review Commission to be overvalued pursuant to the process established under the Medicare program, other procedures considered overvalued in the Medicare program (for which Congress directed reductions in Medicare allowable levels for 1991), radiology procedures and pathology procedures.
(
2
) For each other procedure, the level shall remain unchanged. For this purpose, other procedures are procedures which are not overpriced procedures or primary care procedures.
(
3
) For each primary care procedure, the level shall be adjusted by the MEI, as the MEI is applied to Medicare prevailing charge levels. For this purpose, primary care procedures include maternity care and delivery services and well baby care services.
(C) For purposes of this paragraph (j)(i)(v), “appropriate charge levels” in effect at any time prior to October 7, 1991 shall mean the lesser of:
(
1
) The prevailing charge levels then in effect, or
(
2
) The fiscal year 1988 prevailing charge levels adjusted by the Medicare Economic Index (MEI), as the MEI was applied beginning in the fiscal year 1989.
(vi)
Special transition rule for 1992.
(A) For purposes of calculating the national appropriate charge levels for 1992, the prior year's appropriate charge level for each service will be considered to be the level that does not exceed the amount equivalent to the 80th percentile of billed charges made for similar services during the base period of July 1, 1986 to June 30, 1987 (determined as under paragraph (j)(1)(ii)(B) of this section), adjusted to calendar year 1991 based on the adjustments made for maximum CHAMPUS allowable charge levels through 1990 and the application of paragraph (j)(1)(v) of this section for 1991.
(B) The adjustment to calendar year 1991 of the product of paragraph (j)(1)(vi)(A) of this section shall be as follows:
(
1
) For procedures other than those described in paragraph (j)(1)(vi)(B)(
2
) of this section, the adjustment to 1991
shall be on the same basis as that provided under paragraph (j)(1)(v) of this section.
(
2
) For any procedure that was considered an overpriced procedure for purposes of the 1991 appropriate charge levels under paragraph (j)(1)(v) of this section for which the resulting 1991 appropriate charge level was less than 150 percent of the Medicare converted relative value unit, the adjustment to 1991 for purposes of the special transition rule for 1992 shall be as if the procedure had been treated under paragraph (j)(1)(v)(B)(
2
) of this section for purposes of the 1991 appropriate charge level.
(vii)
Adjustments and procedural rules.
(A) The Director, OCHAMPUS may make adjustments to the appropriate charge levels calculated pursuant to paragraphs (j)(1)(iii) and (j)(1)(v) of this section to correct any anomalies resulting from data or statistical factors, significant differences between Medicare-relevant information and CHAMPUS-relevant considerations or other special factors that fairness requires be specially recognized. However, no such adjustment may result in reducing an appropriate charge level.
(B) The Director, OCHAMPUS will issue procedural instructions for administration of the allowable charge method.
(viii)
Clinical laboratory services.
The allowable charge for clinical diagnostic laboratory test services shall be calculated in the same manner as allowable charges for other individual health care providers are calculated pursuant to paragraphs (j)(1)(i) through (j)(1)(iv) of this section, with the following exceptions and clarifications.
(A) The calculation of national prevailing charge levels, national appropriate charge levels and national CMACs for laboratory service shall begin in calendar year 1993. For purposes of the 1993 calculation, the prior year's national appropriate charge level or national prevailing charge level shall be the level that does not exceed the amount equivalent to the 80th percentile of billed charges made for similar services during the period July 1, 1991, through June 30, 1992 (referred to in this paragraph (j)(1)(viii) of this section as the “base period”).
(B) For purposes of comparison to Medicare allowable payment amounts pursuant to paragraph (j)(1)(iii) of this section, the Medicare national laboratory payment limitation amounts shall be used.
(C) For purposes of establishing laboratory service local CMACs pursuant to paragraph (j)(1)(iv) of this section, the adjustment factor shall equal the ratio of the local average charge (standardized for the distribution of clinical laboratory services) to the national average charge for all clinical laboratory services during the base period.
(D) For purposes of a special locality-based phase-in provision similar to that established by paragraph (j)(1)(iv)(B) of this section, the CMAC in a locality will not be less than 85 percent of the maximum charge level in effect for that locality during the base period.
(ix) The allowable charge for physician assistant services other than assistant-at-surgery shall be at the same percentage, used by Medicare, of the allowable charge for a comparable service rendered by a physician performing the service in a similar location. For cases in which the physician assistant and the physician perform component services of a procedure other than assistant-at-surgery (e.g., home, office, or hospital visit), the combined allowable charge for the procedure may not exceed the allowable charge for the procedure rendered by a physician alone. The allowable charge for physician assistant services performed as an assistant-at-surgery shall be at the same percentage, used by Medicare, of the allowable charge for a physician serving as an assistant surgeon when authorized as CHAMPUS benefits in accordance with the provisions of § 199.4(c)(3)(iii). Physician assistant services must be billed through the employing physician who must be an authorized CHAMPUS provider.
(x) A charge that exceeds the CHAMPUS Maximum Allowable Charge can be determined to be allowable only when unusual circumstances or medical complications justify the higher charge. The allowable charge may not exceed the billed charge under any circumstances.
(xi)
Pharmaceutical agents utilized as part of medically necessary medical services.
In general, the TRICARE-determined allowed amount shall be equal to an amount determined to be appropriate, to the extent practicable, in accordance with the same reimbursement rules as apply to payments for similar services under Medicare. Under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 1079(q), in the case of any pharmaceutical agent utilized as part of medically necessary medical services, the Director may adopt special reimbursement methods, amounts, and procedures to encourage the use of high-value products and discourage the use of low-value products, as determined by the Director. For this purpose, the Director may obtain recommendations from the Pharmaceutical and Therapeutics Committee under § 199.21 or other entities as the Director, DHA deems appropriate with respect to the relative value of products in a class of products subject to this paragraph (j)(1)(xi). Among the special reimbursement methods the Director may choose to adopt under this paragraph (j)(1)(xi) is to reimburse the average sales price of a product plus six percent of the median of the average sales prices of products in the product class or category. The Director shall issue guidance regarding the special reimbursement methods adopted and the appropriate reimbursement rates.
(2)
Bonus payments in medically underserved areas.
A bonus payment, in addition to the amount normally paid under the allowable charge methodology, may be made to physicians in medically underserved areas. For purposes of this paragraph, medically underserved areas are the same as those determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services for the Medicare program. Such bonus payments shall be equal to the bonus payments authorized by Medicare, except as necessary to recognize any unique or distinct characteristics or requirements of the TRICARE program, and as described in instructions issued by the Executive Director, TRICARE Management Activity. If the Department of Health and Human Services acts to amend or remove the provision for bonus payments under Medicare, TRICARE likewise may follow Medicare in amending or removing provision for such payments.
(3)
All-inclusive rate.
Claims from individual health-care professional providers for services rendered to CHAMPUS beneficiaries residing in an RTC that is either being reimbursed on an all-inclusive per diem rate, or is billing an all-inclusive per diem rate, shall be denied; with the exception of independent health-care professionals providing geographically distant family therapy to a family member residing a minimum of 250 miles from the RTC or covered medical services related to a nonmental health condition rendered outside the RTC. Reimbursement for individual professional services is included in the rate paid the institutional provider.
(4)
Alternative method.
The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, may, subject to the approval of the ASD(HA), establish an alternative method of reimbursement designed to produce reasonable control over health care costs and to ensure a high level of acceptance of the CHAMPUS-determined charge by the individual health-care professionals or other noninstitutional health-care providers furnishing services and supplies to CHAMPUS beneficiaries. Alternative methods may not result in reimbursement greater than the allowable charge method above.
(k)
Reimbursement of Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, orthotics and Supplies 9DMEPOS).
Reimbursement of DMEPOS may be based on the same amounts established under the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) DMEPOS fee schedule under 42 CFR part 414, subpart D.
(l)
Reimbursement Under the Military-Civilian Health Services Partnership Program.
The Military-Civilian Health Services Partnership Program, as authorized by section 1096, chapter 55, title 10, provides for the sharing of staff, equipment, and resources between the civilian and military health care system in order to achieve more effective, efficient, or economical health care for authorized beneficiaries. Military treatment facility commanders, based upon the authority provided by their respective Surgeons General of the military departments,
are responsible for entering into individual partnership agreements only when they have determined specifically that use of the Partnership Program is more economical overall to the Government than referring the need for health care services to the civilian community under the normal operation of the CHAMPUS Program. (See paragraph (p) of § 199.1 for general requirements of the Partnership Program.)
(1)
Reimbursement of institutional health care providers.
Reimbursement of institutional health care providers under the Partnership Program shall be on the same basis as non-Partnership providers.
(2)
Reimbursement of individual health-care professionals and other non-institutional health care providers.
Reimbursement of individual health care professionals and other non-institutional health care providers shall be on the same basis as non-Partnership providers as detailed in paragraph (j) of this section.
(m)
Accommodation of Discounts Under Provider Reimbursement Methods
—(1)
General rule.
The Director. OCHAMPUS (or designee) has authority to reimburse a provider at an amount below the amount usually paid pursuant to this section when, under a program approved by the Director, the provider has agreed to the lower amount.
(2)
Special applications.
The following are examples of applications of the general rule; they are not all inclusive.
(i) In the case and individual health care professionals and other non-institutional providers, if the discounted fee is below the provider's normal billed charge and the prevailing charge level (see paragraph (g) of this section), the discounted fee shall be the provider's actual billed charge and the CHAMPUS allowable charge.
(ii) In the case of institutional providers normally paid on the basis of a pre-set amount (such as DRG-based amount under paragraph (a)(1) of this section or per-diem amount under paragraph (a)(2) of this section), if the discount rate is lower than the pre-set rate, the discounted rate shall be the CHAMPUS-determined allowable cost. This is an exception to the usual rule that the pre-set rate is paid regardless of the institutional provider's billed charges or other factors.

§ 199.15
Quality and utilization review peer review organization program.
(a)
General
—(1)
Purpose.
The purpose of this section is to establish rules and procedures for the CHAMPUS Quality and Utilization Review Peer Review Organization program.
(2)
Applicability of program.
All claims submitted for health services under CHAMPUS are subject to review for quality of care and appropriate utilization. The Director, OCHAMPUS shall establish generally accepted standards, norms and criteria as are necessary for this program of utilization and quality review. These standards, norms and criteria shall include, but not be limited to, need for inpatient admission or inpatient or outpatient service, length of inpatient stay, intensity of care, appropriateness of treatment, and level of
institutional care required. The Director, OCHAMPUS may issue implementing instructions, procedures and guidelines for retrospective, concurrent and prospective review.
(3)
Contractor implementation.
The CHAMPUS Quality and Utilization Review Peer Review Organization program may be implemented through contracts administered by the Director, OCHAMPUS. These contractors may include contractors that have exclusive functions in the area of utilization and quality review, fiscal intermediary contractors (which perform these functions along with a broad range of administrative services), and managed care contractors (which perform a range of functions concerning management of the delivery and financing of health care services under CHAMPUS). Regardless of the contractors involved, utilization and quality review activities follow the same standards, rules and procedures set forth in this section, unless otherwise specifically provided in this section or elsewhere in this part.
(4)
Medical issues affected.
The CHAMPUS Quality and Utilization Review Peer Review Organization program is distinguishable in purpose and impact from other activities relating to the administration and management of CHAMPUS in that the Peer Review Organization program is concerned primarily with medical judgments regarding the quality and appropriateness of health care services. Issues regarding such matters as benefit limitations are similar, but, if not determined on the basis of medical judgments, are governed by CHAMPUS rules and procedures other than those provided in this section. (See, for example, § 199.7 regarding claims submission, review and payment.) Based on this purpose, a major attribute of the Peer Review Organization program is that medical judgments are made by (directly or pursuant to guidelines and subject to direct review) reviewers who are peers of the health care providers providing the services under review.
(5)
Provider responsibilities.
Because of the dominance of medical judgments in the quality and utilization review program, principal responsibility for complying with program rules and procedures rests with health care providers. For this reason, there are limitations, set forth in this section and in § 199.4(h), on the extent to which beneficiaries may be held financially liable for health care services not provided in conformity with rules and procedures of the quality and utilization review program concerning medical necessity of care.
(6)
Medicare rules used as model.
The CHAMPUS Quality and Utilization Review Peer Review Organization program, based on specific statutory authority, follows many of the quality and utilization review requirements and procedures in effect for the Medicare Peer Review Organization program, subject to adaptations appropriate for the CHAMPUS program. In recognition of the similarity of purpose and design between the Medicare and CHAMPUS PRO programs, and to avoid unnecessary duplication of effort, the CHAMPUS Quality and Utilization Review Peer Review Organization program will have special procedures applicable to supplies and services furnished to Medicare-eligible CHAMPUS beneficiaries. These procedures will enable CHAMPUS normally to rely upon Medicare determinations of medical necessity and appropriateness in the processing of CHAMPUS claims as a second payer to Medicare. As a general rule, only in cases involving Medicare-eligible CHAMPUS beneficiaries where Medicare payment for services and supplies is denied for reasons other than medical necessity and appropriateness will the CHAMPUS claim be subject to review for quality of care and appropriate utilization under the CHAMPUS PRO program. TRICARE will continue to perform a medical necessity and appropriateness review for quality of care and appropriate utilization under the CHAMPUS PRO program where required by statute.
(b)
Objectives and general requirements of review system
—(1)
In general.
Broadly, the program of quality and utilization review has as its objective to review the quality, completeness and adequacy of care provided, as well as its necessity, appropriateness and reasonableness.
(2)
Payment exclusion for services provided contrary to utilization and quality
standards.
(i) In any case in which health care services are provided in a manner determined to be contrary to quality or necessity standards established under the quality and utilization review program, payment may be wholly or partially excluded.
(ii) In any case in which payment is excluded pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the patient (or the patient's family) may not be billed for the excluded services.
(iii) Limited exceptions and other special provisions pertaining to the requirements established in paragraphs (b)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section, are set forth in § 199.4(h).
(3)
Review of services covered by DRG-based payment system.
Application of these objectives in the context of hospital services covered by the DRG-based payment system also includes a validation of diagnosis and procedural information that determines CHAMPUS reimbursement, and a review of the necessity and appropriateness of care for which payment is sought on an outlier basis.
(4)
Preauthorization and other utilization review procedures
—(i)
In general.
all health care services for which payment is sought under TRICARE are subject to review for appropriateness of utilization as determined by the Director, TRICARE Management Activity, or a designee.
(A) The procedures for this review may be prospective (before the care is provided), concurrent (while the care is in process), or retrospective (after the care has been provided). Regardless of the procedures of this utilization review, the same generally accepted standards, norms and criteria for evaluating the medical necessity, appropriateness and reasonableness of the care involved shall apply. The Director, TRICARE Management Activity, or a designee, shall establish procedures for conducting reviews, including types of health care services for which preauthorization or concurrent review shall be required. Preauthorization or concurrent review may be required for categories of health care services. Except where required by law, the categories of health care services for which preauthorization or concurrent review is required may vary in different geographical locations or for different types of providers.
(B) For healthcare services provided under TRICARE contracts entered into by the Department of Defense after October 30, 2000, medical necessity preauthorization will not be required for referrals for specialty consultation appointment services requested by primary care providers or specialty providers when referring TRICARE Prime beneficiaries for specialty consultation appointment services within the TRICARE contractor's network. However, the lack of medical necessity preauthorization requirements for consultative appointment services does not mean that non-emergent admissions or invasive diagnostic or therapeutic procedures which in and of themselves constitute categories of health care services related to, but beyond the level of the consultation appointment service, are not subject to medical necessity prior authorization. In fact many such health care services may continue to require medical necessity prior authorization as determined by the Director, TRICARE Management Activity, or a designee. TRICARE Prime beneficiaries are also required to obtain preauthorization before seeking health care services from a non-network provider.
(ii)
Preauthorization procedures.
With respect to categories of health care (inpatient or outpatient) for which preauthorization is required, the following procedures shall apply:
(A) The requirement for preauthorization shall be widely publicized to beneficiaries and providers.
(B) All requests for preauthorization shall be responded to in writing. Notification of approval or denial shall be sent to the beneficiary. Approvals shall specify the health care services and supplies approved and identify any special limits or further requirements applicable to the particular case.
(C) An approved preauthorization shall state the number of days, appropriate for the type of care involved, for which it is valid. In general, preauthorizations will be valid for 30 days. If the services or supplies are not obtained within the number of days specified, a new preauthorization request is required. For organ and stem
cell transplants, the preauthorization shall remain in effect as long as the beneficiary continues to meet the specific transplant criteria set forth in the TRICARE/CHAMPUS Policy Manual, or until the approved transplant occurs.
(D) For healthcare services provided under TRICARE contracts entered into by the Department of Defense after October 30, 2000, medical necessity preauthorization for specialty consultation appointment services within the TRICARE contractor's network will not be required. However, the Director, TRICARE Management Activity, or designee, may continue to require or waive medical necessity prior (or pre) authorization for other categories of other health care services based on best business practice.
(iii)
Payment reduction for noncompliance with required utilization review procedures.
(A) Paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section applies to any case in which:
(
1
) A provider was required to obtain preauthorization or continued stay (in connection with required concurrent review procedures) approval.
(
2
) The provider failed to obtain the necessary approval; and
(
3
) The health care services have not been disallowed on the basis of necessity, appropriateness or reasonableness.
In such a case, reimbursement will be reduced, unless such reduction is waived based on special circumstances.
(B) In a case described in paragraph (b)(4)(iii)(A) of this section, reimbursement will be reduced, unless such reduction is waived based on special circumstances. The amount of this reduction shall be at least ten percent of the amount otherwise allowable for services for which preauthorization (including preauthorization for continued stays in connection with concurrent review requirements) approval should have been obtained, but was not obtained.
(C) The payment reduction set forth in paragraph (b)(4)(iii)(B) of this section may be waived by the Director, OCHAMPUS when the provider could not reasonably have been expected to know of the preauthorization requirement or some other special circumstance justifies the waiver.
(D) Services for which payment is disallowed under paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section may not be billed to the patient (or the patient's family).
(c)
Hospital cooperation.
All hospitals which participate in CHAMPUS and submit CHAMPUS claims are required to provide all information necessary for CHAMPUS to properly process the claims. In order for CHAMPUS to be assured that services for which claims are submitted meet quality of care standards, hospitals are required to provide the Peer Review Organization (PRO) responsible for quality review with all the information, within timeframes to be established by OCHAMPUS, necessary to perform the review functions required by this paragraph. Additionally, all participating hospitals shall provide CHAMPUS beneficiaries, upon admission, with information about the admission and quality review system including their appeal rights. A hospital which does not cooperate in this activity shall be subject to termination as a CHAMPUS-authorized provider.
(1) Documentation that the beneficiary has received the required information about the CHAMPUS PRO program must be maintained in the same manner as is the notice required for the Medicare program by 42 CFR 466.78(b).
(2) The physician acknowledgment required for Medicare under 42 CFR 412.46 is also required for CHAMPUS as a condition for payment and may be satisfied by the same statement as required for Medicare, with substitution or addition of “CHAMPUS” when the word “Medicare” is used.
(3) Participating hospitals must execute a memorandum of understanding with the PRO providing appropriate procedures for implementation of the PRO program.
(4) Participating hospitals may not charge a CHAMPUS beneficiary for inpatient hospital services excluded on the basis of § 199.4(g)(1) (not medically necessary), § 199.4(g)(3) (inappropriate level), or § 199.4(g)(7) (custodial care) unless all of the conditions established by 42 CFR 412.42(c) with respect to Medicare beneficiaries have been met
with respect to the CHAMPUS beneficiary. In such cases in which the patient requests a PRO review while the patient is still an inpatient in the hospital, the hospital shall provide to the PRO the records required for the review by the close of business of the day the patient requests review, if such request was made before noon. If the hospital fails to provide the records by the close of business, that day and any subsequent working day during which the hospital continues to fail to provide the records shall not be counted for purposes of the two-day period of 42 CFR 412.42(c)(3)(ii).
(d)
Areas of review
—(1)
Admissions.
The following areas shall be subject to review to determine whether inpatient care was medically appropriate and necessary, was delivered in the most appropriate setting and met acceptable standards of quality. This review may include preadmission or prepayment review when appropriate.
(i) Transfers of CHAMPUS beneficiaries from a hospital or hospital unit subject to the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system to another hospital or hospital unit.
(ii) CHAMPUS admissions to a hospital or hospital unit subject to the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system which occur within a certain period (specified by OCHAMPUS) of discharge from a hospital or hospital unit subject to the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system.
(iii) A random sample of other CHAMPUS admissions for each hospital subject to the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system.
(iv) CHAMPUS admissions in any DRGs which have been specifically identified by OCHAMPUS for review or which are under review for any other reason.
(2)
DRG validation.
The review organization responsible for quality of care reviews shall be responsible for ensuring that the diagnostic and procedural information reported by hospitals on CHAMPUS claims which is used by the fiscal intermediary to assign claims to DRGs is correct and matches the information contained in the medical records. In order to accomplish this, the following review activities shall be done.
(i) Perform DRG validation reviews of each case under review.
(ii) Review of claim adjustments submitted by hospitals which result in the assignment of a higher weighted DRG.
(iii) Review for physician's acknowledgement of annual receipt of the penalty statement as contained in the Medicare regulation at 42 CFR 412.46.
(iv) Review of a sample of claims for each hospital reimbursed under the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system. Sample size shall be determined based upon the volume of claims submitted.
(3)
Outlier review.
Claims which qualify for additional payment as a long-stay outlier or as a cost-outlier shall be subject to review to ensure that the additional days or costs were medically necessary and appropriate and met all other requirements for CHAMPUS coverage. In addition, claims which qualify as short-stay outliers shall be reviewed to ensure that the admission was medically necessary and appropriate and that the discharge was not premature.
(4)
Procedure review.
Claims for procedures identified by OCHAMPUS as subject to a pattern of abuse shall be the subject of intensified quality assurance review.
(5)
Other review.
Any other cases or types of cases identified by OCHAMPUS shall be subject to focused review.
(e)
Actions as a result of review
—(1)
Findings related to individual claims.
If it is determined, based upon information obtained during reviews, that a hospital has misrepresented admission, discharge, or billing information, or is found to have quality of care defects, or has taken an action that results in the unnecessary admissions of an individual entitled to benefits, unnecessary multiple admission of an individual, or other inappropriate medical or other practices with respect to beneficiaries or billing for services furnished to beneficiaries, the PRO, in conjunction with the fiscal intermediary, shall, as appropriate:
(i) Deny payment for or recoup (in whole or in part) any amount claimed or paid for the inpatient hospital and professional services related to such determination.
(ii) Require the hospital to take other corrective action necessary to prevent or correct the inappropriate practice.
(iii) Advise the provider and beneficiary of appeal rights, as required by § 199.10 of this part.
(iv) Notify OCHAMPUS of all such actions.
(2)
Findings related to a pattern of inappropriate practices.
In all cases where a pattern of inappropriate admissions and billing practices that have the effect of circumventing the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system is identified, OCHAMPUS shall be notified of the hospital and practice involved.
(3)
Revision of coding relating to DRG validation.
The following provisions apply in connection with the DRG validation process set forth in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
(i) If the diagnostic and procedural information in the patient's medical record is found to be inconsistent with the hospital's coding or DRG assignment, the hospital's coding on the CHAMPUS claim will be appropriately changed and payments recalculated on the basis of the appropriate DRG assignment.
(ii) If the information stipulated under paragraph (d)(2) of this section is found not to be correct, the PRO will change the coding and assign the appropriate DRG on the basis of the changed coding.
(f)
Special procedures in connection with certain types of health care services or certain types of review activities
—(1)
In general.
Many provisions of this section are directed to the context of services covered by the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system. This section, however, is also applicable to other services. In addition, many provisions of this section relate to the context of peer review activities performed by Peer Review Organizations whose sole functions for CHAMPUS relate to the Quality and Utilization Review Peer Review Organization program. However, it also applies to review activities conducted by contractors who have responsibilities broader than those related to the quality and utilization review program. Paragraph (f) of this section authorizes certain special procedures that will apply in connection with such services and such review activities.
(2)
Services not covered by the DRG-based payment system.
In implementing the quality and utilization review program in the context of services not covered by the DRG-based payment system, the Director, OCHAMPUS may establish procedures, appropriate to the types of services being reviewed, substantively comparable to services covered by the DRG-based payment system regarding obligations of providers to cooperate in the quality and utilization review program, authority to require appropriate corrective actions and other procedures. The Director, OCHAMPUS may also establish such special, substantively comparable procedures in connection with review of health care services which, although covered by the DRG-based payment method, are also affected by some other special circumstances concerning payment method, nature of care, or other potential utilization or quality issue.
(3)
Peer review activities by contractors also performing other administration or management functions
—(i)
Sole-function PRO versus multi-function PRO.
In all cases, peer review activities under the Quality and Utilization Review Peer Review Organization program are carried out by physicians and other qualified health care professionals, usually under contract with OCHAMPUS. In some cases, the Peer Review Organization contractor's only functions are pursuant to the quality and utilization review program. In paragraph (f)(3) of this section, this type of contractor is referred to as a “sole function PRO.” In other cases, the Peer Review Organization contractor is also performing other functions in connection with the administration and management of CHAMPUS. In paragraph (f)(3) of this section, this type of contractor is referred to as a “multi-function PRO.” As an example of the latter type, managed care contractors may perform a wide range of functions regarding management of the delivery and financing of health care services under CHAMPUS, including but not limited to functions under the Quality and Utilization Review Peer Review Organization program.
(ii)
Special rules and procedures.
With respect to multi-function PROs, the Director, OCHAMPUS may establish special procedures to assure the independence of the Quality and Utilization Review Peer Review Organization program and otherwise advance the objectives of the program. These special rules and procedures include, but are not limited to, the following:
(A) A reconsidered determination that would be final in cases involving sole-function PROs under paragraph (i)(2) of this section will not be final in connection with multi-function PROs. Rather, in such cases (other than any case which is appealable under paragraph (i)(3) of this section), an opportunity for a second reconsideration shall be provided. The second reconsideration will be provided by OCHAMPUS or another contractor independent of the multi-function PRO that performed the review. The second reconsideration may not be further appealed by the provider.
(B) Procedures established by paragraphs (g) through (m) of this section shall not apply to any action of a multi-function PRO (or employee or other person or entity affiliated with the PRO) carried out in performance of functions other than functions under this section.
(g)
Procedures regarding initial determinations.
The CHAMPUS PROs shall establish and follow procedures for initial determinations that are substantively the same or comparable to the procedures applicable to Medicare under 42 CFR 466.83 to 466.104. In addition, these procedures shall provide that a PRO's determination that an admission is medically necessary is not a guarantee of payment by CHAMPUS; normal CHAMPUS benefit and procedural coverage requirements must also be applied.
(h)
Procedures regarding reconsiderations.
The CHAMPUS PROs shall establish and follow procedures for reconsiderations that are substantively the same or comparable to the procedures applicable to reconsiderations under Medicare pursuant to 42 CFR 473.15 to 473.34, except that the time limit for requesting reconsideration (see 42 CFR 473.20(a)(1)) shall be 90 days. A PRO reconsidered determination is final and binding upon all parties to the reconsideration except to the extent of any further appeal pursuant to paragraph (i) of this section.
(i)
Appeals and hearings.
(1) Beneficiaries may appeal a PRO reconsideration determination of OCHAMPUS and obtain a hearing on such appeal to the extent allowed and under the procedures set forth in § 199.10(d).
(2) Except as provided in paragraph (i)(3), a PRO reconsidered determination may not be further appealed by a provider.
(3) A provider may appeal a PRO reconsideration determination to OCHAMPUS and obtain a hearing on such appeal to the extent allowed under the procedures set forth in § 199.10(d) if it is a determination pursuant to § 199.4(h) that the provider knew or could reasonably have been expected to know that the services were excludable.
(4) For purposes of the hearing process, a PRO reconsidered determination shall be considered as the procedural equivalent of a formal review determination under § 199.10, unless revised at the initiative of the Director, OCHAMPUS prior to a hearing on the appeal, in which case the revised determination shall be considered as the procedural equivalent of a formal review determination under § 199.10.
(5) The provisions of § 199.10(e) concerning final action shall apply to hearings cases.
(j)
Acquisition, protection and disclosure of peer review information.
The provisions of 42 CFR part 476, except § 476.108, shall be applicable to the CHAMPUS PRO program as they are to the Medicare PRO program.
(k)
Limited immunity from liability for participants in PRO program.
The provisions of section 1157 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1320c-6) are applicable to the CHAMPUS PRO program in the same manner as they apply to the Medicare PRO program. Section 1102(g) of title 10, United States Code also applies to the CHAMPUS PRO program.
(l)
Additional provision regarding confidentiality of records
—(1)
General rule.
The provisions of 10 U.S.C. 1102 regarding the confidentiality of medical quality assurance records shall apply to the
activities of the CHAMPUS PRO program as they do to the activities of the external civilian PRO program that reviews medical care provided in military hospitals.
(2)
Specific applications.
(i) Records concerning PRO deliberations are generally nondisclosable quality assurance records under 10 U.S.C. 1102.
(ii) Initial denial determinations by PROs pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section (concerning medical necessity determinations, DRG validation actions, etc.) and subsequent decisions regarding those determinations are not nondisclosable quality assurance records under 10 U.S.C. 1102.
(iii) Information the subject of mandatory PRO disclosure under 42 CFR part 476 is not a nondisclosable quality assurance record under 10 U.S.C. 1102.
(m)
Obligations, sanctions and procedures.
(1) The provisions of 42 CFR 1004.1-1004.80 shall apply to the CHAMPUS PRO program as they do the Medicare PRO program, except that the functions specified in those sections for the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services shall be the responsibility of OCHAMPUS.
(2) The provisions of 42 U.S.C. section 1395ww(f)(2) concerning circumvention by any hospital of the applicable payment methods for inpatient services shall apply to CHAMPUS payment methods as they do to Medicare payment methods.
(3) The Director, or a designee, of CHAMPUS shall determine whether to impose a sanction pursuant to paragraphs (m)(1) and (m)(2) of this section. Providers may appeal adverse sanctions decisions under the procedures set forth in § 199.10(d).
(n)
Authority to integrate CHAMPUS PRO and military medical treatment facility utilization review activities.
(1) In the case of a military medical treatment facility (MTF) that has established utilization review requirements similar to those under the CHAMPUS PRO program, the contractor carrying out this function may, at the request of the MTF, utilize procedures comparable to the CHAMPUS PRO program procedures to render determinations or recommendations with respect to utilization review requirements.
(2) In any case in which such a contractor has comparable responsibility and authority regarding utilization review in both an MTF (or MTFs) and CHAMPUS, determinations as to medical necessity in connection with services from an MTF or CHAMPUS-authorized provider may be consolidated.
(3) In any case in which an MTF reserves authority to separate an MTF determination on medical necessity from a CHAMPUS PRO program determination on medical necessity, the MTF determination is not binding on CHAMPUS.
[55 FR 625, Jan. 8, 1990, as amended at 58 FR 58961, Nov. 5, 1993; 60 FR 52095, Oct. 5, 1995; 63 FR 48447, Sept. 10, 1998; 66 FR 40608, Aug. 3, 2001; 67 FR 42721, June 25, 2002; 68 FR 23033, Apr. 30, 2003; 68 FR 32363, May 30, 2003; 68 FR 44881, July 31, 2003; 70 FR 19266, Apr. 13, 2005; 81 FR 61098, Sept. 2, 2016]
§ 199.16
Supplemental Health Care Program for active duty members.
(a)
Purpose and applicability.
(1) The purpose of this section is to implement, with respect to health care services provided under the supplemental health care program for active duty members of the uniformed services, the provision of 10 U.S.C. 1074(c). This section of law authorizes DoD to establish for the supplemental care program the same payment rules, subject to appropriate modifications, as apply under CHAMPUS.
(2) This section applies to the program, known as the supplemental care program, which provides for the payment by the uniformed services to private sector health care providers for health care services provided to active duty members of the uniformed services. Although not part of CHAMPUS, the supplemental care program is similar to CHAMPUS in that it is a program for the uniformed services to purchase civilian health care services for active duty members. For this reason, the Director, OCHAMPUS assists the uniformed services in the administration of the supplemental care program.
(3) This section applies to all health care services covered by the CHAMPUS. For purposes of this section, health care services ordered by a military treatment facility (MTF) provider for an MTF patient (who is not
an active duty member) for whom the MTF provider maintains responsibility are also covered by the supplemental care program and subject to the requirements of this section.
(b)
Obligation of providers concerning payment for supplemental health care for active duty members
—(1)
Hospitals covered by DRG-based payment system.
For a hospital covered by the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system to maintain its status as an authorized provider for CHAMPUS pursuant to § 199.6, that hospital must also be a participating provider for purposes of the supplemental care program. As a participating provider, each hospital must accept the DRG-based payment system amount determined pursuant to § 199.14 as payment in full for the hospital services covered by the system. The failure of any hospital to comply with this obligation subjects that hospital to exclusion as a CHAMPUS-authorized provider.
(2)
Other participating providers.
For any institutional or individual provider, other than those described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section that is a participating provider, the provider must also be a participating provider for purposes of the supplemental care program. The provider must accept the CHAMPUS allowable amount determined pursuant to § 199.14 as payment in full for the hospital services covered by the system. The failure of any provider to comply with this obligation subjects the provider to exclusion as a participating provider.
(c)
General rule for payment and administration.
Subject to the special rules and procedures in paragraph (d) of this section and the waiver authority in paragraph (e) of this section, as a general rule the provisions of § 199.14 shall govern payment and administration of claims under the supplemental care program as they do claims under CHAMPUS. To the extent necessary to interpret or implement the provisions of § 199.14, related provisions of this part shall also be applicable.
(d)
Special rules and procedure.
As exceptions to the general rule in paragraph (c) of this section, the special rules and procedures in this section shall govern payment and administration of claims under the supplemental care program. These special rules and procedures are subject to the TRICARE Prime Remote program for active duty service members set forth in paragraph (e) of this section and the waiver authority of paragraph (f) of this section.
(1) There is no patient cost sharing under the supplemental care program. All amounts due to be paid to the provider shall be paid by the program.
(2) Preauthorization by the Uniformed Services of each service is required for the supplemental care program except for services in cases of medical emergency (for which the definition in Sec. 199.2 shall apply) or in cases governed by the TRICARE Prime Remote program for active duty service members set forth in paragraph (e) of this section. It is the responsibility of the active duty members to obtain preauthorization for each service. With respect to each emergency inpatient admission, after such time as the emergency condition is addressed, authorization for any proposed continued stay must be obtained within two working days of admission.
(3) With respect to the filing of claims and similar administrative matters for which this part refers to activities of the CHAMPUS fiscal intermediaries, for purposes of the supplemental care program, responsibilities for claims processing, payment and some other administrative matters may be assigned by the Director, OCHAMPUS to the same fiscal intermediaries, other contractor, or to the nearest military medical treatment facility or medical claims office.
(4) The annual cost pass-throughs for capital and direct medical education costs that are available under the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system are also available, upon request, under the supplemental care program. To obtain payment include the number of active duty bed days as a separate line item on the annual request to the CHAMPUS fiscal intermediaries.
(5) For providers other than participating providers, the Director, OCHAMPUS may authorize payment in excess of CHAMPUS allowable amounts. No provider may bill an active duty member any amount in excess of the CHAMPUS allowable amount.
(e)
TRICARE Prime Remote for Active Duty Members
—(1)
General.
The TRICARE Prime Remote (TPR) program is available for certain active duty members of the Uniformed Services assigned to remote locations in the United States and the District of Columbia who are entitled to coverage of medical care, and the standards for timely access to such care, outside a military treatment facility that are comparable to coverage for medical care and standards for timely access to such care as exist under TRICARE Prime under § 199.17. Those active duty members who are eligible under the provisions of 10 U.S.C. 1074(c)(3) and who enroll in the TRICARE Prime Remote program, may not be required to receive routine primary medical care at a military medical treatment facility.
(2)
Eligibility.
To receive health care services under the TRICARE Prime Remote program, an individual must be an active duty member of the Uniformed Services on orders for more than thirty consecutive days who meet the following requirements:
(i) Has a permanent duty assignment that is greater than fifty miles or approximately one hour drive from a military treatment facility or military clinic designated as adequate to provide the needed primary care services to the active duty service member; and
(ii) Pursuant to the assignment of such duty, resides at a location that is greater than fifty miles or approximately one hour from a military medical treatment facility or military clinic designated as adequate to provide the needed primary care services to the active duty service member.
(3)
Enrollment.
An active duty service member eligible for the TRICARE Prime Remote program must enroll in the program. If an eligible active duty member does not enroll in the TRICARE Prime Remote program, the member shall receive health care services provide under the supplemental health program subject to all requirements of this section without application of the provisions of paragraph (e) of this section.
(4)
Preauthorization.
If a TRICARE Prime network under § 199.17 exists in the remote location, the TRICARE Prime Remote enrolled active duty member will select or be assigned a primary care manager. In the absence of a TRICARE primary care manager in the remote location and if the active duty member is not assigned to a military primary care manager based on fitness for duty requirements, the TRICARE Prime Remote enrolled active duty member may use a local TRICARE authorized provider for primary health care services without preauthorization. Any referral for specialty care will require the TRICARE Prime Remote enrolled active duty member to obtain preauthorization for such services.
(f)
Waiver authority.
With the exception of statutory requirements, any restrictions or limitations pursuant to the general rule in paragraph (c) of this section, and special rules and procedures in paragraph (d) of this section, may be waived by the Director, OCHAMPUS, at the request of an authorized official of the uniformed service concerned, based on a determination that such waiver is necessary to assure adequate availability of health care services to active duty members.
(g)
Authorities.
(1) The Uniformed Services may establish additional procedures, consistent with this part, for the effective administration of the supplemental care program in their respective services.
(2) The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs is responsible for the overall policy direction of the supplemental care program and the administration of this part.
(3) The Director, OCHAMPUS shall issue procedural requirements for the implementation of this section, including requirement for claims submission similar to those established by § 199.7.
[56 FR 23801, May 24, 1991, as amended at 58 FR 58963, Nov. 5, 1993; 67 FR 5479, Feb. 6, 2002; 71 FR 50348, Aug. 25, 2006]
§ 199.17
TRICARE program.
(a)
Establishment.
The TRICARE program is established for the purpose of implementing a comprehensive managed health care program for the delivery and financing of health care services in the Military Health System.
(1)
Purpose.
The TRICARE program implements a number of improvements
primarily through modernized managed care support contracts that include special arrangements with civilian sector health care providers and better coordination between military medical treatment facilities (MTFs) and these civilian providers to deliver an integrated, health care delivery system that provides beneficiaries with access to high quality healthcare. Implementation of these improvements, to include enhanced access, improved health outcomes, increased efficiencies and elimination of waste, in addition to improving and maintaining operational medical force readiness, includes adoption of special rules and procedures not ordinarily followed under CHAMPUS or MTF requirements. This section establishes those special rules and procedures.
(2)
Statutory authority.
Many of the provisions of this section are authorized by statutory authorities other than those which authorize the usual operation of the CHAMPUS program, especially 10 U.S.C. 1079 and 1086. The TRICARE program also relies upon other available statutory authorities, including 10 U.S.C. 1075 (TRICARE Select), 10 U.S.C. 1075a (TRICARE Prime cost sharing), 10 U.S.C. 1095f (referrals and pre-authorizations under TRICARE Prime), 10 U.S.C. 1099 (health care enrollment system), 10 U.S.C. 1097 (contracts for medical care for retirees, dependents and survivors: Alternative delivery of health care), and 10 U.S.C. 1096 (resource sharing agreements).
(3)
Scope of the program.
The TRICARE program is applicable to all the uniformed services. TRICARE Select and TRICARE-for-Life shall be available in all areas, including overseas as authorized in paragraph (u) of this section. The geographic availability of TRICARE Prime is generally limited as provided in this section. The Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) may also authorize modifications to TRICARE program rules and procedures as may be appropriate to the area involved.
(4)
Rules and procedures affected.
Much of this section relates to rules and procedures applicable to the delivery and financing of health care services provided by civilian providers outside military treatment facilities. This section provides that certain rules, procedures, rights and obligations set forth elsewhere in this part (and usually applicable to CHAMPUS) are different under the TRICARE program. To the extent that TRICARE program rules, procedures, rights and obligations set forth in this section are not different from or otherwise in conflict with those set forth elsewhere in this part as applicable to CHAMPUS, the CHAMPUS provisions are incorporated into the TRICARE program. In addition, some rules, procedures, rights and obligations relating to health care services in military treatment facilities are also different under the TRICARE program. In such cases, provisions of this section take precedence and are binding.
(5)
Implementation based on local action.
The TRICARE program is not automatically implemented in all respects in all areas where it is potentially applicable. Therefore, not all provisions of this section are automatically implemented. Rather, implementation of the TRICARE program and this section requires an official action by the Director, Defense Health Agency. Public notice of the initiation of portions of the TRICARE program will be achieved through appropriate communication and media methods and by way of an official announcement by the Director identifying the military medical treatment facility catchment area or other geographical area covered.
(6)
Major features of the TRICARE program.
The major features of the TRICARE program, described in this section, include the following:
(i)
Beneficiary categories.
Under the TRICARE program, health care beneficiaries are generally classified into one of several categories:
(A) Active duty members, who are covered by 10 U.S.C. 1074(a).
(B) Active duty family members, who are beneficiaries covered by 10 U.S.C. 1079 (also referred to in this section as “active duty family category”).
(C) Retirees and their family members (also referred to in this section as “retired category”), who are beneficiaries covered by 10 U.S.C. 1086(c) other than those beneficiaries eligible for Medicare Part A.
(D) Medicare eligible retirees and Medicare eligible retiree family members who are beneficiaries covered by 10 U.S.C. 1086(d) as each become individually eligible for Medicare Part A and enroll in Medicare Part B.
(E) Military treatment facility (MTF) only beneficiaries are beneficiaries eligible for health care services in military treatment facilities, but not eligible for a TRICARE plan covering non-MTF care.
(ii)
Health plans available.
The major TRICARE health plans are as follows:
(A)
TRICARE Prime.
“TRICARE Prime” is a health maintenance organization (HMO)-like program. It generally features use of military treatment facilities and substantially reduced out-of-pocket costs for care provided outside MTFs. Beneficiaries generally agree to use military treatment facilities and designated civilian provider networks and to follow certain managed care rules and procedures. The primary purpose of TRICARE Prime is to support the effective operation of an MTF, which exists to support the medical readiness of the armed forces and the readiness of medical personnel. TRICARE Prime will be offered in areas where the Director determines that it is appropriate to support the effective operation of one or more MTFs.
(B)
TRICARE Select.
“TRICARE Select” is a self-managed, preferred provider organization (PPO) program. It allows beneficiaries to use the TRICARE provider civilian network, with reduced out-of-pocket costs compared to care from non-network providers, as well as military treatment facilities (where they exist and when space is available). TRICARE Select enrollees will not have restrictions on their freedom of choice with respect to authorized health care providers. However, when a TRICARE Select beneficiary receives services covered under the basic program from an authorized health care provider who is not part of the TRICARE provider network that care is covered by TRICARE but is subject to higher cost sharing amounts for “out-of-network” care. Those amounts are the same as under the basic program under § 199.4.
(C)
TRICARE for Life.
“TRICARE for Life” is the Medicare wraparound coverage plan under 10 U.S.C. 1086(d). Rules applicable to this plan are unaffected by this section; they are generally set forth in §§ 199.3 (Eligibility), 199.4 (Basic Program Benefits), and 199.8 (Double Coverage).
(D)
TRICARE Standard.
“TRICARE Standard” generally referred to the basic CHAMPUS program of benefits under § 199.4. While the law required termination of TRICARE Standard as a distinct TRICARE plan December 31, 2017, the CHAMPUS basic program benefits under § 199.4 continues as the baseline of benefits common to the TRICARE Prime and TRICARE Select plans.
(iii)
Comprehensive enrollment system.
The TRICARE program includes a comprehensive enrollment system for all categories of beneficiaries except TRICARE-for-Life beneficiaries. When eligibility for enrollment for TRICARE Prime and/or TRICARE Select exists, a beneficiary must enroll in one of the plans. Refer to paragraph (o) of this section for TRICARE program enrollment procedures.
(7)
Preemption of State laws.
(i) Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 1103 the Department of Defense has determined that in the administration of 10 U.S.C. chapter 55, preemption of State and local laws relating to health insurance, prepaid health plans, or other health care delivery or financing methods is necessary to achieve important Federal interests, including but not limited to the assurance of uniform national health programs for military families and the operation of such programs at the lowest possible cost to the Department of Defense, that have a direct and substantial effect on the conduct of military affairs and national security policy of the United States.
(ii) Based on the determination set forth in paragraph (a)(7)(i) of this section, any State or local law relating to health insurance, prepaid health plans, or other health care delivery or financing methods is preempted and does not apply in connection with TRICARE regional contracts. Any such law, or regulation pursuant to such law, is without any force or effect, and State or
local governments have no legal authority to enforce them in relation to the TRICARE regional contracts. (However, the Department of Defense may by contract establish legal obligations of the part of TRICARE contractors to conform with requirements similar or identical to requirements of State or local laws or regulations).
(iii) The preemption of State and local laws set forth in paragraph (a)(7)(ii) of this section includes State and local laws imposing premium taxes on health or dental insurance carriers or underwriters or other plan managers, or similar taxes on such entities. Such laws are laws relating to health insurance, prepaid health plans, or other health care delivery or financing methods, within the meaning of the statutes identified in paragraph (a)(7)(i) of this section. Preemption, however, does not apply to taxes, fees, or other payments on net income or profit realized by such entities in the conduct of business relating to DoD health services contracts, if those taxes, fees or other payments are applicable to a broad range of business activity. For purposes of assessing the effect of Federal preemption of State and local taxes and fees in connection with DoD health and dental services contracts, interpretations shall be consistent with those applicable to the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program under 5 U.S.C. 8909(f).
(b)
TRICARE Prime and TRICARE Select health plans in general.
The two primary plans for beneficiaries in the active duty family category and the retired category (which does not include most Medicare-eligible retirees/dependents) are TRICARE Prime and TRICARE Select. This paragraph (b) further describes the TRICARE Prime and TRICARE Select health plans.
(1)
TRICARE Prime.
TRICARE Prime is a managed care option that provides enhanced medical services to beneficiaries at reduced cost-sharing amounts for beneficiaries whose care is managed by a designated primary care manager and provided by an MTF or network provider. TRICARE Prime is offered in a location in which an MTF is located (other than a facility limited to members of the armed forces) that has been designated by the Director as a Prime Service Area. In addition, where TRICARE Prime is offered it may be limited to active duty family members if the Director determines it is not practicable to offer TRICARE Prime to retired category beneficiaries. TRICARE Prime is not offered in areas where the Director determines it is impracticable. If TRICARE Prime is not offered in a geographical area, certain active duty family members residing in the area may be eligible to enroll in TRICARE Prime Remote program under paragraph (g) of this section.
(2)
TRICARE Select.
TRICARE Select is the self-managed option under which beneficiaries may receive authorized basic program benefits from any TRICARE authorized provider. The TRICARE Select health care plan also provides enhanced program benefits to beneficiaries with access to a preferred-provider network with broad geographic availability within the United States at reduced out-of-pocket expenses. However, when a beneficiary receives services from an authorized health care provider who is not part of the TRICARE provider network, only basic program benefits (not enhanced Select care) are covered by TRICARE and the beneficiary is subject to higher cost sharing amounts for “out-of-network” care. Those amounts are the same as under the basic program under § 199.4.
(c)
Eligibility for enrollment in TRICARE Prime and TRICARE Select.
Beneficiaries in the active duty family category and the retired category are eligible to enroll in TRICARE Prime and/or TRICARE Select as outlined in this paragraph (c). A retiree or retiree family member who becomes eligible for Medicare Part A is not eligible to enroll in TRICARE Select; however, as provided in this paragraph (c), some Medicare eligible retirees/family members may be allowed to enroll in TRICARE Prime where available. In general, when a retiree or retiree family member becomes individually eligible for Medicare Part A and enrolls in Medicare Part B, he/she is automatically eligible for TRICARE-for-Life and is required to enroll in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS) to verify eligibility. Further,
some rules and procedures are different for dependents of active duty members and retirees, dependents, and survivors.
(1)
Active duty members.
Active duty members are required to enroll in Prime where it is offered. Active duty members shall have first priority for enrollment in Prime.
(2)
Dependents of active duty members.
Beneficiaries in the active duty family member category are eligible to enroll in Prime (where offered) or Select.
(3)
Survivors of deceased members.
(i) The surviving spouse of a member who dies while on active duty for a period of more than 30 days is eligible to enroll in Prime (where offered) or Select for a 3 year period beginning on the date of the member's death under the same rules and provisions as dependents of active duty members.
(ii) A dependent child or unmarried person (as described in § 199.3(b)(2)(ii) or (iv)) of a member who dies while on active duty for a period of more than 30 days whose death occurred on or after October 7, 2001, is eligible to enroll in Prime (where offered) or Select and is subject to the same rules and provisions of dependents of active duty members for a period of three years from the date the active duty sponsor dies or until the surviving eligible dependent:
(A) Attains 21 years of age; or
(B) Attains 23 years of age or ceases to pursue a full-time course of study prior to attaining 23 years of age, if, at 21 years of age, the eligible surviving dependent is enrolled in a full-time course of study in a secondary school or in a full-time course of study in an institution of higher education approved by the Secretary of Defense and was, at the time of the sponsor's death, in fact dependent on the member for over one-half of such dependent's support.
(4)
Retirees, dependents of retirees, and survivors (other than survivors of deceased members covered under paragraph (c)(3) of this section).
All retirees, dependents of retirees, and survivors who are not eligible for Medicare Part A are eligible to enroll in Select. Additionally, retirees, dependents of retirees, and survivors who are not eligible for Medicare Part A based on age are also eligible to enroll in TRICARE Prime in locations where it is offered and where an MTF has, in the judgment of the Director, a significant number of health care providers, including specialty care providers, and sufficient capability to support the efficient operation of TRICARE Prime for projected retired beneficiary enrollees in that location.
(d)
Health benefits under TRICARE Prime
—(1)
Military treatment facility (MTF) care
—(i)
In general.
All participants in Prime are eligible to receive care in military treatment facilities. Participants in Prime will be given priority for such care over other beneficiaries. Among the following beneficiary groups, access priority for care in military treatment facilities where TRICARE is implemented as follows:
(A) Active duty service members;
(B) Active duty service members' dependents and survivors of service members who died on active duty, who are enrolled in TRICARE Prime;
(C) Retirees, their dependents and survivors, who are enrolled in TRICARE Prime;
(D) Active duty service members' dependents and survivors of deceased members, who are not enrolled in TRICARE Prime; and
(E) Retirees, their dependents and survivors who are not enrolled in TRICARE Prime. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(1), survivors of members who died while on active duty are considered as among dependents of active duty service members.
(ii)
Special provisions.
Enrollment in Prime does not affect access priority for care in military treatment facilities for several miscellaneous beneficiary groups and special circumstances. Those include Secretarial designees, NATO and other foreign military personnel and dependents authorized care through international agreements, civilian employees under workers' compensation programs or under safety programs, members on the Temporary Disability Retired List (for statutorily required periodic medical examinations), members of the reserve components not on active duty (for covered medical services), military prisoners, active duty dependents unable to enroll in Prime and temporarily
away from place of residence, and others as designated by the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs). Additional exceptions to the normal Prime enrollment access priority rules may be granted for other categories of individuals, eligible for treatment in the MTF, whose access to care is necessary to provide an adequate clinical case mix to support graduate medical education programs or readiness-related medical skills sustainment activities, to the extent approved by the ASD(HA).
(2)
Non-MTF care for active duty members.
Under Prime, non-MTF care needed by active duty members continues to be arranged under the supplemental care program and subject to the rules and procedures of that program, including those set forth in § 199.16.
(3)
Civilian sector Prime benefits.
Health benefits for Prime enrollees for care received from civilian providers are those under § 199.4 and the additional benefits identified in paragraph (f) of this section.
(e)
Health benefits under the TRICARE Select plan
—(1)
Civilian sector care.
The health benefits under TRICARE Select for enrolled beneficiaries received from civilian providers are those under § 199.4, and, in addition, those in paragraph (f) of this section when received from a civilian network provider.
(2)
Military treatment facility (MTF) care.
All TRICARE Select enrolled beneficiaries continue to be eligible to receive care in military treatment facilities on a space available basis.
(f)
Benefits under TRICARE Prime and TRICARE Select
—(1)
In general.
Except as specifically provided or authorized by this section, all benefits provided, and benefit limitations established, pursuant to this part, shall apply to TRICARE Prime and TRICARE Select.
(2)
Preventive care services.
Certain preventive care services not normally provided as part of basic program benefits under § 199.4 are covered benefits when provided to Prime or Select enrollees by providers in the civilian provider network. Such additional services are authorized under 10 U.S.C. 1097, including preventive care services not part of the entitlement under 10 U.S.C. 1074d and services that would otherwise be excluded under 10 U.S.C. 1079(a)(10). Other authority for such additional services includes section 706 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017. The specific set of such services shall be established by the Director and announced annually before the open season enrollment period. Standards for preventive care services shall be developed based on guidelines from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Such standards shall establish a specific schedule, including frequency or age specifications for services that may include, but are not limited to:
(i) Laboratory and imaging tests, including blood lead, rubella, cholesterol, fecal occult blood testing, and mammography;
(ii) Cancer screenings (including cervical, breast, lung, prostate, and colon cancer screenings);
(iii) Immunizations;
(iv) Periodic health promotion and disease prevention exams;
(v) Blood pressure screening;
(vi) Hearing exams;
(vii) Sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy;
(viii) Serologic screening; and
(ix) Appropriate education and counseling services. The exact services offered shall be established under uniform standards established by the Director.
(3)
Treatment of obesity.
Under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 1097 and sections 706 and 729 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017, notwithstanding 10 U.S.C. 1079(a)(10), treatment of obesity is covered under TRICARE Prime and TRICARE Select even if it is the sole or major condition treated. Such services must be provided by a TRICARE network provider and be medically necessary and appropriate in the context of the particular patient's treatment.
(4)
High value services.
Under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 1097 and other authority, including sections 706 and 729 of the NDAA-17, for purposes of improving population-based health outcomes and incentivizing medical intervention programs to address chronic diseases and other conditions and healthy lifestyle interventions, the Director may waive or reduce cost sharing requirements for TRICARE Prime and TRICARE Select enrollees for care
received from network providers for certain health care services designated for this purpose. The specific services designated for this purpose will be those the Director determines provide especially high value in terms of better health outcomes. The specific services affected for any plan year will be announced by the Director prior to the open season enrollment period for that plan year. Services affected by actions of the Director under this paragraph (f)(4) may be associated with actions taken for high value medications under § 199.21(j)(3) for select pharmaceutical agents to be cost-shared at a reduced or zero dollar rate.
(5)
Other services.
In addition to services provided pursuant to paragraphs (f)(2) through (4) of this section, other benefit enhancements may be added and other benefit restrictions may be waived or relaxed in connection with health care services provided to TRICARE Prime and TRICARE Select enrollees. Any such other enhancements or changes must be approved by the Director based on uniform standards.
(g)
TRICARE Prime Remote for Active Duty Family Members
—(1)
In general.
In geographic areas in which TRICARE Prime is not offered and in which eligible family members reside, there is offered under 10 U.S.C. 1079(p) TRICARE Prime Remote for Active Duty Family Members as an enrollment option. TRICARE Prime Remote for Active Duty Family Members (TPRADFM) will generally follow the rules and procedures of TRICARE Prime, except as provided in this paragraph (g) and otherwise except to the extent the Director determines them to be infeasible because of the remote area.
(2)
Active duty family member.
For purposes of this paragraph (g), the term “active duty family member” means one of the following dependents of an active duty member of the Uniformed Services:
(i) Spouse, child, or unmarried person, as defined in § 199.3(b)(2)(i), (ii), or (iv);
(ii) For a 3-year period, the surviving spouse of a member who dies while on active duty for a period of more than 30 days whose death occurred on or after October 7, 2001; and

(4)
Enrollment.
TRICARE Prime Remote for Active Duty Family Members requires enrollment under procedures set forth in paragraph (o) of this section or as otherwise established by the Director.
(5)
Health care management requirements under TRICARE Prime Remote for Active Duty Family Members.
The additional health care management requirements applicable to Prime enrollees under paragraph (n) of this section are applicable under TRICARE Prime Remote for Active Duty Family Members unless the Director determines they are infeasible because of the particular remote location. Enrollees will be given notice of the applicable management requirements in their remote location.
(6)
Cost sharing.
Beneficiary cost sharing requirements under TRICARE Prime Remote for Active Duty Family Members are the same as those under TRICARE Prime under paragraph (m) of this section, except that the higher point-of-service option cost sharing and deductible shall not apply to routine primary health care services in cases in which, because of the remote location, the beneficiary is not assigned a primary care manager or the Director determines that care from a TRICARE network provider is not available within the TRICARE access standards under paragraph (p)(5) of this section. The higher point-of-service option cost sharing and deductible shall apply to specialty health care services received by any TRICARE Prime Remote for Active Duty Family Members enrollee unless an appropriate referral/preauthorization is obtained as required by paragraph (n) of this section under TRICARE Prime. In the case of pharmacy services under § 199.21, where the Director determines that no TRICARE network retail pharmacy has been established within a reasonable distance of the residence of the TRICARE Prime Remote for Active Duty Family Members enrollee, cost
sharing applicable to TRICARE network retail pharmacies will be applicable to all CHAMPUS eligible pharmacies in the remote area.
(h)
Resource sharing agreements.
Under the TRICARE program, any military medical treatment facility (MTF) commander may establish resource sharing agreements with the applicable managed care support contractor for the purpose of providing for the sharing of resources between the two parties. Internal resource sharing and external resource sharing agreements are authorized. The provisions of this paragraph (h) shall apply to resource sharing agreements under the TRICARE program.
(1) In connection with internal resource sharing agreements, beneficiary cost sharing requirements shall be the same as those applicable to health care services provided in facilities of the uniformed services.
(2) Under internal resource sharing agreements, the double coverage requirements of § 199.8 shall be replaced by the Third Party Collection procedures of 32 CFR part 220, to the extent permissible under such part. In such a case, payments made to a resource sharing agreement provider through the TRICARE managed care support contractor shall be deemed to be payments by the MTF concerned.
(3) Under internal or external resource sharing agreements, the commander of the MTF concerned may authorize the provision of services, pursuant to the agreement, to Medicare-eligible beneficiaries, if such services are not reimbursable by Medicare, and if the commander determines that this will promote the most cost-effective provision of services under the TRICARE program.
(4) Under external resource sharing agreements, there is no cost sharing applicable to services provided by military facility personnel. Cost sharing for non-MTF institutional and related ancillary charges shall be as applicable to services provided under TRICARE Prime or TRICARE Select, as appropriate.
(i)
General quality assurance, utilization review, and preauthorization requirements under the TRICARE program.
All quality assurance, utilization review, and preauthorization requirements for the basic CHAMPUS program, as set forth in this part (see especially applicable provisions in §§ 199.4 and 199.15), are applicable to Prime and Select except as provided in this chapter. Pursuant to an agreement between a military medical treatment facility and TRICARE managed care support contractor, quality assurance, utilization review, and preauthorization requirements and procedures applicable to health care services outside the military medical treatment facility may be made applicable, in whole or in part, to health care services inside the military medical treatment facility.
(j)
Pharmacy services.
Pharmacy services under Prime and Select are as provided in the Pharmacy Benefits Program (see § 199.21).
(k)
Design of cost sharing structures under TRICARE Prime and TRICARE Select
—(1)
In general.
The design of the cost sharing structures under TRICARE Prime and TRICARE Select includes several major factors: beneficiary category (
e.g.,
active duty family member category or retired category, and there are some special rules for survivors of active duty deceased sponsors and medically retired members and their dependents); date of initial military affiliation (
i.e.,
before or on or after January 1, 2018), category of health care service received, and network or non-network status of the provider.
(2)
Categories of health care services.
This paragraph (k)(2) describes the categories of health care services relevant to determining copayment amounts.
(i) Preventive care visits. These are outpatient visits and related services described in paragraph (f)(2) of this section. There are no cost sharing requirements for preventive care listed under §§ 199.4(e)(28)(i) through (iv) and 199.17(f)(2). Beneficiaries shall not be required to pay any portion of the cost of these preventive services even if the beneficiary has not satisfied any applicable deductible for that year.
(ii) Primary care outpatient visits. These are outpatient visits, not occurring in an ER or urgent care center, with the following provider specialties:
(A) General Practice.
(B) Family Practice.

e.g.,
emergency room visits etc.) under paragraph (k)(2) of this section. This category also includes partial hospitalization services, intensive outpatient treatment, and opioid treatment program services. The per visit fee shall be applied on a per day basis on days services are received, with the exception of opioid treatment program services reimbursed in accordance with § 199.14(a)(2)(ix)(A)(

(3)
Beneficiary categories further subdivided.
For purposes of both TRICARE Prime and TRICARE Select, enrollment fees and cost sharing by beneficiary category (
e.g.,
active duty family member category or retired category) are further differentiated between two groups:
(i) Group A consists of Prime or Select enrollees whose sponsor originally enlisted or was appointed in a uniformed service before January 1, 2018.
(ii) Group B consists of Prime or Select enrollees whose sponsor originally enlisted or was appointed in a uniformed service on or after January 1, 2018.
(l)
Enrollment fees and cost sharing (including deductibles and catastrophic cap) amounts.
This paragraph (l) provides enrollment fees and cost sharing requirements applicable to TRICARE Prime and TRICARE Select enrollees.
(1)
Enrollment fee and cost sharing under TRICARE Prime.
(i) For Group A enrollees:
(A) There is no enrollment fee for the active duty family member category.
(B) The retired category enrollment fee in calendar year 2018 is equal to the Prime enrollment fee for fiscal year 2017, indexed to calendar year 2018 and thereafter in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 1097. The Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) may exempt survivors of active duty deceased sponsors and medically retired Uniformed Services members and their dependents from future increases in enrollment fees. The Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) may also waive the enrollment fee requirements for Medicare-eligible beneficiaries.
(C) The cost sharing amounts are established annually in connection with the open season enrollment period. An amount is established for each category of care identified in paragraph (k)(2) of this section, taking into account all applicable statutory provisions, including 10 U.S.C. chapter 55. The amount for each category of care may not exceed the amount for Group B as set forth in 10 U.S.C. 1075a.
(D) The catastrophic cap is $1,000 for active duty families and $3,000 for retired category families.
(ii) For Group B TRICARE Prime enrollees, the enrollment fee, catastrophic cap, and cost sharing amounts are as set forth in 10 U.S.C. 1075a. The cost sharing requirements applicable to services not specifically addressed in the table set forth in 10 U.S.C. 1075a(b)(1) shall be determined by the Director, DHA.
(iii) For both Group A and Group B, for health care services obtained by a Prime enrollee but not obtained in accordance with the rules and procedures
of Prime (
e.g.
failure to obtain a primary care manager referral when such a referral is required or seeing a non-network provider when Prime rules require use of a network provider and one is available) will not be paid under Prime rules but may be covered by the point-of-service option. For services obtained under the point-of-service option, the deductible is $300 per person and $600 per family. The beneficiary cost share is 50 percent of the allowable charges for inpatient and outpatient care, after the deductible. Point-of-service charges do not count against the annual catastrophic cap.
(2)
Enrollment fee and cost sharing under TRICARE Select.
(i) For Group A enrollees:
(A) The enrollment fee in calendar years 2018 through 2020 is zero and the catastrophic cap is as provided in 10 U.S.C. 1079 or 1086. The enrollment fee and catastrophic cap in 2021 and thereafter for certain beneficiaries in the retired category is as provided in 10 U.S.C. 1075(e), except the enrollment fee and catastrophic cap adjustment shall not apply to survivors of active duty deceased sponsors and medically retired Uniformed Services members and their dependents. Payment of TRICARE premiums and enrollment fees will be withheld from the retired, retainer or equivalent pay of these beneficiaries in the retired category to the maximum extent practicable upon complete implementation of this rule and thereafter. Appropriate processes to require and manage these allotments, to include frequency and method, as well as alternatives when allotments are not practicable, shall be determined by the Director, DHA. An exception may be made for certain survivors of active duty deceased sponsors and medically retired Uniformed Services members and their dependents, for which the enrollment fee and catastrophic cap adjustments shall not apply.
(B) The cost sharing amounts for network care for Group A enrollees are calculated for each category of care described in paragraph (k)(2) of this section by taking into account all applicable statutory provisions, including 10 U.S.C. chapter 55, as if TRICARE Extra and Standard programs were still being implemented. When determined practicable, including efficiency and effectiveness in administration, the amounts established are converted to fixed dollar amounts for each category of care for which a fixed dollar amount is established by 10 U.S.C. 1075. When determined not to be practicable, as in the categories of care including ambulatory surgery, inpatient admissions, and inpatient skilled nursing/rehabilitation admissions, the calculated cost-sharing amounts are not converted to fixed dollar amounts. The fixed dollar amount for each category is set prospectively for each calendar year as the amount (rounded down to the nearest dollar amount) equal to 15% for enrollees in the active duty family beneficiary category or 20% for enrollees in the retired beneficiary category of the projected average allowable payment amount for each category of care during the year, as estimated by the Director. The projected average allowable payment amount for primary care (including urgent care) and specialty care outpatient appointments include payments for ancillary services (
e.g.,
laboratory and radiology services) that are provided in connection with the respective outpatient visit. As such, there is no separate cost sharing for these ancillary services.
(C) The cost share for care received from non-network providers is as provided in § 199.4.
(D) The annual deductible amount is as provided in 10 U.S.C. 1079 or 1086.
(ii) For Group B TRICARE Select enrollees, the enrollment fee, annual deductible for services received while in an outpatient status, catastrophic cap., and cost sharing amounts are as provided in 10 U.S.C. 1075 and as consistent with this section. The cost sharing requirements applicable to services not specifically addressed in 10 U.S.C. 1075 shall be determined by the Director, DHA.
(3)
Special cost-sharing rules.
(i) There is no separate cost-sharing applicable to ancillary health care services obtained in conjunction with an outpatient primary or specialty care visit under TRICARE Prime or from network providers under TRICARE Select.
(ii) Cost-sharing for maternity care services shall be determined in accordance with § 199.4(e)(16).
(4)
Special transition rule for the last quarter of calendar year 2017.
In order to transition enrollment fees, deductibles, and catastrophic caps from a fiscal year basis to a calendar year basis, the following special rules apply for the last quarter of calendar year 2017:
(A) A Prime enrollee's enrollment fee for the quarter is one-fourth of the enrollment fee for fiscal year 2017.
(B) The deductible amount and the catastrophic cap amount for fiscal year 2017 will be applicable to the 15-month period of October 1, 2016 through December 31, 2017.
(m)
Limit on out-of-pocket costs under TRICARE Prime and TRICARE Select.
For the purpose of this paragraph (m), out-of-pocket costs means all payments required of beneficiaries under paragraph (l) of this section, including enrollment fees, deductibles, and cost-sharing amounts, with the exception of point-of-service charges. In any case in which a family reaches their applicable catastrophic cap, all remaining payments that would have been required of the beneficiary under paragraph (l) of this section for authorized care, with the exception of applicable point-of-service charges pursuant to paragraph (l)(1)(iii) of this section, will be paid by the program for the remainder of that calendar year.
(n)
Additional health care management requirements under TRICARE Prime.
Prime has additional, special health care management requirements not applicable under TRICARE Select.
(1)
Primary care manager.
(i) All active duty members and Prime enrollees will be assigned a primary care manager pursuant to a system established by the Director, and consistent with the access standards in paragraph (p)(5)(i) of this section. The primary care manager may be an individual, physician, a group practice, a clinic, a treatment site, or other designation. The primary care manager may be part of the MTF or the Prime civilian provider network. The enrollee will be given the opportunity to register a preference for primary care manager from a list of choices provided by the Director. This preference will be entered on a TRICARE Prime enrollment form or similar document. Preference requests will be considered, but primary care manager assignments will be subject to availability under the MTF beneficiary category priority system under paragraph (d) of this section and subject to other operational requirements. (ii) Prime enrollees who are dependents of active duty members in pay grades E-1 through E-4 shall have priority over other active duty dependents for enrollment with MTF PCMs, subject to MTF capacity.
(2)
Referral and preauthorization requirements.
(i) Under TRICARE Prime there are certain procedures for referral and preauthorization.
(A) For the purpose of this paragraph (n)(2), referral addresses the issue of who will provide authorized health care services. In many cases, Prime beneficiaries will be referred by a primary care manager to a medical department of an MTF if the type of care needed is available at the MTF. In such a case, failure to adhere to that referral will result in the care being subject to point-of-service charges. In other cases, a referral may be to the civilian provider network, and again, point-of-service charges would apply to a failure to follow the referral.
(B) In contrast to referral, preauthorization addresses the issue of whether particular services may be covered by TRICARE, including whether they appear necessary and appropriate in the context of the patient's diagnosis and circumstances. A major purpose of preauthorization is to prevent surprises about coverage determinations, which are sometimes dependent on particular details regarding the patient's condition and circumstances. While TRICARE Prime has referral requirements that do not exist for TRICARE Select, TRICARE Select has some preauthorization requirements that do not exist for TRICARE Prime.
(ii) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (n)(2), a beneficiary enrolled in TRICARE Prime is required to obtain a referral for care through a designated primary care manager (or other authorized care coordinator) prior to obtaining care under the TRICARE program.
(iii) There is no referral requirement under paragraph (n)(2)(i) of this section in the following circumstances:
(A) In emergencies;
(B) For urgent care services for a certain number of visits per year (zero to unlimited), with the number specified by the Director and notice provided in connection with the open season enrollment period preceding the plan year; and
(C) In any other special circumstances identified by the Director, generally with notice provided in connection with the open season enrollment period for the plan year.
(iv) A primary care manager who believes a referral to a specialty care provider is medically necessary and appropriate need not obtain pre-authorization from the managed care support contractor before referring a patient to a network specialty care provider. Such preauthorization is only required with respect to a primary care manager's referral for:
(A) Inpatient hospitalization;
(B) Inpatient care at a skilled nursing facility;
(C) Inpatient care at a rehabilitation facility; and
(D) Inpatient care at a residential treatment facility.
(v) The restrictions in paragraph (n)(2)(iv) of this section on preauthorization requirements do not apply to any preauthorization requirements that are generally applicable under TRICARE, independent of TRICARE Prime referrals, such as:
(A) Under the Pharmacy Benefits Program under 10 U.S.C. 1074g and § 199.21.
(B) For laboratory and other ancillary services.
(C) Durable medical equipment.
(vi) The cost-sharing requirement for a beneficiary enrolled in TRICARE Prime who does not obtain a referral for care when it is required, including care from a non-network provider, is as provided in paragraph (l)(1)(iii) of this section concerning point of service care.
(vii) In the case of care for which preauthorization is not required under paragraph (n)(2)(iv) of this section, the Director may authorize a managed care support contractor to offer a voluntary pre-authorization program to enable beneficiaries and providers to confirm covered benefit status and/or medical necessity or to understand the criteria that will be used by the managed care support contractor to adjudicate the claim associated with the proposed care. A network provider may not be required to use such a program with respect to a referral.
(3)
Restrictions on the use of providers.
The requirements of this paragraph (n)(3) shall be applicable to health care utilization under TRICARE Prime, except in cases of emergency care and under point-of-service option (see paragraph (n)(4) of this section).
(i) Prime enrollees must obtain all primary health care from the primary care manager or from another provider to which the enrollee is referred by the primary care manager or otherwise authorized.
(ii) For any necessary specialty care and non-emergent inpatient care, the primary care manager or other authorized individual will assist in making an appropriate referral.
(iii) Though referrals for specialty care are generally the responsibility of the primary care managers, subject to discretion exercised by the TRICARE Regional Directors, and established in regional policy or memoranda of understanding, specialist providers may be permitted to refer patients for additional specialty consultation appointment services within the TRICARE contractor's network without prior authorization by primary care managers.
(iv) The following procedures will apply to health care referrals under TRICARE Prime:
(A) The first priority for referral for specialty care or inpatient care will be to the local MTF (or to any other MTF in which catchment area the enrollee resides).
(B) If the local MTF(s) are unavailable for the services needed, but there is another MTF at which the needed services can be provided, the enrollee may be required to obtain the services at that MTF. However, this requirement will only apply to the extent that the enrollee was informed at the time of (or prior to) enrollment that mandatory referrals might be made to the MTF involved for the service involved.
(C) If the needed services are available within civilian preferred provider network serving the area, the enrollee may be required to obtain the services from a provider within the network. Subject to availability, the enrollee will have the freedom to choose a provider from among those in the network.
(D) If the needed services are not available within the civilian preferred provider network serving the area, the enrollee may be required to obtain the services from a designated civilian provider outside the area. However, this requirement will only apply to the extent that the enrollee was informed at the time of (or prior to) enrollment that mandatory referrals might be made to the provider involved for the service involved (with the provider and service either identified specifically or in connection with some appropriate classification).
(E) In cases in which the needed health care services cannot be provided pursuant to the procedures identified in paragraphs (n)(3)(iv)(A) through (D) of this section, the enrollee will receive authorization to obtain services from a TRICARE-authorized civilian provider(s) of the enrollee's choice not affiliated with the civilian preferred provider network.
(iv) When Prime is operating in non-catchment areas, the requirements in paragraphs (n)(3)(iv)(B) through (E) of this section shall apply.
(4)
Point-of-service option.
TRICARE Prime enrollees retain the freedom to obtain services from civilian providers on a point-of service basis. Any health care services obtained by a Prime enrollee, but not obtained in accordance with the rules and procedures of Prime, will be covered by the point-of-service option. In such cases, all requirements applicable to health benefits under § 199.4 shall apply, except that there shall be higher deductible and cost sharing requirements (as set forth in paragraph (l)(1)(iii)) of this section). However, Prime rules may cover such services if the enrollee did not know and could not reasonably have been expected to know that the services were not obtained in accordance with the utilization management rules and procedures of Prime.
(5)
Prime travel benefit.
In accordance with guidelines issues by the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs), certain travel expenses may be reimbursed when a TRICARE Prime enrollee is referred by the primary care manager for medically necessary specialty care more than 100 miles away from the primary care manager's office. Such guidelines shall be consistent with appropriate provisions of generally applicable Department of Defense rules and procedures governing travel expenses.
(o)
TRICARE program enrollment procedures.
There are certain requirements pertaining to procedures for enrollment in TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Select, and TRICARE Prime Remote for Active Duty Family Members. (These procedures do not apply to active duty members, whose enrollment is mandatory and automatic.)
(1)
Annual open season enrollment.
(i) As a general rule, enrollment (or a modification to a previous enrollment) must occur during the open season period prior to the plan year, which is on a calendar year basis. The open season enrollment period will be of at least 30 calendar days duration. An enrollment choice will be applicable for the plan year.
(ii) Open season enrollment procedures may include automatic re-enrollment in the same plan for the next plan year for enrollees or sponsors that will occur in the event the enrollee does not take other action during the open season period.
(2)
Exceptions to the calendar year enrollment process.
The Director will identify certain qualifying events that may be the basis for a change in enrollment status during a plan year, such as a change in eligibility status, marriage, divorce, birth of a new family member, relocation, loss of other health insurance, or other events. In the case of such an event, a beneficiary eligible to enroll in a plan may newly enroll, dis-enroll, or modify a previous enrollment during the plan year. Initial payment of the applicable enrollment fee shall be collected for new enrollments in accordance with established procedures. Any applicable enrollment fee will be pro-rated. A beneficiary who dis-enrolls without enrolling at the same time in
another plan is not eligible to enroll in a plan later in the same plan year unless there is another qualifying event. A beneficiary who is dis-enrolled for failure to pay a required enrollment fee installment is not eligible to re-enroll in a plan later in the same plan year unless there is another qualifying event. Generally, the effective date of coverage will coincide with the date of the qualifying event.
(3)
Installment payments of enrollment fee.
The Director will establish procedures for installment payments of enrollment fees.(4)
Effect of failure to enroll.
Beneficiaries eligible to enroll in Prime or Select and who do not enroll will no longer have coverage under the TRICARE program until the next annual open season enrollment or they have a qualifying event, except that they do not lose any statutory eligibility for space-available care in military medical treatment facilities. There is a limited grace period exception to this enrollment requirement for calendar year 2018, as provided in section 701(d)(3) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017.
(5)
Automatic enrollment for certain dependents.
Under 10 U.S.C. 1097a, in the case of dependents of active duty members in the grade of E-1 to E-4, such dependents who reside in a catchment area of a military treatment facility shall be enrolled in TRICARE Prime. The Director may provide for the automatic enrollment in TRICARE Prime for such dependents of active duty members in the grade of E-5 and higher. In any case of automatic enrollment under this paragraph (o)(5), the member will be provided written notice and the automatic enrollment may be cancelled at the election of the member.
(6)
Grace periods.
The Director may make provisions for grace periods for enrollment-related actions to facilitate effective operation of the enrollment program.
(p)
Civilian preferred provider networks.
A major feature of the TRICARE program is the civilian preferred provider network.
(1)
Status of network providers.
Providers in the preferred provider network are not employees or agents of the Department of Defense or the United States Government. Although network providers must follow numerous rules and procedures of the TRICARE program, on matters of professional judgment and professional practice, the network provider is independent and not operating under the direction and control of the Department of Defense.
(2)
Utilization management policies.
Preferred providers are required to follow the utilization management policies and procedures of the TRICARE program. These policies and procedures are part of discretionary judgments by the Department of Defense regarding the methods of delivering and financing health care services that will best achieve health and economic policy objectives.
(3)
Quality assurance requirements.
A number of quality assurance requirements and procedures are applicable to preferred network providers. These are for the purpose of assuring that the health care services paid for with government funds meet the standards called for in the contract and provider agreement.
(4)
Provider qualifications.
All preferred providers must meet the following qualifications:
(i) They must be TRICARE-authorized providers and TRICARE- participating providers. In addition, a network provider may not require payment from the beneficiary for any excluded or excludable services that the beneficiary received from the network provider (
i.e.,
the beneficiary will be held harmless) except as follows:
(A) If the beneficiary did not inform the provider that he or she was a TRICARE beneficiary, the provider may bill the beneficiary for services provided.
(B) If the beneficiary was informed in writing that the specific services were excluded or excludable from TRICARE coverage and the beneficiary agreed in writing, in advance of the services being provided, to pay for the services, the provider may bill the beneficiary.
(ii) All physicians in the preferred provider network must have staff privileges in a hospital accredited by The Joint Commission (TJC) or other accrediting body determined by the Director. This requirement may be
waived in any case in which a physician's practice does not include the need for admitting privileges in such a hospital, or in locations where no accredited facility exists. However, in any case in which the requirement is waived, the physician must comply with alternative qualification standards as are established by the Director.
(iii) All preferred providers must agree to follow all quality assurance, utilization management, and patient referral procedures established pursuant to this section, to make available to designated DoD utilization management or quality monitoring contractors medical records and other pertinent records, and to authorize the release of information to MTF Commanders regarding such quality assurance and utilization management activities.
(iv) All preferred network providers must be Medicare participating providers, unless this requirement is waived based on extraordinary circumstances. This requirement that a provider be a Medicare participating provider does not apply to providers who not eligible to be participating providers under Medicare.
(v) The network provider must be available to all TRICARE beneficiaries.
(vi) The provider must agree to accept the same payment rates negotiated for Prime enrollees for any person whose care is reimbursable by the Department of Defense, including, for example, Select participants, supplemental care cases, and beneficiaries from outside the area.
(vii) All preferred providers must meet all other qualification requirements, and agree to comply with all other rules and procedures established for the preferred provider network.
(viii) In locations where TRICARE Prime is not available, a TRICARE provider network will, to the extent practicable, be available for TRICARE Select enrollees. In these locations, the minimal requirements for network participation are those set forth in paragraph (p)(4)(i) of this section. Other requirements of this paragraph (p) will apply unless waived by the Director.
(5)
Access standards.
Preferred provider networks will have attributes of size, composition, mix of providers and geographical distribution so that the networks, coupled with the MTF capabilities (when applicable), can adequately address the health care needs of the enrollees. In the event that a Prime enrollee seeks to obtain from the managed care support contractor an appointment for care but is not offered an appointment within the access time standards from a network provider, the enrollee will be authorized to receive care from a non-network provider without incurring the additional fees associated with point-of-service care. The following are the access standards:
(i) Under normal circumstances, enrollee travel time may not exceed 30 minutes from home to primary care delivery site unless a longer time is necessary because of the absence of providers (including providers not part of the network) in the area.
(ii) The wait time for an appointment for a well-patient visit or a specialty care referral shall not exceed four weeks; for a routine visit, the wait time for an appointment shall not exceed one week; and for an urgent care visit the wait time for an appointment shall generally not exceed 24 hours.
(iii) Emergency services shall be available and accessible to handle emergencies (and urgent care visits if not available from other primary care providers pursuant to paragraph (p)(5)(ii) of this section), within the service area 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
(iv) The network shall include a sufficient number and mix of board certified specialists to meet reasonably the anticipated needs of enrollees. Travel time for specialty care shall not exceed one hour under normal circumstances, unless a longer time is necessary because of the absence of providers (including providers not part of the network) in the area. This requirement does not apply under the Specialized Treatment Services Program.
(v) Office waiting times in nonemergency circumstances shall not exceed 30 minutes, except when emergency care is being provided to patients, and the normal schedule is disrupted.
(6)
Special reimbursement methods for network providers.
The Director, may establish, for preferred provider networks, reimbursement rates and methods different from those established pursuant to § 199.14. Such provisions may be expressed in terms of percentage discounts off CHAMPUS allowable amounts, or in other terms. In circumstances in which payments are based on hospital-specific rates (or other rates specific to particular institutional providers), special reimbursement methods may permit payments based on discounts off national or regional prevailing payment levels, even if higher than particular institution-specific payment rates.
(q)
Preferred provider network establishment.
(1) The any qualified provider method may be used to establish a civilian preferred provider network. Under this method, any TRICARE-authorized provider that meets the qualification standards established by the Director, or designee, may become a part of the preferred provider network. Such standards must be publicly announced and uniformly applied. Also under this method, any provider who meets all applicable qualification standards may not be excluded from the preferred provider network. Qualifications include:
(i) The provider must meet all applicable requirements in paragraph (p)(4) of this section.
(ii) The provider must agree to follow all quality assurance and utilization management procedures established pursuant to this section.
(iii) The provider must be a participating provider under TRICARE for all claims.
(iv) The provider must meet all other qualification requirements, and agree to all other rules and procedures, that are established, publicly announced, and uniformly applies by the Director (or other authorized official).
(v) The provider must sign a preferred provider network agreement covering all applicable requirements. Such agreements will be for a duration of one year, are renewable, and may be canceled by the provider or the Director (or other authorized official) upon appropriate notice to the other party. The Director shall establish an agreement model or other guidelines to promote uniformity in the agreements.
(2) In addition to the above requirements, the Director, or designee, may establish additional categories of preferred providers of high quality/high value that require additional qualifications.
(r)
General fraud, abuse, and conflict of interest requirements under TRICARE program.
All fraud, abuse, and conflict of interest requirements for the basic CHAMPUS program, as set forth in this part (see especially applicable provisions of § 199.9) are applicable to the TRICARE program.
(s) [Reserved]
(t)
Inclusion of Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Centers in TRICARE networks.
TRICARE preferred provider networks may include Department of Veterans Affairs health facilities pursuant to arrangements, made with the approval of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs), between those centers and the Director, or designated TRICARE contractor.
(u)
Care provided outside the United States.
The TRICARE program is not automatically implemented in all respects outside the United States. This paragraph (u) sets forth the provisions of this section applicable to care received outside the United States under the following TRICARE health plans.
(1)
TRICARE Prime.
The Director may, in conjunction with implementation of the TRICARE program, authorize a special Prime program for command sponsored dependents of active duty members who accompany the members in their assignments in foreign countries. Under this special program, a preferred provider network may be established through contracts or agreements with selected health care providers. Under the network, Prime covered services will be provided to the enrolled covered dependents subject to applicable Prime deductibles, copayments, and point-of-service charges. To the extent practicable, rules and procedures applicable to TRICARE Prime under this section shall apply unless specific exemptions are granted in writing by the Director. The use of this authority by the Director for any particular geographical area will be published on the primary
publicly available Internet Web site of the Department and on the publicly available Internet Web site of the managed care support contractor that has established the provider network under the TRICARE program. Published information will include a description of the preferred provider network program and other pertinent information. The Director shall also issue policies, instructions, and guidelines necessary to implement this special program.
(2)
TRICARE Select.
The TRICARE Select option shall be available outside the United States except that a preferred provider network of providers shall only be established in areas where the Director determines that it is economically in the best interest of the Department of Defense. In such a case, the Director shall establish a preferred provider network through contracts or agreements with selected health care providers for eligible beneficiaries to receive covered benefits subject to the enrollment and cost-sharing amounts applicable to the specific category of beneficiary. When an eligible beneficiary, other than a TRICARE for Life beneficiary, receives covered services from an authorized TRICARE non-network provider, including in areas where a preferred provider network has not been established by the Director, the beneficiary shall be subject to cost-sharing amounts applicable to out-of-network care. To the extent practicable, rules and procedures applicable to TRICARE Select under this section shall apply unless specific exemptions are granted in writing by the Director. The use of this authority by the Director to establish a TRICARE preferred provider network for any particular geographical area will be published on the primary publicly available Internet Web site of the Department and on the publicly available Internet Web site of the managed care support contractor that has established the provider network under the TRICARE program. Published information will include a description of the preferred provider network program and other pertinent information. The Director shall also issue policies, instructions, and guidelines necessary to implement this special program.
(3)
TRICARE for Life.
The TRICARE for Life (TFL) option shall be available outside the United States. Eligible TFL beneficiaries may receive covered services and supplies authorized under § 199.4, subject to the applicable catastrophic cap, deductibles and cost-shares under § 199.4, whether received from a network provider or any authorized TRICARE provider not in a preferred provider network. However, if a TFL beneficiary receives covered services from a PPN provider, the beneficiary's out-of-pocket costs will generally be lower.
(v)
Administration of the TRICARE program in the state of Alaska.
In view of the unique geographical and environmental characteristics impacting the delivery of health care in the state of Alaska, administration of the TRICARE program in the state of Alaska will not include financial underwriting of the delivery of health care by a TRICARE contractor. All other provisions of this section shall apply to administration of the TRICARE program in the state of Alaska as they apply to the other 49 states and the District of Columbia.
(w)
Administrative procedures.
The Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs), the Director, and MTF Commanders (or other authorized officials) are authorized to establish administrative requirements and procedures, consistent with this section, this part, and other applicable DoD Directives or Instructions, for the implementation and operation of the TRICARE program.
[82 FR 45448, Sept. 29, 2017, as amended at 84 FR 4333, Feb. 15, 2019; 85 FR 27927, May 12, 2020; 87 FR 33014, June 1, 2022; 87 FR 46886, Aug. 1, 2022; 89 FR 45767, May 24, 2024]
§ 199.18

§ 199.20
Continued Health Care Benefit Program (CHCBP).
(a)
Purpose.
The CHCBP is a premium-based temporary health care coverage program, authorized by 10 U.S.C. 1078a, and available to individuals who meet the eligibility and enrollment criteria as set forth in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. The CHCBP is not part of the TRICARE program. However, as set forth in this section, it
functions under similar rules and procedures to the TRICARE Select program. Because the purpose of the CHCBP is to provide a continuation health care benefit for Department of Defense and the other uniformed services beneficiaries losing eligibility, it will be administered so that it appears, to the maximum extent practicable, to be part of the TRICARE Select program. Medical coverage under this program will be the same as the benefits payable under the TRICARE Select program. There is a cost for enrollment to the CHCBP and these premium costs must be paid by CHCBP enrollees before any care may be cost shared.
(b)
General provisions.
Except for any provisions the Director of the TRICARE Management Activity may exclude, the general provisions of § 199.1 shall apply to the CHCBP as they do to TRICARE.
(c)
Definitions.
Except as may be specifically provided in this section, to the extent terms defined in § 199.2 are relevant to the administration of the CHCBP, the definitions contained in that section shall apply to the CHCBP as they do to the TRICARE Select program.
(d)

—(1)
Rates.
Premium rates will be established by the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) for two rate groups—individual and family. Eligible beneficiaries will select the level of coverage they require at the time of initial enrollment (either individual or family) and pay the appropriate premium payment. The rates are based on Federal Employees Health Benefits Program employee and agency contributions required for a comparable health benefits plan, plus an administrative fee. The administrative fee, not to exceed ten percent of the basic premium amount, shall be determined based on actual expected administrative costs for administration of the program. Premiums may be revised annually and shall be published when the premium amount is changed. Premiums will be paid by enrollees quarterly.
(2)
Effects of failure to make premium payments.
Failure by enrollees to submit timely and proper premium payments will result in denial of continued enrollment and denial of payment of medical claims. Premium payments that are late thirty (30) days or more past the start of the quarter for which payment is due will result in the termination of beneficiary enrollment. Beneficiaries denied continued enrollment due to lack of premium payments will not be allowed to reenroll. In such a case, benefit coverage will cease at the end of the ninety (90) day period for which a premium payment was received. Enrollees will be held liable for medical costs incurred after losing eligibility.
(r)
Procedures.
The Director, TRICARE Management Activity, may establish other rules and procedures for the administration of the CHCBP.
[76 FR 57639, Sept. 16, 2011, as amended at 82 FR 45457, Sept. 29, 2017]
§ 199.21
TRICARE Pharmacy Benefits Program.
(a) General—(1)
Statutory authority.
Title 10, U.S. Code, Section 1074g requires that the Department of Defense establish an effective, efficient, integrated pharmacy benefits program for the Military Health System. This law is independent of a number of sections of Title 10 and other laws that affect the benefits, rules, and procedures of TRICARE, resulting in changes to the rules otherwise applicable to TRICARE Prime, Standard, and Extra.
(2)
Pharmacy benefits program.
(i)
Applicability.
The pharmacy benefits program, which includes the uniform formulary and its associated tiered co-payment structure, is applicable to all of the uniformed services. Geographically, except as specifically provided in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, this program is applicable to all 50 states and the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. In addition, if authorized by the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) (ASD(HA)), the TRICARE pharmacy benefits program may be implemented in areas outside the 50 states and the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. In such case, the ASD (HA) may also authorize modifications to the pharmacy benefits program rules and procedures as may be appropriate to the area involved.
(ii)
Applicability exception.
The pharmaceutical benefit under the TRICARE smoking cessation program under § 199.4(e)(30) is available to TRICARE beneficiaries who are not entitled to Medicare benefits authorized under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act. Except as noted in § 199.4(e)(30), the smoking cessation program, including the pharmaceutical benefit, is not applicable or available to beneficiaries who reside overseas, including the U. S. territories of Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands, except that under
the authority of § 199.17 active duty service members and active duty dependents enrolled in TRICARE Prime residing overseas, including the U. S. territories of Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands, shall have access to smoking cessation pharmaceuticals through either an MTF or the TMOP program where available.
(3)
Uniform formulary.
The pharmacy benefits program features a uniform formulary of pharmaceutical agents as defined in § 199.2.
(i) The uniform formulary will assure the availability of pharmaceutical agents in the complete range of therapeutic classes authorized as basic program benefits.
(ii) As required by 10 U.S.C. 1074g(a)(2) and implemented under the procedures established by paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section, pharmaceutical agents in each therapeutic class are selected for inclusion on the uniform formulary based upon the relative clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness of the agents in such class. If a pharmaceutical agent in a therapeutic class is determined by the Department of Defense Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee not to have a significant, clinically meaningful therapeutic advantage in terms of safety, effectiveness, or clinical outcome over other pharmaceutical agents included on the uniform formulary, the Committee may recommend it be classified as a non-formulary agent. In addition, if the evaluation by the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee concludes that a pharmaceutical agent in a therapeutic class is not cost effective relative to other pharmaceutical agents in that therapeutic class, considering costs, safety, effectiveness, and clinical outcomes, the Committee may recommend it be classified as a non-formulary agent.
(iii) Pharmaceutical agents which are used exclusively in medical treatments or procedures that are expressly excluded from the TRICARE benefit by statute or regulation will not be considered for inclusion on the uniform formulary. Excluded pharmaceutical agents shall not be available as non-formulary agents, nor will they be cost-shared under the TRICARE pharmacy benefits program.
(b)
Definitions.
For most definitions applicable to the provisions of this section, refer to § 199.2. The following definitions apply only to this section:
(1)
Clinically necessary.
Also referred to as clinical necessity. Sufficient evidence submitted by a beneficiary or provider on behalf of the beneficiary that establishes that one or more of the following conditions exist: The use of formulary pharmaceutical agents is contraindicated; the patient experiences significant adverse effects from formulary pharmaceutical agents in the therapeutic class, or is likely to experience significant adverse effects from formulary pharmaceutical agents in the therapeutic class; formulary pharmaceutical agents result in therapeutic failure, or the formulary pharmaceutical agent is likely to result in therapeutic failure; the patient previously responded to a non-formulary pharmaceutical agent and changing to a formulary pharmaceutical agent would incur an unacceptable clinical risk; or there is no alternative pharmaceutical agent on the formulary.
(2)
Therapeutic class.
A group of pharmaceutical agents that are similar in chemical structure, pharmacological effect, and/or clinical use.
(3)
Over-the-counter drug.
A drug that is not subject to section 503(b)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)).
(c)
Department of Defense Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee
—(1)
Purpose.
The Department of Defense Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee is established by 10 U.S.C. 1074g to assure that the selection of pharmaceutical agents for the uniform formulary is based on broadly representative professional expertise concerning relative clinical and cost effectiveness of pharmaceutical agents and accomplishes an effective, efficient, integrated pharmacy benefits program.
(2)
Composition.
As required by 10 U.S.C. 1074g(b), the committee includes representatives of pharmacies of the uniformed services facilities and representatives of providers in facilities of the uniformed services. Committee members will have expertise in treating the medical needs of the populations served through such entities and in the range of pharmaceutical and
biological medicines available for treating such populations.
(3)
Executive Council.
The Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee may have an Executive Council, composed of those voting and non-voting members of the Committee who are military or civilian employees of the Department of Defense. The function of the Executive Council is to review and analyze issues relating to the operation of the uniform formulary, including issues of an inherently governmental nature, procurement sensitive information, and matters affecting military readiness. The Executive Council presents information to the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee, but is not authorized to act for the Committee.
(d)
Uniform Formulary Beneficiary Advisory Panel.
As required by 10 U.S.C. 1074g(c), a Uniform Formulary Beneficiary Advisory Panel reviews and comments on the development of the uniform formulary. The Panel includes members that represent non-governmental organizations and associations that represent the views and interests of a large number of eligible covered beneficiaries, contractors responsible for the TRICARE retail pharmacy program, contractors responsible for the TRICARE mail-order pharmacy program, and TRICARE network providers. The panel will meet after each Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee quarterly meeting. The Panel's comments will be submitted to the Director, TRICARE Management Activity. The Director will consider the comments before implementing the uniform formulary or any recommendations for change made by the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee. The Panel will function in accordance with the Federated Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. App. 2).
(e)
Determinations regarding relative clinical and cost effectiveness for the selection of pharmaceutical agents for the uniform formulary
—(1)
Clinical effectiveness.
(i) It is presumed that pharmaceutical agents in a therapeutic class are clinically effective and should be included on the uniform formulary unless the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee finds by a majority vote that a pharmaceutical agent does not have a significant, clinically meaningful therapeutic advantage in terms of safety, effectiveness, or clinical outcome over the other pharmaceutical agents included on the uniform formulary in that therapeutic class. This determination is based on the collective professional judgment of the DoD Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee and consideration of pertinent information from a variety of sources determined by the Committee to be relevant and reliable. The DoD Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee has discretion based on its collective professional judgment in determining what sources should be reviewed or relied upon in evaluating the clinical effectiveness of a pharmaceutical agent in a therapeutic class.
(ii) Sources of information may include but are not limited to:
(A) Medical and pharmaceutical textbooks and reference books;
(B) Clinical literature;
(C) U.S. Food and Drug Administration determinations and information;

(3)
Special rules for best clinical effectiveness.
(i) Under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 1074g(a)(10), the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee may recommend and the Director may, after considering the comments and recommendations of the Beneficiary Advisory Panel, approve special uniform formulary actions to encourage use of pharmaceutical agents that provide the best clinical effectiveness to covered beneficiaries and DoD, including consideration of better care, healthier people, and smarter spending. Such special actions may operate as exceptions to the normal rules and procedures under 10 U.S.C. 1074g(a)(2), (5) and (6) and the related provisions of this section.
(ii) Actions under paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section may include a complete or partial exclusion from the pharmacy benefits program of any pharmaceutical agent the Director determines provides very little or no clinical effectiveness relative to similar agents to covered beneficiaries and DoD. A partial exclusion under this paragraph may take the form (as one example) of a limitation on the clinical conditions, diagnoses, or indications for which the pharmaceutical agent may be prescribed. A partial exclusion may be implemented through any means recommended by the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee, including but not limited to preauthorization under paragraph (k) of this section. In the case of a partial exclusion, a pharmaceutical agent may be available on the non-formulary tier of the uniform formulary for limited purposes and for other purposes be excluded.
(iii) Actions under paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section may also include giving preferential status to any non-generic pharmaceutical agent of the uniform formulary by treating it for purposes of cost-sharing as a generic product.
(f)
Evaluation of pharmaceutical agents for determinations regarding inclusion on the uniform formulary.
The DoD Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee will periodically evaluate or re-evaluate individual pharmaceutical agents and therapeutic classes of pharmaceutical agents for determinations regarding inclusion or continuation on the uniform formulary. Such evaluation or re-evaluation may be prompted by a variety of circumstances including, but not limited to:

(2) Approval of a new indication for an existing pharmaceutical agent;
(3) Changes in the clinical use of existing pharmaceutical agents;
(4) New information concerning the safety, effectiveness or clinical outcomes of existing pharmaceutical agents;
(5) Price changes;
(6) Shifts in market share;
(7) Scheduled review of a therapeutic class; and
(8) Requests from Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee members, military treatment facilities, or other Military Health System officials.
(g)
Administrative procedures for establishing and maintaining the uniform formulary
—(1)
Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee determinations.
Determinations of the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee are by majority
vote and recorded in minutes of Committee meetings. The minutes set forth the determinations of the committee regarding the pharmaceutical agents selected for inclusion in the uniform formulary and summarize the reasons for those determinations. For any pharmaceutical agent (including maintenance medications) for which a recommendation is made that the status of the agent be changed from the formulary tier to the non-formulary tier of the uniform formulary, or that the agent requires a pre-authorization, the Committee shall also make a recommendation as to effective date of such change that will not be longer than 180 days from the final decision date but may be less. The minutes will include a record of the number of members voting for and against the Committee's action.
(2)
Beneficiary Advisory Panel.
Comments and recommendations of the Beneficiary Advisory Panel are recorded in minutes of Panel meetings. The minutes set forth the comments and recommendations of the Panel and summarize the reasons for those comments and recommendations. The minutes will include a record of the number of members voting for or against the Panel's comments and recommendations.
(3)
Uniform formulary final decisions.
The Director of the TRICARE Management Activity makes the final DoD decisions regarding the uniform formulary. Those decisions are based on the Director's review of the final determinations of the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee and the comments and recommendations of the Beneficiary Advisory Panel. No pharmaceutical agent may be designated as non-formulary on the uniform formulary unless it is preceded by such recommendation by the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee. The decisions of the Director of the TRICARE Management Activity are in writing and establish the effective date(s) of the uniform formulary actions.
(4)
Transition to the Uniform Formulary.
Beginning in Fiscal Year 2005, under an updated charter for the DoD P
T Committee, the committee shall meet at least quarterly to review therapeutic classes of pharmaceutical agents and make recommendations concerning which pharmaceutical agents should be on the Uniform Formulary, the Basic Care Formulary (BCF), and Extended Core Formulary (ECF). The P
T Committee will review the classes in a methodical, but expeditious manner. During the transition period from the previous methodology of formulary management involving only the MTFs and the TMOP Program, previous decisions by the predecessor DoD P
T Committee concerning MTF and Mail Order Pharmacy Program formularies shall continue in effect. As therapeutic classes are reviewed under the new formulary management process, the processes established by this section shall apply.
(5)
Administrative procedure for newly approved drugs.
In the case of a newly approved innovator drug, other than a generic drug, the innovator drug will, not later than 120 days after the date of approval by the Food and Drug Administration, be added to the uniform formulary unless prior to that date the P
T Committee has recommended that the agent be listed as a non-formulary drug. If the Director, DHA subsequently approves that recommendation, the drug will be so listed. If the Director, DHA disapproves the recommendation to list the drug as non-formulary Third Tier, the drug will be then classified per the Director's decision. If, prior to the expiration of 120 days, the P
T Committee recommends that the agent be added to the uniform formulary and the recommendation is approved by the Director, DHA, that will be done as soon as feasible. Pending action under this paragraph (g)(5), the newly approved pharmaceutical agent will be considered to be in a classification pending status and will be available to beneficiaries under Third Tier terms applicable to all other non-formulary agents.
(h)
Obtaining pharmacy services under the retail network pharmacy benefits program.
—(1)
Points of service.
There are four outpatient pharmacy points of service:
(i) Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs);
(ii) Retail network pharmacies: Those are non-MTF pharmacies that
are a part of the network established for TRICARE retail pharmacy services;
(iii) Retail non-network pharmacies: Those are non-MTF pharmacies that are not part of the network established for TRICARE retail pharmacy services, and
(iv) the TRICARE Mail Order Pharmacy (TMOP).
(2)
Availability of formulary pharmaceutical agents
—(i)
General.
Subject to paragraphs (h)(2)(ii) and (h)(2)(iii) of this section, formulary pharmaceutical agents are available under the Pharmacy Benefits Program from all points of service identified in paragraph (h)(1) of this section.
(ii)
Availability of formulary pharmaceutical agents at military treatment facilities (MTF).
Pharmaceutical agents included on the uniform formulary are available through facilities of uniformed services, consistent with the scope of health care services offered in such facilities and additional determinations by the P
T Committee of the relative clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness, based on costs to the Program associated with providing the agents to beneficiaries. The BCF is a subset of the uniform formulary and is a mandatory component of formularies at all full-service MTF pharmacies. The BCF contains the minimum set of pharmaceutical agents that each full-service MTF pharmacy must have on its formulary to support the primary care scope of practice for Primary Care Manager enrollment sites. Limited-service MTF pharmacies (e.g., specialty pharmacies within an MTF or pharmacies servicing only active duty military members) are not required to include the entire BCF on their formularies, but may limit their formularies to those BCF agents appropriate to the needs of the patients they serve. An ECF may list preferred agents in drug classes other than those covered by the BCF. Among BCF and ECF agents, individual MTF formularies are determined by local P
T Committees based on the scope of health care services provided at the respective MTFs. All pharmaceutical agents on the local formulary of full-service MTF pharmacies must be available to all categories of beneficiaries.
(iii) Pharmaceutical agents prescribed for smoking cessation are not available for coverage when obtained through a retail pharmacy. This includes network and non-network retail pharmacies.
(3)
Availability of non-formulary pharmaceutical agents
—(i)
General.
Non-formulary pharmaceutical agents are generally not available in military treatment facilities or in the retail point of service. They are available in the mail order program.
(ii)
Availability of non-formulary pharmaceutical agents at military treatment facilities.
Even when particular non-formulary agents are not generally available at military treatment facilities, they will be made available to eligible covered beneficiaries through the non-formulary special approval process as noted in this paragraph (h)(3)(ii) when there is a valid medical necessity for use of the non-formulary pharmaceutical agent.
(iii)
Availability of clinically appropriate non-formulary pharmaceutical agents to members of the Uniformed Services.
The pharmacy benefits program is required to assure the availability of clinically appropriate pharmaceutical agents to members of the uniformed services, including, where appropriate, agents not included on the uniform formulary. Clinically appropriate pharmaceutical agents will be made available to members of the Uniformed Services, including, where medical necessity has been validated, agents not included on the uniform formulary. MTFs shall establish procedures to evaluate the clinical necessity of prescriptions written for members of the uniformed services for pharmaceutical agents not included on the uniform formulary. If it is determined that the prescription is clinically necessary, the MTF will provide the pharmaceutical agent to the member.
(iv)
Availability of clinically appropriate pharmaceutical agents to other eligible beneficiaries at retail pharmacies or the TMOP.
Eligible beneficiaries will receive non-formulary pharmaceutical agents at the formulary cost-share when medical necessity has been established by the beneficiary and/or his/her provider. The peer review provisions of
§ 199.15 shall apply to the clinical necessity pre-authorization determinations. TRICARE may require that the time for review be expedited under the pharmacy benefits program.
(4)
Availability of vaccines/immunizations.
This paragraph (h)(4) applies to the following three immunizations: H1N1 vaccine, seasonal influenza vaccine, and pneumococcal vaccine. A retail network pharmacy may be an authorized provider under the Pharmacy Benefits Program when functioning within the scope of its state laws to provide authorized vaccines/immunizations to an eligible beneficiary. The Pharmacy Benefits Program will cover the vaccine and its administration by the retail network pharmacy, including administration by pharmacists who meet the applicable requirements of state law to administer the vaccine. A TRICARE authorized vaccine/immunization includes vaccines/immunizations authorized as preventive care under the basic program benefits of § 199.4 of this Part, as well as such care authorized for Prime enrollees under the uniform HMO benefit of section 199.18. For Prime enrollees under the uniform HMO benefit, a referral is not required under paragraph (n)(2) of § 199.18 for preventive care vaccines/immunizations received from a retail network pharmacy that is a TRICARE authorized provider. Any additional policies, instructions, procedures, and guidelines appropriate for implementation of this benefit may be issued by the TMA Director, or designee.
(5)
Availability of selected over-the-counter (OTC) drugs under the pharmacy benefits program.
Although the pharmacy benefits program generally covers only prescription drugs, in some cases over-the-counter drugs may be covered and may be placed on the uniform formulary.
(i) An OTC drug may be included on the uniform formulary upon the recommendation of the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee and approval of the Director, DHA, based on a finding that it is cost-effective and clinically effective, as compared with other drugs in the same therapeutic class of pharmaceutical agents. Clinical need is judged by the criteria found in paragraph (e)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section. Cost effectiveness is determined based on criteria found in paragraph (e)(2) of this section.
(ii) OTC drugs placed on the uniform formulary, in general, will be treated the same as generic drugs on the uniform formulary for purposes of availability in MTF pharmacies, retail pharmacies, and the mail order pharmacy program and other requirements. However, upon the recommendation of the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee and approval of the Director, DHA, the requirement for a prescription may be waived for a particular OTC drug for certain emergency care treatment situations. In addition, a special copayment may be established under paragraph (i)(2)(xii) of this section for OTC drugs specifically used in certain emergency care treatment situations.
(i)
Cost-sharing requirements under the pharmacy benefits program
—(1)
General.
Under 10 U.S.C. 1074g(a)(6), cost-sharing requirements are established in this section for the pharmacy benefits program independent of those established under other provisions of this Part. Cost-shares under this section partially defray government costs of administering the pharmacy benefits program when collected by the government for prescriptions dispensed through the retail network pharmacies or the TRICARE Mail Order Pharmacy. The higher cost-share paid for prescriptions dispensed by a non-network retail pharmacy is established to encourage the use of the most economical venue to the government. Cost-sharing requirements are based on the classification of a pharmaceutical agent as generic, formulary, or non-formulary, in conjunction with the point of service from which the agent is acquired.
(2)
Cost-sharing amounts.
Active duty members of the uniformed services do not pay cost-shares or annual deductibles. For other categories of beneficiaries, after applicable annual deductibles are met, cost-sharing amounts prior to October 1, 2016, are set forth in this paragraph (i)(2).
(i) For pharmaceutical agents obtained from a military treatment facility, there is no cost-sharing or annual deductible.
(ii) For pharmaceutical agents obtained from a retail network pharmacy, the cost share will be as provided in 10 U.S.C. 1074g(a)(6), except that there is a $0 cost-share for vaccines/immunizations authorized as preventive care for eligible beneficiaries.
(iii) For formulary and generic pharmaceutical agents obtained from a retail non-network pharmacy, except as provided in paragraph (i)(2)(vi) of this section, there is a 20 percent or $20.00 cost-share (whichever is greater) per prescription for up to a 30-day supply of the pharmaceutical agent.
(iv) For pharmaceutical agents obtained under the TRICARE mail order program, the cost share will be as provided in 10 U.S.C. 1074g(a)(6), except that there is a $0 cost-share for smoking cessation pharmaceutical agents covered under the smoking cessation program.
(v) [Reserved]
(vi) For TRICARE Prime beneficiaries there is no annual deductible applicable for pharmaceutical agents obtained from retail network pharmacies or the TRICARE mail-order program. However, for TRICARE Prime beneficiaries who obtain formulary or generic pharmaceutical agents from retail non-network pharmacies, an enrollment year deductible of $300 per person and $600 per family must be met after which there is a beneficiary cost-share of 50 percent per prescription for up to a 30-day supply of the pharmaceutical agent.
(vii) For TRICARE Select beneficiaries the annual deductible which must be met before the cost-sharing amounts for pharmaceutical agents in paragraph (i)(2) of this section are applicable is as provided for each category of TRICARE Select enrollee in § 199.17(l)(2).
(viii) For TRICARE beneficiaries not otherwise qualified to enroll in TRICARE Prime or Select, the annual deductible which must be met before the cost-sharing amounts for pharmaceutical agents in paragraph (i)(2) of this section are applicable is as provided in § 199.4(f).
(ix) The TRICARE catastrophic cap limits apply to pharmacy benefits program cost-sharing.
(x) For any year after 2027, the cost-sharing amounts under this paragraph shall be equal to the cost-sharing amounts for the previous year adjusted by an amount, if any, determined by the Director to reflect changes in the costs of pharmaceutical agents and prescription dispensing, rounded to the nearest dollar. These cost changes, if any, will consider costs under the TRICARE pharmacy benefits program calculated separately for each of the following categories based on prescriptions filled in the most recent period for which TRICARE cost data are available, updated to the current year, if necessary, by appropriate industry data:
(A) Generic drugs in the retail point of service;
(B) Formulary drugs in the retail point of service;
(C) Generic drugs in the mail order point of service;
(D) Formulary drugs in the mail order point of service;
(E) Non-formulary drugs.
(xi) For a Medicare-eligible beneficiary, the cost-sharing requirements may not be in excess of the cost-sharing requirements applicable to all other beneficiaries covered by 10 U.S.C. 1086.
(xii)
Special copayment rule for OTC drugs in the retail pharmacy network.
As a general rule, OTC drugs placed on the uniform formulary under paragraph (h)(5) of this section will have copayments equal to those for generic drugs on the uniform formulary. However, upon the recommendation of the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee and approval of the Director, DHA, the copayment may be established at $0.00 for any particular OTC drug in the retail pharmacy network.
(3)
Special cost-sharing rule when there is a clinical necessity for use of a non-formulary pharmaceutical agent.
(i) When there is a clinical necessity for the use of a non-formulary pharmaceutical agent that is not otherwise excluded as a covered benefit, the pharmaceutical agent will be provided at the same co-payment as a formulary pharmaceutical agent can be obtained.
(ii) A clinical necessity for use of a non-formulary pharmaceutical agent is established when the beneficiary or
their provider submits sufficient information to show that one or more of the following conditions exist:
(A) The use of formualry pharmaceutical agents is contraindicated;
(B) The patient experiences significant adverse effects from formulary pharmaceutical agents, or the provider shows that the patient is likely to experience significant adverse effects from formulary pharmaceutical agents;
(C) Formulary pharmaceutical agents result in therapeutic failure, or the provider shows that the formulary pharmaceutical agent is likely to result in therapeutic failure;
(D) The patient previously responded to a non-formulary pharmaceutical agent and changing to a formulary pharmaceutical agent would incur unacceptable clinical risk; or
(E) There is no alternative pharmaceutical agent on the formulary.
(iii) Information to establish clinical necessity for use of a non-formulary pharmaceutical agent should be provided to TRICARE for prescriptions submitted to a retail network pharmacy.
(iv) Information to establish clinical necessity for use of a non-formulary pharmaceutical agent should be provided as part of the claims processes for non-formulary pharmaceutical agents obtained through non-network points of service, claims as a result of other health insurance, or any other situations requiring the submission of a manual claim.
(v) Information to establish clinical necessity for use of a non-formulary pharmaceutical agent may be provided with the prescription submitted to the TMOP contractor.
(vi) Information to establish clinical necessity for use of a non-formulary pharmaceutical agent may also be provided at a later date, but no later than sixty days from the dispensing date, as an appeal to reduce the non-formulary co-payment to the same co-payment as a formulary drug.
(vii) The process of establishing clinical necessity will not unnecessarily delay the dispensing of a prescription. In situations where clinical necessity cannot be determined in a timely manner, the non-formulary pharmaceutical agent will be dispensed at the non-formulary co-payment and a refund provided to the beneficiary should clinical necessity be established.
(viii) Peer review and appeal and hearing procedures. All levels of peer review, appeals, and grievances established by the Contractor for internal review shall be exhausted prior to forwarding to TRICARE Management Activity for a formal review. Procedures comparable to those established under §§ 199.15 and 199.10 of this part shall apply. If it is determined that the prescription is clinically necessary, the pharmaceutical agent will be provided to the beneficiary at the formulary cost-share. TRICARE may require that the time periods for peer review or for appeal and hearing be expedited under the pharmacy benefits program. For purposes of meeting the amount in dispute requirement of § 199.10(a)(7), the relevant amount is the difference between the cost shares of a formulary versus non-formulary drug. The amount for each of multiple prescriptions involving the same drug to treat the same medical condition and filled within a 12-month period may be combined to meet the required amount in dispute.
(j)
Use of generic drugs under the pharmacy benefits program.
(1) The designation of a drug as a generic, for the purpose of applying cost-shares at the generic rate, will be determined through the use of standard pharmaceutical references as part of commercial best business practices. Pharmaceutical agents will be designated as generics when listed with an “A” rating in the current Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (Orange Book) published by the Food and Drug Administration, or any successor to such reference. Generics are multisource products that must contain the same active ingredients, are of the same dosage form, route of administration and are identical in strength or concentration.
(2) The pharmacy benefits program generally requires mandatory substitution of generic drugs listed with an “A” rating in the current Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (Orange Book) published by the FDA and generic equivalents of grandfather or
Drug Efficacy Study Implementation (DESI) category drugs for brand name drugs. In cases in which there is a clinical justification for a brand name drug in lieu of a generic equivalent, under the standards and procedures of paragraph (h)(3) of this section, the generic substitution policy is waived.
(3) When a blanket purchase agreement, incentive price agreement, Government contract, or other circumstances results in a brand pharmaceutical agent being the most cost effective agent for purchase by the Government, the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee may also designate that the drug be cost-shared at the generic rate.
(4) Upon the recommendation of the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee, a generic drug may be classified as non-formulary if it is less cost effective than non-generic formulary drugs in the same drug class.
(5) The beneficiary copayment amount for any generic drug prescription may not exceed the total charge for that prescription.
(k)
Preauthorization of certain pharmaceutical agents.
(1) Selected pharmaceutical agents may be subject to prior authorization or utilization review requirements to assure medical necessity, clinical appropriateness and/or cost effectiveness.
(2) The Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee will assess the need to prior authorize a given agent by considering the relative clinical and cost effectiveness of pharmaceutical agents within a therapeutic class. Pharmaceutical agents that require prior authorization will be identified by a majority vote of the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee. The Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee will establish the prior authorization criteria for the pharamaceutical agent.
(3) Prescriptions for pharmaceutical agents for which prior authorization criteria are not met will not be cost-shared under the TRICARE pharmacy benefits program.
(4) The Director, TRICARE Management Activity, may issue policies, procedures, instructions, guidelines, standards or criteria to implement this paragraph (k).
(l)
TRICARE Senior Pharmacy Program.
Section 711 of the Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 (Public Law 106-398, 114 Stat. 1654A-175) established the TRICARE Senior Pharmacy Program for Medicare eligible beneficiaries effective April 1, 2001. These beneficiaries are required to meet the eligibility criteria as prescribed in § 199.3 of this part. The benefit under the TRICARE Senior Pharmacy Program applies to prescription drugs and medicines provided on or after April 1, 2001.
(m)
Effect of other health insurance.
The double coverage rules of section 199.8 of this part are applicable to services provided under the pharmacy benefits program. For this purpose, the Medicare prescription drug benefit under Medicare Part D, prescription drug benefits provided under Medicare Part D plans are double coverage plans and such plans will be the primary payer, to the extent described in section 199.8 of this part. Beneficiaries who elect to use these pharmacy benefits shall provide DoD with other health insurance information.
(n)
Procedures.
The Director, TRICARE Management Activity shall establish procedures for the effective operation of the pharmacy benefits program. Such procedures may include restrictions of the quantity of pharmaceuticals to be included under the benefit, encouragement of the use of generic drugs, implementation of quality assurance and utilization management activities, and other appropriate matters.
(o)
Preemption of State laws.
(1) Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 1103, the Department of Defense has determined that in the administration of 10 U.S.C. chapter 55, preemption of State and local laws relating to health insurance, prepaid health plans, or other health care delivery or financing methods is necessary to achieve important Federal interests, including but not limited to the assurance of uniform national health programs for military families and the operation of such programs at the lowest possible cost to the Department of Defense, that have a direct and substantial effect on the conduct of
military affairs and national security policy of the United States.
(2) Based on the determination set forth in paragraph (o)(1) of this section, any State or local law relating to health insurance, prepaid health plans, or other health care delivery or financing methods is preempted and does not apply in connection with TRICARE pharmacy contracts. Any such law, or regulation pursuant to such law, is without any force or effect, and State or local governments have no legal authority to enforce them in relation to the TRICARE pharmacy contracts. However, the Department of Defense may by contract establish legal obligations on the part of TRICARE contractors to conform with requirements similar or identical to requirements of State or local laws or regulations.
(3) The preemption of State and local laws set forth in paragraph (o)(1) of this section includes State and local laws imposing premium taxes on health or dental insurance carriers or underwriters or other plan managers, or similar taxes on such entities. Such laws are laws relating to health insurance, prepaid health plans, or other health care delivery or financing methods, within the meaning of the statutes identified in paragraph (o)(1) of this section. Preemption, however, does not apply to taxes, fees, or other payments on net income or profit realized by such entities in the conduct of business relating to DoD pharmacy services contracts, if those taxes, fees or other payments are applicable to a broad range of business activity. For purposes of assessing the effect of Federal preemption of State and local taxes and fees in connection with DoD pharmacy services contracts, interpretations shall be consistent with those applicable to the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program under 5 U.S.C. 8909(f).
(p)
General fraud, abuse, and conflict of interest requirements under TRICARE pharmacy benefits program.
All fraud, abuse, and conflict of interest requirements for the basic CHAMPUS program, as set forth in this part 199 (see applicable provisions of § 199.9 of this part) are applicable to the TRICARE pharmacy benefits program. Some methods and procedures for implementing and enforcing these requirements may differ from the methods and procedures followed under the basic CHAMPUS program.
(q)
Pricing standards for retail pharmacy program
—(1)
Statutory requirement.
(i) As required by 10 U.S.C. 1074g(f), with respect to any prescription filled on or after the date of the enactment of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, the TRICARE retail pharmacy program shall be treated as an element of the DoD for purposes of the procurement of drugs by Federal agencies under 38 U.S.C. 8126 to the extent necessary to ensure pharmaceuticals paid for by the DoD that are provided by pharmacies under the program to eligible covered beneficiaries under this section are subject to the pricing standards in such section 8126.
(ii) Under paragraph (q)(1)(i) of this section, all covered drug TRICARE retail pharmacy network prescriptions are subject to Federal Ceiling Prices under 38 U.S.C. 8126.
(2)
Manufacturer written agreement.
(i) A written agreement by a manufacturer to honor the pricing standards required by 10 U.S.C. 1074g(f) and referred to in paragraph (q)(1) of this section for pharmaceuticals provided through retail network pharmacies shall with respect to a particular covered drug be a condition for:
(A) Inclusion of that drug on the uniform formulary under this section; and
(B) Availability of that drug through retail network pharmacies without preauthorization under paragraph (k) of this section.
(ii) A covered drug not under an agreement under paragraph (q)(2)(i) of this section requires preauthorization under paragraph (k) of this section to be provided through a retail network pharmacy under the Pharmacy Benefits Program. This preauthorization requirement does not apply to other points of service under the Pharmacy Benefits Program.
(iii) For purposes of this paragraph (q)(2), a covered drug is a drug that is a covered drug under 38 U.S.C. 8126, but does not include:
(A) A drug that is not a covered drug under 38 U.S.C. 8126;
(B) A drug provided under a prescription that is not covered by 10 U.S.C. 1074g(f);
(C) A drug that is not provided through a retail network pharmacy under this section;
(D) A drug provided under a prescription which the TRICARE Pharmacy Benefits Program is the second payer under paragraph (m) of this section;
(E) A drug provided under a prescription and dispensed by a pharmacy under section 340B of the Public Health Service Act; or
(F) Any other exception for a drug, consistent with law, established by the Director, TMA.
(iv) The requirement of this paragraph (q)(2) may, upon the recommendation of the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee, be waived by the Director, TMA if necessary to ensure that at least one drug in the drug class is included on the Uniform Formulary. Any such waiver, however, does not waive the statutory requirement referred to in paragraph (q)(1) that all covered TRICARE retail network pharmacy prescriptions are subject to Federal Ceiling Prices under 38 U.S.C. 8126; it only waives the exclusion from the Uniform Formulary of drugs not covered by agreements under this paragraph (q)(2).
(3)
Refund procedures.
(i) Refund procedures to ensure that pharmaceuticals paid for by the DoD that are provided by retail network pharmacies under the pharmacy benefits program are subject to the pricing standards referred to in paragraph (q)(1) of this section shall be established. Such procedures may be established as part of the agreement referred to in paragraph (q)(2), or in a separate agreement, or pursuant to § 199.11.
(ii) The refund procedures referred to in paragraph (q)(3)(i) of this section shall, to the extent practicable, incorporate common industry practices for implementing pricing agreements between manufacturers and large pharmacy benefit plan sponsors. Such procedures shall provide the manufacturer at least 70 days from the date of the submission of the TRICARE pharmaceutical utilization data needed to calculate the refund before the refund payment is due. The basis of the refund will be the difference between the average non-federal price of the drug sold by the manufacturer to wholesalers, as represented by the most recent annual non-Federal average manufacturing prices (non-FAMP) (reported to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)) and the corresponding FCP or, in the discretion of the manufacturer, the difference between the FCP and direct commercial contract sales prices specifically attributable to the reported TRICARE paid pharmaceuticals, determined for each applicable NDC listing. The current annual FCP and the annual non-FAMP from which it was derived will be applicable to all prescriptions filled during the calendar year.
(iii) A refund due under this paragraph (q) is subject to § 199.11 of this part and will be treated as an erroneous payment under that section.
(A) A manufacturer may under section 199.11 of this part request waiver or compromise of a refund amount due under 10 U.S.C. 1074g(f) and this paragraph (q).
(B) During the pendency of any request for waiver or compromise under paragraph (q)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, a manufacturer's written agreement under paragraph (q)(2) shall be deemed to exclude the matter that is the subject of the request for waiver or compromise. In such cases the agreement, if otherwise sufficient for the purpose of the condition referred to in paragraph (q)(2), will continue to be sufficient for that purpose. Further, during the pendency of any such request, the matter that is the subject of the request shall not be considered a failure of a manufacturer to honor a requirement or an agreement for purposes of paragraph (q)(4).
(C) In addition to the criteria established in § 199.11, a request for waiver may also be premised on the voluntary removal by the manufacturer in writing of a drug from coverage in the TRICARE Pharmacy Benefit Program.
(iv) In the case of disputes by the manufacturer of the accuracy of TMA's utilization data, a refund obligation as to the amount in dispute will be deferred pending good faith efforts to resolve the dispute in accordance with procedures established by the Director, TMA. If the dispute is not resolved
within 60 days, the Director, TMA will issue an initial administrative decision and provide the manufacturer with opportunity to request reconsideration or appeal consistent with procedures under section 199.10 of this part. When the dispute is ultimately resolved, any refund owed relating to the amount in dispute will be subject to an interest charge from the date payment of the amount was initially due, consistent with section 199.11 of this part.
(4)
Remedies.
In the case of the failure of a manufacturer of a covered drug to honor a requirement of this paragraph (q) or to honor an agreement under this paragraph (q), the Director, TMA, in addition to other actions referred to in this paragraph (q), may take any other action authorized by law.
(5)
Beneficiary transition provisions.
In cases in which a pharmaceutical is removed from the uniform formulary or designated for preauthorization under paragraph (q)(2) of this section, the Director, TMA may for transitional time periods determined appropriate by the Director or for particular circumstances authorize the continued availability of the pharmaceutical in the retail pharmacy network or in MTF pharmacies for some or all beneficiaries as if the pharmaceutical were still on the uniform formulary.
(r)
Refills of maintenance medications for eligible covered beneficiaries through the mail order pharmacy program
—(1)
In general.
Consistent with section 702 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015, this paragraph requires that for non-generic covered maintenance medications, beneficiaries are generally required to obtain their prescription through the national mail-order pharmacy program or through military treatment facility pharmacies. For purposes of this paragraph, eligible covered beneficiaries are those defined under sections 1072 and 1086 of title 10, United States Code.
(2)
Medications covered.
The Director, DHA, will establish, maintain, and periodically revise and update a list of non-generic covered maintenance medications subject to the requirement of paragraph (r)(1) of this section. The current list will be accessible through the TRICARE Pharmacy Program Internet Web site and by telephone through the TRICARE Pharmacy Program Service Center. Each medication included on the list will meet the following requirements:
(i) It will be a medication prescribed for a chronic, long-term condition that is taken on a regular, recurring basis.
(ii) It will be clinically appropriate to dispense the medication from the mail order pharmacy.
(iii) It will be cost effective to dispense the medication from the mail order pharmacy.
(iv) It will be available for an initial filling of a 30-day or less supply through retail pharmacies.
(v) It will be generally available at military treatment facility pharmacies for initial fill and refills.
(vi) It will be available for refill through the national mail-order pharmacy program.
(3)
Refills covered.
For purposes of the program under paragraph (r)(1) of this section, a refill is:
(i) A subsequent filling of an original prescription under the same prescription number or other authorization as the original prescription; or
(ii) A new original prescription issued at or near the end date of an earlier prescription for the same medication for the same patient.
(4)
Waiver of requirement.
A waiver of the general requirement to obtain maintenance medication prescription refills from the mail order pharmacy or military treatment facility pharmacy will be granted in the following circumstances:
(i) There is a blanket waiver for prescription medications that are for acute care needs.
(ii) There is a blanket waiver for prescriptions covered by other health insurance.
(iii) There is a case-by-case waiver to permit prescription maintenance medication refills at a retail pharmacy when necessary due to personal need or hardship, emergency, or other special circumstance. This waiver is obtained through an administrative override request to the TRICARE pharmacy benefits manager under procedures established by the Director, DHA.
(5)
Procedures.
Under the program established by paragraph (r)(1) of this
section, the Director, DHA will establish procedures for the effective operation of the program. Among these procedures are the following:
(i) The Department will implement the program by utilizing best commercial practices to the extent practicable.
(ii) An effective communication plan that includes efforts to educate beneficiaries in order to optimize participation and satisfaction will be implemented.
(iii) Beneficiaries with active retail prescriptions for a medication on the maintenance medication list will be notified that their medication is included under the program. Beneficiaries will be advised that they may receive two 30 day fill at retail while they transition their prescription to the mail order program.
(iv) Requests for a third fill at retail will result in 100% patient cost shares and will be blocked from any TRICARE payments and the beneficiary advised to call the pharmacy benefits manager (PBM) for assistance.
(v) The PBM will provide a toll free number to assist beneficiaries in transferring their prescriptions from retail to the mail order program. With the beneficiary's permission, the PBM will contact the physician or other health care provider who prescribed the medication to assist in transferring the prescription to the mail order program.
(vi) In any case in which a beneficiary required under paragraph (r) of this section to obtain a maintenance medication prescription refill from national mail order pharmacy program and attempts instead to refill such medications at a retail pharmacy, the PBM will also maintain the toll free number to assist the beneficiary. This assistance may include information on how to request a waiver, consistent with paragraph (r)(4)(iii) of this section, or in taking any other appropriate action to meet the beneficiary's needs and to implement the program.
(vii) The PBM will ensure that a pharmacist is available at all times through the toll-free telephone number to answer beneficiary questions or provide other appropriate assistance.
(6) This program will remain in effect indefinitely with any adjustments or modifications required by law.

§ 199.22
TRICARE Retiree Dental Program (TRDP).
(a)
Establishment.
The TRDP is a premium based indemnity dental insurance coverage program that will be available to certain retirees and their surviving spouses, their dependents, and certain other beneficiaries, as specified in paragraph (d) of this section. The TRDP is authorized by 10 U.S.C. 1076c.
(1) The Director will, except as authorized in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, make available a premium based indemnity dental insurance plan for eligible TRDP beneficiaries specified in paragraph (d) of this section consistent with the provisions of this section.
(2) The TRDP premium based indemnity dental insurance program under paragraph (a) of this section may be provided by allowing eligible beneficiaries specified in paragraph (d) of this section to enroll in an insurance plan under chapter 89A of title 5, United States Code that provides benefits similar to those benefits provided under paragraph (f) of this section. Such enrollment shall be authorized pursuant to an agreement entered into between the Department of Defense and the Office of Personnel Management which agreement, in the event of any inconsistency, shall take precedence over provisions in this section.
(b)
General provisions.
(1) At a minimum, benefits are the diagnostic services, preventive services, basic restorative services (including endodontics), oral surgery services, and emergency services specified in paragraph (f)(1) of this section. Additional services comparable to those contained in paragraph (e)(2) of § 199.13 may be covered pursuant to benefit policy decisions made by the Director, TRICARE Management Activity, or designee.
(2) Premium costs for this coverage will be paid by the enrollee.
(3)
Geographic scope.
(i) The TRDP is applicable to authorized providers in the 50 United States and the District of Columbia, Canada, Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
(ii) The Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) (ASD (HA)) may extend the TRDP to geographic areas other than those specified in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section. In extending the TRDP overseas, the ASD (HA) is authorized to establish program elements, methods of administration, and payment rates and procedures that are different from those in effect for the areas specified in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section to the extent the ASD (HA), or designee, determines necessary for the effective and efficient operation of the TRDP. These differences may include, but are not limited to, specific provisions for preauthorization of care, varying licensure and certification requirements for foreign providers, and other differences based on limitations in the availability and capabilities of the Uniformed Services overseas dental treatment facilities and a particular nation's civilian sector providers in certain areas. The Director, TRICARE Management Activity shall issue guidance, as necessary, to implement the provisions of this paragraph. TRDP enrollees residing in overseas locations will be eligible for the same benefits as enrollees residing in the continental United States, although dental services may not be available or accessible in all locations.
(4) Except as otherwise provided in this section or by the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) or designee, the TRDP is administered in a manner similar to the TRICARE Dental Program under § 199.13 of this part.
(5) The TRDP shall be administered through a contract.
(c) Except as may be specifically provided in this section, to the extent terms defined in § 199.2 and § 199.13(b) are relevant to the administration of the TRICARE Retiree Dental Program, the definitions contained in § 199.2 and § 199.13(b) shall apply to the TRDP as they do to TRICARE/CHAMPUS and the TRICARE Dental Program.

(2)
Notification of eligibility.
The contractor will notify persons eligible to receive dental benefits under the TRICARE Retiree Dental Program.
(3)
Election of coverage.
In order to initiate dental coverage, election to enroll must be made by the member or eligible dependent. Enrollment in the TRICARE Retiree Dental Program is voluntary and will be accomplished by submission of an application to the TRDP contractor.
(4)
Enrollment periods
—(i)
Enrollment period for basic benefits.
The initial enrollment for the basic dental benefits described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section shall be for a period of 24 months followed by month-to-month enrollment as long as the enrollee remains eligible and chooses to continue enrollment. An enrollee's disenrollment from the TRDP at any time for any reason, including termination for failure to pay premiums, is subject to a lockout period of 12 months. After any lockout period, eligible individuals may elect to reenroll and are subject to a new initial enrollment period. The enrollment periods and conditions stipulated in this paragraph apply only to the basic benefit coverage described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section. Effective with the implementation of an enhanced benefit program, new enrollments for basic coverage will cease. Enrollees in the basic program at that time may continue their enrollment for basic coverage, subject to the applicable provisions of this section, as long as the contract administering that coverage is in effect.
(ii)
Enrollment period for enhanced benefits.
The initial enrollment period for enhanced benefit coverage described in paragraph (f)(2) of this section shall be established by the Director, TMA, or designee, to be a period of not less than 12 months and not more than 24 months. The initial enrollment period shall be followed by renewal enrollment periods of up to 12 months as long as the enrollee chooses to continue enrollment and remains eligible. An enrollee who chooses not to continue enrollment upon completion of an enrollment period may re-enroll at any time. However, an enrollee who is disenrolled from the TRDP before completion of an initial or subsequent enrollment period for reasons other than those in paragraphs in (d)(5)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section shall incur a lockout period of 12 months before re-enrollment can occur. Former enrollees who re-enroll following a lockout period or following a period of disenrollment after completion of an enrollment period must comply with all provisions that apply to new enrollees, including a new enrollment commitment.
(5)
Termination of coverage
—(i)
Involuntary termination.
TRDP coverage is terminated when the member's entitlement to retired pay is terminated, the member's status as a member of the Retired Reserve is terminated, a dependent child loses eligible child dependent status, or a surviving spouse remarries.
(ii)
Voluntary termination.
All enrollee requests for termination of TRDP coverage before the completion of an enrollment period shall be submitted to the TRDP contractor for determination of whether the enrollee qualifies to be disenrolled under paragraphs (d)(5)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section.
(A)
Enrollment grace period.
Regardless of the reason, TRDP coverage shall be cancelled, or otherwise terminated, upon request from an enrollee if the request is received by the TRDP contractor within 30 calendar days following the enrollment effective date and there has been no use of TRDP benefits under the enrollment during that period. If such is the case, the enrollment is voided and all premium payments are refunded. However, use of benefits during this 30-day enrollment grace period constitutes acceptance by the enrollee of the enrollment and the enrollment period commitment. In this case, a request for termination of enrollment under paragraph (d)(5)(ii)(A) of this section will not be honored, and premiums will not be refunded.
(B)
Extenuating circumstances.
Under limited circumstances, TRDP enrollees shall be disenrolled by the contractor before the completion of an enrollment period commitment upon request by an enrollee if the enrollee submits written, factual documentation that independently verifies that one of the following extenuating circumstances occurred during the enrollment period. In general, the circumstances must be unforeseen and long-term and must have originated after the effective date of TRDP coverage.
(
1
) The enrollee is prevented by a serious medical condition from being able to utilize TRDP benefits,
(
2
) The enrollee would suffer severe financial hardship by continuing TRDP enrollment; or
(
3
) Any other circumstances which the Secretary considers appropriate.
(C)
Effective date of voluntary termination.
For cases determined to qualify for disenrollment under the grace period provisions in paragraph (d)(5)(ii)(A) of this section, enrollment is completely nullified effective from the beginning date of coverage. For cases determined to qualify for disenrollment under the extenuating circumstances provisions in paragraph (d)(5)(ii)(B) of this section, the effective date of disenrollment is the first of the month following the contractor's initial determination on the disenrollment request or the first of the month following the last use of TRDP benefits under the enrollment, whichever is later.
(D)
Appeal process for denied voluntary enrollment termination.
An enrollee has the right to appeal the contractor's determination that a disenrollment request does not qualify under paragraphs (d)(5)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section. The enrollee may appeal that determination by submitting a written appeal to the TMA, Office of Appeals and Hearings, with a copy of the contractor's determination notice and relevant documentation supporting the disenrollment request. This appeal must be received by TMA within 60 days of the date on the contractor's determination notice. The burden of proof is on the enrollee to establish affirmatively by substantial evidence that the enrollee qualifies to be disenrolled under paragraphs (d)(5)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section. TMA will issue written notification to the enrollee and the contractor of its appeal determination within 60 days from the date of receipt of the appeal request. That determination is final.
(6)
Continuation of dependents' enrollment upon death of enrollee.
Coverage of a dependent in the TRDP under an enrollment of a member or surviving spouse who dies during the period of enrollment shall continue until the end of that period and may be renewed by (or for) the dependent, so long as the premium paid is sufficient to cover continuation of the dependent's enrollment. Coverage may be terminated when the premiums paid are no longer sufficient to cover continuation of the enrollment.
(e)
Premium payments.
Persons enrolled in the dental plan will be responsible for paying the full cost of the premiums in order to obtain the dental insurance.
(1)
Premium payment method.
The premium payment may be collected pursuant to procedures established by the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) or designee.
(2)
Effects of failure to make premium payments.
Failure to make premium payments will result in the enrollee's disenrollment from the TRDP and a lockout period of 12 months. Following this period of time, eligible individuals will be able to re-enroll.
(3)
Member's payment of premiums.
The cost of the TRDP monthly premium will be paid by the enrollee. Interested beneficiaries may contact the dental contractor-insurer to obtain the enrollee premium cost.
(f)
Plan benefits.
The Director, TRICARE Management Activity, or designee, may modify the services covered by the TRDP to the extent determined appropriate based on developments in common dental care practices and standard dental programs. In addition, the Director, TRICARE Management Activity, or designee, may establish such exclusions and limitations as are consistent with those established by dental insurance and prepayment plans to control utilization and quality of care for the services and items covered by the TRDP.

In general, these include additional diagnostic and preventive services, major restorative services, prosthodontics (removable and fixed), additional oral surgery services, orthodontics, and additional adjunctive general services (including general anesthesia and intravenous sedation). Enrollees in the basis plan will be given an enrollment option at the time the enhanced plan is implemented.
(3)
Alternative course of treatment policy.
The Director, TRICARE Management Activity, or designee, may establish, in accordance with generally accepted dental benefit practices, an alternative course of treatment policy which provides reimbursement in instances where the dentist and TRDP enrollee select a more expensive service, procedure, or course of treatement than in customarily provided. The alternative course of treatment policy must meet the following conditions:
(i) The service, procedure, or course of treatment must be consistent with sound professional standards of generally accepted dental practice for the dental condition concerned.
(ii) The service, procedure, or course of treatment must be a generally accepted alternative for a service or procedure covered by the TRDP for the dental condition.

The TRDP enrollee may seek covered services from any provider who is fully licensed and approved to provide dental care in the state where the provider is located.
(j)
Benefit payment.
Enrollees are not required to utilize the special network of dental providers established by the TRDP contractor. For enrollees who do use these network providers, however, providers shall not balance bill any amount in excess of the maximum payment allowable by the TRDP. Enrollees using non-network providers may balance billed amounts in excess of allowable charges. The maximum payment allowable by the TRDP (minus the appropriate cost-share) will be the lesser of:
(1) Billed charges; or
(2) Usual, Customary and Reasonable rates, in which the customary rate is calculated at the 50th percentile of billed charges in that geographic area, as measured in an undiscounted charge profile in 1995 or later for that geographic area (as defined by three-digit zip code).
(k)
Appeal procedures.
All levels of appeal established by the contractor shall be exhausted prior to an appeal being filed with the TMA. Procedures comparable to those established for appeal of benefit determinations under § 199.10 of this part shall apply together with the procedures for appeal of voluntary disenrollment determinations described in paragraph (d)(5)(ii)(D) of this section.
(l)
Preemption of State laws.
(1) Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 1103, the Department of Defense has determined that in the administration of chapter 55 of title 10, U.S. Code, preemption of State and local laws relating to health insurance, prepaid health plans, or other health care delivery or financing methods is necessary to achieve important Federal interests, including but not limited to the assurance of uniform national health programs for military families and the operation of such programs at the lowest possible cost to the Department of Defense, that have a direct and substantial effect on the conduct of military affairs and national security policy of the United States. This determination is applicable to the dental services contracts that implement this section.
(2) Based on the determination set forth in paragraph (l)(1) of this section, any State or local law or regulation pertaining to health or dental insurance, prepaid health or dental plans, or other health or dental care delivery, administration, and financing methods is preempted and does not apply in connection with the TRICARE Retiree Dental Program contract. Any such law, or regulation pursuant to such law, is without any force or effect, and State or local governments have no legal authority to enforce them in relation to the TRICARE Retiree Dental Program contract. (However, the Department of Defense may, by contract, establish legal obligations on the part of the TRICARE Retiree Dental Program contractor to conform with requirements similar to or identical to requirements of State or local laws or regulations).
(3) The preemption of State and local laws set forth in paragraph (l)(2) of this section includes State and local laws imposing premium taxes on health or dental insurance carriers or underwriters or other plan managers, or
similar taxes on such entities. Such laws are laws relating to health insurance, prepaid health plans, or other health care delivery or financing methods, within the meaning of section 1103. Preemption, however, does not apply to taxes, fees, or other payments on net income or profit realized by such entities in the conduct of business relating to DoD health services contracts, if those taxes, fees or other payments are applicable to a broad range of business activity. For the purposes of assessing the effect of Federal preemption of State and local taxes and fees in connection with DoD health and dental services contracts, interpretations shall be consistent with those applicable to the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program under 5 U.S.C. 8909(f).
(m)
Administration.
The Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) or designee may establish other rules and procedures for the administration of the TRICARE Retiree Dental Program.

TRICARE Reserve Select.
(a)
Establishment.
TRICARE Reserve Select offers the TRICARE Select self-managed, preferred-provider network option under § 199.17 to qualified members of the Selected Reserve, their immediate family members, and qualified survivors under this section.
(1)
Purpose.
TRICARE Reserve Select is a premium-based health plan that is available for purchase by members of the Selected Reserve and certain survivors of Selected Reserve members as specified in paragraph (c) of this section.
(2)
Statutory Authority.
TRICARE Reserve Select is authorized by 10 U.S.C. 1076d.
(3)
Scope of the Program.
TRICARE Reserve Select is applicable in the 50 United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and, to the extent practicable, other areas where members of the Selected Reserve serve. In locations other than the 50 states of the United States and the District of Columbia, the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) may authorize modifications to the program rules and procedures as may be appropriate to the area involved.
(4)
Major Features of TRICARE Reserve Select.
The major features of the program include the following:
(i)
TRICARE Select rules applicable.
(A) Unless specified in this section or otherwise prescribed by the Director, provisions of TRICARE Select under § 199.17 apply to TRICARE Reserve Select.
(B) Certain special programs established in 32 CFR part 199 are not available to members covered under TRICARE Reserve Select. These include the Extended Care Health Option (§ 199.5), the Special Supplemental Food Program (see § 199.23), and the Supplemental Health Care Program (§ 199.16), except when referred by a Military Treatment Facility (MTF) provider for incidental consults and the MTF provider maintains clinical control over the episode of care. The TRICARE Dental Program (§ 199.13) is independent of this program and is otherwise available to all members of the Selected Reserve and their eligible family members whether or not they purchase TRICARE Reserve Select coverage. The Continued Health Care Benefits Program (§ 199.20) is also independent of this program and is otherwise available to all members who qualify.
(ii)
Premiums.
TRICARE Reserve Select coverage is available for purchase by any Selected Reserve member if the member fulfills all of the statutory qualifications. A member of the Selected Reserve covered under TRICARE Reserve Select shall pay 28 percent of the total amount that the ASD(HA) determines on an appropriate actuarial basis as being appropriate for that coverage. There is one premium rate for member-only coverage and one premium rate for member and family coverage.
(iii)
Procedures.
Under TRICARE Reserve Select, Reserve Component members who fulfilled all of the statutory qualifications may purchase either the member-only type of coverage or the member-and-family type of coverage by submitting a completed request in the appropriate format along with an
initial payment of the applicable premium. Rules and procedures for purchasing coverage and paying applicable premiums are prescribed in this section.
(iv)
Benefits.
When their coverage becomes effective, TRICARE Reserve Select beneficiaries receive the TRICARE Select benefit including access to military treatment facility services and pharmacies, as described in §§ 199.17 and 199.21. TRICARE Reserve Select coverage features the deductible, catastrophic cap and cost share provisions of the TRICARE Select plan applicable to Group B active duty family members under § 199.17(l)(2)(ii) for both the member and the member's covered family members; however, the TRICARE Reserve Select premium under paragraph (c) of this section applies instead of any TRICARE Select plan enrollment fee under § 199.17. Both the member and the member's covered family members are provided access priority for care in military treatment facilities on the same basis as active duty service members' dependents who are not enrolled in TRICARE Prime as described in § 199.17(d)(1)(i)(D).
(b)
Qualifications for TRICARE Reserve Select coverage
—(1)
Ready Reserve member.
A Ready Reserve member qualifies to purchase TRICARE Reserve Select coverage prior to January 1, 2030, if the Service member meets the criteria listed in both paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section. Beginning January 1, 2030, only the criteria in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section is necessary for qualification.
(i) Is a member of the Selected Reserve of the Ready Reserve of the Armed Forces, or a member of the Individual Ready Reserve of the Armed Forces who has volunteered to be ordered to active duty pursuant to the provisions of 10 U.S.C. 12304 in accordance with section 10 U.S.C. 10144(b); and
(ii) Is not enrolled in, or eligible to enroll in, a health benefits plan under 5 U.S.C. chapter 89. That statute has been implemented under 5 CFR part 890 as the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program. For purposes of the FEHB program, the terms “enrolled,” “enroll” and “enrollee” are defined in 5 CFR 890.101. Further, the member (or certain former member involuntarily separated) no longer qualifies for TRICARE Reserve Select when the member (or former member) has been eligible for coverage to be effective in a health benefits plan under the FEHB program for more than 60 days.
(2)
TRICARE Reserve Select survivor.
If a qualified Service member dies while in a period of TRICARE Reserve Select coverage, the immediate family member(s) of such member is qualified to purchase new or continue existing TRICARE Reserve Select coverage for up to six months beyond the date of the member's death as long as they meet the definition of immediate family members as specified in paragraph (g)(2) of this section. This applies regardless of type of coverage in effect on the day of the TRICARE Reserve Select member's death.
(c)
TRICARE Reserve Select premiums.
Members are charge premiums for coverage under TRICARE Reserve Select that represent 28 percent of the total annual premium amount that the Director determines on an appropriate actuarial basis as being appropriate for coverage under the TRICARE Select benefit for the TRICARE Reserve Select eligible population. Premiums are to be paid monthly, except as otherwise provided through administrative implementation, pursuant to procedures established by the Director. The monthly rate for each month of a calendar year is one-twelfth of the annual rate for that calendar year.
(1)
Annual establishment of rates.
TRICARE Reserve Select monthly premium rates shall be established and updated annually on a calendar year basis for each of the two types of coverage, member-only and member- and-family as described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. Starting with calendar year 2009, the appropriate actuarial basis for purposes of this paragraph (c) shall be determined for each calendar year by utilizing the actual reported cost of providing benefits under this section to members and their dependents during the calendar years preceding such calendar year. Reported actual TRS cost data from calendar years 2006 and 2007 was used to determine premium rates for calendar year 2009. This established pattern will be followed to determine
premium rates for all calendar years subsequent to 2009.
(2)
Premium adjustments.
In addition to the determinations described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, premium adjustments may be made prospectively for any calendar year to reflect any significant program changes or any actual experience in the costs of administering TRICARE Reserve Select.
(3)
Survivor premiums.
A surviving family member of a Reserve Component service member who qualified for TRICARE Reserve Select coverage as described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section will pay premium rates as follows. The premium amount shall be at the member-only rate if there is only one surviving family member to be covered by TRICARE Reserve Select and at the member and family rate if there are two or more survivors to be covered.
(d)
Procedures.
The Director may establish procedures for the following.
(1)
Purchasing coverage.
Procedures may be established for a qualified member to purchase one of two types of coverage: Member-only coverage or member and family coverage. Immediate family members of a qualified member as specified in paragraph (g)(2) of this section may be included in such family coverage. To purchase either type of TRICARE Reserve Select coverage for effective dates of coverage described below, members and survivors qualified under either paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section must submit a request in the appropriate format, along with an initial payment of the applicable premium required by paragraph (c) of this section in accordance with established procedures.
(i)
Continuation coverage.
Procedures may be established for a qualified member or qualified survivor to purchase TRICARE Reserve Select coverage with an effective date immediately following the date of termination of coverage under another TRICARE program.
(ii)
Qualifying event.
Procedures for qualifying events in TRICARE Select plans under § 199.17(o) shall apply to TRICARE Reserve Select coverage. Additionally, the Director may identify other events unique to needs of the Reserve Components as qualifying events.
(iii)
Enrollment.
Procedures for enrollment in TRICARE Select plans under § 199.17(o) shall apply to TRICARE Reserve Select enrollment. Generally, the effective date of coverage will coincide with the first day of a month unless enrollment is due to a qualifying event and a different date on or after the qualifying event is required to prevent a lapse in health care coverage.
(iv)
Survivor coverage under TRICARE Reserve Select.
Procedures may be established for a surviving family member of a Reserve Component service member who qualified for TRICARE Reserve Select coverage as described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section to purchase new TRICARE Reserve Select coverage or continue existing TRICARE Reserve Select coverage for up to six months beyond the date of the member's death. The effective date of coverage will be the day following the date of the member's death.
(2)
Termination.
Termination of coverage for the TRS member/survivor will result in termination of coverage for the member's/survivor's family members in TRICARE Reserve Select. Procedures may be established for coverage to be terminated as follows.
(i) Coverage shall terminate when members or survivors no longer qualify for TRICARE Reserve Select as specified in paragraph (b) of this section, with one exception. If a member is involuntarily separated from the Selected Reserve under other than adverse conditions, as characterized by the Secretary concerned, and is covered by TRICARE Reserve Select on the last day of his or her membership in the Selected Reserve, then TRICARE Reserve Select coverage may terminate up to 180 days after the date on which the member was separated from the Selected Reserve. This applies regardless of type of coverage. This exception expires December 31, 2018.
(ii) Coverage may terminate for members, former members, and survivors who gain coverage under another TRICARE program.
(iii) In accordance with the provisions of § 199.17(o)(2) coverage terminates for members/survivors who fail to
make premium payments in accordance with established procedures.
(iv) Coverage may be terminated for members/survivors upon request at any time by submitting a completed request in the appropriate format in accordance with established procedures.
(3)
Re-enrollment following termination.
Absent a new qualifying event, members/survivors (subject to paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section) are not eligible to re-enroll in TRICARE Reserve Select until the next annual open season.
(4)
Processing.
Upon receipt of a completed request in the appropriate format, enrollment actions will be processed into DEERS in accordance with established procedures.
(5)
Periodic revision.
Periodically, certain features, rules or procedures of TRICARE Reserve Select may be revised. If such revisions will have a significant effect on members' or survivors' costs or access to care, members or survivors may be given the opportunity to change their type of coverage or terminate coverage coincident with the revisions.
(e)
Preemption of State laws.
(1) Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 1103, the Department of Defense has determined that in the administration of chapter 55 of title 10, U.S. Code, preemption of State and local laws relating to health insurance, prepaid health plans, or other health care delivery or financing methods is necessary to achieve important Federal interests, including but not limited to the assurance of uniform national health programs for military families and the operation of such programs, at the lowest possible cost to the Department of Defense, that have a direct and substantial effect on the conduct of military affairs and national security policy of the United States. This determination is applicable to contracts that implement this section.
(2) Based on the determination set forth in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, any State or local law or regulation pertaining to health insurance, prepaid health plans, or other health care delivery, administration, and financing methods is preempted and does not apply in connection with TRICARE Reserve Select. Any such law, or regulation pursuant to such law, is without any force or effect, and State or local governments have no legal authority to enforce them in relation to TRICARE Reserve Select. (However, the Department of Defense may, by contract, establish legal obligations on the part of DoD contractors to conform with requirements similar to or identical to requirements of State or local laws or regulations with respect to TRICARE Reserve Select).
(3) The preemption of State and local laws set forth in paragraph (f)(2) of this section includes State and local laws imposing premium taxes on health insurance carriers or underwriters or other plan managers, or similar taxes on such entities. Such laws are laws relating to health insurance, prepaid health plans, or other health care delivery or financing methods, within the meaning of 10 U.S.C. 1103. Preemption, however, does not apply to taxes, fees, or other payments on net income or profit realized by such entities in the conduct of business relating to DoD health services contracts, if those taxes, fees or other payments are applicable to a broad range of business activity. For the purposes of assessing the effect of Federal preemption of State and local taxes and fees in connection with DoD health services contracts, interpretations shall be consistent with those applicable to the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program under 5 U.S.C. 8909(f).
(f)
Administration.
The Director may establish other rules and procedures for the effective administration of TRICARE Reserve Select, and may authorize exceptions to requirements of this section, if permitted by law.
(g)
Terminology.
The following terms are applicable to the TRICARE Reserve Select program.
(1)

Such laws are laws relating to health insurance, prepaid health plans, or other health care delivery or financing methods, within the meaning of 10 U.S.C. 1103. Preemption, however, does not apply to taxes, fees, or other payments on net income or profit realized by such entities in the conduct of business relating to DoD health services contracts, if those taxes, fees or other payments are applicable to a broad range of business activity. For the purposes of assessing the effect of Federal preemption of State and local taxes and fees in connection with DoD health services contracts, interpretations shall be consistent with those of the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program under 5 U.S.C. 8909(f).
(f)
Administration.
The Director may establish other rules and procedures for the effective administration of TRICARE Retired Reserve, and may authorize exceptions to requirements of this section, if permitted by law.
(g)
Terminology.
The following terms are applicable to the TRICARE Retired Reserve program.
(1)

§ 199.26
TRICARE Young Adult.
(a)
Establishment.
The TRICARE Young Adult (TYA) program offers options of medical benefits provided under the TRICARE program to qualified unmarried adult children of TRICARE-eligible uniformed service sponsors who do not otherwise have eligibility for medical coverage under a TRICARE program at age 21 (23 if enrolled in a full-time course of study at an approved institution of higher learning, and the sponsor provides over 50 percent of the student's financial support), and are under age 26.
(1)
Purpose.
As specified in paragraph (c) of this section, TYA is a premium-based health option that is available for purchase by any qualified adult child as that term is defined in paragraph (b) of this section. The TYA program allows a qualified adult child to purchase TRICARE coverage.
(2)
Statutory authority.
TYA is authorized by 10 U.S.C. 1110b.
(3)
Scope of the program.
TYA is geographically applicable to the same extent as specified in § 199.1(b)(1).
(4)
Major features of TYA.
(i)
TRICARE rules applicable.
(A) Unless specified in this section or otherwise prescribed by the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) (ASD (HA)), provisions of this part apply to TYA.
(B) The TRICARE Dental Program (§ 199.13) and the TRICARE Retiree Dental Program (§ 199.22) are not covered under TYA.
(C) TRICARE Select is available to all TYA-eligible young adult dependents.
(D) TRICARE Prime is available to TYA-eligible young adult dependents, provided that TRICARE Prime (including the Uniformed Services Family Health Plan) is available in the geographic location where the TYA enrollee resides. TYA-eligible young adults are:
(
1
) Dependents of sponsors on active duty orders written, or otherwise continuously, for more than 30 days or covered by TAMP (under § 199.3(e));
(
2
) Dependents of sponsors who are retired members other than retired members of the Retired Reserve; and
(
3
) Survivors of members who died while on active duty for more than 30 days or while receiving retired or retainer pay.
(ii)
Premiums.
TYA coverage is a premium based program that an eligible young adult dependent may purchase. There is only individual coverage, and a premium shall be charged for each dependent even if there is more than one qualified dependent in the uniformed service sponsor's family that qualifies for TYA coverage. Dependents qualifying for TYA status can purchase individual TRICARE Select or TRICARE Prime coverage (as applicable) according to the rules governing the TRICARE option for which they are qualified on the basis of their uniformed service sponsor's TRICARE-eligible status (active duty, retired, Selected Reserve, or Retired Reserve) and the availability of a desired option in their geographic location. Premiums shall be determined in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.
(iii)
Procedures.
Under TYA, qualified dependents under paragraph (b) of this section may purchase individual TYA coverage by submitting a completed request in the appropriate format along with an initial payment of the applicable premium. Procedures for purchasing coverage and paying applicable premiums are prescribed in paragraph (d) of this section.
(iv)
Benefits.
When their TYA coverage becomes effective, qualified beneficiaries receive the benefit of the TRICARE option that they selected, including, if applicable, access to military treatment facilities and pharmacies. TYA coverage features the cost share, deductible and catastrophic cap provisions applicable to Group B beneficiaries based on the program selected,
i.e.,
the TRICARE Select program under § 199.17(l)(2)(ii) or the TRICARE Prime program under § 199.17(l)(ii), as well as the status of their military sponsor. Access to military treatment facilities under the system of access priorities in § 199.17(d)(1) is also based on the program selected as well as the
status of the military sponsor. Premiums are not credited to deductibles or catastrophic caps; however, TYA premiums shall apply instead of any applicable TRICARE Prime or Select enrollment fee.
(b)
Eligibility for TRICARE Young Adult coverage
—(1)
Young Adult Dependent.
A young adult dependent qualifies to purchase TYA coverage if the dependent meets the following criteria:
(i) Would be a dependent child under 10 U.S.C. 1072, but for exceeding the age limit under that section (abused dependents and NATO dependents are not eligible for TYA coverage); and
(ii) Is a dependent under the age of 26; and
(iii) Is not enrolled, or eligible to enroll, for medical coverage in an eligible employer-sponsored health plan as defined in section 5000A(f)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; and
(iv) Is not otherwise eligible under § 199.3; and
(v) Is not a member of the uniformed services.
(2) The dependents' sponsor is responsible for keeping the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS) current with eligibility data through the sponsor's Service personnel office. Using information from the DEERS, the TRICARE regional contractors have the responsibility to validate a dependent's qualifications to purchase TYA coverage.
(c)
TRICARE Young Adult premiums.
Qualified young adult dependents are charged premiums for coverage under TYA that represent the full cost of the program, including reasonable administrative costs, as determined by the Director utilizing an appropriate actuarial basis for the provision of TRICARE benefits for the TYA-eligible beneficiary population. Separate premiums shall be established for TRICARE Select and Prime plans. There may also be separate premiums based on the uniformed services sponsor's status. Premiums are to be paid monthly, except as otherwise provided through administrative implementation, pursuant to procedures established by the Director. The monthly rate for each month of a calendar year is one-twelfth of the annual rate for that calendar year.
(1)
Annual establishment of rates.
(i) Monthly premium rates shall be established and updated annually on a calendar year basis by the ASD(HA) for TYA individual coverage.
(ii) The appropriate actuarial basis used for calculating premium rates shall be one that most closely approximates the actual cost of providing care to a similar demographic population (based on age and health plans) as those enrolled in TYA, as determined by the ASD(HA). TYA premiums shall be based on the actual costs of providing benefits to TYA dependents during the preceding years if the population of TYA enrollees is large enough during those preceding years to be considered actuarially appropriate. Until such time that actual costs from those preceding years become available, TYA premiums shall be based on the actual costs during the preceding calendar years for providing benefits to the population of similarly aged dependents to make the underlying group actuarially appropriate. An adjustment may be applied to cover overhead costs for administration of the program.
(2)
Premium adjustments.
In addition to the determinations described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, premium adjustments may be made prospectively for any calendar year to reflect any significant program changes mandated by legislative enactment, including but not limited to significant new programs or benefits.
(d)
Procedures.
The Director may establish procedures for the following.
(1)
Purchasing coverage.
Procedures may be established for a qualified dependent to purchase individual coverage. To purchase TYA coverage for effective dates of coverage described below, qualified dependents must submit a request in the appropriate format, along with an initial payment of the applicable premium required by paragraph (c) of this section in accordance with established procedures.
(i)
Continuation coverage.
Procedures may be established for a qualified dependent to purchase TYA coverage with an effective date immediately following the date of termination of coverage under another TRICARE program. Application for continuation coverage must be made within 30 days
of the date of termination of coverage under another TRICARE program.
(ii)
Enrollment.
Procedures for enrollment in TRICARE plans under § 199.17(o) shall apply to a qualified dependent purchasing TYA coverage. Generally, the effective date of coverage will coincide with the first day of a month unless enrollment is due to a qualifying event and a different date on or after the qualifying event is required to prevent a lapse in health care coverage.
(2)
Termination.
Procedures may be established for TYA coverage to be terminated as follows.
(i) Loss of eligibility or entitlement for coverage by the sponsor will result in termination of the dependent's TYA coverage unless otherwise specified. The effective date of the sponsor's loss of eligibility for care will also be the effective date of termination of benefits under the TYA program unless specified otherwise.
(A)
Active duty military sponsor.
TYA coverage ends effective the date of military sponsor's separation from military service, unless the dependent would be eligible under section 199.3(e) of this Part but for the dependent's age, for the duration of the Transitional Assistance Management Program (TAMP) eligibility or until reaching age 26, whichever comes first. Upon the death of an active duty sponsor, dependents eligible for Transitional Survivor coverage may purchase TYA coverage if otherwise qualified.
(B)
Selected Reserve (Sel Res) Sponsor.
Sel Res sponsors must be currently enrolled in TRICARE Reserve Select (TRS) before a young adult dependent is eligible to purchase TYA. If TRS coverage is terminated by the sponsor, TYA coverage ends effective the same termination date as the sponsor. If the Sel Res sponsor dies while enrolled in TRS, the young adult dependent is eligible to purchase TYA coverage for six months after the date of death of the Sel Res sponsor, if otherwise qualified.
(C)
Retired Reserve Sponsor.
Retired Reserve members not yet eligible for retired or retainer pay must be enrolled in TRICARE Retired Reserve (TRR) to establish TYA eligibility for their young adult dependents. If TRR coverage is terminated by the sponsor, the TYA coverage for the young adult dependent ends effective the same date as the sponsor's termination of coverage under TRR. If the retired reserve sponsor dies while enrolled in TRR, the young adult dependent may continue to purchase TYA coverage until the date on which the deceased member would have attained age 60, if otherwise qualified. If the Retired Reserve member dies and is not enrolled in TRR, there is no eligibility for TYA coverage until the sponsor would have reached age 60. On the date the Retired Reserve member would have reached 60, a young adult dependent who otherwise qualifies for TYA qualifies as a dependent of a deceased retired sponsor and can purchase TYA coverage.
(ii) Failure of a young adult dependent to maintain the eligibility qualifications in paragraph (b) of this section shall result in the termination of coverage under the TYA program. The effective date of termination shall be the date upon which the adult young dependent failed to meet any of the prerequisite qualifications. If a subsequent change in circumstances re-establishes eligibility (such as losing eligibility for an eligible employer-sponsored plan), the young adult dependent may re-enroll for coverage under the TYA program.
(iii) Coverage may also be terminated due to a change in the sponsor's status, and the young adult dependent must re-qualify and reapply for TYA coverage within 30 days of termination to preclude a gap in coverage.
(iv) Termination of coverage results in denial of claims for services with a date of service after the effective date of termination.
(v) Coverage may be terminated for young adult dependents upon request at any time by submitting a completed request in the appropriate format in accordance with established procedures.
(vi) In accordance with the provisions of § 199.17(o)(2), coverage terminates for young adult dependents who fail to make premium payments in accordance with established procedures.
(vii) Absent a new qualifying event, young adults are not eligible to re-enroll in TYA until the next annual open season.
(3)
Eligibility for the Continued Health Care Benefit Program.
Upon termination of eligibility to purchase TYA coverage, dependents may purchase coverage for up to 36 months through the Continued Health Care Benefit Program under § 199.20 unless locked out of TYA.
(4)
Changing coverage.
Upon application and payment of appropriate premiums, qualified dependents already enrolled in and who are current in their premium payments may elect to change to another TRICARE program for which the qualified dependent is eligible based on the sponsor's eligibility and the geographic location of the qualified young adult dependent. Upon change in sponsor status (for example, active duty to retired status), TYA coverage may be automatically transferred to the appropriate TRICARE option consistent with the sponsor's new status. Recurring TYA premiums may be adjusted accordingly. Administrative processes may be established for changes in program enrollment; however, no change shall be effective until the applicable premium has been paid.
(e)
Preemption of State laws.
—The preemption provisions of § 199.17(a)(7) are applicable to the TYA program.
(f)
Administration.
The Director may establish other processes, policies and procedures for the effective administration of the TYA Program and may authorize exceptions to requirements of this section, if permitted.

§ 200.120
Liability for penalties and assessments.
(a) In any case in which it is determined that more than one person was responsible for a violation described in this part, each such person may be held separately liable for the entire penalty prescribed by this part.
(b) In any case in which it is determined that more than one person was responsible for a violation described in this part, an assessment may be imposed, when authorized, against any one such person or jointly and severally against two or more such persons, but the aggregate amount of the assessments collected may not exceed the amount that could be assessed if only one person was responsible.
(c) Under this part, a principal is liable for penalties and assessments for the actions of his or her agent acting within the scope of his or her agency. The provision in this paragraph (c) does not limit the underlying liability of the agent.
§ 200.130
Assessments.
The assessment in this part is in lieu of damages sustained by the Department because of the violation.
§ 200.140
Determinations regarding the amount of penalties and assessments.
(a) Except as otherwise provided in this part, in determining the amount of any penalty or assessment in accordance with this part, the DHA will consider the following factors—
(1) The nature and circumstances of the violation;
(2) The degree of culpability of the person against whom a civil money penalty and assessment is proposed. It should be considered an aggravating circumstance if the respondent had actual knowledge where a lower level of knowledge was required to establish liability (
e.g.,
for a provision that establishes liability if the respondent “knew or should have known” a claim was false or fraudulent, it will be an aggravating circumstance if the respondent knew the claim was false or fraudulent). It should be a mitigating circumstance if the person took appropriate and timely corrective action in response to the violation. For purposes of this part, corrective action must include disclosing the violation to the DHA by initiating a self-disclosure and fully cooperating with the DHA's review and resolution of such disclosure;
(3) The history of prior offenses. Aggravating circumstances include, if at any time prior to the violation, the individual—or in the case of an entity, the entity itself; any individual who had a direct or indirect ownership or control interest (as defined in section 1124(a)(3) of the Act) in a sanctioned entity at the time the violation occurred and who knew, or should have known, of the violation; or any individual who was an officer or a managing employee (as defined in section 1126(b) of the Act) of such an entity at the time the violation occurred—was held liable for criminal, civil, or administrative sanctions in connection with a program covered by this part or in connection with the delivery of a health care item or service;
(4) Other wrongful conduct. Aggravating circumstances include proof that the individual—or in the case of an entity, the entity itself; any individual who had a direct or indirect ownership or control interest (as defined in section 1124(a)(3) of the Act) in a sanctioned entity at the time the violation occurred and who knew, or should have known, of the violation; or any individual who was an officer or a managing employee (as defined in section 1126(b) of the Act) of such an entity at the time the violation occurred—engaged in wrongful conduct, other than the specific conduct upon which liability is based, relating to a government program or in connection with the delivery of a health care item or service. The statute of limitations governing civil money penalty proceedings does not apply to proof of other wrongful conduct as an aggravating circumstance; and
(5) Such other matters as justice may require. Other circumstances of an aggravating or mitigating nature should be considered if, in the interests of justice, they require either a reduction or an increase in the penalty or assessment to achieve the purposes of this part.
(b)(1) After determining the amount of any penalty and assessment in accordance with this part, the DHA considers the ability of the person to pay the proposed civil money penalty or assessment. The person shall provide, in a time and manner requested by the DHA, sufficient financial documentation, including, but not limited to, audited financial statements, tax returns, and financial disclosure statements, deemed necessary by the DHA to determine the person's ability to pay the penalty or assessment.
(2) If the person requests a hearing in accordance with § 200.2002, the only financial documentation subject to review is that which the person provided to the DHA during the administrative process, unless the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) finds that extraordinary circumstances prevented the person from providing the financial documentation to the DHA in the time and manner requested by the DHA prior to the hearing request.
(c) In determining the amount of any penalty and assessment to be imposed under this part the following circumstances are also to be considered—
(1) If there are substantial or several mitigating circumstances, the aggregate amount of the penalty and assessment should be set at an amount sufficiently below the maximum permitted by this part to reflect that fact.
(2) If there are substantial or several aggravating circumstances, the aggregate amount of the penalty and assessment should be set at an amount sufficiently close to or at the maximum permitted by this part to reflect that fact.
(3) Unless there are extraordinary mitigating circumstances, the aggregate amount of the penalty and assessment should not be less than double the approximate amount of damages and costs (as defined by paragraph (e)(2) of this section) sustained by the United States, or any State, as a result of the violation.
(4) The presence of any single aggravating circumstance may justify imposing a penalty and assessment at or close to the maximum even when one or more mitigating factors is present.
(d)(1) The standards set forth in this section are binding, except to the extent that their application would result in imposition of an amount that would exceed limits imposed by the United States Constitution.
(2) The amount imposed will not be less than the approximate amount required to fully compensate the United States, for its damages and costs, tangible and intangible, including, but not limited to, the costs attributable to the investigation, prosecution, and administrative review of the case.
(3) Nothing in this part limits the authority of the Department or the DHA to settle any issue or case as provided by § 200.1530 or to compromise any penalty and assessment as provided by § 200.1550.
(4) Penalties and assessments imposed under this part are in addition to any other penalties, assessments, or other sanctions prescribed by law.
§ 200.150
Delegation of authority.
The DHA is delegated authority from the Secretary to impose civil money penalties and, as applicable, assessments against any person who has violated one or more provisions of this part.

(6) Fails to grant timely access to records, documents, and other material or data in any medium (including electronically stored information and any tangible thing), upon reasonable request, to the OIG, for the purpose of audits, investigations, evaluations, or other OIG statutory functions. Such failure to grant timely access means:
(i) Except when the OIG reasonably believes that the requested material is about to be altered or destroyed, the failure to produce or make available for inspection and copying the requested material upon reasonable request or to provide a compelling reason why they cannot be produced, by the deadline specified in the OIG's written request; and
(ii) When the OIG has reason to believe that the requested material is about to be altered or destroyed, the failure to provide access to the requested material at the time the request is made.

as described in this part, that were presented, or caused to be presented, by the respondent.

Fees.
The party requesting a subpoena will pay the cost of the fees and mileage of any witness subpoenaed in the amounts that would be payable to a witness in a proceeding in United States District Court.

§ 200.2014
Sanctions.
(a) The ALJ may sanction a person, including any party or attorney, for failing to comply with an order or procedure, for failing to defend an action or for other misconduct that interferes with the speedy, orderly, or fair conduct of the hearing. Such sanctions will reasonably relate to the severity and nature of the failure or misconduct. Such sanction may include—

The ALJ may, at his or her discretion, admit prior sworn testimony of experts which has been subject to adverse examination, such as a deposition or trial testimony. Any such written statement must be provided to all other parties along with the last known address of such witnesses, in a manner that allows sufficient time for other parties to subpoena such witness for cross-examination at the hearing. Prior written statements of witnesses proposed to testify at the hearing will be exchanged as provided in § 200.2008.
(c) The ALJ will exercise reasonable control over the mode and order of interrogating witnesses and presenting evidence so as to:
(1) Make the interrogation and presentation effective for the ascertainment of the truth;
(2) Avoid repetition or needless consumption of time; and
(3) Protect witnesses from harassment or undue embarrassment.
(d) The ALJ will permit the parties to conduct such cross-examination of witnesses as may be required for a full and true disclosure of the facts.
(e) The ALJ may order witnesses excluded so that they cannot hear the testimony of other witnesses. This does not authorize exclusion of—
(1) A party who is an individual;
(2) In the case of a party that is not an individual, an officer or employee of the party appearing for the entity pro se or designated as the party's representative; or
(3) An individual whose presence is shown by a party to be essential to the presentation of its case, including an individual engaged in assisting the attorney for the Inspector General (IG).
§ 200.2017
Evidence.
(a) The ALJ will determine the admissibility of evidence.
(b) Except as provided in this part, the ALJ will not be bound by the Federal Rules of Evidence. However, the ALJ may apply the Federal Rules of Evidence where appropriate, for example, to exclude unreliable evidence.
(c) The ALJ must exclude irrelevant or immaterial evidence.
(d) Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or by considerations of undue delay or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.

(h) The ALJ will permit the parties to introduce rebuttal witnesses and evidence.
(i) All documents and other evidence offered or taken for the record will be open to examination by all parties, unless otherwise ordered by the ALJ for good cause shown.

(d) For good cause, the ALJ may order appropriate redactions made to the record.
§ 200.2019
Post-hearing briefs.
The ALJ may require the parties to file post-hearing briefs. In any event, any party may file a post-hearing brief. The ALJ will fix the time for filing such briefs which are not to exceed 60 days from the date the parties receive the transcript of the hearing or, if applicable, the stipulated record. Such briefs may be accompanied by proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. The ALJ may permit the parties to file reply briefs.
§ 200.2020
Initial decision.
(a) The ALJ will issue an initial decision, based only on the record, which will contain findings of fact and conclusions of law.
(b) The ALJ may affirm, increase or reduce the penalties, assessment proposed or imposed by the DHA.
(c) The ALJ will issue the initial decision to all parties within 120 days after the time for submission of post-hearing briefs and reply briefs, if permitted, has expired. The decision will be accompanied by a statement describing the right of any party to file a notice of appeal with the DAB and instructions for how to file such appeal. If the ALJ fails to meet the deadline contained in this paragraph (c), he or she will notify the parties of the reason for the delay and will set a new deadline.
(d) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, unless the initial decision is appealed to the DAB, it will be final and binding on the parties 30 days after the ALJ serves the parties with a copy of the decision. If service is by mail, the date of service will be deemed to be 5 days from the date of mailing.
(e) If an extension of time within which to appeal the initial decision is granted under § 200.2021(a), except as provided in § 200.2022(a), the initial decision will become final and binding on the day following the end of the extension period.
§ 200.2021

The DAB may extend the initial 30 day period for a period of time not to exceed 30 days if a party files with the DAB a request for an extension within the initial 30 day period and shows good cause.
(b) If a party files a timely notice of appeal with the DAB, the ALJ will forward the record of the proceeding to the DAB.
(c) A notice of appeal will be accompanied by a written brief specifying exceptions to the initial decision and reasons supporting the exceptions. Any party may file a brief in opposition to exceptions, which may raise any relevant issue not addressed in the exceptions, within 30 days of receiving the notice of appeal and accompanying brief. The DAB may permit the parties to file reply briefs.
(d) There is no right to appear personally before the DAB or to appeal to the DAB any interlocutory ruling by the ALJ, except on the timeliness of a filing of the hearing request.
(e) The DAB will not consider any issue not raised in the parties' briefs, nor any issue in the briefs that could have been raised before the ALJ but was not.
(f) If any party demonstrates to the satisfaction of the DAB that additional evidence not presented at such hearing is relevant and material and that there were reasonable grounds for the failure
to adduce such evidence at such hearing, the DAB may remand the matter to the ALJ for consideration of such additional evidence.
(g) The DAB may decline to review the case, or may affirm, increase, reduce, reverse, or remand any penalty or assessment determined by the ALJ.
(h) The standard of review on a disputed issue of fact is whether the initial decision is supported by substantial evidence on the whole record. The standard of review on a disputed issue of law is whether the initial decision is erroneous.
(i) Within 120 days after the time for submission of briefs and reply briefs, if permitted, has expired, the DAB will issue to each party to the appeal a copy of the DAB's decision and a statement describing the right of any petitioner or respondent who is found liable to seek judicial review.
(j) Except with respect to any penalty or assessment remanded by the ALJ, the DAB's decision, including a decision to decline review of the initial decision, becomes final and binding 60 days after the date on which the DAB serves the parties with a copy of the decision.

The petition copy will be time-stamped by the clerk of the court when the original is filed with the court.
(3) If the General Counsel of the DHA receives two or more petitions within 10 days after the DAB issues its decision, the General Counsel of the DHA will notify the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation of any petitions that were received within the 10-day period.
§ 200.2022
Stay of initial decision.
(a) In a CMP case under section 1128A of the Act, the filing of a respondent's request for review by the DAB will automatically stay the effective date of the ALJ's decision.
(b)(1) After the DAB renders a decision in a CMP case, pending judicial review, the respondent may file a request for stay of the effective date of any penalty or assessment with the ALJ. The request must be accompanied by a copy of the notice of appeal filed with the Federal court. The filing of such a request will automatically act to stay the effective date of the penalty or assessment until such time as the ALJ rules upon the request.
(2) The ALJ may not grant a respondent's request for stay of any penalty or assessment unless the respondent posts a bond or provides other adequate security.
(3) The ALJ will rule upon a respondent's request for stay within 10 days of receipt.
§ 200.2023
Harmless error.
No error in either the admission or the exclusion of evidence, and no error or defect in any ruling or order or in any act done or omitted by the ALJ or by any of the parties, including Federal representatives or TRICARE contractors is ground for vacating, modifying, or otherwise disturbing an otherwise appropriate ruling or order or act, unless refusal to take such action appears to the ALJ or the DAB inconsistent with substantial justice. The ALJ and the DAB at every stage of the proceeding will disregard any error or defect in the proceeding that does not affect the substantial rights of the parties.

# Subpart A—General Requirements
§ 202.1
Purpose, scope, definitions, and applicability.
(a)
Purpose.
The purpose of this part to establish regulations regarding the scope, characteristics, composition, funding, establishment, operation, adjournment, and dissolution of Restoration Advisory Boards (RABs).
(b)
Purpose and scope of responsibilities of RABs.
The purpose of a RAB is to provide:
(1) An opportunity for stakeholder involvement in the environmental restoration process at Department of Defense (DoD) installations. Stakeholders are those parties that may be affected by environmental restoration activities at the installation.
(2) A forum for the early discussion and continued exchange of environmental restoration program information between DoD installations, regulatory agencies, tribes, and the community.
(3) An opportunity for RAB members to review progress, participate in a dialogue with, and provide comments and advice to the installation's decision makers concerning environmental restoration matters. Installations shall give careful consideration to the comments provided by the RAB members.
(4) A forum for addressing issues associated with environmental restoration activities under the Defense Environmental Restoration Program (DERP) at DoD installations, including activities conducted under the Military Munitions Response program (MMRP) to address unexploded ordnance, discarded military munitions, and the chemical constituents of munitions. Environmental groups or advisory boards that address issues other than environmental restoration activities are not governed by this regulation.
(c)
Definitions.
In this section:
(1)
Community RAB member
shall mean those individuals identified by community members and appointed by the Installation Commander to participate in a RAB who live and/or work in the affected community or are affected by the installation's environmental restoration program.
(2)
Environmental restoration
shall include the identification, investigation, research and development, and cleanup of contamination from hazardous substances, including munitions and explosives of concern, and pollutants and contaminants.
(3)
Installation
shall include active and closing DoD installations and formerly used defense sites (FUDS).
(4)
Installation Commander
shall include the Commanding Officer or the equivalent of a Commanding Officer at active installations; the Installation Commander or other Military Department officials who close the facility and are responsible for its disposal at Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) installations; or the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Project Management District Commander at FUDS.
(5)
Public participants
shall include anyone else who may want to attend the RAB meetings, including those individuals that may not live and/or work in the affected community or may not be affected by the installation's environmental restoration program but would like to attend and provide comments to the RAB.
(6)
Stakeholders
are those parties that may be affected by environmental restoration activities at an installation, including family members of military personnel and civilian workers, local and state governments and EPA for NPL properties, tribal community members and indigenous people, and current landowners, as appropriate.
(7)
Tribes
shall mean any Federally-recognized American Indian and Alaska Native government as defined by the most current Department of Interior/Bureau of Indian Affairs list of tribal entities published in the
Federal Register
pursuant to Section 104 of the Federally Recognized Tribe Act.
(8)
RAB adjournment
shall mean when an Installation Commander, in consultation with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), state, tribes, RAB members, and the local community, as appropriate, close the RAB based on a determination that there is no longer a need for a RAB or when community interest in the RAB declines.
(9)
RAB dissolution
shall mean when an Installation Commander, with the appropriate Military Component's Environmental Deputy Assistant Secretary's approval, disbands a RAB that is no longer fulfilling the intended purpose of advising and providing community input to an Installation Commander and decision makers on environmental restoration projects. Installation Commanders are expected to make every reasonable effort to ensure that a RAB performs its role as effectively as possible and a concerted attempt is made to resolve issues that affect the RAB's effectiveness. There are circumstances, however, that may prevent a RAB from operating effectively or fulfilling its intended purpose.
(d)
Other public involvement activities.
A RAB should complement other community involvement efforts occurring at an installation; however, it does not replace other types of community outreach and participation activities required by applicable laws and regulations.
(e)
Applicability of regulations to existing RABs.
The regulations in this part apply to all RABs regardless of when the RAB was established.
(f)
Guidance.
The Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Environment shall issue guidance regarding the scope, characteristics, composition, funding, establishment, operation, adjournment, and dissolution of RABs pursuant to this rule. The issuance of any such guidance shall not be a precondition to the establishment of RABs or the implementation of this part.
[71 FR 27617, May 12, 2006; 71 FR 30719, May 30, 2006]
§ 202.2
Criteria for establishment.
(a)
Determining if sufficient interest warrants establishing a RAB.
A RAB should be established when there is sufficient and sustained community interest, and any of the following criteria are met:
(1) The closure of an installation involves the transfer of property to the community,
(2) At least 50 local citizens petition the installation for creation of a RAB,
(3) Federal, state, tribal, or local government representatives request the formation of a RAB, or
(4) The installation determines the need for a RAB. To determine the need for establishing a RAB, an installation should:
(i) Review correspondence files,
(ii) Review media coverage,
(iii) Consult local community members,
(iv) Consult relevant government officials, and
(v) Evaluate responses to communication efforts, such as notices placed in local newspapers and, if applicable, announced on the installation's Web site.
(b)
Responsibility for forming or operating a RAB.
The installation shall have lead responsibility for forming and operating a RAB.
(c)
Converting existing Technical Review Committees (TRCs) to RABs.
In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2705(d)(1), a RAB may fulfill the requirements of 10 U.S.C. 2705(c), which directs DoD to establish TRCs. DoD recommends that, where TRCs or similar advisory groups already exist, the TRC or similar advisory group be considered for conversion to a RAB, provided there is sufficient and sustained interest within the community.
[71 FR 27617, May 12, 2006; 71 FR 30719, May 30, 2006]
§ 202.3
Notification of formation of a Restoration Advisory Board.
Prior to establishing a RAB, an installation shall notify potential stakeholders of its intent to form a RAB. In
announcing the formation of a RAB, the installation should describe the purpose of a RAB and discuss opportunities for membership.
§ 202.4
Composition of a RAB.
(a)
Membership.
At a minimum, each RAB shall include representatives from DoD and the community. RAB community membership shall be well balanced and reflect the diverse interests within the local community.
(1)
Government representation.
The RAB may also include representatives from the EPA at the discretion of the Regional Administrator of the appropriate EPA Regional Office, and state, tribal, and local governments, as appropriate. At closing installations where BRAC Cleanup Teams (BCT) exist, representatives of the BCT may also serve as the government representative(s) of the RAB. The Department encourages individuals and agencies involved with BRAC to participate in RABs at closing installations.
(2)
Community representation.
Community RAB members should live and/or work in the affected community or be affected by the installation's environmental restoration program. While DoD encourages individual tribal members to participate on RABs, RABs in no way replace or serve as a substitute forum for the government-to-government relationship between DoD and Federally-recognized tribes.
(i) To support the objective selection of community RAB members, installations will use a selection panel comprised of community members to nominate community RAB members. The Installation Commander, in consultation with the state, tribal, and local governments and EPA, as appropriate, will identify community interests and solicit names of individuals who can represent these interests on the selection panel. The panel will establish the procedures for nominating community RAB members, the process for reviewing community interest, and criteria for selecting community RAB members. The panel will transmit the list of RAB nominees to the Installation Commander for appointment.
(ii) Following the panel nominations, the Installation Commander, in consultation with the state and EPA, as appropriate, will review the nominations to ensure the panel fairly represents the local community. The Installation Commander will accept or reject the entire list of RAB nominees for appointment.
(b)
Chairmanship.
Each RAB established shall have two co-chairs, one representing the DoD installation and the other the community. Co-chairs shall be responsible for directing and managing the RAB operations.
(c)
Compensation for community members of the RAB.
The community co-chair and community RAB members serve voluntarily. DoD will not compensate them for their participation.
[71 FR 27617, May 12, 2006; 71 FR 30719, May 30, 2006]

# Subpart B—Operating Requirements
§ 202.5

§ 202.6
Selecting co-chairs.
(a)
DoD installation co-chair.
The DoD installation co-chair shall be selected by the Installation Commander or equivalent, or in accordance with Military Component-specific guidance.
(b)
Community co-chair.
The community co-chair shall be selected by the community RAB members.
[71 FR 27617, May 12, 2006; 71 FR 30719, May 30, 2006]
§ 202.7
Developing operating procedures.
Each RAB shall develop a set of operating procedures and the co-chairs are responsible for carrying them out. Areas that should be addressed in the procedures include:
(a) Clearly defined goals and objectives for the RAB, as determined by the co-chairs in consultation with the RAB,
(b) Meeting announcements,
(c) Attendance requirements of members at meetings,
(d) Development, approval and distribution procedures for the minutes of RAB meetings,
(e) Meeting frequency and location,
(f) Rules of order,
(g) The frequency and procedures for conducting training,
(h) Procedures for selecting or replacing co-chairs and selecting, replacing, or adding RAB members,
(i) Specifics on the size of the RAB, periods of membership, and co-chair length of service,
(j) Review of public comments and responses,
(k) Participation of the general public,
(l) Keeping the public informed about proceedings of the RAB,
(m) Discussing the agenda for the next meeting and issues to be addressed, and
(n) Methods for resolving disputes.
§ 202.8
Training RAB members.
Training is not required for RAB members. It may be advisable, however, to provide RAB members with some initial orientation training regarding the purpose and responsibilities of the RAB, familiarization on cleanup technologies, chemicals of concern, and sampling protocols, as well as informing them of the availability of independent technical advice and document review through EPA's Technical Assistant Grant program and DoD's Technical Assistance for Public Participation (TAPP) program, to enable them to fulfill their responsibilities. Training should be site-specific and beneficial to RAB members. The DoD installation may also provide in-house assistance to discuss technical issues. Funding for training activities must be within the scope of administrative support for RABs, as permitted in § 202.12.
§ 202.9
Conducting RAB meetings.
(a)
Public participation.
RAB meetings shall be open to the public.
(1) The installation co-chair shall prepare and publish a timely public notice in a local newspaper of general circulation announcing each RAB meeting. If applicable, it is recommended that the meeting also be announced on the installation's Web site.
(2) Each RAB meeting shall be held at a reasonable time and in a manner or place reasonably accessible to and usable by all participants, including persons with disabilities.
(3) Presentation materials and readable maps should be provided to all meeting participants as appropriate.
(4) Interested persons shall be permitted to attend, appear before, or file statements with any RAB, subject to such reasonable rules or regulations as may be prescribed. Open solicitation of public comments shall be permitted and members of the public will have a designated time on the agenda to speak to the RAB committee as a whole.
(b)
Nature of discussions.
The installation shall give careful consideration to all comments provided by individual RAB members. Group consensus is not a prerequisite for RAB input. Each member of the RAB may provide advice as an individual; however, when a RAB decides to vote or poll for consensus, only community members should participate.
(c)
Meeting minutes.
The installation co-chair, in coordination with the community co-chair, shall prepare the minutes of each RAB meeting.
(1) The RAB meeting minutes shall contain a record of the persons present; a complete and accurate description of matters discussed and comments received; and copies of all reports received, issued, or approved by the RAB. The accuracy of all minutes shall be certified by the RAB co-chairs. RAB minutes should be kept in the information repository; however, if the RAB minutes reflect decision-making, copies should also be documented in the Administrative Record.
(2) The records, reports, minutes, appendixes, working papers, drafts, studies, agenda, or other documents that were made available to or prepared for or by each RAB shall be available for public inspection and copying at a publicly accessible location, such as the information repositories established under the installation's Community Relations Plan, a public library, or in the offices of the installation to which the RAB reports, until the RAB ceases to exist.
[71 FR 27617, May 12, 2006; 71 FR 30719, May 30, 2006]

(iv) The RAB has achieved the desired end goal as defined in the RAB Operating Procedures,
(v) There is no longer sufficient, sustained community interest, as documented by the installation with RAB community members and community-at-large input, to sustain the RAB. The installation shall continue to monitor for any changes in community interest that could warrant reactivating or reestablishing the RAB, or
(vi) The installation has been transferred out of DoD control and day-to-day responsibility for making restoration response decisions has been assumed by the transferee.
(2)
Adjournment procedures.
If the Installation Commander is considering adjourning the RAB, the Installation Commander shall:
(i) Consult with EPA, state, tribes, RAB members, and the local community, as appropriate, regarding adjourning the RAB and consider all responses before making a final decision.
(ii) Document the rationale for adjournment in a memorandum in a memorandum for inclusion in the Administrative Record, notify the public of the decision through written notice to the RAB members and through publication of a notice in a local newspaper of general circulation, and describe other ongoing public involvement opportunities that are available if the Installation Commander decides to adjourn the RAB.
(b)
RAB dissolution
—(1)
Requirements for RAB dissolution.
An Installation Commander may recommend dissolution of a RAB when a RAB is no longer fulfilling the intended purpose of advising and providing community input to an Installation Commander and decision makers on environmental restoration projects as described in § 202.1(b).
(2)
Dissolution procedures.
If the Installation Commander is considering dissolving the RAB, the Installation Commander shall:
(i) Consult with EPA, state, tribal and local government representatives, as appropriate, regarding dissolving the RAB.
(ii) Notify the RAB community co-chair and members in writing of the intent to dissolve the RAB and the reasons for doing so and provide the RAB members 30 days to respond in writing. The Installation Commander shall consider RAB member responses, and in consultation with EPA, state, tribal and local government representatives, as appropriate, determine the appropriate actions.
(iii) Notify the public of the proposal to dissolve the RAB and provide a 30-day public comment period on the proposal, if the Installation Commander decides to proceed with dissolution. At the conclusion of the public comment period, the Installation Commander will review the public comments, consult with EPA, state, tribal and local government representatives, as appropriate, and, if the Installation Commander still believes dissolution is appropriate, render a recommendation to that effect.
(iv) Send the recommendation, responsiveness summary, and all supporting documentation via the chain-of-command to the Military Component's Environmental Deputy Assistant Secretary (or equivalent) for approval or disapproval. The Military Component's Environmental Deputy Assistant Secretary (or equivalent) shall notify the Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Installations
Environment) (or equivalent) of the decision to approve or disapprove the request to dissolve the RAB and the rationale for that decision.
(v) Document the recommendation, responsiveness summary, and the rationale for dissolution in a memorandum for inclusion in the Administrative Record, notify the public of the decision through written notice to the RAB members and through publication of a notice in a local newspaper of general circulation and describe other ongoing public involvement opportunities that are available, once the Military Component's Environmental Deputy Assistant Secretary (or equivalent) makes a final decision.
(c)
Reestablishing an adjourned or dissolved RAB.
An Installation Commander may reestablish an adjourned or dissolved RAB if there is sufficient and sustained community interest in doing so, and there are environmental restoration activities still ongoing at the installation or that may start up again. Where a RAB is adjourned or dissolved and environmental restoration activities continue, the Installation Commander should reassess community interest at least every 24 months. When all environmental restoration decisions have been made and required remedies are in place and are properly operating at an installation, reassessment of the community interest for reestablishing the RAB is not necessary. When additional environmental restoration decisions have to be made resulting from subsequent actions, such as long-term management and five-year reviews, the installation will reassess community interest for reestablishing the RAB. Where the reassessment finds sufficient and sustained community interest at previously adjourned or dissolved RABs, the Installation Commander should reestablish a RAB. Where the reassessment does not find sufficient and sustained community interest in reestablishing the RAB, the Installation Commander shall document in a memorandum for the record the procedures followed in the reassessment and the findings of the reassessment. This document shall be included in the Administrative Record for the installation. If there is interest in reestablishment at a previously dissolved RAB, but the Installation Commander determines that the same conditions exist that required the original dissolution, he or she will request, through the chain-of-command to the Military Component's Deputy Assistant Secretary, an exception to reestablishing the RAB. If those conditions no longer exist at a previously dissolved RAB, and there is sufficient and sustained interest in reestablishment, the Installation Commander should recommend to the Deputy Assistant Secretary that the RAB be reestablished. The Deputy Assistant Secretary will take the Installation Commander's recommendation under advisement and may approve that RAB for reestablishment.
(d)
Public comment.
If the Installation Commander intends to recommend dissolution of a RAB or reestablish a dissolved RAB, the Installation Commander shall notify the public of the proposal to dissolve or reestablish the RAB and provide a 30-day public comment period on the proposal. At the conclusion of the public comment period, the Installation Commander shall review public comments; consult with EPA and state, tribal, or local government representatives, as appropriate; prepare a responsiveness summary; and render a recommendation. The recommendation, responsiveness summary, and all supporting documentation should be sent via the chain-of-command to the Military Component's Environmental Deputy Assistant Secretary (or equivalent) for approval or disapproval. The Installation Commander shall notify the public of the decision.
§ 202.11
Documenting RAB activities.
(a) The installation shall document information on the activities of a RAB in the Information Repository. These activities shall include, but are not limited to:
(1) Installation's efforts to survey community interest in forming a RAB,
(2) Steps taken to establish a RAB where there is sufficient and sustained community interest,
(3) How the RAB relates to the overall community involvement program, and
(4) Steps taken to adjourn, dissolve, or reestablish the RAB.
(b) When RAB input has been used in decision-making, it should be documented as part of the Administrative Record.

§ 203.1
Authority.
Part 203 is issued under the authority of section 2705 of Title 10, United States Code. In 1994, Congress authorized the Department of Defense (DoD) to develop a program to facilitate public participation by providing technical assistance to local community members of Restoration Advisory Boards (RABs) and Technical Review Committees (TRCs) (section 326 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1995, Pub.L. 103-337). In 1996, Congress revised this authority (section 324 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996, Pub.L. 104-112). It is pursuant to this revised authority, which is codified as new subsection (3) of section 2705, that the Department of Defense issues this part.
§ 203.2
Purpose and availability of referenced material.
(a) This part establishes the Technical Assistance for Public Participation (TAPP) program for the Department of Defense. It sets forth policies and procedures for providing technical assistance to community members of TRCs and RABs established at DoD installations in the United States and its territories. This part sets forth the procedures for the Department of Defense to accept and evaluate TAPP applications, to procure the assistance desired by community members of RABs and TRCs, and to manage the TAPP program. These provisions are applicable to all applicants/recipients of technical assistance as discussed in § 203.4 of this part.
(b) Any reference to documents made in this part necessary to apply for TAPP (e.g., the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circulars or DoD forms) are available through the DoD installations, the military department headquarters, or from the Department of Defense, Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Environmental Security (DUSD(ES)), 3400 Defense Pentagon, Washington, DC 20301-3400.

Technical assistance does not include those activities prohibited under Section 203.11 of this part, such as litigation or underwriting legal actions; political activity; generation of new primary data such as well drilling and testing, including split sampling; reopening final DoD decisions or conducting disputes with the Department of Defense; or epidemiological or health studies, such as blood or urine testing.
Technical Review Committee (TRC).
A group comprised of the Department of Defense, EPA, State, and local authorities and a public representative of the community formed to meet the requirements of 10 U.S.C. 2705(c), the Department of Defense Environmental Restoration Program. Primarily functioning to review installation restoration documents, these committees are being expanded and modified at installations where interest or need necessitates the creation of a RAB.
§ 203.4
Major components of the TAPP process.
(a) The Department of Defense will issue purchase orders to technical assistance, facilitation, training, and other public participation assistance providers subject to the purchase limit per order as resources continue to be available. If multiple purchase orders are needed to assist community members of a particular RAB or TRC, the combined sum of these purchase orders cannot exceed $100,000 or, during any one year, the lesser of $25,000 or 1 percent of the installation's total projected environmental restoration cost-to-complete. Note that these limitations refer to the maximum allowable technical assistance funding per RAB/TRC. Resources available within a given year may vary. These limitations apply unless a waiver is granted by the DoD Component Secretary or equivalent for the installation in question. The $100,000 total and $25,000 annual limitations may be waived, as appropriate, to reflect the complexity of response action, the nature and extent of contamination at the installation, the level of activity at the installation, projected total needs as identified by the TAPP recipient, the size and diversity of the affected population, and the ability of the TAPP recipient to identify and raise funds from other sources.
(b) Community members of the RAB/TRC will provide a description of the services requested (TAPP Project Description) and, if desired, the names of one or more proposed technical assistance providers to the DoD RAB Co-Chair, who will ensure the application is submitted to the installation commander or other designated authority and to the appropriate DoD contracting office. Technical assistance providers proposed by the community members of a RAB or TRC at each DoD installation that meets the minimum set of organizational qualifications guidelines provided by the Department of Defense in § 203.12 of this part will be added to the governments list of bidders for the proposed procurement.
§ 203.5
TAPP process.
This section provides an overview of the TAPP process. Specific details referred to in this section can be found in subsequent sections of this part.
(a)
TAPP funding.
Funding for this TAPP program will come from the Environmental Restoration Accounts established for Army, Navy, and Air Force for operational installations. The funding for Defense Agencies' operating installations will be from the Defense-Wide Environmental Restoration Account. Funding will be from the component's base closure account for transferring or closing installations. Funding for Formerly Used Defense Sites will come from the Environmental Restoration Account established for Formerly Used Defense Sites. After justification of the TAPP proposal, each DoD Component will make funds available from their individual installation's environmental restoration or BRAC accounts, considering a number of factors related to the restoration program at the installation and its impact upon the community. These factors include, but are not limited to:
(1) Closure status.
(2) Budget.
(3) Installation restoration program status.
(4) Presence (or absence) of alternate funding.
(5) Relative risk posed by sites at the installation.
(6) Type of task to be funded.
(7) Community concern.
(8) Available funding.
(b)
Identification of proposed TAPP project.
Eligible applicants of RABs and TRCs, established in § 203.7 of this part, should determine whether a TAPP project is required to assist the community members of the RAB or TRC to interpret information regarding the nature and extent of contamination or the proposed remedial actions. Eligibility requirements for TAPP projects are described in §§ 203.10 and 203.11 of this part. In keeping with the requirements of 10 U.S.C. 2705(e), the RAB or TRC must be able to demonstrate that the technical expertise necessary for the proposed TAPP project is not available through the Federal, State, or local agencies responsible for overseeing environmental restoration at the installation, or that the selection of an independent provider will contribute to environmental restoration activities and the community acceptance of such activities. In addition, the Department of Defense encourages the RAB or TRC to seek other available sources of assistance prior to submitting a request for TAPP in order to preserve limited resources. These sources include DoD's installation restoration contractor, or other DoD contractors or personnel, EPA or state regulatory personnel, volunteer services from local universities or other experts, or assistance from state and local health and environmental organizations.
(c)
TAPP project request.
The RAB or TRC should notify the installation of its intent to pursue TAPP upon the determination that other sources of assistance are unavailable or unlikely to contribute to the community acceptance of environmental restoration activities at the installation and should prepare a formal request specifying the type of assistance required and, if desired, one or more sources for this assistance. Details concerning this request are stated in § 203.9 of this part. The RAB or TRC must certify to the Department of Defense that the TAPP request represents a request by a majority of the community members of the RAB or TRC. The RAB or TRC should ensure that the request meets the eligibility requirements specified in §§ 203.10 and 203.11 of this part. Furthermore, the RAB or TRC may outline additional criteria for the Department of Defense to consider in the selection of a provider (such as knowledge of local environmental conditions or specific technical issues, a prior work history within the study area which has relevant specific circumstances or unique challenges, or other relevant expertise or capabilities), keeping in mind that providers must meet the minimum technical qualifications outlined in § 203.12 of this part. The formal request should be submitted to the installation commander or designated decision authority, either directly, or through the DoD RAB Co-chair. The installation commander, or other designated decision authority, will review
the proposed project to determine whether the proposed project conforms to the eligibility requirements. If the installation commander, or other designated authority, fails to approve the project request, the rationale for that decision will be provided to the RAB/TRC in writing.
(d)
Purchase orders.
Upon receipt of a completed TAPP request, the installation will begin the procurement process necessary to obtain the desired services by means of a purchase order or will forward the request to the contracting authority designated by the DoD Component to act for that installation. The government is required to follow the rules and regulations for purchase orders as outlined in the FAR (48 CFR part 13). As a result, the government cannot direct awards to a specified supplier unless the procurement is under $2,500, and then only if the cost is comparable to other suppliers. For procurements over $2,500 but under $100,000, the acquisition is reserved for small businesses, unless there is a reasonable expectation that small businesses could not provide the best scientific and technological sources consistent with the demands of the proposed acquisition for the best mix of cost, performance, and schedules. Furthermore, the award must be on a competitive basis. In addition to proposing potential providers, the application for technical assistance may indicate specific criteria or qualifications that are deemed necessary by the RAB/TRC for the completion of the project to their satisfaction. This information will be used to assist the Department of Defense in preparing a bidders list. The Department of Defense will solicit bids from those providers meeting the criteria and will select a provider offering the best value to the government. Should the procurement process identify a qualified respondent other than the proposed provider(s) identified by the RAB/TRC or fail to identify any qualified respondents, the RAB/TRC will be consulted prior to the award of a purchase order. If the Department of Defense determines that the TAPP request represents an eligible project for which no funds are available, it will ask the RAB or TRC to specify whether the project should be reconsidered upon the availability of additional funds.
(e)
Reporting requirements.
The applicant must assure that copies of delivered reports are made available to the Department of Defense and must comply with the reporting requirements established in § 203.14 of this part.
§ 203.6
Cost principles.
(a) Non-profit contractors must comply with the cost principles in OMB Circular A-122. Copies of the circular may be obtained from EOP Publications, 725 17th NW, NEOB, Washington, DC 20503.
(b) For-profit contractors and subcontractors must comply with the cost principles in the FAR (48 CFR part 31).
§ 203.7
Eligible applicants.
Eligible applicants are community members of RABs or TRCs. Furthermore, the RABs or TRCs must be comprised of at least three community members to ensure community interests are broadly represented. The applicant must certify that the request represents the wishes of a simple majority of the community members of the RAB or TRC. Certification includes, but is not limited to, the results of a roll call vote of community members of the RAB or TRC documented in the meeting minutes. Other requirements of the application are detailed in § 203.9 of this part.
§ 203.8
Evaluation criteria.
The Department of Defense will begin the TAPP procurement process only after it has determined that all eligibility and responsibility requirements listed in §§ 203.6, 203.7, and 203.9 of this part are met, and after review of the specific provider qualifications as submitted in the narrative section of the application. In addition, the proposed TAPP project must meet the eligibility criteria as specified in §§ 203.10 and 203.11 of this part. Projects that fail to meet those requirements relating to the relevance of the proposed project to the restoration activities at the installation will not be approved.
§ 203.9
Submission of application.
The applicant must submit a TAPP application to begin the TAPP procurement process. The application form is included as appendix A of this part and can be obtained from the DoD installation, the DoD Component headquarters, or directly from the Department of Defense, Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Environmental Security, 3400 Defense Pentagon, Washington, D.C. 20301-3400. The applications will not be considered complete until the following data elements have been entered into the form:
(a) Installation.
(b) Source of TAPP request (names of RAB or TRC).
(c) Certification of majority request.
(d) RAB/TRC contact point for TAPP project.
(e) Project title.
(f) Project type (e.g. data interpretation, training, etc.).
(g) Project purpose and description (descriptions, time and locations of products or services desired).
(h) Statement of eligibility of project.
(i) Proposed provider, if known.
(j) Specific qualifications or criteria for provider.
§ 203.10
Eligible activities.
(a) TAPP procurements should be pursued by the RAB or TRC only to the extent that Federal, State, or local agencies responsible for overseeing environmental restoration at the facility do not have the necessary technical expertise for the proposed project, or the proposed technical assistance will contribute to the efficiency, effectiveness, or timeliness of environmental restoration activities at the installation and is likely to contribute to community acceptance of those activities.
(b) TAPP procurements may be used to fund activities that will contribute to the public's ability to provide advice to decision-makers by improving the public's understanding of overall conditions and activities. Categories of eligible activities include the following:
(1)

Examples of such criteria could include prior work in the area, knowledge of local environmental conditions or laws, specific technical capabilities, or other relevant expertise.
§ 203.13
Procurement.
Procurements will be conducted as purchase orders in accordance with the FAR (48 CFR part 13). Under these procedures, procurements not exceeding $100,000 are reserved exclusively for small businesses, and will be conducted as competitive procurements. Procurements below a value of $2,500 are considered “micro-purchases.” These procurements do not require the solicitation of bids and may be conducted at the discretion of the contracting officer.
§ 203.14
RAB/TRC reporting requirements.
The community point of contact of the RAB or TRC must submit a report, to be provided to the installation and to DUSD(ES), to enable the Department of Defense to meet DoD reporting requirements to Congress. This report should include a description of the TAPP project, a summary of services and products obtained, and a statement regarding the overall satisfaction of the community member of the RAB or TRC with the quality of service and/or products received.
§ 203.15
Method of payment.
The SAP set forth in FAR (48 CFR part 13) require purchase orders to be conducted on a firm-fixed-price basis, unless otherwise authorized by agency procedures. The Department of Defense anticipates all TAPP awards to be firm-fixed-price procurements.
§ 203.16
Record retention and audits.
The recipient technical assistance providers shall keep and preserve detailed records in connection with the contract reflecting acquisitions, work progress, reports, expenditures and commitments, and indicate the relationship to established costs and schedules.
§ 203.17
Technical assistance provider reporting requirements.
Each technical assistance provider shall submit progress reports, financial status reports, materials prepared for the RAB/TRC, and a final report to the DoD installation for the TAPP project as specified by the specific purchase order agreement. The final report shall document TAPP project activities over the entire period of support and shall describe the achievements with respect to stated TAPP project purposes and objectives.
§ 203.18
Conflict of interest and disclosure requirements.
The Department of Defense shall require each prospective assistance provider on any contract to provide, with its bid or proposal:
(a) Information on its financial and business relationship with the installation, RAB/TRC members, or any/all potentially responsible parties (PRPs) at the site, and with their parent companies, subsidiaries, affiliates, subcontractors, contractors, and current clients or attorneys and agents. This disclosure requirement encompasses past and anticipated financial and business relationships, including services related to any proposed or pending litigation, with such parties.
(b) Certification that, to the best of its knowledge and belief, it has disclosed such information or no such information exists.
(c) A statement that it shall disclose immediately any such information discovered after submission of its bid or after award. The contracting officer shall evaluate such information and shall exclude any prospective contractor if the contracting officer determines the prospective contractor has a potential conflict of interest that is both significant and cannot be avoided or otherwise resolved. If, after award, the contracting officer determines that a conflict of interest exists that is both significant and cannot be avoided or resolved, the contract will be terminated for cause.
(d) Contractors and subcontractors may not be technical assistance providers to community members of RABs/TRCs at an installation where they are performing cleanup activities for the Federal or State government or any other entity.
§ 203.19
Appeals process.
DoD Components will establish an appeals process to settle potential disputes between the Department of Defense and the public regarding certain decisions arising out of the TAPP process. The Department of Defense recognizes that the RAB/TRC may disagree with the findings of the installation commander that a proposed TAPP project is ineligible, either because of the availability of alternate sources of assistance or because the project does not meet the eligibility criteria established in this part. It is in the best interests of the Department of Defense and the community members of RABs and TRCs to anticipate and avoid disputes and to work cooperatively to resolve potential differences of opinion. However, in certain circumstances, the RAB/TRC community members may feel that their needs were not adequately served by the decisions of the Department of Defense. In this instance, the hierarchical structure and chain-of-command within each DoD Component will serve as the avenue for appeal. Appeals will be considered within the chain-of-command, and, in general, will be resolved at the lowest level possible. The highest level of appeal will be at the DoD Component Deputy Assistant Secretary level with authority over the DERP and BRAC environmental programs. Inherently governmental functions, such as the procurement process governed by the FAR, are not subject to appeal.

Procedures and requirements applicable to NSEP aard recipients
—(1)
NSEP service agreement.
Award recipients of any scholarship, fellowship, or EHLS award through this program must comply with the terms of the NSEP service agreement they signed. NSEP awards entered into before the date of this part will be governed by the laws, regulations, and policies in effect at the time that the award was made. The NSEP service agreement for recipients awarded as of the date of this part will:
(i) In accordance with 50 U.S.C. 1902(b) outlines requirements for NSEP award recipients to fulfill their federal service requirement through work in positions that contribute to the national security of the United States. An emphasis is placed on work within one of four organizations: DoD, any element of the Intelligence Community, DHS, or DOS. On a case-by-case basis, NSEP may consider employment with a federal contractor of one of these four priority organizations as meeting the service requirement should the award recipient provide adequate documentary evidence that the salary for the position is funded by the U.S. Government.
(ii) Stipulate that absent the availability of a suitable position in the four priority organizations or a contractor thereof, award recipients may satisfy the service requirement by serving in any federal agency or office in a position with national security responsibilities. It will also stipulate that absent the availability of a suitable position in DoD, any element of the Intelligence Community, DHS, DOS, a contractor thereof, or any federal agency with national security responsibilities, award recipients may satisfy the service requirement by working in the field of education in a discipline related to the study supported by the program if the recipient satisfactorily demonstrates to the Secretary of Defense through the Director, NSEP, that no position is available in the departments, agencies, and offices covered by paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.
(2)
Implementation.
The NSEP service agreement will be implemented as follows:
(i) Prior to receiving assistance, the award recipient must sign an NSEP service agreement. The award recipient will submit to the NSEP Administrative Agent, in advance of program of study start date, any proposed changes to the approved award program (
i.e.,
course and schedule changes, withdrawals, course or program incompletions, unanticipated or increased costs).
(ii) The minimum length of service requirement for undergraduate scholarship, graduate fellowship, and EHLS award recipients is one year. The duration of the service requirement for graduate fellowship award recipients is equal to the duration of assistance provided by NSEP.
(iii) In accordance with 50 U.S.C. 1902(b), undergraduate scholarship students must begin fulfilling the NSEP service agreement within three years of completion or termination of their undergraduate degree program.
(iv) In accordance with 50 U.S.C. 1902(b), graduate fellowship students must begin fulfilling the NSEP service agreement within two years of completion or termination of their graduate degree program.
(v) In accordance with 50 U.S.C. 1902(b), EHLS award recipients must begin fulfilling the service requirement within three years of completion of their program.
(vi) The award recipient must accept a reasonable offer of employment, as defined by the Director, NSEP, or his or her designee, in accordance with the NSEP service agreement, at a salary deemed by the hiring organization as commensurate with the award recipient's education level, and consistent with the terms and conditions of the NSEP service agreement.
(vii) The award recipient will annually submit a DD Form 2753 to NSEP until all NSEP service agreement requirements are satisfied. The DD Form 2753 must be received and reviewed by the NSEP Service Approval Committee. The receipt of a completed DD Form 2753 will be acknowledged through official correspondence from NSEP. Award recipients who do not submit the DD Form 2753 as required will be notified by NSEP of the intent to pursue collection action.
(viii) If the award recipient fails to maintain satisfactory academic progress for any term in which assistance is provided, probationary measures of the host institution will apply to the award recipient. Failure to meet the institution's requirements to resume satisfactory academic progress within the prescribed guidelines of the institution will result in the termination of assistance to the award recipient.
(ix) Extenuating circumstances, such as illness of the award recipient or a close relative, death of a close relative, or an interruption of study caused by the host institution, may be considered acceptable reasons for non-satisfactory academic progress. The award recipient must notify the NSEP Administrative Agent of any extenuating circumstances within 10 business days of occurrence. The NSEP Administrative Agent will review these requests to determine what course of action is appropriate and make a recommendation to NSEP for final determination. The DASD(FE
T) will upon receipt of the NSEP Administrative Agent recommendation, determine by what conditions to terminate or reinstate the award to the award recipient.
(x) NSEP award recipients may apply to the DASD(FE
T) for a deferral of the NSEP service agreement requirement if pursuing qualified further education.
(xi) NSEP award recipients may apply to the DASD(FE
T), to receive an extension of the NSEP service agreement requirement if actively seeking to fulfill the NSEP service agreement in a well-documented manner.
(xii) In extraordinary circumstances an NSEP award recipient may request a waiver to be relieved of responsibilities associated with the NSEP service agreement. Conditions for requesting a waiver to the NSEP service agreement may include:
(A) Situations in which compliance is either impossible or would involve extreme hardship to the award recipient.
(B) Interruptions in service due to temporary physical or medical disability or other causes beyond the award recipient's control.
(C) Unreasonable delays in the hiring process not caused by the award recipient, including delays in obtaining a security clearance if required for employment.

(E) Permanent physical or medical disability that prevent the award recipient from fulfilling the obligation.
(F) Inability to complete the NSEP service agreement due to terminations or interruptions of work beyond the award recipient's control.
(G) Death of the award recipient.
(xiii) In cases where assistance to the award recipient is terminated, the amount owed to the U.S. Government is equal to the support received from NSEP. Repayment to the U.S. Treasury must be made within a period not to exceed six months from expiration of the service deadline. Noncompliance with repayment requirements will result in the initiation of standard U.S.
Government collection procedures to obtain payment for overdue indebtedness, unless a waiver is specifically granted by the DASD(FE
T). Further job search assistance to an award recipient will be denied if any outstanding debt remains unpaid as a result of an award termination.
(A) Repayment to the U.S. Treasury for the amount of assistance provided becomes due, either in whole or in part, if the award recipient fails to fulfill the NSEP service agreement. Award recipients who do not submit the SAR as required will be notified by NSEP of the intent to pursue collection action. Noncompliance with repayment requirements will result in the initiation of standard U.S. Government collection procedures to obtain payment for overdue indebtedness, unless a waiver is specifically granted by the DASD(FE
T).
(B) Repayment recovery procedures will include one or a combination of the following:
(
1
) Voluntary repayment schedule arranged between the award recipient and the administrative agent.
(
2
) Deduction from accrued pay, compensation, amount of retirement credit, or any other amount due the employee from the U.S. Government.
(
3
) Such other methods as are provided by law for recovery of amounts owed to the U.S. Government.

# Subpart C—Project Evaluation Procedures
§ 211.6
Initiating a formal DoD review of a proposed project.
(a) A formal review of a proposed project begins with the receipt from the Secretary of Transportation by the Clearinghouse of a proper application filed with the Secretary of Transportation pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 44718.
(1) The Clearinghouse will convey the application as received to those DoD Components it believes may have an interest in reviewing the application.
(2) The DoD Components that receive the application shall provide their comments and recommendations on the application to the Clearinghouse no later than 20 days after they receive the application.
(3) Not later than 30 days after receiving the application from the Secretary of Transportation, the Clearinghouse shall evaluate all comments and recommendations received and take one of three actions:
(i) Determine that the proposed project will not have an adverse impact on military operations and readiness, in which case it shall notify the Secretary of Transportation of such determination.
(ii) Determine that the proposed project will have an adverse impact on military operations and readiness but that the adverse impact involved is sufficiently attenuated that it does not require mitigation. When the Clearinghouse makes such a determination, it shall notify the Secretary of Transportation of such determination.
(iii) Determine that the proposed project may have an adverse impact on military operations and readiness. When the Clearinghouse makes such a determination it shall immediately—
(A) Notify the applicant of the determination of the Clearinghouse and offer to discuss mitigation with the applicant to reduce the adverse impact;
(B) Designate one or more DoD Components to engage in discussions with
the applicant to attempt to mitigate the adverse impact;
(C) Notify the Secretary of Transportation that the Department of Defense has determined that the proposed project may have an adverse impact on military operations and readiness, and, if the cause of the adverse impact is due to the proposed project exceeding an obstruction standard set forth in subpart C of part 77 of title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations, identify the specific standard and how it would be exceeded; and
(D) Notify the Secretary of Transportation and the Secretary of Homeland Security that the Clearinghouse has offered to engage in mitigation discussions with the applicant.
(4) The applicant must provide to the Clearinghouse its agreement to discuss the possibility of mitigation within five days of receipt of the notification from the Clearinghouse.
(b) If the applicant agrees to enter into discussions with the DoD to seek to mitigate an adverse impact, the designated DoD Components shall engage in discussions with the applicant to attempt to reach agreement on measures that would mitigate the adverse impact of the proposed project on military operations and readiness. The Clearinghouse shall invite the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration and the Secretary of Homeland Security to participate in such discussions. The Clearinghouse may also invite other Federal agencies to participate in such discussions.
(1) Such discussions shall not extend more than 90 days beyond the initial notification to the applicant, unless both the designated DoD Components and the applicant agree, in writing, to an extension of a specific period of time.
(i) If agreement between the applicant and the designated DoD Components has not been reached on mitigation measures by that time and no extension has been mutually agreed to, the designated DoD Components shall notify the Clearinghouse of the results of the discussions and the analysis and recommendations of the Components with regard to the proposed project as it is proposed after discussions.
(ii) If agreement between the applicant and the designated DoD Components has been reached on mitigation measures that remove the adverse impact of the proposed project on military operations and readiness, the DoD Components shall notify the Clearinghouse of the agreement. If the mitigation measures entail modification to the proposed project, the applicant shall notify the Secretary of Transportation of such agreement and amend its application accordingly.
(2) If the applicant and the designated DoD Components are unable to reach agreement on mitigation, the Clearinghouse shall review the analysis and recommendations of the DoD Components and determine if the proposed project as it may have been modified by the applicant after discussions would result in an unacceptable risk to the national security of the United States.
(i) If the Clearinghouse determines that the proposed project as it may have been modified by the applicant after discussions would result in an unacceptable risk to the national security of the United States, it shall make a recommendation to the senior official to that effect. If the Clearinghouse determines, contrary to the recommendations of the DoD Components, that the proposed project as it may have been modified by the applicant after discussions would not result in an unacceptable risk to the national security of the United States, it shall make a recommendation to the senior official to that effect.
(ii) If the senior official concurs with the recommendation of the Clearinghouse, the senior official shall make a recommendation to the senior officer that is consistent with the recommendation of the Clearinghouse. If the senior official does not agree with the recommendation of the Clearinghouse, the senior official may make a recommendation to the senior officer to that effect.
(iii) The senior officer shall consider the recommendation of the senior official, and, after giving full consideration to mitigation actions available to the DoD and those agreed to by the applicant, determine whether the proposed project as it may have been
modified by the applicant would result in an unacceptable risk to the national security of the United States. If the senior officer makes such a determination, the senior officer shall convey that determination to the Secretary of Transportation, identifying which of the three criteria in § 211.3 creates the unacceptable risk to the national security of the United States.
(iv) Any mitigation discussions engaged in by the Department of Defense pursuant to this part shall not be binding upon any other Federal agency, nor waive required compliance with any other law or regulation.
(c) If the applicant does not agree to enter into discussions with the DoD to seek to mitigate an adverse impact, the Clearinghouse shall review the analysis and recommendations of the designated DoD Components and determine if the proposed project would result in an unacceptable risk to the national security of the United States.
(1) If the Clearinghouse determines that the proposed project would result in an unacceptable risk to the national security of the United States, it shall make a recommendation to the senior official to that effect. If the Clearinghouse determines, contrary to the recommendations of the DoD Components, that the proposed project would not result in an unacceptable risk to the national security of the United States, it shall make a recommendation to the senior official to that effect.
(2) If the senior official concurs with the recommendation of the Clearinghouse, the senior official shall make a recommendation to the senior officer that is consistent with the recommendation of the Clearinghouse. If the senior official does not agree with the recommendation of the Clearinghouse, the senior official may make a recommendation to the senior officer to that effect.
(3) The senior officer shall consider the recommendation of the senior official, and, after giving full consideration to mitigation actions available to the DoD and those agreed to by the applicant, determine whether the proposed project would result in an unacceptable risk to the national security of the United States. If the senior officer makes such a determination, the senior officer shall convey that determination to the Secretary of Transportation, identifying which of the three criteria in § 211.3 creates the unacceptable risk to the national security of the United States.
(d) The Clearinghouse may, on behalf of itself, the senior official, or the senior officer, seek an extension of time from the Secretary of Transportation for consideration of the application.
§ 211.7
Initiating an informal DoD review of a proposed project.
(a) An informal review of a project begins with the receipt from a requester by the Clearinghouse of a request for an informal review. In seeking an informal review, the requester shall provide the following information to the Clearinghouse:
(1) The geographic location of the project including its latitude and longitude,
(2) The height of the project,
(3) The nature of the project.
(4) The requester is encouraged to provide as much additional information as is available. The more information provided by the requester, the greater will be the accuracy and reliability of the resulting DoD review. When a request for an informal review includes information that is proprietary or competition sensitive, requesters are encouraged to mark the documents they submit accordingly.
(b) The Clearinghouse shall, within five days of receiving the information provided by the requester, convey that information to those DoD Components it believes may have an interest in reviewing the request.
(1) The DoD Components that receive the request from the Clearinghouse shall provide their comments and recommendations on the request to the Clearinghouse no later than 30 days after they receive the request.
(2) Not later than 50 days after receiving the request from the requester, the Clearinghouse shall evaluate all comments and recommendations received and take one of three actions:
(i) Determine that the project will not have an adverse impact on military operations and readiness, in which case
it shall notify the requester of such determination. In doing so, the Clearinghouse shall also advise the requester that the informal review by the DoD does not constitute an action under 49 U.S.C. 44718 and that neither the DoD nor the Secretary of Transportation are bound by the determination made under the informal review.
(ii) Determine that the project will have an adverse impact on military operations and readiness but that the adverse impact involved is sufficiently attenuated that it does not require mitigation. The Clearinghouse shall notify the requester of such determination. In doing so, the Clearinghouse shall also advise the requester that the informal review by the DoD does not constitute an action under 49 U.S.C. 44718 and that neither the DoD nor the Secretary of Transportation are bound by the determination made under the informal review.
(iii) Determine that the project will have an adverse impact on military operations and readiness.
(A) When the requester is the project proponent, the Clearinghouse shall immediately—
(
1
) Notify the requester of the determination and the reasons for the conclusion of the Clearinghouse and advise the requester that the DoD would like to discuss the possibility of mitigation to reduce any adverse impact; and
(
2
) Designate one or more DoD Components to engage in discussions with the requester to attempt to mitigate the adverse impact.
(B) When the requester is a State, Indian tribal, or local official or a landowner, notify the requester of the determination and the reasons for that conclusion.
(c) If the requester is the project proponent and agrees to enter into discussions with the DoD to seek to mitigate an adverse impact, the designated DoD Components shall engage in discussions with the requester in an attempt to reach agreement on measures that would mitigate the adverse impact of the project on military operations and readiness.
§ 211.8
Inquiries received by DoD Components.
(a) An inquiry received by a DoD Component other than the Clearinghouse relating to an application filed with the Secretary of Transportation pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 44718 shall be forwarded to the Clearinghouse by the DoD Component except when that DoD Component has been designated by the Clearinghouse to engage in discussions with the entity making the inquiry.
(b) A request for informal DoD review or any other inquiry related to matters covered by this part and received by a DoD Component other than the Clearinghouse shall be forwarded to the Clearinghouse by that Component except when that DoD Component has been designated by the Clearinghouse to engage in discussions with the entity making the request.
§ 211.9
Mitigation options.
(a) In discussing mitigation to avoid an unacceptable risk to the national security of the United States, the DoD Components designated to discuss mitigation with an applicant or requester shall, as appropriate and as time allows, analyze the following types of DoD mitigation to determine if they identify feasible and affordable actions that may be taken to mitigate adverse impacts of projects on military operations and readiness:
(1) Modifications to military operations.
(2) Modifications to radars or other items of military equipment.
(3) Modifications to military test and evaluation activities, military training routes, or military training procedures.
(4) Providing upgrades or modifications to existing systems or procedures.
(5) The acquisition of new systems by the DoD and other departments and agencies of the Federal Government.
(b) In discussing mitigation to avoid an unacceptable risk to the national security of the United States, the applicant or requester, as the case may be, should consider the following possible actions:

§ 212.3
Definitions.
DoD installation:
As used in this instruction, a base, camp, post, station, yard, center, homeport facility for any ship, or other activity under the jurisdiction of the Department of Defense, including any leased facility or, in the case of an activity in a foreign country, under the operational control of the Department of Defense. This term does not include any facility used primarily for civil works, rivers and harbor projects, or flood control projects.
Non-Federal entities.
A self-sustaining organization, incorporated or unincorporated, that is not an agency or instrumentality of the Federal government. This part addresses only those entities that operate on DoD installations with the express consent of the installation commander or higher authority. Membership of these organizations consists of individuals acting exclusively outside the scope of any official capacity as officers, employees, or agents of the Federal Government. Non-Federal entities include a State, interstate, Indian tribal, or local government, as well as private organizations.
United States.
As used in this part, the 50 States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, Johnston Atoll, Kingman Reef, Midway Island, Nassau Island, Palmyra Island, Wake Island, and any other territory or possession of the United States, and associated navigable waters, including the territorial seas.
§ 212.4
Policy.
It is DoD policy, consistent with 32 CFR part 213, that procedures be established for the operation of non-Federal entities on DoD installations to prevent official sanction, endorsement, or support by the DoD Components except as authorized in DoD 5500.7-R and applicable law. The Department recognizes that non-Federal entity support of Service members and their families can be important to their welfare. Non-Federal entities are not entitled to sovereign immunity and privileges accorded to Federal agencies and instrumentalities. The DoD Components shall take action to preclude unauthorized expenditures of appropriated funds, commissary surcharge, or nonappropriated funds (NAF) in support of these organizations.
§ 212.5
Responsibilities.
(a) The Principal Deputy Under Secretary for Personnel and Readiness, under the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness and in coordination with the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Installations and Environment and subject to DoD Directive 4165.6, shall be responsible for implementing policy and oversight of non-Federal entities on DoD installations.
(b) The Heads of the DoD Components shall:
(1) Implement this part.
(2) Be aware of all non-Federal entities operating on installations under their jurisdiction.
(3) Conduct reviews to ensure installation commanders periodically review facilities, programs, and services provided by non-Federal entities operating on DoD installations. Installation commanders will also review membership provisions and the original purpose for which each organization was originally approved. Substantial changes to those original conditions shall necessitate further review, documentation, and approval for continued permission to operate on the installation.
§ 212.6
Procedures.
(a) To prevent the appearance of official sanction or support by the Department of Defense:
(1) Non-Federal entities may not use the seals, logos, or insignia of the Department of Defense or any DoD Component, DoD organizational unit, or
DoD installation on organization letterhead, correspondence, titles, or in association with organization programs, locations, or activities.
(2) Non-Federal entities operating on DoD installations may use the name or abbreviation of the Department of Defense, a DoD Component, organizational unit, or installation in its name provided that its status as a non-Federal entity is apparent and unambiguous and there is no appearance of official sanction or support by the Department of Defense. The following applies:
(i) The non-Federal entity must have approval from the appropriate DoD organization whose name or abbreviation is to be used before using the name or abbreviation.
(ii) Any use of the name or abbreviation of a DoD Component, organizational unit, or installation must not mislead members of the public to assume a non-Federal entity is an organizational unit of the Department of Defense.
(iii) A non-Federal entity must prominently display the following disclaimer on all print and electronic media mentioning the entity's name confirming that the entity is not a part of the Department of Defense: “THIS IS A NON-FEDERAL ENTITY. IT IS NOT A PART OF THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE OR ANY OF ITS COMPONENTS AND IT HAS NO GOVERNMENTAL STATUS.” This disclaimer must also be provided in appropriate oral communications and public announcements when the name of the entity is used.
(b) Activities of non-Federal entities covered by this part shall not in any way prejudice or discredit the DoD Components or other Federal Government agencies.
(c) Subject to DoD Directive 4165.6 as it relates to real property, installation commanders shall approve written agreements that indicate permission to operate on the installation and any logistical support that will be provided. DoD personnel acting in an official capacity will not execute any charter that will serve as the legal basis for the non-Federal entity. The nature, function, and objectives of a non-Federal entity covered by this part shall be delineated in articles of incorporation, a written constitution, bylaws, charters, articles of agreement, or other authorization documents before receiving approval from the installation commander to operate on the installation. That documentation shall also include:
(1) Description of eligible membership in the non-Federal entity.
(i) No person because of race, color, creed, sex, age, disability, or national origin shall be unlawfully denied membership, unlawfully excluded from participation, or otherwise subjected to unlawful discrimination by any non-Federal entity or other private organization covered by this part.
(ii) Installation commanders will distribute information on procedures for individuals to follow when they suspect unlawful discrimination by the organization.
(2) Designation of management responsibilities, including the accountability for assets, satisfaction of liabilities, disposition of any residual assets on dissolution, and other documentation that shows responsible financial management.
(3) A certification indicating that members understand they are personally liable, as provided by law, if the assets of the non-Federal entity are insufficient to discharge all liabilities.
(4) Guidance relating to professional scouting organizations operating at U.S. military installations located overseas can be found in DoD Instruction 1015.9.
(i) In accordance with DoD 5500.7-R, which contains a policy on sponsorship of non-Federal entities by DoD personnel acting in an official capacity, DoD personnel acting in an official capacity shall not execute charters that serve as the legal basis for the creation of Boy Scouts organizations (including Boy Scouts, Cub Scout Packs, or Venturer Crews).
(ii) In accordance with U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division, Decision No. 1999 CV 02424, while such chartering is not allowed, nothing in this part is intended to preclude, if otherwise authorized by law or regulation, DoD support to Boy Scouts or their official affiliates; Boy Scouts activities on DoD installations; or sponsorship of Boy Scout organizations by DoD personnel
in their personal capacity. Existing charters executed by DoD personnel in their official capacity shall be terminated or amended to substitute sponsorship by an appropriate individual, volunteer, group, or organization, consistent with DoD policy.

v.
Chicago School Reform Board of Trustees, et al.
)
(d) A non-Federal entity covered by this part shall not offer programs or services on DoD installations that compete with appropriated or NAF activities, but may, when specifically authorized, supplement those activities.
(1) Installation commanders, or higher authorities if the installation commander has not been delegated such authority, will determine if the services of a non-Federal entity conflict with or detract from local DoD programs. The cognizant commander has discretionary authority over the operations of non-Federal entities on DoD installations. Commanders are authorized to eliminate duplication of services, particularly when these services compete with the installation's revenue-generating activities.
(2) Background checks are required for employees and volunteers of non-Federal entities who have contact with children under the age of 18 in DoD- operated, -contracted, or community-based programs that are used to supplement or expand child care or youth services, according to DoD Instruction 1402.5.
(e) Non-Federal entities covered by this part shall be self-sustaining, primarily through dues, contributions, service charges, fees, or special assessment of members. There shall be no financial assistance to such an entity from a NAF Instrumentality (NAFI) in the form of contributions, repairs, services, dividends, or other donations of money or other assets. Fundraising and membership drives are governed by DoD 5500.7-R.
(f) Non-Federal entities are not entitled to DoD support. However, support may be provided when it is consistent with and supportive of the military mission of the DoD Component concerned. Such support may be provided only when it can be offered within the capability of the installation commander without detriment to the commander's ability to fulfill the military mission, and when it is permitted under applicable Status of Forces Agreements. The DoD Components may provide logistical support to non-Federal entities with appropriated funds to the extent authorized by DoD 5500.7-R and applicable law. NAFI funds or assets shall not be directly or indirectly transferred to non-Federal entities according to DoD Instruction 1015.15.
(g) Personal and professional participation in non-Federal entities by DoD employees is governed by DoD 5500.7-R. DoD personnel acting in an official capacity will not execute charters that serve as the legal basis for any non-Federal entity or other private organization.
(h) Neither appropriated fund activities nor NAFIs may assert any claim to the assets, or incur or assume any obligation, of any non-Federal entity covered by this part, except as may arise out of contractual relationships or as provided by law. Property shall not be abandoned on the installation by a non-Federal entity and may only be acquired by the DoD installation by purchase or through donation agreed to by the Department of Defense.
(i) The non-Federal entity shall have adequate insurance, as defined by the DoD Component concerned, to protect against liability and property damage claims or other legal actions that may arise due to its activities, those of its members, or the operation of its equipment or devices. The DoD Components will not assume liability (through insurance or other means) for any activities or assets of non-Federal entities.
(j) Non-Federal entities shall comply with applicable fire and safety regulations; environmental laws; local, State, and Federal tax codes; and any other applicable statutes or regulations.
(k) Income from a non-Federal entity or its activities shall not accrue to individual members of a non-Federal entity except through wages and salaries as employees of the non-Federal entity or as award recognition for services
rendered to the non-Federal entity or military community. This prohibition is not meant to preclude operation of investment clubs, in which the investment of members' personal funds result in a return on investment directly and solely to the individual members.
(l) Employees of non-Federal entities are not employees of the United States or of an instrumentality of the United States. Applicable laws on labor standards for employment shall be observed, including worker's compensation insurance. Employees of non-Federal entities shall not participate in NAF employee benefit programs based upon their affiliation with the non-Federal entity.
(m) Non-Federal entities that have statutory authorization for particular support are listed at Appendix A to this part.
(n) Certain unofficial activities conducted on DoD installations do not need formal authorization because of the limited scope of their activities. Examples are office coffee funds, flower funds, and similar small, informal activities and funds. The DoD Components shall establish the basis upon which such informal activities and funds shall operate.

# Authority:
10 U.S.C. 983.

# Source:
73 FR 16527, Apr. 28, 2008, unless otherwise noted.
§ 216.1
Purpose.
This part:
(a) Implements 10 U.S.C. 983.
(b) Updates policy and responsibilities relating to the management of covered schools that have a policy of denying or effectively preventing military recruiting personnel access to their campuses or access to students on their campuses in a manner that is at least equal in quality and scope to the access to campuses and to students provided to any other employer, or access to student-recruiting information. The term “equal in quality and scope” means the same access to campus and students provided by the school to the any other nonmilitary recruiters or employers receiving the most favorable access. The focus is not on the content of a school's recruiting policy, but instead on the result achieved by the policy and compares the access provided military recruiters to that provided other recruiters. Therefore, it is insufficient to comply with the statute (10 U.S.C. 983) if the policy results in a greater level of access for other recruiters than for the military.
(c) Updates policy and responsibilities relating to the management of covered schools that have an anti-ROTC policy.
§ 216.2
Applicability.
This part applies to the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Military Departments (including the Coast Guard when it is operating as a Military Service in the Navy), the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Combatant Commands, the Defense Agencies, and the DoD Field Activities (hereafter referred to collectively as “the DoD Components”). This part also applies, by agreement with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), to the Coast Guard at all times, including when it is a service in the Department of Homeland Security. The policies herein also affect the Departments of Transportation, Homeland Security, Energy (National Nuclear Security Administration), the Central Intelligence Agency, and any department or agency in which regular appropriations are made in the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act. The term “Military Services,” as used herein, refers to the Army, the Navy, the Marine Corps, the Air Force, and the Coast Guard, including their Reserve or National Guard Components. The term “Related Agencies” as used herein refers to the Armed Forces Retirement Home, the Corporation for National and Community Service, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission, the National Commission on Libraries and Information Science, the National Council on Disability, the National Education Goals Panel, the National Labor Relations Board, the National Mediation Board, the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission, the
Social Security Administration, the Railroad Retirement Board and the United States Institute of Peace.
§ 216.3
Definitions.
(a)
Anti-ROTC policy.
A policy or practice whereby a covered school prohibits or in effect prevents the Secretary of Defense from maintaining, establishing, or efficiently operating a unit of the Senior ROTC at the covered school, or prohibits or in effect prevents a student at the covered school from enrolling in a Senior ROTC unit at another institution of higher education.
(b)
Covered funds.
“Covered funds” is defined in 10 U.S.C. 983 as any funds made available for the Departments of Defense, Transportation, Homeland Security, or National Nuclear Security Administration of the Department of Energy, the Central Intelligence Agency, or any department or agency in which regular appropriations are made in the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, as well as in Related Agencies Appropriations Act (excluding any Federal funds provided to an institution of higher education, or to an individual, to be available solely for student financial assistance, related administrative costs, or costs associated with attendance).
(c)
Covered school.
An institution of higher education, or a subelement of an institution of higher education, subject to the following clarifications:
(1) A determination (§ 216.5(a)) affecting only a subelement of a parent institution (see § 216.3(f)) effects a limitation on the use of funds (see § 216.4 (a)) applicable to the parent institution as a whole, including the institution's offending subelement and all of its subelements, if any.
(2) When an individual institution of higher education that is part of a single university system (
e.g.
, University of (State) at (City)—a part of that state's university system) has a policy or practice that prohibits, or in effect prevents, access to campuses or access to students on campuses in a manner that is at least equal in quality and scope to the access to its campus and students as it provides to any other employer, or access to student-recruiting information by military recruiters, or has an anti-ROTC policy, as defined in this rule, it is only that individual institution within that university system that is affected by the loss of Federal funds. This limited effect applies even though another campus of the same university system may or may not be affected by a separate determination under § 216.5 (a). The funding of a subelement of the offending individual institution of a single university system, if any, will also be withheld as a result of the policies or practices of that offending individual institution.
(d)
Enrolled.
Students are “enrolled” when registered for at least one credit hour of academic credit at the covered school during the most recent, current, or next term. Students who are enrolled during the most recent term, but who are no longer attending the institution, are included.
(e)
Equal in quality and scope.
The term means the same access to campus and students provided by the school to the any other nonmilitary recruiters or employers receiving the most favorable access. The focus is not on the content of a school's recruiting policy, but instead on the result achieved by the policy and compares the access provided military recruiters to that provided other recruiters. Therefore, it is insufficient to comply with the statute if the policy results in a greater level of access for other recruiters than for the military. The U.S. Supreme Court further explained that “the statute does not call for an inquiry into why or how the ‘other employer’ secured its access * * * We do not think that the military recruiter has received equal ‘access’ [when a law firm is permitted on campus to recruit students and the military is not]—regardless of whether the disparate treatment is attributable to the military's failure to comply with the school's nondiscrimination policy.”
(f)
Institution of higher education.
A domestic college, university, or other institution (or subelement thereof) providing postsecondary school courses of study, including foreign campuses of such domestic institutions. The term includes junior colleges, community colleges, and institutions providing courses leading to undergraduate and post-graduate degrees. The term does
not include entities that operate exclusively outside the United States, its territories, and possessions. A subelement of an institution of higher education is a discrete (although not necessarily autonomous) organizational entity that may establish policies or practices affecting military recruiting and related actions (
e.g.
, an undergraduate school, a law school, a medical school, other graduate schools, or a national laboratory connected or affiliated with that parent institution). For example, the School of Law of XYZ University is a subelement of its parent institution (XYZ University).
(g)
Military recruiters.
Personnel of DoD whose current assignment or detail is to a recruiting activity of the DoD.
(h)
Pacifism.
Opposition to war or violence, demonstrated by refusal to participate in military service.
(i)
Student.
An individual who is 17 years of age or older and is enrolled at a covered school.
(j)
Student-recruiting information.
For those students currently enrolled, the student's name, address, telephone listing, age (or year of birth), place of birth, level of education (
e.g.
, freshman, sophomore, or degree awarded for a recent graduate), most recent educational institution attended, and current major(s).
§ 216.4
Policy.
It is DoD policy that:
(a) Under 10 U.S.C. 983, no covered funds may be provided by contract or grant (to include payment on such contracts or grants previously obligated) to a covered school if the Secretary of Defense determines that the covered school:
(1) Has a policy or practice (regardless of when implemented) that either prohibits or in effect prevents the Secretary of Defense or Secretary of Homeland Security from obtaining, for military recruiting purposes, access to campuses or access to students on campuses that is at least equal in quality and scope, as defined in § 216.3(d), to the access to campuses and to students provided to any other employer, or access to directory information on students;
(2) Has failed to disseminate military visit information or alerts at least on par with nonmilitary recruiters since schools offering such services to nonmilitary recruiters must also send e-mails, post notices, etc., on behalf of military recruiters to comply with the Solomon Amendment;
(3) Has failed to schedule visits at times requested by military recruiters that coincide with nonmilitary recruiters' visits to campus if this results in a greater level of access for other recruiters than for the military (
e.g.
, offering non-military recruiters a choice of a variety of dates for on-campus interviews while only offering the military recruiters the final day of interviews), as schools must ensure that their recruiting policies operate such that military recruiters are given access to students equal to that provided to any other employer;
(4) Has failed to provide military recruiters with a mainstream recruiting location amidst nonmilitary employers to allow unfettered access to interviewees since military recruiters must be given the same access as recruiters who comply with a school's nondiscrimination policy;
(5) Has failed to enforce time, place, and manner policies established by the covered school such that the military recruiters experience an inferior or unsafe recruiting climate, as schools must allow military recruiters on campus and must assist them in whatever way the school assists other employers;
(6) Has through policy or practice in effect denied students permission to participate, or has prevented students from participating, in recruiting activities; or
(7) Has an anti-ROTC policy or practice, as defined in this rule, regardless of when implemented.
(b) The limitations established in paragraph (a) of this section shall not apply to a covered school if the Secretary of Defense determines that the covered school:
(1) Has ceased the policies or practices defined in paragraph (a) of this section;
(2) Has a long-standing policy of pacifism (see § 216.3(j)) based on historical religious affiliation;
(3) When not providing requested access to campuses or to students on campus, certifies that all employers are similarly excluded from recruiting on the premises of the covered school, or presents evidence that the degree of access by military recruiters is the same access to campuses or to students on campuses provided to the nonmilitary recruiters;
(4) When not providing any student-recruiting information, certifies that such information is not maintained by the covered school; or that such information already has been provided to the Military Service concerned for that current semester, trimester, quarter, or other academic term, or within the past 4 months (for institutions without academic terms); or
(5) When not providing student-recruiting information for a specific student certifies that the student concerned has formally requested, in writing, that the covered school withhold this information from all third parties.
(c) A covered school may charge military recruiters a fee for the costs incurred in providing access to student-recruiting information when that institution can certify that such charges are the actual costs, provided that such charges are reasonable, customary and identical to fees charged to other employers.
(d) An evaluation to determine whether a covered school maintains a policy or practice covered by paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(6) of this section shall be undertaken when:
(1) Military recruiting personnel are prohibited, or in effect prevented, from the same access to campuses or access to students on campuses provided to nonmilitary recruiters, or are denied access to student-recruiting information;
(2) Information or alerts on military visits are not distributed at least on par with nonmilitary recruiters since schools offering such services to nonmilitary recruiters must also send e-mails, post notices, etc., on behalf of the military recruiter to comply with the Solomon Amendment;
(3) Military recruiters are prohibited from scheduling their visits at requested times that coincide with nonmilitary recruiters' visits to its campus if this results in a greater level of access for other recruiters than for the military as schools must ensure their recruiting policy operates in such a way that military recruiters are given access to students equal to that provided to any other employer;
(4) Military recruiters do not receive a mainstream recruiting location amidst nonmilitary employers to allow unfettered access to interviewees since military recruiters must be given the same access as recruiters who comply with the school's nondiscrimination policy;
(5) The school has failed to enforce time, place, and manner policies established by that school such that military recruiters experience an unsafe recruiting climate, as schools must allow military recruiters on campus and must assist them in whatever way the school chooses to assist other employers;
(6) Evidence is discovered of an institution-sponsored policy or practice that in effect denied students permission to participate, or prevented students from participating in recruiting activities.
(7) The costs being charged by the school for providing student-recruiting information are believed by the military recruiter to be excessive, and the school does not provide information sufficient to support a conclusion that such are the actual costs, provided that they are reasonable and customary, and are identical to those costs charged to other employers; or
(8) The covered school is unwilling to declare in writing, in response to an inquiry from a representative of a DoD Component or a representative from the Department of Homeland Security, that the covered school does not have a policy or practice of prohibiting, or in effect preventing, the Secretary of a Military Department or Secretary of Homeland Security from the same access to campuses or access to students on campuses provided to nonmilitary recruiters, or access to student-recruiting information by military recruiters for purposes of military recruiting.
(e) An evaluation to determine whether a covered school has an anti-ROTC policy covered by paragraph
(a)(7) of this section shall be undertaken when:
(1) A Secretary of a Military Department or designee cannot obtain permission to establish, maintain, or efficiently operate a unit of the Senior ROTC; or
(2) Absent a Senior ROTC unit at the covered school, students cannot obtain permission from a covered school to participate, or are effectively prevented from participating, in a unit of the Senior ROTC at another institution of higher education.
§ 216.5
Responsibilities.
(a) The PDUSD(P
R), under the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, shall:

The Excluded Parties List System (EPLS) is the system that the General Services Administration maintains for Executive Branch agencies, with names and other pertinent information of persons who are debarred, suspended, or otherwise ineligible for Federal procurement and/or covered non-procurement transactions.
(6) Provide ONR with an updated list of the names of institutions identified under paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section whenever the list changes due to an institution being added to or dropped from the list, so that ONR can carry out its responsibilities for post-award administration of DoD Components' contracts and grants with institutions of higher education.
(7) Provide the Office of the Deputy Chief Financial Officer, DoD, and the Director, Defense Finance and Accounting Service with an updated list of the names of institutions identified
under paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section whenever the list changes due to an institution being added or dropped from the list, so those offices can carry out their responsibilities related to cessation of payments of prior contract and grant obligations to institutions of higher education that are on the list.
(8) Publish in the
Federal Register
the list of names of affected institutions that have changed their policies or practices such that they are determined no longer to be in violation of 10 U.S.C. 983 and this part.

Dr. John Doe,
President, ABC University, Anywhere, USA 12345-9876.
Dear Dr. Doe: I understand that military recruiting personnel [have been unable to recruit or have been refused student-recruiting information
3
at (subelement of) ABC University)] by a policy or practice of the school. Specifically, military recruiting personnel have reported [here state policy decisions or practices encountered]. [If preliminary information coming to the attention of a Military Service indicates that other Military Services' recruiting representatives have been similarly informed of the policy or experienced a similar practice affecting their ability for military recruiting purposes to have the access or information require, so state.]
3
Student-recruiting information refers to a student's name, address, telephone listing, age (or year of birth), level of education (e.g., freshman, sophomore, or degree awarded for a recent graduate), and major(s).
Current Federal law (10 U.S.C. 983) denies the use of certain Federal funds through grants or contracts, to include payment on such contracts or grants previously obligated, (excluding any Federal funding to an institution of higher education, or to an individual, to be available solely for student financial assistance, related administrative costs, or costs associated with attendance) from appropriations of the Departments of Defense, Transportation, Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and related agencies to institutions of higher education (including any subelements of such institutions) that have a policy or practice of denying military recruiting personnel access to campuses or access to students on campuses, in a manner that is at least equal in quality and scope (as explained in § 216.3 of Title 32, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 216), as it provides to nonmilitary recruiters, or access to student recruiting information. Implementing regulations are codified at Title 32, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 216.
This letter provides you an opportunity to clarify your institution's policy regarding military recruiting on the campus of [University]. In that regard, I request, within the next 30 days, a written policy statement of the institution with respect to access to campus and students by military recruiting personnel. Your response should highlight any difference between access for military recruiters and access for recruiting by other potential employers.
Based on this information and any additional facts you can provide, Department of Defense officials will make a determination as to your institution's eligibility to receive funds by grant or contract. That decision may affect eligibility for funding from appropriations of the Departments of Defense, Transportation, Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and related agencies. Should it be determined that [University] as an institution of higher education (or any subelement of the institution) is in violation of the aforementioned statutes and regulations, such funding would be stopped, and the institution of higher education (including any subelements of the institution) would remain ineligible to receive such funds until and unless the Department of Defense determines that the institution has ceased the offending policies and practices.
I regret that this action may have to be taken. Successful recruiting requires that Department of Defense recruiters have equal access to students on the campuses of colleges and universities [and student-recruiting information], and at the same time, have effective relationships with the officials and student bodies of those institutions. I hope it will be possible to identify and correct any policies or practices that inhibit military recruiting at your school. [My representative, (name), is] [I am] available to answer any of your questions by telephone at [telephone number]. I look forward to your reply.
Sincerely,

# Appendix B to Part 216—ROTC Sample Letter of Inquiry
(Tailor letter to situation presented)
Dr. Jane Smith,
President, ABC University, Anywhere, USA 12345-9876.
Dear Dr. Smith: I understand that ABC University has [refused a request from a Military Department to establish a Senior ROTC unit at your institution] [refused to continue existing ROTC programs at your institution][prevented students from participation at a Senior ROTC program at another institution] by a policy or practice of the University.
Current Federal law (10 U.S.C. 983) denies the use of certain Federal funds through grants or contracts, to include payment on such contracts or grants previously obligated, (excluding any Federal funding to an institution of higher education, or to an individual, to be available solely for student financial assistance, related administrative
costs, or costs associated with attendance) from appropriations of the Departments of Defense, Transportation, Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and related agencies to institutions of higher education (including any subelements of such institutions) that have a policy or practice of prohibiting or preventing the Secretary of Defense from maintaining, establishing, or efficiently operating a Senior ROTC unit. Implementing regulations are codified at Title 32, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 216.
This letter provides you an opportunity to clarify your institution's policy regarding ROTC access on the campus of ABC University. In that regard, I request, within the next 30 days, a written statement of the institution with respect to [define the problem area(s)].
Based on this information, Department of Defense officials will make a determination as to your institution's eligibility to receive the above-referenced funds by grant or contract. That decision may affect eligibility for funding from appropriations of the Departments of Defense, Transportation, Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and related agencies. Should it be determined that [University] as an institution of higher education (or any subelement of the institution) is in violation of the aforementioned statutes and regulations, such funding would be stopped, and the institution of higher education (including any subelements of the institution) would remain ineligible to receive such funds until and unless the Department of Defense determines that the institution has ceased the offending policies and practices.
I regret that this action may have to be taken. Successful officer procurement requires that the Department of Defense maintain a strong ROTC program. I hope it will be possible to [define the correction to the aforementioned problem area(s)]. [My representative, (name), is] [I am] available to answer any of your questions by telephone at [telephone number]. I look forward to your reply.

50 FR 42521, Oct. 21, 1985, unless otherwise noted.
§ 218.1
Policies.
(a) Upon request by the Veterans Administration in connection with a claim for compensation, or by a veteran or his or her representative, available information shall be provided by the applicable Military Service which shall include all material aspects of the radiation environment to which the veteran was exposed and shall include inhaled, ingested and neutron doses. In determining the veteran's dose, initial neutron, initial gamma, residual gamma, and internal (inhaled and ingested) alpha, beta, and gamma shall be considered. However, doses will be reported as gamma dose, neutron dose, and internal dose. The minimum standards for reporting dose estimates are set forth in § 218.4.
(b) The basic means by which to measure dose from exposure to ionizing radiation is the film badge. Of the estimated 220,000 Department of Defense participants in atmospheric nuclear weapons tests, about 145,000 have film badge dose data available. The information contained in the records has been reproduced in a standard format and is being provided to each military service, which can use the film badge dose data to obtain a radiation dose for a particular individual from that service. This is done upon request from the individual, the individual's representative, the Veterans Administration, or others as authorized by the Privacy Act. Upon request, the participant or his or her authorized representative will be informed of the specific methodologies and assumptions employed in estimating his or her dose. The participant can use this information to obtain independent options regarding exposure.
(c) From 1945 through 1954, the DoD and Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) policy was to issue badges only to a portion of the personnel in a homogeneous unit such as a platoon of a battalion combat team, Naval ship or aircraft crew. Either one person was badged in a group performing the same function, or only personnel expected to
be exposed to radiation were badged. After 1954, the policy was to badge all personnel. But, some badges were unreadable and some records were lost or destroyed, as in the fire at the Federal Records Center in St. Louis. For these reasons the Nuclear Test Personnel Review (NTPR) Program has focused on determining the radiation dose for those personnel (about 75,000) who were not issued film badges or for whom film badge records are not available.
(d) In order to determine the radiation dose to individuals for whom film badge data are not available, alternative approaches are used as circumstances warrant. All approaches require investigation of individual or group activities and their relationship to the radiological environment. First, if it is apparent that personnel were not present in the radiological environment and had no other potential for exposure, then their dose is zero. Second, if some members of a group had film badge readings and others did not—and if all members had a common relationship with the radiological enviroment—then doses for unbadged personnel can be calculated. Third, where sufficient badge readings or a common relationship to the radiological environment does not exist, dose reconstruction is performed. This involves correlating a unit's or individual's detailed activities with the quantitively determined radiological environment. The three approaches are described as follows:
(1) Activities of an individual or his unit are researched for the period of participation in an atmospheric nuclear test. Unit locations and movements are related to areas of radiation. If personnel were far distant from the nuclear detonation(s), did not experience fallout or enter a fallout area, and did not come in contact with radioactive samples or contaminated objects, they were judged to have received no dose.
(2) Film badge data from badged personnel may be used to estimate individual doses for unbadged personnel. First, a group of participants must be identified that have certain common characteristics and a similar potential for exposure to radiation. Such characteristics are: Individuals must be doing the same kind of work, referred to as activity, and all members of the group must have a common relationship to the radiological environment in terms of time, location or other factors. Identification of these groups is based upon research of historical records, technical reports or correspondence. A military unit may consist of several groups or several units may comprise a single group. Using proven statistical methods, the badge data for each group is examined to determine if it adequately reflects the entire group, is valid for use in statistical calculations, or if the badge data indicate the group should be sub-divided into smaller groups. For a group that meets the tests described above, the mean dose, variance and confidence limits are determined. An estimated dose equal to 95% probability that the actual exposure did not exceed the estimate is assigned to unbadged personnel. This procedure is statistically sound and will insure that unbadged personnel are assigned doses much higher than the average/mean for the group.
(3) Dose reconstruction is performed if film badge data are unavailable for all or part of the period or radiation exposure, if film badge data are partially available but cannot be used statistically for calculations, special activities are indicated for specific individuals, or if other types of radiation exposures are indicated. In dose reconstruction, the conditions of exposure are reconstructed analytically to arrive at a radiation dose. Such reconstruction is not a new concept; it is standard scientific practice used by health physicists when the circumstances of a radiation exposure require investigation. The underlying method is in each case the same. The radiation environment is characterized in time and space, as are the activities and geometrical position of the individual. Thus, the rate at which radiation is accrued is determined throughout the time of exposure, from which the total dose is integrated. An uncertainty analysis of the reconstruction provides a calculated mean dose with confidence limits. The specific method used in a dose reconstruction depends on what type of data are available to
provide the required characterizations as well as the nature of the radiation environment. The radiation environment is not limited to the gamma radiation that would have been measured by a film badge, but also includes neutron radiation for personnel sufficiently close to a nuclear detonation, as well as beta and alpha radiation (internally) for personnel whose activities indicate the possibility of inhalation or ingestion of radioactive particles.
§ 218.2
General procedures.
The following procedures govern the approach taken in dose determination:
(a) Use individual film badge data where available and complete, for determining the external gamma dose.
(b) Identify group activities and locations for period(s) of possible exposure.
(c) Qualitatively assess the radiation environment in order to delineate contaminated areas. If no activities occurred in these areas, and if no other potential for exposure exists, a no dose received estimate is made.
(d) If partial film badge data are available, define group(s) of personnel with common activities and relationships to radiation environment.
(e) Using standard statistical methods, verify from the distribution of film badge readings whether the badged sample adequately represents the intended group.
(f) Calculate the mean external gamma dose, with variance and confidence limits, for each unbadged population. Assign a dose equal to 95% probability that actual exposure did not exceed the assigned dose.
(g) If badge data is not available for a statistical calculation, conduct a dose reconstruction.
(h) For dose reconstruction, define radiation environment through use of all available scientific data, e.g., measurements of radiation intensity, decay, radioisotopic composition.
(i) Quantitatively relate activities shielding, position, and other factors to radiation environment as a function of time. Integrate dose throughout period of exposure.
(j) Where possible, calculate mean dose with confidence limits; otherwise calculate best estimate dose or, if data are too sparse, upper limit dose.
(k) Compare calculations with available film badge records to verify the calculated doses. Whether or not film badge data is available, calculate initial and internal doses where identified as a meaningful contribution to the total dose.
§ 218.3
Dose reconstruction methodology.
(a)
Concept.
The specific methodology consists of the characterization of the radiation environments to which participants through all relevant activities, were exposed. The environments, both initial and residual radiation are corrected with the activities of participants to determine accrued doses due to initial radiation, residual radiation and/or inhaled/ingested radioactive material, as warranted by the radiation environment and the specific personnel activities. Due to the range of activities, times, geometries, shielding, and weapon characteristics, as well as the normal spread in the available data pertaining to the radiation environment, an uncertainty analysis is performed. This analysis quantifies the uncertainties due to time/space variations, group size, and available data. Due to the large amounts of data, an automated (computer-assisted) procedure is often used to facilitate the data-handling and the dose integration, and to investigate the sensitivity to variations in the parameters used. The results of the gamma data calculations are then compared with film badge data as they apply to the specific period of the film badges and to the comparable activities of the exposed personnel, in order to validate the procedure and to identify personnel activities that could have led to atypical doses. Radiation dose from neutrons and dose commitments due to inhaled or ingested radioactive material are not detected by film badges. Where required, these values are calculated and recorded separately.
(b)
Characterization of the radiological environment.
(1) This step describes and defines the radiological conditions as a function of time for all locations of concern, that is, where personnel were
positioned or where personnel activities took place. The radiation environment is divided into two standard categories—initial radiation and residual radiation.
(2) The initial radiation environment results from several types of gamma and neutron emissions. Prompt neutron and gamma radiation are emitted at the time of detonation, while delayed neutrons and fission-product gamma, from the decay of radioactive products in the fireball, continue to be emitted as the fireball rises. In contrast to these essentially point sources of radiation, there is gamma radiation from neutron interactions with air and soil, generated within a fraction of a second. Because of the complexity of these radiation sources and their varied interaction properties with air and soil, it is necessary to obtain solutions of the Boltzmann radiation transport equation. The radiation environment thus derived includes the effects of shot-specific parameters such as weapon type and yield, neutron and gamma output, source and target geometry, and atmospheric conditions. The calculated neutron and gamma radiation environments are checked for consistency with existing measured data as available. In those few cases displaying significant discrepancies that cannot be resolved, an environment based on extrapolation of the data is used if it leads to a larger calculated dose.
(3) In determining the residual radiation environment, all possible sources are considered including radioactive clouds, radiation that may have been encountered from other tests, and radioactive debris that may have been deposited in water during oceanic tests. The residual radiation environment is divided into two general components—neutron-activated material that subsequently emits, over a period of time, beta and gamma radiation; and radioactive debris from the fission reaction or from unfissioned materials that emit alpha, beta, and gamma radiation. Because residual radiation decays, the characterization of the residual environment is defined by the radiation intensity as a function of type and time. Radiological survey data are used to determine specific intensities at times of personnel exposure. Interpolation and extrapolation are based on known decay characteristics of the individual materials that comprise the residual contamination. In those rare cases where insufficient radiation data exist to adequately define the residual environment, source data are obtained from the appropriate weapon design laboratory and applied in standard radiation transport codes to determine the initial radiation at specific distances from the burst. This radiation, together with material composition and characteristics, leads to description of the neutron-activated field for each location and time of interest. In all cases observed data, as obtained at the time of the operation, are used to calibrate the calculations.
(c)
Activities of participants.
This step uses all official records, augmented by personnel interviews where gaps exist, to depict a scenario of activities for each individual or definable group. When a dose reconstruction is performed for a specific individual, information available from the individual is accepted unless demonstrably inaccurate. For military units, whose operations were closely controlled and further constrained by radiological safety monitors, the scenario is usually well defined. The same is true for observers, who were restricted to specific locations both during and after the nuclear burst. Ships' locations and activities are usually known with a high degree of precision from deck logs. Aircraft tracks and altitudes are also usually well defined. Personnel engaged in scientific experiments often kept logs of their activities; moreover, the locations of their experiments are usually a matter of record. Where the records are insufficiently complete for the degree of precision required to determine radiation exposure, participants' comments are used and reasonable judgements are made to further the analysis. Possible variations in the activities, as well as possible individual deviations from group activities, with respect to both time and location, are considered in the uncertainty analysis of the radiation dose calculations.
(d)
Calculation of dose.
(1) The initial radiation doses to close-in personnel (who were normally positioned in trenches at the time of detonation) are
calculated from the above-ground environment by simulating the radiation transport into the trenches. Various calculational approaches, standard in health physics, are employed to relate in-trench to above-trench doses for each source of radiation. Detailed modeling of the human body, in appropriate postures in the trench, is performed to calculate the gamma dose that would have been recorded on a film badge and the maximum neutron dose. The neutron, neutron-generated gamma, and prompt gamma doses are accrued during such a short time interval that the posture in a trench could not be altered significantly during this exposure. The fission-product gamma dose, however, is delivered over a period of many seconds. Therefore, the possibility of individual reorientation (e.g., standing up) in the trench is considered.
(2) The calculation of the dose from residual radiation follows from the characterized radiation environment and personnel activities. Because radiation intensities are calculated for a field (i.e., in two spatial dimensions) and in time, the radiation intensity is determinable for each increment of personnel activity regardless of direction or at what time. The dose from exposure to a radiation field is obtained by summing the contribution (product of intensity and time) to dose at each step. The dose calculated from the radiation field does not reflect the shielding of the film badge afforded by the human body. This shielding has been determined for pertinent body positions by the solution of radiation transport equations as applied to a radiation field. Conversion factors are used to arrive at a calculated film badge dose, which not only facilitates comparison with film badge data, but serves as a substitute for an unavailable film badge reading.
(3) The calculation of the dose from inhaled or ingested radioactivity primarily involves the determination of what radiosotopes entered the body in what quantity. Published conversion factors are then applied to these data to arrive at the radiation dose and future dose commitments to internal organs. Inhalation or ingestion of radioactive material is calculated from the radioactive environment and the processes of making these materials inhalable or ingestible. Activities and processes that cause material to become airborne (such as wind, decontamination or traffic) are used with empirical data on particle lofting to determine airborne concentrations under specific circumstances. Volumetric breathing rates and durations of exposure are used to calculate the total material intake. Data on time-dependent weapon debris isotopic composition and the above-mentioned conversion factors are used to calculate the dose commitment to the body and to specific body organs.
(e)
Uncertainty analysis.
Because of the uncertainties associated with the radiological data or calculations used in the absence of data, as well as the uncertainties with respect to personnel activities, confidence limits are determined where possible for group dose calculations. The uncertainty analysis quantifies the errors in available data or in the model used in the absence of data. Confidence limits are based on the uncertainty of all relevant input parameters, and thus vary with the quality of the input data. They also consider the possible range of doses due to the size of the exposure group being examined. Typical sources of error include orientation of the weapons, specific weapon yields, instrument error, fallout intensity data, time(s) at which data were obtained, fallout decay rate, route of personnel movements, and arrival/stay times for specific activities.
(f)
Comparison with film badge records.
(1) Calculations of gamma dose were compared with film badge records for two military units at Operation PLUMBBOB to initially validate this methodology. Where all parameters relating to radiation exposure were identified, direct comparison of gamma dose calculations with actual film badge readings was possible. Resultant correlations provided high confidence in the methodology.
(2) Film badge data may, in some cases, be unrepresentative of the total exposure of a given individual or group; nevertheless, they are extremely useful for direct comparison of incremental
doses for specific periods, e.g., validating the calculations for the remaining, unbadged period of exposure. Moreover, a wide distribution of film badge data often leads to more definitive personnel grouping for dose calculations and to further investigation of the reason(s) for such distribution. In all cases, personnel film badge data are not used in the dose calculations, but rather are used solely for comparison with and validation of the calculations. For dose reconstructions accomplished to date, comparison has been favorable and within the confidence limits of the calculations.
§ 218.4
Dose estimate reporting standards.
The following minimum standards for reporting dose estimates shall be uniformly applied by the Military Services when preparing information in response to an inquiry by the Veterans Administration, in connection with a claim for compensation, or by a veteran or his or her representative. The information shall include all material aspects of the radiation environment to which the veteran was exposed and shall include inhaled, ingested, and neutron doses, when applicable. In determining the veteran's dose, initial neutron, initial gamma, residual gamma, and internal (inhaled and ingested) alpha, beta, and gamma shall be considered. However, doses will be reported as gamma dose, neutron dose, and internal dose. To the extent to which the information is available, the responses will address the following questions:
(a) Can it be documented that the veteran was a test participant? If so, what tests did he attend and what were the specifics of these tests (date, time, yield (unless classified) type, location and other relevant details)?
(b) What unit was the man in? What were the mission and activities of the units at the test?
(c) To the extent to which the available records indicate, what were his duties at the test?
(d) Can you corroborate the specific information relevant to the potential exposure provided by the claimant to the Veterans Administration and forwarded to the Department of Defense? What is the impact of these specific activities on the claimant's reconstructed dose?
(e) Is there any recorded radiation exposure for the individual? Does this recorded exposure cover the full period of test participation? What are the uncertainties associated with the recorded film badge dose?
(f) If recorded dosimetry data is unavailable or incomplete, what is the dose reconstruction for the most probable dose, with error limits, if available?
(g) Is there evidence of a neutron or internal exposure? What is the reconstruction?
Upon request, the participant or his or her authorized representative will be informed of the specific methodologies and assumptions employed in estimating his or her dose.

e.g.,
venipuncture) and manipulations of the subject or the subject's environment that are performed for research purposes.
(3)
Interaction
includes communication or interpersonal contact between investigator and subject.
(4)
Private information
includes information about behavior that occurs in a context in which an individual can reasonably expect that no observation or recording is taking place, and information that has been provided for specific purposes by an individual and that the individual can reasonably expect will not be made public (

§ 219.103
Assuring compliance with this policy—research conducted or supported by any Federal department or agency.
(a) Each institution engaged in research that is covered by this policy, with the exception of research eligible for exemption under § 219.104, and that is conducted or supported by a Federal department or agency, shall provide written assurance satisfactory to the department or agency head that it will comply with the requirements of this policy. In lieu of requiring submission of an assurance, individual department or agency heads shall accept the existence of a current assurance, appropriate for the research in question, on file with the Office for Human Research Protections, HHS, or any successor office, and approved for Federal-wide use by that office. When the existence of an HHS-approved assurance is accepted in lieu of requiring submission of an assurance, reports (except certification) required by this policy to be made to department and agency heads shall also be made to the Office for Human Research Protections, HHS, or any successor office. Federal departments and agencies will conduct or support research covered by this policy only if the institution has provided an assurance that it will comply with the requirements of this policy, as provided in this section, and only if the institution has certified to the department or agency head that the research has been reviewed and approved by an IRB (if such certification is required by § 219.103(d)).
(b) The assurance shall be executed by an individual authorized to act for the institution and to assume on behalf of the institution the obligations imposed by this policy and shall be filed in such form and manner as the department or agency head prescribes.
(c) The department or agency head may limit the period during which any assurance shall remain effective or otherwise condition or restrict the assurance.
(d) Certification is required when the research is supported by a Federal department or agency and not otherwise waived under § 219.101(i) or exempted under § 219.104. For such research, institutions shall certify that each proposed research study covered by the assurance and this section has been reviewed and approved by the IRB. Such certification must be submitted as prescribed by the Federal department or agency component supporting the research. Under no condition shall research covered by this section be initiated prior to receipt of the certification that the research has been reviewed and approved by the IRB.
(e) For nonexempt research involving human subjects covered by this policy (or exempt research for which limited IRB review takes place pursuant to § 219.104(d)(2)(iii), (d)(3)(i)(C), or (d)(7) or (8)) that takes place at an institution in which IRB oversight is conducted by an IRB that is not operated by the institution, the institution and the organization operating the IRB shall document the institution's reliance on the IRB for oversight of the research and the responsibilities that each entity will undertake to ensure compliance with the requirements of this policy (
e.g.,
in a written agreement between the institution and the IRB, by implementation of an institution-wide policy directive providing the allocation of responsibilities between the institution and an IRB that is not affiliated with the institution, or as set forth in a research protocol).

§ 219.104
Exempt research.
(a) Unless otherwise required by law or by department or agency heads, research activities in which the only involvement of human subjects will be in one or more of the categories in paragraph (d) of this section are exempt from the requirements of this policy,
except that such activities must comply with the requirements of this section and as specified in each category.
(b) Use of the exemption categories for research subject to the requirements of subparts B, C, and D: Application of the exemption categories to research subject to the requirements of 45 CFR part 46, subparts B, C, and D, is as follows:
(1)
Subpart B.
Each of the exemptions at this section may be applied to research subject to subpart B if the conditions of the exemption are met.
(2)
Subpart C.
The exemptions at this section do not apply to research subject to subpart C, except for research aimed at involving a broader subject population that only incidentally includes prisoners.
(3)
Subpart D.
The exemptions at paragraphs (d)(1), (4), (5), (6), (7), and (8) of this section may be applied to research subject to subpart D if the conditions of the exemption are met. Paragraphs (d)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section only may apply to research subject to subpart D involving educational tests or the observation of public behavior when the investigator(s) do not participate in the activities being observed. Paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section may not be applied to research subject to subpart D.
(c) [Reserved]
(d) Except as described in paragraph (a) of this section, the following categories of human subjects research are exempt from this policy:
(1) Research, conducted in established or commonly accepted educational settings, that specifically involves normal educational practices that are not likely to adversely impact students' opportunity to learn required educational content or the assessment of educators who provide instruction. This includes most research on regular and special education instructional strategies, and research on the effectiveness of or the comparison among instructional techniques, curricula, or classroom management methods.
(2) Research that only includes interactions involving educational tests (cognitive, diagnostic, aptitude, achievement), survey procedures, interview procedures, or observation of public behavior (including visual or auditory recording) if at least one of the following criteria is met:
(i) The information obtained is recorded by the investigator in such a manner that the identity of the human subjects cannot readily be ascertained, directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects;
(ii) Any disclosure of the human subjects' responses outside the research would not reasonably place the subjects at risk of criminal or civil liability or be damaging to the subjects' financial standing, employability, educational advancement, or reputation; or
(iii) The information obtained is recorded by the investigator in such a manner that the identity of the human subjects can readily be ascertained, directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects, and an IRB conducts a limited IRB review to make the determination required by § 219.111(a)(7).
(3)(i) Research involving benign behavioral interventions in conjunction with the collection of information from an adult subject through verbal or written responses (including data entry) or audiovisual recording if the subject prospectively agrees to the intervention and information collection and at least one of the following criteria is met:
(A) The information obtained is recorded by the investigator in such a manner that the identity of the human subjects cannot readily be ascertained, directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects;
(B) Any disclosure of the human subjects' responses outside the research would not reasonably place the subjects at risk of criminal or civil liability or be damaging to the subjects' financial standing, employability, educational advancement, or reputation; or
(C) The information obtained is recorded by the investigator in such a manner that the identity of the human subjects can readily be ascertained, directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects, and an IRB conducts a limited IRB review to make the determination required by § 219.111(a)(7).
(ii) For the purpose of this provision, benign behavioral interventions are brief in duration, harmless, painless,
not physically invasive, not likely to have a significant adverse lasting impact on the subjects, and the investigator has no reason to think the subjects will find the interventions offensive or embarrassing. Provided all such criteria are met, examples of such benign behavioral interventions would include having the subjects play an online game, having them solve puzzles under various noise conditions, or having them decide how to allocate a nominal amount of received cash between themselves and someone else.
(iii) If the research involves deceiving the subjects regarding the nature or purposes of the research, this exemption is not applicable unless the subject authorizes the deception through a prospective agreement to participate in research in circumstances in which the subject is informed that he or she will be unaware of or misled regarding the nature or purposes of the research.
(4) Secondary research for which consent is not required: Secondary research uses of identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens, if at least one of the following criteria is met:
(i) The identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens are publicly available;
(ii) Information, which may include information about biospecimens, is recorded by the investigator in such a manner that the identity of the human subjects cannot readily be ascertained directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects, the investigator does not contact the subjects, and the investigator will not re-identify subjects;
(iii) The research involves only information collection and analysis involving the investigator's use of identifiable health information when that use is regulated under 45 CFR parts 160 and 164, subparts A and E, for the purposes of “health care operations” or “research” as those terms are defined at 45 CFR 164.501 or for “public health activities and purposes” as described under 45 CFR 164.512(b); or
(iv) The research is conducted by, or on behalf of, a Federal department or agency using government-generated or government-collected information obtained for nonresearch activities, if the research generates identifiable private information that is or will be maintained on information technology that is subject to and in compliance with section 208(b) of the E-Government Act of 2002, 44 U.S.C. 3501 note, if all of the identifiable private information collected, used, or generated as part of the activity will be maintained in systems of records subject to the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, and, if applicable, the information used in the research was collected subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, 44 U.S.C. 3501
et seq.
(5) Research and demonstration projects that are conducted or supported by a Federal department or agency, or otherwise subject to the approval of department or agency heads (or the approval of the heads of bureaus or other subordinate agencies that have been delegated authority to conduct the research and demonstration projects), and that are designed to study, evaluate, improve, or otherwise examine public benefit or service programs, including procedures for obtaining benefits or services under those programs, possible changes in or alternatives to those programs or procedures, or possible changes in methods or levels of payment for benefits or services under those programs. Such projects include, but are not limited to, internal studies by Federal employees, and studies under contracts or consulting arrangements, cooperative agreements, or grants.

(i) Each Federal department or agency conducting or supporting the research and demonstration projects must establish, on a publicly accessible Federal Web site or in such other manner as the department or agency head may determine, a list of the research and demonstration projects that the Federal department or agency conducts or supports under this provision. The research or demonstration project must be published on this list prior to commencing the research involving human subjects.
(ii) [Reserved]
(6) Taste and food quality evaluation and consumer acceptance studies:
(i) If wholesome foods without additives are consumed, or
(ii) If a food is consumed that contains a food ingredient at or below the level and for a use found to be safe, or agricultural chemical or environmental contaminant at or below the level found to be safe, by the Food and Drug Administration or approved by the Environmental Protection Agency or the Food Safety and Inspection Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
(7) Storage or maintenance for secondary research for which broad consent is required: Storage or maintenance of identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens for potential secondary research use if an IRB conducts a limited IRB review and makes the determinations required by § 219.111(a)(8).
(8) Secondary research for which broad consent is required: Research involving the use of identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens for secondary research use, if the following criteria are met:
(i) Broad consent for the storage, maintenance, and secondary research use of the identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens was obtained in accordance with § 219.116(a)(1) through (4), (a)(6), and (d);
(ii) Documentation of informed consent or waiver of documentation of consent was obtained in accordance with § 219.117;
(iii) An IRB conducts a limited IRB review and makes the determination required by § 219.111(a)(7) and makes the determination that the research to be conducted is within the scope of the broad consent referenced in paragraph (d)(8)(i) of this section; and (iv) The investigator does not include returning individual research results to subjects as part of the study plan. This provision does not prevent an investigator from abiding by any legal requirements to return individual research results.

[Reserved]
§ 219.107
IRB membership.
(a) Each IRB shall have at least five members, with varying backgrounds to promote complete and adequate review of research activities commonly conducted by the institution. The IRB shall be sufficiently qualified through the experience and expertise of its members (professional competence), and the diversity of its members, including race, gender, and cultural backgrounds and sensitivity to such issues as community attitudes, to promote respect for its advice and counsel in safeguarding the rights and welfare of human subjects. The IRB shall be able to ascertain the acceptability of proposed research in terms of institutional commitments (including policies and resources) and regulations, applicable law, and standards of professional conduct and practice. The IRB shall therefore include persons knowledgeable in these areas. If an IRB regularly reviews research that involves a category of subjects that is vulnerable to coercion or undue influence, such as children, prisoners, individuals with impaired decision-making capacity, or economically or educationally disadvantaged persons, consideration shall be given to the inclusion of one or more individuals who are knowledgeable about and experienced in working with these categories of subjects.
(b) Each IRB shall include at least one member whose primary concerns are in scientific areas and at least one member whose primary concerns are in nonscientific areas.
(c) Each IRB shall include at least one member who is not otherwise affiliated with the institution and who is not part of the immediate family of a person who is affiliated with the institution.
(d) No IRB may have a member participate in the IRB's initial or continuing review of any project in which the member has a conflicting interest, except to provide information requested by the IRB.
(e) An IRB may, in its discretion, invite individuals with competence in special areas to assist in the review of issues that require expertise beyond or in addition to that available on the
IRB. These individuals may not vote with the IRB.
§ 219.108
IRB functions and operations.
(a) In order to fulfill the requirements of this policy each IRB shall:
(1) Have access to meeting space and sufficient staff to support the IRB's review and recordkeeping duties;
(2) Prepare and maintain a current list of the IRB members identified by name; earned degrees; representative capacity; indications of experience such as board certifications or licenses sufficient to describe each member's chief anticipated contributions to IRB deliberations; and any employment or other relationship between each member and the institution, for example, full-time employee, part-time employee, member of governing panel or board, stockholder, paid or unpaid consultant;
(3) Establish and follow written procedures for:
(i) Conducting its initial and continuing review of research and for reporting its findings and actions to the investigator and the institution;
(ii) Determining which projects require review more often than annually and which projects need verification from sources other than the investigators that no material changes have occurred since previous IRB review; and
(iii) Ensuring prompt reporting to the IRB of proposed changes in a research activity, and for ensuring that investigators will conduct the research activity in accordance with the terms of the IRB approval until any proposed changes have been reviewed and approved by the IRB, except when necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the subject.
(4) Establish and follow written procedures for ensuring prompt reporting to the IRB; appropriate institutional officials; the department or agency head; and the Office for Human Research Protections, HHS, or any successor office, or the equivalent office within the appropriate Federal department or agency of
(i) Any unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others or any serious or continuing noncompliance with this policy or the requirements or determinations of the IRB; and
(ii) Any suspension or termination of IRB approval.
(b) Except when an expedited review procedure is used (as described in § 219.110), an IRB must review proposed research at convened meetings at which a majority of the members of the IRB are present, including at least one member whose primary concerns are in nonscientific areas. In order for the research to be approved, it shall receive the approval of a majority of those members present at the meeting.

§ 219.109
IRB review of research.
(a) An IRB shall review and have authority to approve, require modifications in (to secure approval), or disapprove all research activities covered by this policy, including exempt research activities under § 219.104 for which limited IRB review is a condition of exemption (under § 219.104(d)(2)(iii), (d)(3)(i)(C), and (d)(7), and (8)).
(b) An IRB shall require that information given to subjects (or legally authorized representatives, when appropriate) as part of informed consent is in accordance with § 219.116. The IRB may require that information, in addition to that specifically mentioned in § 219.116, be given to the subjects when in the IRB's judgment the information would meaningfully add to the protection of the rights and welfare of subjects.
(c) An IRB shall require documentation of informed consent or may waive documentation in accordance with § 219.117.
(d) An IRB shall notify investigators and the institution in writing of its decision to approve or disapprove the proposed research activity, or of modifications required to secure IRB approval of the research activity. If the IRB decides to disapprove a research activity, it shall include in its written notification a statement of the reasons for its decision and give the investigator an opportunity to respond in person or in writing.
(e) An IRB shall conduct continuing review of research requiring review by
the convened IRB at intervals appropriate to the degree of risk, not less than once per year, except as described in § 219.109(f).

(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under Control Number 0990-0260)
§ 219.110
Expedited review procedures for certain kinds of research involving no more than minimal risk, and for minor changes in approved research.
(a) The Secretary of HHS has established, and published as a Notice in the
Federal Register,
a list of categories of research that may be reviewed by the IRB through an expedited review procedure. The Secretary will evaluate the list at least every 8 years and amend it, as appropriate, after consultation with other federal departments and agencies and after publication in the
Federal Register
for public comment. A copy of the list is available from the Office for Human Research Protections, HHS, or any successor office.
(b)(1) An IRB may use the expedited review procedure to review the following:
(i) Some or all of the research appearing on the list described in paragraph (a) of this section, unless the reviewer determines that the study involves more than minimal risk;
(ii) Minor changes in previously approved research during the period for which approval is authorized; or
(iii) Research for which limited IRB review is a condition of exemption under § 219.104(d)(2)(iii), (d)(3)(i)(C), and (d)(7) and (8).
(2) Under an expedited review procedure, the review may be carried out by the IRB chairperson or by one or more experienced reviewers designated by the chairperson from among members of the IRB. In reviewing the research, the reviewers may exercise all of the authorities of the IRB except that the reviewers may not disapprove the research. A research activity may be disapproved only after review in accordance with the nonexpedited procedure set forth in § 219.108(b).
(c) Each IRB that uses an expedited review procedure shall adopt a method for keeping all members advised of research proposals that have been approved under the procedure.
(d) The department or agency head may restrict, suspend, terminate, or choose not to authorize an institution's or IRB's use of the expedited review procedure.
§ 219.111
Criteria for IRB approval of research.
(a) In order to approve research covered by this policy the IRB shall determine that all of the following requirements are satisfied:
(1) Risks to subjects are minimized:
(i) By using procedures that are consistent with sound research design and that do not unnecessarily expose subjects to risk, and
(ii) Whenever appropriate, by using procedures already being performed on the subjects for diagnostic or treatment purposes.
(2) Risks to subjects are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits, if any, to subjects, and the importance of the knowledge that may reasonably be expected to result. In evaluating risks and benefits, the IRB should consider only those risks and benefits that may result from the research (as distinguished from risks and benefits of therapies subjects would receive even if not participating in the research). The IRB should not consider possible long-range effects of applying knowledge
gained in the research (
e.g.,
the possible effects of the research on public policy) as among those research risks that fall within the purview of its responsibility.
(3) Selection of subjects is equitable. In making this assessment the IRB should take into account the purposes of the research and the setting in which the research will be conducted. The IRB should be particularly cognizant of the special problems of research that involves a category of subjects who are vulnerable to coercion or undue influence, such as children, prisoners, individuals with impaired decision-making capacity, or economically or educationally disadvantaged persons.
(4) Informed consent will be sought from each prospective subject or the subject's legally authorized representative, in accordance with, and to the extent required by, § 219.116.
(5) Informed consent will be appropriately documented or appropriately waived in accordance with § 219.117.
(6) When appropriate, the research plan makes adequate provision for monitoring the data collected to ensure the safety of subjects.
(7) When appropriate, there are adequate provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data.
(i) The Secretary of HHS will, after consultation with the Office of Management and Budget's privacy office and other Federal departments and agencies that have adopted this policy, issue guidance to assist IRBs in assessing what provisions are adequate to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data.
(ii) [Reserved]
(8) For purposes of conducting the limited IRB review required by § 219.104(d)(7)), the IRB need not make the determinations at paragraphs (a)(1) through (7) of this section, and shall make the following determinations:
(i) Broad consent for storage, maintenance, and secondary research use of identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens is obtained in accordance with the requirements of § 219.116(a)(1)-(4), (a)(6), and (d);
(ii) Broad consent is appropriately documented or waiver of documentation is appropriate, in accordance with § 219.117; and
(iii) If there is a change made for research purposes in the way the identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens are stored or maintained, there are adequate provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data.
(b) When some or all of the subjects are likely to be vulnerable to coercion or undue influence, such as children, prisoners, individuals with impaired decision-making capacity, or economically or educationally disadvantaged persons, additional safeguards have been included in the study to protect the rights and welfare of these subjects.
§ 219.112
Review by Institution
Research covered by this policy that has been approved by an IRB may be subject to further appropriate review and approval or disapproval by officials of the institution. However, those officials may not approve the research if it has not been approved by an IRB.
§ 219.113
Suspension or Termination of IRB Approval of Research.
An IRB shall have authority to suspend or terminate approval of research that is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB's requirements or that has been associated with unexpected serious harm to subjects. Any suspension or termination of approval shall include a statement of the reasons for the IRB's action and shall be reported promptly to the investigator, appropriate institutional officials, and the department or agency head.
(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under Control Number 0990-0260)
§ 219.114
Cooperative Research.
(a) Cooperative research projects are those projects covered by this policy that involve more than one institution. In the conduct of cooperative research projects, each institution is responsible for safeguarding the rights and welfare of human subjects and for complying with this policy.
(b)(1) Any institution located in the United States that is engaged in cooperative research must rely upon approval by a single IRB for that portion
of the research that is conducted in the United States. The reviewing IRB will be identified by the Federal department or agency supporting or conducting the research or proposed by the lead institution subject to the acceptance of the Federal department or agency supporting the research.
(2) The following research is not subject to this provision:
(i) Cooperative research for which more than single IRB review is required by law (including tribal law passed by the official governing body of an American Indian or Alaska Native tribe); or
(ii) Research for which any Federal department or agency supporting or conducting the research determines and documents that the use of a single IRB is not appropriate for the particular context.
(c) For research not subject to paragraph (b) of this section, an institution participating in a cooperative project may enter into a joint review arrangement, rely on the review of another IRB, or make similar arrangements for avoiding duplication of effort.
§ 219.115

General Requirements for Informed Consent.
(a)
General.
General requirements for informed consent, whether written or oral, are set forth in this paragraph and apply to consent obtained in accordance with the requirements set forth in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section. Broad consent may be obtained in lieu of informed consent obtained in accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section only with respect to the storage, maintenance, and secondary research uses of identifiable private information and identifiable biospecimens. Waiver or alteration of consent in research involving public benefit and service programs conducted by or subject to the approval of state or local officials is described in paragraph (e) of this section. General waiver or alteration of informed consent is
described in paragraph (f) of this section. Except as provided elsewhere in this policy:
(1) Before involving a human subject in research covered by this policy, an investigator shall obtain the legally effective informed consent of the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative.
(2) An investigator shall seek informed consent only under circumstances that provide the prospective subject or the legally authorized representative sufficient opportunity to discuss and consider whether or not to participate and that minimize the possibility of coercion or undue influence.
(3) The information that is given to the subject or the legally authorized representative shall be in language understandable to the subject or the legally authorized representative.
(4) The prospective subject or the legally authorized representative must be provided with the information that a reasonable person would want to have in order to make an informed decision about whether to participate, and an opportunity to discuss that information.
(5) Except for broad consent obtained in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section:
(i) Informed consent must begin with a concise and focused presentation of the key information that is most likely to assist a prospective subject or legally authorized representative in understanding the reasons why one might or might not want to participate in the research. This part of the informed consent must be organized and presented in a way that facilitates comprehension.
(ii) Informed consent as a whole must present information in sufficient detail relating to the research, and must be organized and presented in a way that does not merely provide lists of isolated facts, but rather facilitates the prospective subject's or legally authorized representative's understanding of the reasons why one might or might not want to participate.
(6) No informed consent may include any exculpatory language through which the subject or the legally authorized representative is made to waive or appear to waive any of the subject's legal rights, or releases or appears to release the investigator, the sponsor, the institution, or its agents from liability for negligence.

(7) An explanation of whom to contact for answers to pertinent questions about the research and research subjects' rights, and whom to contact in the event of a research-related injury to the subject;
(8) A statement that participation is voluntary, refusal to participate will involve no penalty or loss of benefits to which the subject is otherwise entitled, and the subject may discontinue participation at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which the subject is otherwise entitled; and
(9) One of the following statements about any research that involves the collection of identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens:
(i) A statement that identifiers might be removed from the identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens and that, after such removal, the information or biospecimens could be used for future research studies or distributed to another investigator for future research studies without additional informed consent from the subject or the legally authorized representative, if this might be a possibility; or
(ii) A statement that the subject's information or biospecimens collected as part of the research, even if identifiers are removed, will not be used or distributed for future research studies.
(c)
Additional elements of informed consent.
Except as provided in paragraph (d), (e), or (f) of this section, one or more of the following elements of information, when appropriate, shall also be provided to each subject or the legally authorized representative:
(1) A statement that the particular treatment or procedure may involve risks to the subject (or to the embryo or fetus, if the subject is or may become pregnant) that are currently unforeseeable;

General waiver or alteration of consent
—(1)
Waiver.
An IRB may waive the requirement to obtain informed consent for research under paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section, provided the IRB satisfies the requirements of paragraph (f)(3) of this section. If an individual was asked to provide broad consent for the storage, maintenance, and secondary research use of identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens in accordance with the requirements at paragraph (d) of this section, and refused to consent, an IRB cannot waive consent for the storage, maintenance, or secondary research use of the identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens.
(2)
Alteration.
An IRB may approve a consent procedure that omits some, or alters some or all, of the elements of informed consent set forth in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section provided the IRB satisfies the requirements of paragraph (f)(3) of this section. An IRB may not omit or alter any of the requirements described in paragraph (a) of this section. If a broad consent procedure is used, an IRB may not omit or alter any of the elements required under paragraph (d) of this section.
(3)
Requirements for waiver and alteration.
In order for an IRB to waive or alter consent as described in this subsection, the IRB must find and document that:
(i) The research involves no more than minimal risk to the subjects;
(ii) The research could not practicably be carried out without the requested waiver or alteration;
(iii) If the research involves using identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens, the research could not practicably be carried out without using such information or biospecimens in an identifiable format;
(iv) The waiver or alteration will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the subjects; and
(v) Whenever appropriate, the subjects or legally authorized representatives will be provided with additional pertinent information after participation.
(g)
Screening, recruiting, or determining eligibility.
An IRB may approve a research proposal in which an investigator will obtain information or biospecimens for the purpose of screening, recruiting, or determining the eligibility of prospective subjects without the informed consent of the prospective subject or the subject's legally authorized representative, if either of the following conditions are met:
(1) The investigator will obtain information through oral or written communication with the prospective subject or legally authorized representative, or
(2) The investigator will obtain identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens by accessing records or stored identifiable biospecimens.
(h)
Posting of clinical trial consent form.
(1) For each clinical trial conducted or supported by a Federal department or agency, one IRB-approved informed consent form used to enroll subjects must be posted by the awardee or the Federal department or agency component conducting the trial on a publicly available Federal Web site that will be established as a repository for such informed consent forms.
(2) If the Federal department or agency supporting or conducting the clinical trial determines that certain information should not be made publicly available on a Federal Web site (
e.g.
confidential commercial information), such Federal department or agency may permit or require redactions to the information posted.
(3) The informed consent form must be posted on the Federal Web site after the clinical trial is closed to recruitment, and no later than 60 days after the last study visit by any subject, as required by the protocol.
(i)
Preemption.
The informed consent requirements in this policy are not intended to preempt any applicable Federal, state, or local laws (including tribal laws passed by the official governing body of an American Indian or Alaska Native tribe) that require additional information to be disclosed in order for informed consent to be legally effective.
(j)
Emergency medical care.
Nothing in this policy is intended to limit the authority of a physician to provide emergency medical care, to the extent the physician is permitted to do so under applicable Federal, state, or local law (including tribal law passed by the official governing body of an American Indian or Alaska Native tribe).
(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under Control Number 0990-0260)
§ 219.117
Documentation of informed consent.
(a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, informed consent shall be documented by the use of a written informed consent form approved by the IRB and signed (including in an electronic format) by the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative. A written copy shall be given to the person signing the informed consent form.
(b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the informed consent form may be either of the following:
(1) A written informed consent form that meets the requirements of § 219.116. The investigator shall give either the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative adequate opportunity to read the informed consent form before it is signed; alternatively, this form may be read to the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative.
(2) A short form written informed consent form stating that the elements of informed consent required by § 219.116 have been presented orally to the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative, and that the key information required by § 219.116(a)(5)(i) was presented first to the subject, before other information, if any, was provided. The IRB shall approve a written summary of what is to be said to the subject or the legally authorized representative. When this method is used, there shall be a witness to the oral presentation. Only the short form itself is to be signed by the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative. However, the witness shall sign both the short form and a copy of the summary, and the person actually obtaining consent shall sign a copy of the summary. A copy of the summary shall be given to the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative, in addition to a copy of the short form.
(c)(1) An IRB may waive the requirement for the investigator to obtain a signed informed consent form for some or all subjects if it finds any of the following:
(i) That the only record linking the subject and the research would be the informed consent form and the principal risk would be potential harm resulting from a breach of confidentiality. Each subject (or legally authorized representative) will be asked whether the subject wants documentation linking the subject with the research, and the subject's wishes will govern;
(ii) That the research presents no more than minimal risk of harm to subjects and involves no procedures for which written consent is normally required outside of the research context; or
(iii) If the subjects or legally authorized representatives are members of a distinct cultural group or community in which signing forms is not the norm, that the research presents no more than minimal risk of harm to subjects and provided there is an appropriate alternative mechanism for documenting that informed consent was obtained.
(2) In cases in which the documentation requirement is waived, the IRB may require the investigator to provide subjects or legally authorized representatives with a written statement regarding the research.
(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under Control Number 0990-0260)
§ 219.118
Applications and proposals lacking definite plans for involvement of human subjects.
Certain types of applications for grants, cooperative agreements, or contracts are submitted to Federal departments or agencies with the knowledge that subjects may be involved within the period of support, but definite plans would not normally be set forth in the application or proposal. These include activities such as institutional type grants when selection of specific projects is the institution's responsibility; research training grants in which the activities involving subjects remain to be selected; and projects in which human subjects' involvement will depend upon completion of instruments, prior animal studies, or purification of compounds. Except for research waived under § 219.101(i) or exempted under § 219.104, no human subjects may be involved in any project supported by these awards until the project has been reviewed and approved by the IRB, as provided in this policy, and certification submitted, by the institution, to the Federal department or agency component supporting the research.
§ 219.119
Research undertaken without the intention of involving human subjects.
Except for research waived under § 219.101(i) or exempted under § 219.104, in the event research is undertaken without the intention of involving human subjects, but it is later proposed to involve human subjects in the research, the research shall first be reviewed and approved by an IRB, as provided in this policy, a certification submitted by the institution to the Federal department or agency component supporting the research, and final approval given to the proposed change by the Federal department or agency component.
§ 219.120
Evaluation and disposition of applications and proposals for research to be conducted or supported by a Federal department or agency.
(a) The department or agency head will evaluate all applications and proposals involving human subjects submitted to the Federal department or agency through such officers and employees of the Federal department or agency and such experts and consultants as the department or agency head determines to be appropriate. This evaluation will take into consideration the risks to the subjects, the adequacy of protection against these risks, the potential benefits of the research to the subjects and others, and the importance of the knowledge gained or to be gained.
(b) On the basis of this evaluation, the department or agency head may approve or disapprove the application or proposal, or enter into negotiations to develop an approvable one.
§ 219.121
[Reserved]
§ 219.122
Use of Federal funds.
Federal funds administered by a Federal department or agency may not be expended for research involving human subjects unless the requirements of this policy have been satisfied.
§ 219.123
Early termination of research support: Evaluation of applications and proposals.
(a) The department or agency head may require that Federal department or agency support for any project be terminated or suspended in the manner prescribed in applicable program requirements, when the department or agency head finds an institution has materially failed to comply with the terms of this policy.
(b) In making decisions about supporting or approving applications or proposals covered by this policy the department or agency head may take into account, in addition to all other eligibility requirements and program criteria, factors such as whether the applicant has been subject to a termination or suspension under paragraph (a) of this section and whether the applicant or the person or persons who would direct or has/have directed the scientific and technical aspects of an activity has/have, in the judgment of the department or agency head, materially failed to discharge responsibility for the protection of the rights and welfare of human subjects (whether or not the research was subject to federal regulation).
§ 219.124
Conditions.
With respect to any research project or any class of research projects the department or agency head of either the conducting or the supporting Federal department or agency may impose additional conditions prior to or at the time of approval when in the judgment of the department or agency head additional conditions are necessary for the protection of human subjects.

§ 220.1
Purpose and applicability.
(a) This part implements the provisions of 10 U.S.C. 1095, 1097b(b), and 1079b. In general, 10 U.S.C. 1095 establishes the statutory obligation of third party payers to reimburse the United
States the reasonable charges of healthcare services provided by facilities of the Uniformed Services to covered beneficiaries who are also covered by a third party payer's plan. Section 1097b(b) elaborates on the methods for computation of reasonable charges. Section 1079b addresses charges for civilian patients who are not normally beneficiaries of the Military Health System. This part establishes the Department of Defense interpretations and requirements applicable to all healthcare services subject to 10 U.S.C. 1095, 1097b(b), and 1079b.
(b) This part applies to all facilities of the Uniformed Services; the Department of Transportation administers this part with respect to facilities to the Coast Guard, not the Department of Defense.
(c) This part applies to pathology services provided by the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology. However, in lieu of the rules and procedures otherwise applicable under this part, the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) may establish special rules and procedures under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 176 and 177 in relation to cooperative enterprises between the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology and the American Registry of Pathology.
[67 FR 57740, Sept. 12, 2002]
§ 220.2
Statutory obligation of third party payer to pay.
(a)
Basic rule.
Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 1095(a)(1), a third party payer has an obligation to pay the United States the reasonable charges for healthcare services provided in or through any facility of the Uniformed Services to a covered beneficiary who is also a beneficiary under the third party payer's plan. The obligation to pay is to the extent that the beneficiary would be eligible to receive reimbursement or indemnification from the third party payer if the beneficiary were to incur the costs on the beneficiary's own behalf.
(b)
Application of cost shares.
If the third party payer's plan includes a requirement for a deductible or copayment by the beneficiary of the plan, then the amount the United States may collect from the third party payer is the reasonable charge for the care provided less the appropriate deductible or copayment amount.
(c)
Claim from United States exclusive.
The only way for a third party payer to satisfy its obligation under 10 U.S.C. 1095 is to pay the facility of the uniformed service or other authorized representative of the United States. Payment by a third party payer to the beneficiary does not satisfy 10 U.S.C. 1095.
(d)
Assignment of benefits or other submission by beneficiary not necessary.
The obligation of the third party payer to pay is not dependent upon the beneficiary executing an assignment of benefits to the United States. Nor is the obligation to pay dependent upon any other submission by the beneficiary to the third party payer, including any claim or appeal. In any case in which a facility of the Uniformed Services makes a claim, appeal, representation, or other filing under the authority of this part, any procedural requirement in any third party payer plan for the beneficiary of such plan to make the claim, appeal, representation, or other filing must be deemed to be satisfied. A copy of the completed and signed DoD insurance declaration form will be provided to payers upon request, in lieu of a claimant's statement or coordination of benefits form.
(e)
Preemption of conflicting State laws.
Any provision of a law or regulation of a State or political subdivision thereof that purports to establish any requirement on a third party payer that would have the effect of excluding from coverage or limiting payment, for any health care services for which payment by the third party payer under 10 U.S.C. 1095 or this part is required, is preempted by 10 U.S.C. 1095 and shall have no force or effect in connection with the third party payer's obligations under 10 U.S.C. 1095 or this part.
[55 FR 21748, May 29, 1990, as amended at 57 FR 41101, Sept. 9, 1992; 65 FR 7727, Feb. 16, 2000; 67 FR 57740, Sept. 12, 2002]
§ 220.3
Exclusions impermissible.
(a)
Statutory requirement.
Under 10 U.S.C. 1095(b), no provision of any third party payer's plan having the effect of excluding from coverage or limiting payment for certain care if that care is provided in a facility of the uniformed
services shall operate to prevent collection by the United States.
(b)
General rules.
Based on the statutory requirement, the following are general rules for the administration of 10 U.S.C. 1095 and this part.
(1) Express exclusions or limitations in third party payer plans that are inconsistent with 10 U.S.C. 1095(b) are inoperative.
(2) No objection, precondition or limitation may be asserted that defeats the statutory purpose of collecting from third party payers.
(3) Third party payers may not treat claims arising from services provided in facilities of the uniformed services less favorably than they treat claims arising from services provided in other hospitals.
(4) No objection, precondition or limitation may be asserted that is contrary to the basic nature of facilities of the uniformed services.
(c)
Specific examples of impermissible exclusion.
The following are several specific examples of impermissible exclusions, limitations or preconditions. These examples are not all inclusive.
(1)
Care provided by a government entity.
A provision in a third party payer's plan that purports to disallow or limit payment for services provided by a government entity or paid for by a government program (or similar exclusion) is not a permissible ground for refusing or reducing third party payment.
(2)
No obligation to pay.
A provision in a third party payer's plan that purports to disallow or limit payment for services for which the patient has no obligation to pay (or similar exclusion) is not a permissible ground for refusing or reducing third party payment.
(3)
Exclusion of military beneficiaries.
No provision of an employer sponsored program or plan that purports to make ineligible for coverage individuals who are uniformed services health care beneficiaries shall be permissible.
(4)
No participation agreement.
The lack of a participation agreement or the absence of privity of contract between a third party payer and a facility of the uniformed services is not a permissible ground for refusing or reducing third party payment.
(5)
Medicare carve-out and Medicare secondary payer provisions.
A provision in a third party payer plan, other than a Medicare supplemental plan under § 220.10, that seeks to make Medicare the primary payer and the plan the secondary payer or that would operate to carve out of the plan's coverage an amount equivalent to the Medicare payment that would be made if the services were provided by a provider to whom payment would be made under Part A or Part B of Medicare is not a permissible ground for refusing or reducing payment as the primary payer to the facility of the Uniformed Services by the third party payer unless the provision:
(i) Expressly disallows payment as the primary payer to all providers to whom payment would not be made under Medicare (including payment under Part A, Part B, a Medicare HMO, or a Medicare+Choice plan); and
(ii) Is otherwise in accordance with applicable law.
[55 FR 21748, May 29, 1990, as amended at 57 FR 41101, Sept. 9, 1992; 65 FR 7728, Feb. 16, 2000]
§ 220.4
Reasonable terms and conditions of health plan permissible.
(a)
Statutory requirement.
The statutory obligation of the third party to pay is not unqualified. Under 10 U.S.C. 1095(a)(1) (as noted in § 220.2 of this part), the obligation to pay is to the extent the third party payer would be obliged to pay if the beneficiary incurred the costs personally.
(b)
General rules.
(1) Based on the statutory requirement, after any impermissible exclusions have been made inoperative (see § 220.3 of this part), reasonable terms and conditions of the third party payer's plan that apply generally and uniformly to services provided in facilities other than facilities of the uniformed services may also be applied to services provided in facilities of the uniformed services.
(2) Except as provided by 10 U.S.C. 1095, this part, or other applicable law, third party payers are not required to treat claims arising from services provided in or through facilities of the Uniformed Services more favorably than they treat claims arising from services provided in other facilities or by other health care providers.
(c)
Specific examples of permissible terms and conditions.
The following are several specific examples of permissible terms and conditions of third party payer plans. These examples are not all inclusive.
(1)
Generally applicable coverage provisions.
Generally applicable provisions regarding particular types of medical care or medical conditions covered by the third party payer's plan are permissible grounds to refuse or limit third party payment.
(2)
Generally applicable utilization review provisions.
(i) Reasonable and generally applicable provisions of a third party payer's plan requiring pre-admission screening, second surgical opinions, retrospective review or other similar utilization management activities may be permissible grounds to refuse or reduce third party payment if such refusal or reduction is required by the third party payer's plan.
(ii) Such provisions are not permissible if they are applied in a manner that would result in claims arising from services provided by or through facilities of the Uniformed Services being treated less favorably than claims arising from services provided by other hospitals or providers.
(iii) Such provisions are not permissible if they would not affect a third party payer's obligation under this part. For example, concurrent review of an inpatient hospitalization would generally not affect the third party payer's obligation because of the DRG-based, per-admission basis for calculating reasonable charges under § 220.8(a) (except in long stay outlier cases, noted in § 220.8(a)(4)).
(3)
Restrictions in HMO plans.
Generally applicable exclusions in Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) plans of non-emergency or non-urgent services provided outside the HMO (or similar exclusions) are permissible. However, HMOs may not exclude claims or refuse to certify emergent and urgent services provided within the HMO's service area or otherwise covered non-emergency services provided out of the HMO's service area. In addition, opt-out or point-of-service options available under an HMO plan may not exclude services otherwise payable under 10 U.S.C. 1095 or this part.
(d)
Procedures for establishing reasonable terms and conditions.
In order to establish that a term or condition of a third party payer's plan is permissible, the third party payer must provide appropriate documentation to the facility of the Uniformed Services. This includes, when applicable, copies of explanation of benefits (EOBs), remittance advice, or payment to provider forms. It also includes copies of policies, employee certificates, booklets, or handbooks, or other documentation detailing the plan's health care benefits, exclusions, limitations, deductibles, co-insurance, and other pertinent policy or plan coverage and benefit information.

§ 220.5
Records available.
Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 1095(c), facilities of the uniformed services, when requested, shall make available to representatives of any third party payer from which the United States seeks payment under 10 U.S.C. 1095 for inspection and review appropriate health care records (or copies of such records) of individuals for whose care payment is sought. Appropriate records which will be made available are records which document that the services which are the subject of the claims for payment under 10 U.S.C. 1095 were provided as claimed and were provided in a manner consistent with permissible terms and conditions of the third party payer's plan. This is the sole purpose for which patient care records will be made available. Records not needed for this purpose will not be made available.
§ 220.6
Certain payers excluded.
(a)
Medicare and Medicaid.
Under 10 U.S.C. 1095(d), claims for payment from the Medicare or Medicaid programs (titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security Act) are not authorized.
(b)
Supplemental plans.
CHAMPUS (see 32 CFR part 199) supplemental plans and income supplemental plans are excluded from any obligation to pay under 10 U.S.C. 1095.
(c)
Third party payer plans prior to April 7, 1986.
10 U.S.C. 1095 is not applicable to third party payer plans which have been in continuous effect without amendment or renewal since prior to April 7, 1986. Plans entered into, amended or renewed on or after April 7, 1986, are subject to 10 U.S.C. 1095.
(d)
Third party payer plans prior to November 5, 1990, in connection with outpatient care.
The provisions of 10 U.S.C. 1095 and this section concerning outpatient services are not applicable to third party payer plans:
(1) That have been in continuous effect without amendment or renewal since prior to November 5, 1990; and
(2) For which the facility of the Uniformed Services or other authorized representative for the United States makes a determination, based on documentation provided by the third party payer, that the policy or plan clearly excludes payment for such services. Plans entered into, amended or renewed on or after November 5, 1990, are subject to this section, as are prior plans that do not clearly exclude payment for services covered by this section.
[55 FR 21748, May 29, 1990, as amended at 57 FR 41101, Sept. 9, 1992]
§ 220.7
Remedies and procedures.
(a) Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 1095(e)(1), the United States may institute and prosecute legal proceedings against a third party payer to enforce a right of the United States under 10 U.S.C. 1095 and this part.
(b) Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 1095(e)(2), an authorized representative of the United States may compromise, settle or waive a claim of the United States under 10 U.S.C. 1095 and this part.
(c) The authorities provided by 31 U.S.C. 3701,
et seq.,
28 CFR part 11, and 4 CFR parts 101-104 regarding collection of indebtedness due the United States shall be available to effect collections pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 1095 and this part.
(d) A third party payer may not, without the consent of a U.S. Government official authorized to take action under 10 U.S.C. 1095 and this part, offset or reduce any payment due under 10 U.S.C. 1095 or this part on the grounds that the payer considers itself due a refund from a facility of the Uniformed Services. A request for refund must be submitted and adjudicated separately from any other claims submitted to the third party payer under 10 U.S.C. 1095 or this part.
[55 FR 21748, May 29, 1990, as amended at 65 FR 7728, Feb. 16, 2000]
§ 220.8
Reasonable charges.
(a)
In general.
(1) Section 1095(f) and section 1097b(b) both address the issue of computation of rates. Between them, the effect is to authorize the calculation of all third party payer collections on the basis of reasonable charges and the computation of reasonable charges on the basis of per diem rates, all-inclusive per-visit rates, diagnosis related groups rates, rates used by the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS) program to reimburse authorized providers, or any other method the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) considers appropriate and establishes in this part. Such rates, representative of costs, are also endorsed by section 1079(a).
(2) The general rule is that reasonable charges under this part are based on the rates used by CHAMPUS under 32 CFR 199.14 to reimburse authorized providers. There are some exceptions to this general rule, as outlined in this section.
(b)
Inpatient institutional and professional services on or after October 1, 2017.
Reasonable charges for inpatient institutional services provided on or after October 1, 2017, are based on either of two methods as determined by the ASD(HA). The first uses the CHAMPUS Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) payment system rates under 32 CFR 199.14(a)(1). Certain adjustments are made to reflect differences between the CHAMPUS payment system and MHS billing solutions. Among these are to include in the inpatient hospital service charges adjustments related to direct medical education and capital costs (which in the CHAMPUS system are handled as annual pass through payments). Additional adjustments are made for long stay outlier cases. The second method uses Itemized Resource Utilization (IRU) rates based on the cost to provide inpatient institutional
resources. Like the CHAMPUS system, inpatient professional services are not included in the inpatient institutional services charges calculated under either methodology, but are billed separately in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section. In lieu of either method described in this paragraph (b), the method in effect prior to April 1, 2003 (described in paragraph (c) of this section), may continue to be used for a period of time after April 1, 2003, if the ASD(HA) determines that effective implementation requires a temporary deferral.
(c)
Inpatient hospital and inpatient professional services before April 1, 2003
—(1)
In general.
Prior to April 1, 2003, the computation of reasonable charges for inpatient institutional and professional services is reasonable costs based on diagnosis related groups (DRGs). Costs shall be based on the inpatient full reimbursement rate per hospital discharge, weighted to reflect the intensity of the principal diagnosis involved. The average charge per case shall be published annually as an inpatient standardized amount. A relative weight for each DRG shall be the same as the DRG weights published annually for hospital reimbursement rates under CHAMPUS pursuant to 32 CFR 199.14(a)(1). The method in effect prior to April 1, 2003 (as described in this paragraph (c)), may continue to be used for a period of time after April 1, 2003, if the ASD(HA) determines that effective implementation requires a temporary deferral of the method described in paragraph (b) of this section.
(2)
Standard amount.
The standard amount is determined by dividing the total costs of all inpatient care in all military treatment facilities by the total number of discharges. This produces a single national standardized amount. The Department of Defense is authorized, but not required by this part, to calculate three standardized amounts, one for large urban, other urban/rural, and overseas area, utilizing the same distinctions in identifying the first two areas as is used for CHAMPUS under 32 CFR 199.14(a)(1). Using this applicable standardized amount, the Department of Defense may make adjustments for area wage rates and indirect medical education costs (as identified in paragraph (c)(4) of this section), producing for each inpatient facility of the Uniformed Services a facility-specific “adjusted standardized amount” (ASA).
(3)
DRG relative weights.
Costs for each DRG will be determined by multiplying the standardized amount per discharge by the DRG relative weight. For this purpose, the DRG relative weights used for CHAMPUS pursuant to 32 CFR 199.14(a)(1) shall be used.
(4)
Adjustments for outliers, area wages, and indirect medical education.
The Department of Defense may, but is not required by this part, to adjust charge determinations in particular cases for length-of-stay outliers (long stay and short stay), cost outliers, area wage rates, and indirect medical education. If any such adjustments are used, the method shall be comparable to that used for CHAMPUS hospital reimbursements pursuant to 32 CFR 199.14(a)(1)(iii)(E), and the calculation of the standardized amount under paragraph (a)(2) of this section will reflect that such adjustments will be used.
(5)
Identification of professional and institutional charges.
For purposes of billing third party payers other than automobile liability and no-fault insurance carriers, inpatient billings are subdivided into two categories:
(i) Institutional charges (which refer to routine service charges associated with the facility encounter or hospital stay and ancillary charges).
(ii) Professional charges (which refers to professional services provided by physicians and certain other providers).
(d)
Medical services and subsistence charges included.
Medical services charges pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 1078 or subsistence charges pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 1075 are included in the claim filed with the third party payer pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 1095. For any patient of a facility of the Uniformed Services who indicates that he or she is a beneficiary of a third party payer plan, the usual medical services or subsistence charge will not be collected from the patient to the extent that payment received from the payer exceeds the medical services or subsistence charge. Thus, except in cases covered by § 220.8(k), payment of the claim made
pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 1095 which exceeds the medical services or subsistence charge, will satisfy all of the third party payer's obligation arising from the care provided by the facility of the Uniformed Services on that occasion.
(e)
Reasonable charges for professional services.
The CHAMPUS Maximum Allowable Charge rate table, established under 32 CFR 199.14(h), is used for determining the appropriate charge for professional services in an itemized format, based on Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) methodology. This applies to outpatient professional charges only prior to implementation of the method described in paragraph (b) of this section, and to all professional charges, both inpatient and outpatient, thereafter.
(f)
Miscellaneous Healthcare services.
Some special services are provided by or through facilities of the Uniformed Services for which reasonable charges are computed based on reasonable costs. Those services are the following:
(1) The charge for ambulance services is based on the full costs of operating the ambulance service.
(2) With respect to inpatient institutional charges in the Burn Center at Brooke Army Medical Center, the ASD(HA) may establish an adjustment to the rate otherwise applicable under the payment methodologies under this section to reflect unique attributes of the Burn Center.
(3) Charges for dental services (including oral diagnosis and prevention, periodontics, prosthodontics (fixed and removable), implantology, oral surgery, orthodontics, pediatric dentistry and endodontics) will be based on a full cost of the dental services.
(4) With respect to service provided prior to January 1, 2003, reasonable charges for anesthesia services will be based on an average DoD cost of service in all Military Treatment Facilities. With respect to services provided on or after January 1, 2003, reasonable charges for anesthesia services will be based on an average cost per minute of service in all Military Treatment Facilities.
(5) The charge for immunizations, allergen extracts, allergic condition tests, and the administration of certain medications when these services are provided by or through a facility of the Uniformed Services or a separate immunizations or shot clinic, are based either on CHAMPUS prevailing rates or on IRU rates based on the cost to provide these items, exclusive of any costs considered for purposes of any outpatient visit. A separate charge shall be made for each immunization, injection or medication administered.
(6) The charges for pharmacy, durable medical equipment and supply resources are based either on CHAMPUS prevailing rates or on IRU rates based on the cost to provide these items, exclusive of any costs considered for purposes of any outpatient visit. A separate charge shall be made for each item provided.
(7) Charges for aero-medical evacuation will be based on the full cost of the aero-medical evacuation services.
(8) Ambulatory (outpatient) institutional services on or after October 1, 2017. Reasonable charges for institutional facility charges for ambulatory services provided on or after October 1, 2017, are based on any of three methods as determined by the ASD(HA). The first uses the CHAMPUS Ambulatory Payment Classification (APC) and Ambulatory Surgery Center (ASC) payment system rates under 32 CFR 199.14(a)(1)(ii) and (iii) and 32 CFR 199.14(d) respectively. The second uses a bundled MHS Ambulatory Procedure Visit (APV) payment system rate charge reflected by the average cost of providing an APV exclusive of professional services. The third method uses IRU rates based on the cost to provide ambulatory institutional resources. Like the CHAMPUS system, ambulatory professional services are not included in the ambulatory institutional facility charges calculated under any of the three methodologies, but are billed separately in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section.
(g)
Special rule for services ordered and paid for by a facility of the Uniformed Services but provided by another provider.
In cases where a facility of the Uniformed Services purchases ancillary services or procedures, from a source other than a Uniformed Services facility, the cost of the purchased services will be added to the standard rate. Examples of ancillary services and other
procedures covered by this special rule include (but are not limited to): laboratory, radiology, pharmacy, pulmonary function, cardiac catheterization, hemodialysis, hyperbaric medicine, electrocardiography, electroencephalography, electroneuromyography, pulmonary function, inhalation and respiratory therapy and physical therapy services.
(h)
Special rule for TRICARE Resource Sharing Agreements.
Services provided in facilities of the Uniformed Services in whole or in part through personnel or other resources supplied under a TRICARE Resource Sharing Agreement under 32 CFR 199.17(h) are considered for purposes of this part as services provided by the facility of the Uniformed Services. Thus, third party payers will receive a claim for such services in the same manner and for the same charges as any similar services provided by a facility of the Uniformed Services.
(i)
Alternative determination of reasonable charges.
Any third party payer that can satisfactorily demonstrate a prevailing rate of payment in the same geographic area for the same or similar aggregate groups of services that is less than the charges prescribed under this section may, with the agreement of the facility of the Uniformed Services (or other authorized representatives of the United States), limit payments under 10 U.S.C. 1095 to that prevailing rate for those services. The determination of the third party payer's prevailing rate shall be based on a review of valid contractual arrangements with other facilities or providers constituting a majority of the services for which payment is made under the third party payer's plan. This paragraph does not apply to cases covered by § 220.11.
(j)
Exception authority for extraordinary circumstances.
The Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) may authorize exceptions to this section, not inconsistent with law, based on extraordinary circumstances.
[57 FR 41101, Sept. 9, 1992, as amended at 59 FR 49002, Sept. 26, 1994; 61 FR 6542, Feb. 21, 1996; 62 FR 941, Jan. 7, 1997; 65 FR 7728, Feb. 16, 2000; 67 FR 57740, Sept. 12, 2002; 85 FR 51351, Aug. 20, 2020]
§ 220.9
Rights and obligations of beneficiaries.
(a)
No additional cost share.
Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 1095(a)(2), uniformed services beneficiaries will not be required to pay to the facility of the uniformed services any amount greater than the normal medical services or subsistence charges (under 10 U.S.C. 1075 or 1078). In every case in which payment from a third party payer is received, it will be considered as satisfying the normal medical services or subsistence charges, and no further payment from the beneficiary will be required.
(b)
Availability of healthcare services unaffected.
The availability of healthcare services in any facility of the Uniformed Services will not be affected by the participation or nonparticipation of a Uniformed Services beneficiary in a health care plan of a third party payer. Whether or not a Uniformed Services beneficiary is covered by a third party payer's plan will not be considered in determining the availability of healthcare services in a facility of the Uniformed Services.
(c)
Obligation to disclose information and cooperate with collection efforts.
(1) Uniformed Services beneficiaries are required to provide correct information to the facility of the Uniformed Services regarding whether the beneficiary is covered by a third party payer's plan. Such beneficiaries are also required to provide correct information regarding whether particular health care services might be covered by a third party payer's plan, including services arising from an accident or workplace injury or illness. In the event a third party payer's plan might be applicable, a beneficiary has an obligation to provide such information as may be necessary to carry out 10 U.S.C. 1095 and this part, including identification of policy numbers, claim numbers, involved parties and their representatives, and other relevant information.
(2) Uniformed Services beneficiaries are required to take other reasonable steps to cooperate with the efforts of the facility of the Uniformed Services to make collections under 10 U.S.C. 1095 and this part, such as submitting to the third party payer (or other entity involved in adjudicating a claim) any requests or documentation that
might be required by the third party payer (or other entity), if consistent with this part, to facilitate payment under this part.
(3) Intentionally providing false information or willfully failing to satisfy a beneficiary's obligations are grounds for disqualification for health care services from facilities of the Uniformed Services.
(d)
Mandatory disclosure of Social Security account numbers.
Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 1095(k)(2), every covered beneficiary eligible for care in facilities of the Uniformed Services is, as a condition of eligibility, required to disclose to authorized personnel his or her Social Security account number.
[55 FR 21748, May 29, 1990, as amended at 57 FR 41102, Sept. 9, 1992; 63 FR 11600, Mar. 10, 1998; 65 FR 7729, Feb. 16, 2000]
§ 220.10
Special rules for Medicare supplemental plans.
(a)
Statutory obligation of Medicare supplemental plans to pay.
The obligation of a Medicare supplemental plan to pay shall be determined as if the facility of the Uniformed Services were a medicare-eligible provider and the services provided as if they were Medicare-covered services. A Medicare supplemental plan is required to pay only to the extent that the plan would have incurred a payment obligation if the services had been furnished by a Medicare eligible provider.
(b)
Inpatient hospital care charges.
(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of § 220.8, charges to Medicare supplemental plans for inpatient hospital care services provided to beneficiaries of such plans shall not, for any admission, exceed the Medicare inpatient hospital deductible amount.
(2) Only one deductible charge shall be made per hospital admission (or Medicare benefit period), regardless of whether the admission is to a facility of the Uniformed Services or a Medicare certified civilian hospital. To ensure that a Medicare supplemental insurer is not charged the inpatient hospital deductible twice when an individual who is entitled to benefits under both DoD retiree benefits and Medicare, the following payment rules apply:
(i) If a dual beneficiary is first admitted to a Medicare-certified hospital and is later admitted to a facility of the Uniformed Services within the same benefit period initiated by the admission to the Medicare-certified hospital, the facility of the Uniformed Services shall not charge the Medicare supplemental insurance plan an inpatient hospital deductible.
(ii) If a dual beneficiary is admitted first to a facility of the Uniformed Services and secondly to a Medicare-certified hospital within 60 days of discharge from the facility of the Uniformed Services, the facility of the Uniformed Services shall refund to the Medicare supplemental insurer any inpatient hospital deductible that the insurer paid to the facility of the Uniformed Services so that it may pay the deductible to the Medicare-certified hospital.
(c)
Charges for Healthcare services other than inpatient deductible amount.
(1) The Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) may establish charge amounts for Medicare supplemental plans to collect reasonable charges for inpatient and outpatient copayments and other services covered by the Medicare supplemental plan. Any such schedule of charge amounts shall:
(i) Be based on percentage amounts of the per diem, per visit and other rates established by § 220.8 comparable to the percentage amounts of beneficiary financial responsibility under Medicare for the service involved;
(ii) Include adjustments, as appropriate, to identify major components of the all inclusive per diem or per visit rates for which Medicare has special rules.
(iii) Provide for offsets and/or refunds to ensure that Medicare supplemental insurers are not required to pay a limited benefit more than one time in cases in which beneficiaries receive similar services from both a facility of the uniformed services and a Medicare certified provider; and
(iv) Otherwise conform with the requirements of this section and this part.
(2) If collections are sought under paragraph (c) of this section, the effective date of such collections will be prospective from the date the Assistant
Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) provides notice of such collections, and will exempt policies in continuous effect without amendment or renewal since the date the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) provides notice of such collections.
(d)
Medicare claim not required.
Notwithstanding any requirement of the Medicare supplemental plan policy, a Medicare supplemental plan may not refuse payment to a claim made pursuant to this section on the grounds that no claim had previously been submitted by the provider or beneficiary for payment under the Medicare program.
(e)
Exclusion of Medicare supplemental plans prior to November 5, 1990.
This section is not applicable to Medicare supplemental plans:
(1) That have been in continuous effect without amendment since prior to November 5, 1990; and
(2) For which the facility of the Uniformed Services (or other authorized representative of the United States) makes a determination, based on documentation provided by the Medicare supplemental plan, that the plan agreement clearly excludes payment for services covered by this section. Plans entered into, amended or renewed on or after November 5, 1990, are subject to this section, as are prior plans that do not clearly exclude payment for services covered by this section.
[57 FR 41102, Sept. 9, 1992, as amended at 59 FR 49003, Sept. 26, 1994; 67 FR 57742, Sept. 12, 2002]
§ 220.11
Special rules for automobile liability insurance and no-fault automobile insurance.
(a)
Active duty members covered.
In addition to Uniformed Services beneficiaries covered by other provisions of this part, this section also applies to active duty members of the Uniformed Services. As used in this section, “beneficiaries” includes active duty members.
(b)
Effect of concurrent applicability of the Federal Medical Care Recovery Act
—(1)
In general.
In many cases covered by this section, the United States has a right to collect under both 10 U.S.C. 1095 and the Federal Medical Care Recovery Act (FMCRA), Pub. L. 87-693 (42 U.S.C. 2651
et seq.
). In such cases, the authority is concurrent and the United States may pursue collection under both statutory authorities.
(2)
Cases involving tort liability.
In cases in which the right of the United States to collect from the automobile liability insurance carrier is premised on establishing some tort liability on some third person, matters regarding the determination of such tort liability shall be governed by the same substantive standards as would be applied under the FMCRA including reliance on state law for determinations regarding tort liability. In addition, the provisions of 28 CFR part 43 (Department of Justice regulations pertaining to the FMCRA) shall apply to claims made under the concurrent authority of the FMCRA and 10 U.S.C. 1095. All other matters and procedures concerning the right of the United States to collect shall, if a claim is made under the concurrent authority of the FMCRA and this section, be governed by 10 U.S.C. 1095 and this part.
(c)
Exclusion of automobile liability insurance and no-fault automobile insurance plans prior to November 5, 1990.
This section is not applicable to automobile liability insurance and no-fault automobile insurance plans:
(1) That have been in continuous effect without amendment since prior to November 5, 1990; and
(2) For which the facility of the Uniformed Services (or other authorized representative of the United States) makes a determination, based on documentation provided by the third party payer, that the policy or plan clearly excludes payment for services covered by this section. Plans entered into, amended or renewed on or after November 5, 1990, are subject to this section, as are prior plans that do not clearly exclude payment for services covered by this section.
[57 FR 41103, Sept. 9, 1992]
§ 220.12
[Reserved]
§ 220.13
Special rules for workers' compensation programs.
(a)
Basic rule.
Pursuant to the general duty of third party payers under 10 U.S.C. 1095(a)(1) and the definitions of
10 U.S.C. 1095(h), a workers' compensation program or plan generally has an obligation to pay the United States the reasonable charges for healthcare services provided in or through any facility of the Uniformed Services to a Uniformed Services beneficiary who is also a beneficiary under a workers' compensation program due to an employment related injury, illness, or disease. Except to the extent modified or supplemented by this section, all provisions of this part are applicable to any workers' compensation program or plan in the same manner as they are applicable to any other third party payer.
(b)
Special rules for lump-sum settlements.
In cases in which a lump-sum workers' compensation settlement is made, the special rules established in this paragraph (b) shall apply for purposes of compliance with this section.
(1)
Lump-sum commutation of future benefits.
If a lump-sum worker's compensation award stipulates that the amount paid is intended to compensate the individual for all future medical expenses required because of the work-related injury, illness, or disease, the Uniformed Service health care facility is entitled to reimbursement for injury, illness, or disease related, future health care services or items rendered or provided to the individual up to the amount of the lump-sum payment.
(2)
Lump-sum compromise settlement.
(i) A lump sum compromise settlement, unless otherwise stipulated by an official authorized to take action under 10 U.S.C. 1095 and this part, is deemed to be a workers' compensation payment for the purpose of reimbursement to the facility of the Uniformed Services for services and items provided, even if the settlement agreement stipulates that there is no liability under the workers' compensation law, program, or plan.
(ii) If a settlement appears to represent an attempt to shift to the facility of the Uniformed Services the responsibility of providing uncompensated services or items for the treatment of the work-related condition, the settlement will not be recognized and reimbursement to the uniformed health care facility will be required. For example, if the parties to a settlement attempt to maximize the amount of disability benefits paid under workers' compensation by releasing the employer or workers' compensation carrier from liability for medical expenses for a particular condition even though the facts show that the condition is work-related, the facility of the Uniformed Services must be reimbursed.
(iii) Except as specified in paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section, if a lump-sum compromise settlement forecloses the possibility of future payment or workers' compensation benefits, medical expenses incurred by a facility of the Uniformed Services after the date of the settlement are not reimbursable under this section.
(iv) As an exception to the rule of paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, if the settlement agreement allocates certain amounts for specific future medical services, the facility of the Uniformed Services is entitled to reimbursement for those specific services and items provided resulting from the work-related injury, illness, or disease up to the amount of the lump-sum settlement allocated to future expenses.
(3)
Apportionment of a lump-sum compromise settlement of a workers' compensation claim.
If a compromise settlement allocates a portion of the payment for medical expenses and also gives reasonable recognition to the income replacement element, that apportionment may be accepted as a basis for determining the payment obligation of a workers' compensation program or plan under this section to a facility of the Uniformed Services. If the settlement does not give reasonable recognition to both elements of a workers' compensation award or does not apportion the sum granted, the portion to be considered as payment for medical expenses is computed as follows: determine the ratio of the amount awarded (less the reasonable and necessary costs incurred in procuring the settlement) to the total amount that would have been payable under workers' compensation if the claim had not been compromised; multiply that ratio by the total medical expenses incurred as a result of the injury or disease up to the date of settlement. The product is the amount of workers' compensation settlement to
be considered as payment or reimbursement for medical expenses.
[65 FR 7730, Feb. 16, 2000, as amended at 67 FR 57742, Sept. 12, 2002]
§ 220.14
Definitions.
Ambulatory procedure visit.
An ambulatory procedure visit is a type of outpatient visit in which immediate (day of procedure) pre-procedure and immediate post-procedure care require an unusual degree of intensity and are provided in an ambulatory procedure unit (APU) of the facility of the Uniformed Services. Care is required in the facility for less than 24 hours. An APU is specially designated and is accounted for separately from any outpatient clinic.
Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs).
This term includes any authorized designee of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs).
Automobile liability insurance.
Automobile liability insurance means insurance against legal liability for health and medical expenses resulting from personal injuries arising from operation of a motor vehicle. Automobile liability insurance includes:
(1) Circumstances in which liability benefits are paid to an injured party only when the insured party's tortious acts are the cause of the injuries; and
(2) Uninsured and underinsured coverage, in which there is a third party tortfeasor who caused the injuries (i.e., benefits are not paid on a no-fault basis), but the insured party is not the tortfeasor.
CHAMPUS supplemental plan.
A CHAMPUS supplemental plan is an insurance, medical service or health plan exclusively for the purpose of supplementing an eligible person's benefit under CHAMPUS. (For information concerning CHAMPUS, see 32 CFR part 199.) The term has the same meaning as set forth in the CHAMPUS regulation (32 CFR 199.2).
Covered beneficiaries.
Covered beneficiaries are all healthcare beneficiaries under chapter 55 of title 10, United States Code, except members of the Uniformed Services on active duty (as specified in 10 U.S.C. 1074(a)). However, for purposes of § 220.11 of this part, such members of the Uniformed Services are included as covered beneficiaries.
Facility of the Uniformed Services.
A facility of the Uniformed Services means any medical or dental treatment facility of the Uniformed Services (as that term is defined in 10 U.S.C. 101(43)). Contract facilities such as Navy NAVCARE clinics and Army and Air Force PRIMUS clinics that are funded by a facility of the Uniformed Services are considered to operate as an extension of the local military treatment facility and are included within the scope of this program. Facilities of the Uniformed Services also include several former Public Health Services facilities that are deemed to be facilities of the Uniformed Services pursuant to section 911 of Pub. L. 97-99 (often referred to as “Uniformed Services Treatment Facilities” or “USTFs”).
Healthcare services.
Healthcare services include inpatient, outpatient, and designated high-cost ancillary services.
Inpatient hospital care.
Treatment provided to an individual other than a transient patient, who is admitted (i.e., placed under treatment or observation) to a bed in a facility of the uniformed services that has authorized beds for inpatient medical or dental care.
Insurance, medical service or health plan.
Any plan (including any plan, policy, program, contract, or liability arrangement) that provides compensation, coverage, or indemnification for expenses incurred by a beneficiary for health or medical services, items, products, and supplies. It includes but is not limited to:
(1) Any plan offered by an insurer, re-insurer, employer, corporation, organization, trust, organized health care group or other entity.

(3) Any Employee Retirement Income and Security Act (ERISA) plan.
(4) Any Multiple Employer Trust (MET).
(5) Any Multiple Employer Welfare Arrangement (MEWA).

Medicare eligible provider.
Medicare participating (institutional) providers and physicians, suppliers and other individual providers eligible to participate in the Medicare program.
Medicare supplemental insurance plan.
A Medicare supplemental insurance plan is an insurance, medical service or health plan primarily for the purpose of supplementing an eligible person's benefit under Medicare. The term has the same meaning as “Medicare supplemental policy” in section 1882(g)(1) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395ss) and 42 CFR part 403, subpart B.
No-fault insurance.
No-fault insurance means an insurance contract providing compensation for health and medical expenses relating to personal injury arising from the operation of a motor vehicle in which the compensation is not premised on who may have been responsible for causing such injury. No-fault insurance includes personal injury protection and medical payments benefits in cases involving personal injuries resulting from operation of a motor vehicle.
Preferred provider organization.
A preferred provider organization (PPO) is any arrangement in a third party payer plan under which coverage is limited to services provided by a select group of providers who are members of the PPO or incentives (for example, reduced copayments) are provided for beneficiaries under the plan to receive health care services from the members of the PPO rather than from other providers who, although authorized to be paid, are not included in the PPO. However, a PPO does not include any organization that is recognized as a health maintenance organization.
Third party payer.
A third party payer is any entity that provides an insurance, medical service, or health plan by contract or agreement. It includes but is not limited to:
(1) State and local governments that provide such plans other than Medicaid.
(2) Insurance underwriters or carriers.
(3) Private employers or employer groups offering self-insured or partially self-insured medical service or health plans.

A third party payer plan is any plan or program provided by a third party payer, but not including an income or wage supplemental plan.
Uniformed Services beneficiary.
For purposes of this part, a Uniformed Services beneficiary is any person who is covered by 10 U.S.C. 1074(b), 1076(a), or 1076(b). For purposes of § 220.11 (but not for other sections), a Uniformed Services beneficiary also includes active duty members of the Uniformed Services.
Workers' compensation program or plan.
A workers' compensation program or plan is any program or plan that provides compensation for loss, to employees or their dependents, resulting from the injury, disablement, or
death of an employee due to an employment related accident, casualty or disease. The common characteristic of such a plan or program is the provision of compensation regardless of fault, in accordance with a delineated schedule based upon loss or impairment of the worker's wage earning capacity, as well as indemnification or compensation for medical expenses relating to the employment related injury or disease. A workers' compensation program or plan includes any such program or plan:
(1) Operated by or under the authority of any law of any State (or the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands).
(2) Operated through an insurance arrangement or on a self-insured basis by an employer.
(3) Operated under the authority of the Federal Employees Compensation Act or the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act.

CAC request.
Individuals with a CAC, a computer with internet access and a CAC reader may apply for either a sponsor or a dependent DS Logon credential via the My Access Center website or any application that has implemented DS Logon.
(
1
) A sponsor DS Logon credential is provisioned immediately upon request.
This type of request supports the provisioning of a Premium DS Logon credential.
(

Once complete, this type of request supports the provisioning of a Premium DS Logon credential.
(ii)
Via remote proofing.
Eligible individuals with an existing DEERS record may apply for a sponsor or dependent DS Logon credential using remote proofing via the My Access Center website. Individuals requesting a DS Logon credential via remote proofing must correctly answer a number of system-generated questions. Once remote proofing is completed, a Premium DS Logon credential is provisioned immediately.
(iii)
Via in-person proofing.
Eligible individuals may apply for a sponsor or dependent DS Logon credential using in-person proofing. In-person proofing is performed at Department of Veterans Affairs regional offices where the DS access station application is implemented, and at DoD ID card sites when a DS Logon credential is requested either in conjunction with DoD ID card issuance or during initial enrollment of a surrogate. Once in-person proofing is completed, a Premium DS Logon credential is provisioned immediately. Individuals requesting a DS Logon credential via in-person proofing must present:
(A)
Identity documents.
DS Logon credential applicants must satisfy the identity verification criteria in paragraph 4a of Volume 1 of DoD Manual 1000.13, “DoD Identification (ID) Cards: ID Card Life-Cycle” (available at
http://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/DD/issuances/dodm/100013_vol1.pdf
), by presenting two forms of government-issued ID, one of which must contain a photograph. The requirement for the primary ID to have a photo cannot be waived. Identity documents must be original or a certified copy. All documentation not in English must have a certified English translation.
(B)
Proof of address.
DS Logon credential applicants must present proof of address, if address on the presented ID is different than the address in DEERS.
(C)
DD Form 214, “Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty.”
DS Logon credential applicants must present a DD Form 214 if a veteran who was separated before 1982. If separated from the Reserve Component, a DS Logon credential applicant may present a Reserve Component separation document in lieu of a DD Form 214.
(2)
Use.

(4)
Decommissioning.
DS Logon credentials may be decommissioned by the DS Logon credential holder, via self-service; by an operator, at the request of the DS Logon credential holder; or by the system, when the credential holder no longer has an affiliation
to the DoD or is identified as deceased in DEERS.
(5)
Reactivation.
DS Logon credentials may be reactivated if the person is living and still eligible for the credential.
(d)
Associations.
DS Logon supports several types of associations, including DEERS-identified family relationships and operator-initiated and -approved surrogates.
(1)
Family.
Individuals are connected to one another based on their family relationship information in DEERS. A family relationship must exist in DEERS before the relationship can exist in DS Logon.
(i)
Multiple sponsors.
An individual has only one DS Logon credential, regardless of the number of sponsors the individual has (
e.g.,
a dependent child whose parents are both Service members).
(ii)
Transferring families.
If an individual has a second family in DEERS, the individual can move their DS Logon credential to the second family. This changes the assignment of the DS Logon credential from the first family to the second family and removes any granted permissions from the first family.
(2)
Surrogacy.
Surrogacy is a feature that allows an individual who may not be affiliated with the DoD and who may not be related to the DS Logon credential holder or eligible individual by a DoD-recognized family relationship to be granted access to a DS Logon credential holder's or an eligible individual's information. A surrogate may be established as the custodian of a deceased Service member's unmarried minor child(ren) who is under 18, who is at least 18 but under 23 and attending school full-time, or who is incapacitated. A surrogate may also be established as the agent of an incapacitated dependent (
e.g.,
spouse, parent) or of a wounded, ill, or incapacitated Service member.
(i)
Eligibility.
An operator must first establish an identity in DEERS before establishing the surrogacy association in DS Logon. To establish a surrogate association, the surrogate must present to an operator for approval:
(A) A completed and signed DD Form 3005, “Application for Surrogate Association for DoD Self-Service (DS) Logon.”
(B) Any additional eligibility documents required by the DD Form 3005 which describe the scope of the surrogate's authority.

(D)
Health care agent (HA).
An eligible individual (the patient) names an HA in a durable power of attorney for health care documents to make health care decisions.

A sponsor, a sponsor's spouse, and a sponsor's dependent over the age of 18 can manage who has access to their information (
i.e.,
who has access to view and edit their information and who is eligible to act on their behalf). The provisions of this section may be superseded by order of a court of competent jurisdiction.

(i)
Access granting by a sponsor.
Sponsors may grant their spouse access to the sponsor's information and the information of any sponsor's dependents under the age of 18. Access to the sponsor's information and the information of any sponsor's dependents under the age of 18 may not be granted to any other sponsor's dependent, unless that dependent has been identified as a surrogate.
(ii)
Access granting by a spouse.
Spouses may grant the sponsor access to the spouse's information. Access to the spouse's information may not be granted to any other sponsor's dependent, unless that sponsor's dependent has been identified as a surrogate.

(4) Include a statement that the requester understands that the request may incur processing charges in accordance with paragraph (k) of this section.
(d)
Receipt and Control.
Upon receipt of an MDR request, the DoD Component shall send the requester an acknowledgement and open a file in a formal control system. The acknowledgement shall include the tracking number and date of receipt of the request.
(e)
Simultaneous MDR and FOIA Requests.
DoD Components should be aware of possible requests under both the MDR and the FOIA. In accordance with 32 CFR part 286, if a requester asks for the same information under
the FOIA and the MDR, the DoD Component shall ask the requester to select only one process. If the requester does not select a process, the DoD Component shall process the requested information under the FOIA.
(f)
MDR Document Review Process.
(1) Requests normally will be processed on a first in first out basis by date of receipt.
(2) Every effort shall be made to ensure that a response to an MDR request is provided to the requester within 1 year from the date of receipt.
(3) The DoD Components shall conduct line-by-line reviews of documents responsive to an MDR request to determine if the information contained within the documents continues to adhere to the standards for classification according to Executive Order 13526 Classified National Security Information. This line-by-line review must take into account the unique sensitivity of FGI as outlined in paragraph (h) of this section. In accordance with section 3.6(b) of Executive Order 13526 Classified National Security Information, classified information originating with another U.S. Government agency contained in records of the DoD Components will be referred to the originating agency for a declassification and release determination. Likewise, classified information in a DoD Component's records originating with another DoD Component will be referred to the originating Component. It is the responsibility of the DoD Component originally receiving the MDR request to manage these referrals and to incorporate the other agency's or DoD Component's determinations when preparing the final decision on the request. The review of each document will determine if the document:
(i) No longer meets the standards for classification as established by Executive Order 13526 “Classified National Security Information”, and is therefore declassified in full.
(ii) Contains portions still meeting the standards for classification and is therefore declassified in part and denied in part.
(iii) Still meets the standards for classification in its entirety and is therefore denied in full.
(4) For documents meeting the criteria of paragraphs (f)(3)(i) and (f)(3)(ii) of this section, the DoD Components shall not release any unclassified information exempt from public release pursuant to Exemptions 2 through 9 of the FOIA. DoD 5400.7-R, “DoD Freedom of Information Act Program” provides a more detailed explanation of the FOIA exemptions.
(5) When this process is complete, the DoD Components shall redact all information, both classified and unclassified, determined to be exempt from release as warranted under applicable law and authority. All of the remaining information within the documents, which is determined to be publicly releasable information, shall be provided promptly to the requester.
(g)
Public Access.
In the interest of transparency, the DoD Components should make efforts to post documents released under the MDR program on DoD Component Web sites.
(h)
FGI.
Every effort must be made to ensure that FGI is not subject to declassification without the prior consent of the originating government. Therefore, if a requested document originated with a foreign government or organization and was classified by that government or organization, the DoD Component shall conduct MDR of the document in accordance with DoD 5200.1-R and 32 CFR part 2001.
(i)
Denial of Information.
(1) When classified information is denied, the DoD Component shall advise the requester, in writing:
(i) That information currently and properly classified has been denied (whether a document in its entirety or partially) in accordance with the appropriate sections of Executive Order 13526 Classified National Security Information.
(ii) Of the right to appeal the denial to the DoD Component within 60 days of receipt of the denial.
(iii) Of the mailing address for the appellate authority.
(2) When unclassified information is withheld because it is determined to be exempt from release pursuant to Exemptions 2 through 9 of the FOIA (whether or not classified information
was also withheld within the same document), the DoD Component shall advise the requester that:
(i) Section 3.5(c) of Executive Order 13526 Classified National Security Information allows for the denial of information when withholding it is authorized and warranted under applicable law.
(ii) Unclassified information exempt from public release pursuant to one or more exemptions of the FOIA has been withheld.
(3) For the denial of unclassified information, the requester shall not be given MDR appeal rights because the MDR applies only to the denial of classified information and because the request was not processed under the FOIA.
(4) The DoD Component is not required to confirm or deny the existence or nonexistence of requested information whenever the fact of its existence or nonexistence is itself classified pursuant to Executive Order 13526 Classified National Security Information.
(j)
MDR Appeals.
MDR appeals are for the denial of classified information only. DoD Components shall make an appellate decision within 60 working days of receipt of an MDR appeal. If additional time is required to make a determination, the appellate authority shall notify the requester of the additional time needed and provide the requester with the reason for the extension. When the appellate review is complete, the appellate authority shall notify the requester in writing of the final determination and of the reasons for any denial. If the appellate authority determines that some information remains classified under the provisions of Executive Order 13526 Classified National Security Information, the requester will be advised of the right to appeal the final decision to the ISCAP within 60 days of the final Component decision, in accordance with section 5.3 of Executive Order 13526 Classified National Security Information.
(k)
FEES.
In responding to MDR requests, the DoD Components may charge fees as permitted by 32 CFR Part 2001. Fees for search, review, and reproduction shall be in accordance with the fee schedule in Appendix 2 of Chapter 4 of Volume 11A of DoD 7000.14-R (available at
http://comptroller.defense.gov/fmr/11a/11a_04.pdf
).

(3) Designate a DoD UCNI reviewing official, who shall be authorized to determine that materials or documents contain, do not contain, or no longer contain DoD UCNI.
(c) The Director, Administration and Management shall provide guidance, as needed, to the Heads of the DoD Components regarding 5 U.S.C. 552, as implemented by 32 CFR part 286, as it applies to the DoD UCNI program.
(d) The Heads of the DoD Components shall identify DoD UCNI within their Component and protect it from unauthorized dissemination, consistent with the requirements of 10 U.S.C. 128 and this part.
§ 223.6
Procedures-identifying and controlling DoD UCNI.
(a)
General.
(1) The decision to protect unclassified information as DoD UCNI shall be based on a determination that the unauthorized dissemination of such information could reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on the health and safety of the public or the common defense and security by increasing significantly the likelihood of the illegal production of nuclear weapons or the theft, diversion, or sabotage of DoD SNM, SNM equipment, SNM facilities, or nuclear weapons in DoD custody. This is called the “adverse effects test.”
(2) DoD UCNI shall be identified, controlled, marked, transmitted, and safeguarded in the DoD Components, the Intelligence Community, and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and among DoD contractors, consultants, and grantees. Within NATO, DoD UCNI shall be marked, controlled, and safeguarded as “NATO RESTRICTED” information.
(3) Contracts requiring access to or the preparation of unclassified information that is or could be DoD UCNI shall require compliance with this part and any applicable DoD Component
regulations, and shall specify requirements for identifying, marking, handling, and safeguarding DoD UCNI.
(b)
Identifying DoD UCNI.
(1) To be designated and protected as DoD UCNI, information must:
(i) Be unclassified.
(ii) Pertain to security measures, including plans, procedures, and equipment, for the physical protection of DoD SNM, SNM equipment, SNM facilities, or nuclear weapons in DoD custody.
(iii) Meet the adverse effects test.
(2) Information shall be protected as DoD UCNI if it qualifies for one or more of the categories listed in § 223.7(c) and meets the criteria in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(3) DoD personnel, in making a determination to protect unclassified information as DoD UCNI, shall consider the probability of illegal production of nuclear weapons or of theft, diversion, or sabotage of DoD SNM, SNM equipment, SNM facilities, or nuclear weapons in DoD custody if the information proposed for protection were made available for public disclosure and dissemination. The cognizant official shall consider how the unauthorized disclosure or dissemination of such information could assist a potential adversary in:
(i) Selecting a target for an act of theft, diversion, or sabotage of nuclear weapons in DoD custody, DoD SNM, SNM equipment, or SNM facilities (e.g., relative importance of a facility or the location, form, and quantity of DoD SNM). Information that can be obtained by observation from public areas outside controlled locations should not be considered as DoD UCNI.
(ii) Planning or committing an act of theft, diversion, or sabotage of nuclear weapons in DoD custody, DoD SNM, SNM equipment, or SNM facilities (e.g., design of security systems; building plans; methods and procedures for transfer, accountability, and handling of nuclear weapons or DoD SNM; or security plans, procedures, and capabilities).
(iii) Measuring the success of an act of theft, diversion, or sabotage of nuclear weapons in DoD custody, DoD SNM, SNM equipment, or SNM facilities (e.g., actual or hypothetical consequences of the sabotage of specific vital equipment or facilities).
(iv) Illegally producing a nuclear explosive device (e.g., unclassified nuclear weapon design information useful in designing a primitive nuclear device; location of unique DoD SNM needed to fabricate such a device; or location of a nuclear weapon).
(v) Dispersing DoD SNM in the environment (e.g., location, form, and quantity of DoD SNM).
(c) Where questions or disagreements arise on designation or continued protection of information as DoD UCNI, the reviewing official appointed by the ASD(NCB) shall make the final determination. If a determination cannot be made because applicable guidance is unclear or does not exist, the document or material in question shall be referred to the reviewing official for a determination.
(d)
Access to DoD UCNI.
(1) No explicit designation or security clearance is required for access to DoD UCNI; however, a person granted access to DoD UCNI must have a need to know the specific DoD UCNI to which access is granted in the performance of official duties or of DoD-authorized activities.
(2) The individual granting access to DoD UCNI shall notify each person granted such access of applicable regulations, including the physical protection and access requirements, concerning the protection of DoD UCNI as well as any special dissemination limitations that apply to the specific DoD UCNI to which access is being granted, prior to dissemination of the DoD UCNI to the person.
(3) The requirement to notify persons granted access to DoD UCNI of applicable regulations concerning protection and dissemination of DoD UCNI may be met by attachment of an appropriate cover sheet to the front of each document or material containing DoD UCNI prior to its transmittal to the person granted access.
(e)
Marking DoD UCNI.
(1) An unclassified document with DoD UCNI shall be marked “DOD UNCLASSIFIED CONTROLLED NUCLEAR INFORMATION” (or abbreviated “DOD UCNI”) at the bottom on: the outside of the front cover, if any; the outside of the back cover, if any; the first page; and
each individual page containing DoD UCNI.
(2) Within an unclassified document, an individual page containing DoD UCNI shall be marked to show which of its portions contain DoD UCNI. In marking sections, parts, paragraphs, or similar portions, the parenthetical term “(DCNI)” shall be used and placed at the beginning of the applicable portions.
(3) In a classified document, an individual page that has both DoD UCNI and classified information shall be marked at the top and bottom of the page with the highest security classification of information appearing on that page or with the overall classification of the document. In marking sections, parts, paragraphs, or similar portions, the parenthetical term “(U//DCNI)” shall be used and placed at the beginning of those portions containing DoD UCNI. In a classified document, an individual page that has DoD UCNI, but no classified information, shall be marked “UNCLASSIFIED//DOD UNCLASSIFIED CONTROLLED NUCLEAR INFORMATION” (or “UNCLASSIFIED//DOD UCNI”) at the top and bottom of the page, unless the page is marked with the overall classification of the document. The DoD UCNI information may be included in the same portion with other classified or unclassified information, if all relevant statutory and regulatory markings and citations are included. Volume 2 of DoD Manual 5200.01
4
provides additional guidance on marking classified documents.
4
Available on the Internet at
http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/520001_vol2.pdf.
(4) Other material (e.g., electronic media, photographs, films, tapes, or slides) containing DoD UCNI shall be conspicuously marked “DOD UNCLASSIFIED CONTROLLED NUCLEAR INFORMATION” (or “DOD UCNI”), in accordance with paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(3) of this section, to ensure that a recipient or viewer is aware of the status of the information.
(e)
Dissemination and Transmission.
(1) DoD UCNI may be disseminated among the DoD Components, members of the Intelligence Community, NATO, and DoD contractors, consultants, and grantees on a need-to-know basis for the conduct of official business for the Department of Defense. Dissemination to NATO or other foreign or international entities requires prior review and approval by the appropriate dissemination entity.
(2) Recipients shall be made aware of the status as DoD UCNI for all such information disseminated to them. Transmission of DoD UCNI shall be by means which preclude unauthorized disclosure or dissemination (e.g., secure phone, encrypted email).
(3) Documents containing DoD UCNI shall be marked as prescribed in paragraph (d) of this section. Transmittal documents shall call attention to the presence of DoD UCNI attachments using an appropriate statement in the text or including at the bottom of the transmittal document a statement similar to: “The attached document contains DoD Unclassified Controlled Nuclear Information (DoD UCNI).”
(4) DoD UCNI transmitted outside the Department of Defense requires application of an expanded marking to explain the significance of the DoD UCNI marking. That may be accomplished by adding the transmittal statement “DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE/UNCLASSIFIED CONTROLLED NUCLEAR INFORMATION/EXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE PURSUANT TO 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(3), AS AUTHORIZED BY 10 U.S.C. 128” to the document cover before transfer.
(5) When not commingled with classified information, DoD UCNI may be sent by first-class mail in a single, opaque envelope, or wrapping.
(6) DoD UCNI shall not be discussed or transmitted over an unprotected telephone or telecommunications circuit (to include facsimile transmissions) except in case of an emergency.
(7) Each part of electronically transmitted messages containing DoD UCNI portions shall be marked appropriately. Unclassified messages, including email, with DoD UCNI portions shall have the abbreviation “DOD UCNI” at the top of the message, before the beginning of the text, and the
parenthetical marking “(DCNI)” preceding each portion of text containing DoD UCNI information. Classified messages containing DoD UCNI portions shall be marked with the highest classification of information within the message; use the parenthetical marking “(U//DCNI)” preceding each portion of text containing DoD UCNI information.
(8) DoD UCNI processed, stored, or produced on stand-alone or networked computers or other information technology systems shall enforce protection from unauthorized disclosure or dissemination, in accordance with the procedures in paragraph (f) of this section.
(9) A document marked as having DoD UCNI may be reproduced minimally without permission of the originator and consistent with the need to carry out official business.
(f)
Safeguarding DoD UCNI.
(1) During normal working hours, documents and materials determined to contain DoD UCNI shall be safeguarded and controlled by measures designed to reduce the risk of access to DoD UCNI by unauthorized individuals. Particular attention should be paid to areas where DoD UCNI is used or stored if unescorted access by unauthorized individuals is possible.
(2) At the close of business, DoD UCNI shall be stored to preclude disclosure. Storage of such information with other unclassified information in unlocked receptacles (e.g., desks, bookcases) is adequate if Government or Government-contractor internal building security is provided during non-duty hours. When such internal building security is not provided, locked rooms or buildings normally provide adequate after-hours protection. If such protection is not considered adequate, DoD UCNI shall be stored in locked receptacles (e.g., locked file cabinet, locked desk drawer, safe).
(3) Non-record copies of DoD UCNI shall be destroyed by shredding or burning or, if the sensitivity or volume of the information justifies it, in accordance with the procedures specified by Volume 3 of DoD Manual 5200.01
5
for classified information. Record copies of DoD UCNI shall be disposed of in accordance with the DoD Component's record management regulations. DoD UCNI on magnetic storage media shall be disposed of by overwriting to preclude its reconstruction. DoD UCNI in electronic form shall be deleted and also removed from any desktop trash or recycling files.

http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/520001_vol3.pdf.
(4) Unauthorized dissemination and disclosure of DoD UCNI justifies investigative and administrative actions to determine cause, assess impact, and fix responsibility. The DoD Component that originated the DoD UCNI shall be informed of its unauthorized disclosure and the outcome of the investigative and administrative actions. Unauthorized disclosure of DoD UCNI does not constitute a compromise of classified information.

§ 223.7
Procedures-determination of DoD UCNI.
(a)
Use of the Guidelines.
(1) The guidelines in this section are the basis for determining what unclassified information regarding the physical protection of DoD SNM, SNM equipment, SNM facilities, or nuclear weapons in DoD custody, in a given technical or programmatic subject area are to be designated as DoD UCNI.
(2) The decision to protect unclassified information as DoD UCNI shall be based on a determination that the unauthorized dissemination of such information could reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on the health and safety of the public or the common defense and security by significantly increasing the likelihood of the illegal production of nuclear weapons or the theft, diversion, or sabotage of SNM, SNM equipment, SNM facilities, or nuclear weapons in DoD custody.
(b)
General Guidance.
(1) Unclassified information relating to the physical protection of DoD SNM, SNM equipment, SNM facilities, or nuclear weapons in DoD custody is to be protected from public disclosure to prevent the adverse effects identified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. Public availability of information that would not result in such adverse effects is not to be restricted.
(2) In controlling DoD SNM information, only the minimum restrictions needed to protect the health and safety of the public or the common defense and security shall be applied to prohibit the disclosure and dissemination of DoD UCNI.
(3) Any information that has been, or is, widely and irretrievably disseminated in the public domain and whose dissemination was not, or is not, under Government control is exempt from control under these guidelines. However, the fact that information is in the public domain is not a sufficient basis for determining that similar or updated Government-owned and -controlled information in another document or other material is not, or is no longer, DoD UCNI; case-by-case determinations are required.
(c)
Topical Guidance.
DoD Components shall consider the topics discussed in this section during the preparation of unclassified information that addresses the physical protection of DoD SNM or nuclear weapons in DoD custody to determine if it qualifies for control as DoD UCNI.
(1)
Vulnerability Assessments.
(i) General vulnerabilities that could be associated with specific DoD SNM, SNM equipment, SNM facility locations, or DoD nuclear weapons storage facilities.
(ii) The fact that DoD SNM or nuclear weapons facility security-related projects or upgrades are planned or in progress, if not observable from a public area.
(iii) Identification and description of security system components intended to mitigate the consequences of an accident or act of sabotage at a DoD SNM or nuclear weapons facility.
(2)
Material Control and Accountability.
(i) Total quantity or categories of DoD SNM at a facility.
(ii) Control and accountability plans or procedures.
(iii) Receipts that, cumulatively, would reveal quantities and categories of DoD SNM of potential interest to an adversary.
(iv) Measured discards, decay losses, or losses due to fission and transmutation for a reporting period.
(v) Frequency and schedule of DoD SNM inventories.
(3)
Facility Description.
(i) Maps, conceptual design, and construction drawings of a DoD SNM or nuclear weapons facility showing construction characteristics of building(s) and associated electrical systems, barriers, and back-up power systems not observable from a public area.
(ii) Maps, plans, photographs, or drawings of man-made or natural features in a DoD SNM or nuclear weapons facility not observable from a public area; e.g., tunnels, storm or waste sewers, water intake and discharge conduits, or other features having the
potential for concealing surreptitious movement.
(iii) Communications and computer network configurations and capabilities.
(4)
Intrusion Detection and Security Alarm Systems.
(i) Information on the layout or design of security and alarm systems at a specific DoD SNM or nuclear weapons facility, if the information is not observable from a public area.
(ii) The fact that a particular system make or model has been installed at a specific DoD SNM or nuclear weapons facility, if the information is not observable from a public area.
(iii) Performance characteristics of installed systems.
(5)
Keys, Locks, Combinations, and Tamper-Indicating Devices.
(i) Types and models of keys, locks, and combinations of locks used in DoD SNM or nuclear weapons facilities and during shipment.
(ii) Method of application of tamper-indicating devices.
(iii) Vulnerability information available from unclassified vendor specifications.
(6)
Threat Response Capability and Procedures.
(i) Information about arrangements with local, State, and Federal law enforcement agencies of potential interest to an adversary.
(ii) Information in “non-hostile” contingency plans of potential value to an adversary to defeat a security measure, e.g., fire, safety, nuclear accident, radiological release, or other administrative plans.
(iii) Required response time of security forces.
(7)
Physical Security Evaluations.
(i) Method of evaluating physical security measures not observable from public areas.
(ii) Procedures for inspecting and testing communications and security systems.
(8)
In-Transit Security.

The Federal land manager may issue a permit to any qualified person, subject to appropriate terms and conditions, provided that the person applying for a permit meets conditions in § 229.8(a) of this part.
(b) Exceptions:
(1) No permit shall be required under this part for any person conducting activities on the public lands under other permits, leases, licenses, or entitlements for use, when those activities are exclusively for purposes other than the excavation and/or removal of archaeological resources, even though those activities might incidentally result in the disturbance of archaeological resources. General earth-moving excavation conducted under a permit or other authorization shall not be construed to mean excavation and/or removal as used in this part. This exception does not, however, affect the Federal land manager's responsibility to comply with other authorities which protect archaeological resources prior to approving permits, leases, licenses, or entitlements for use; any excavation and/or removal of archaeological resources required for compliance with those authorities shall be conducted in accordance with the permit requirements of this part.
(2) No permit shall be required under this part for any person collecting for private purposes any rock, coin, bullet, or mineral which is not an archaeological resource as defined in this part, provided that such collecting does not result in disturbance of any archaeological resource.
(3) No permit shall be required under this part or under section 3 of the Act of June 8, 1906 (16 U.S.C. 432), for the excavation or removal by any Indian tribe or member thereof of any archaeological resource located on Indian lands of such Indian tribe, except that in the absence of tribal law regulating the excavation or removal or archaeological resources on Indian lands, an individual tribal member shall be required to obtain a permit under this part;
(4) No permit shall be required under this part for any person to carry out any archaeological activity authorized by a permit issued under section 3 of the Act of June 8, 1906 (16 U.S.C. 432), before the enactment of the Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979. Such permit shall remain in effect according to its terms and conditions until expiration.
(5) No permit shall be required under section 3 of the Act of June 8, 1906 (16 U.S.C. 432) for any archaeological work for which a permit is issued under this part.
(c) Persons carrying out official agency duties under the Federal land manager's direction, associated with the management of archaeological resources, need not follow the permit application procedures of § 229.6. However, the Federal land manager shall insure that provisions of § 229.8 and § 229.9 have been met by other documented means,
and that any official duties which might result in harm to or destruction of any Indian tribal religious or cultural site, as determined by the Federal land manager, have been the subject of consideration under § 229.7.
(d) Upon the written request of the Governor of any State, on behalf of the State or its educational institutions, the Federal land manager shall issue a permit, subject to the provisions of §§ 229.5(b)(5), 229.7, 229.8(a)(3), (4), (5), (6), and (7), 229.9, 229.10, 229.12, and 229.13(a) to such Governor or to such designee as the Governor deems qualified to carry out the intent of the Act, for purposes of conducting archaeological research, excavating and/or removing archaeological resources, and safeguarding and preserving any materials and data collected in a university, museum, or other scientific or educational institution approved by the Federal land manager.
(e) Under other statutory, regulatory, or administrative authorities governing the use of public lands and Indian lands, authorizations may be required for activities which do not require a permit under this part. Any person wishing to conduct on public lands or Indian lands any activities related to but believed to fall outside the scope of this part should consult with the Federal land manager, for the purpose of determining whether any authorization is required, prior to beginning such activities.
§ 229.6
Application for permits and information collection.

The information collection requirement contained in this section of these regulations has been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501
et seq.
and assigned clearance number 1024-0037. The purpose of the information collection is to meet statutory and administrative requirements in the public interest. The information will be used to assist Federal land managers in determining that applicants for permits are qualified, that the work proposed would further archaeological knowledge, that archaeological resources and associated records and data will be properly preserved, and that the permitted activity would not conflict with the management of the public lands involved. Response to the information requirement is necessary in order for an applicant to obtain a benefit.
§ 229.7
Notification to Indian tribes of possible harm to, or destruction of, sites on public lands having religious or cultural importance.
(a) If the issuance of a permit under this part may result in harm to, or destruction of, any Indian tribal religious or cultural site on public lands, as determined by the Federal land manager, at least 30 days before issuing such a permit the Federal land manager shall notify any Indian tribe which may consider the site as having religious or cultural importance. Such notice shall not be deemed a disclosure to the public for purposes of section 9 of the Act.
(1) Notice by the Federal land manager to any Indian tribe shall be sent to the chief executive officer or other designated official of the tribe. Indian tribes are encouraged to designate a tribal official to be the focal point for any notification and discussion between the tribe and the Federal land manager.
(2) The Federal land manager may provide notice to any other Native American group that is known by the Federal land manager to consider sites potentially affected as being of religious or cultural importance.
(3) Upon request during the 30-day period, the Federal land manager may meet with official representatives of any Indian tribe or group to discuss their interests, including ways to avoid or mitigate potential harm or destruction such as excluding sites from the permit area. Any mitigation measures which are adopted shall be incorporated into the terms and conditions of the permit under § 229.9.
(4) When the Federal land manager determines that a permit applied for under this part must be issued immediately because of an imminent threat of loss or destruction of an archaeological resource, the Federal land manager shall so notify the appropriate tribe.
(b)(1) In order to identify sites of religious or cultural importance, the Federal land manager shall seek to identify all Indian tribes having aboriginal or historic ties to the lands under the Federal land manager's jurisdiction and seek to determine, from the chief executive officer or other designated official of any such tribe, the location and nature of specific sites of religious or cultural importance so that such information may be on file for land management purposes. Information on sites eligible for or included in the National Register of Historic Places may be withheld from public disclosure pursuant to section 304 of the Act of October 15, 1966, as amended (16 U.S.C. 470w-3).
(2) If the Federal land manager becomes aware of a Native American group that is not an Indian tribe as defined in this part but has aboriginal or historic ties to public lands under the Federal land manager's jurisdiction, the Federal land manager may seek to communicate with official representatives of that group to obtain information on sites they may consider to be of religious or cultural importance.
(3) The Federal land manager may enter into agreement with any Indian tribe or other Native American group for determining locations for which such tribe or group wishes to receive notice under this section.
(4) The Federal land manager should also seek to determine, in consultation with official representatives of Indian tribes or other Native American groups, what circumstances should be the subject of special notification to the tribe or group after a permit has been issued. Circumstances calling for
notification might include the discovery of human remains. When circumstances for special notification have been determined by the Federal land manager, the Federal land manager will include a requirement in the terms and conditions of permits, under § 229.9(c), for permittees to notify the Federal land manager immediately upon the occurrence of such circumstances. Following the permittee's notification, the Federal land manager will notify and consult with the tribe or group as appropriate. In cases involving Native American human remains and other “cultural items”, as defined by NAGPRA, the Federal land manager is referred to NAGPRA and its implementing
§ 229.8

§ 229.12
Relationship to section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act.
Issuance of a permit in accordance with the Act and this part does not constitute an undertaking requiring compliance with section 106 of the Act of October 15, 1966 (16 U.S.C. 470f). However, the mere issuance of such a permit does not excuse the Federal land manager from compliance with section 106 where otherwise required.
§ 229.13

§ 229.14
Determination of archaeological or commercial value and cost of restoration and repair.
(a)
Archaeological value.
For purposes of this part, the archaeological value of any archaeological resource involved in a violation of the prohibitions in § 229.4 of this part or conditions of a permit issued pursuant to this part shall be the value of the information associated with the archaeological resource. This value shall be appraised in terms of the costs of the retrieval of the scientific information which would have been obtainable prior to the violation. These costs may include, but need not be limited to, the cost of preparing a research design, conducting field work, carrying out laboratory analysis, and preparing reports as would be necessary to realize the information potential.
(b)
Commercial value.
For purposes of this part, the commercial value of any archaeological resource involved in a violation of the prohibitions in § 229.4 of this part or conditions of a permit issued pursuant to this part shall be its fair market value. Where the violation has resulted in damage to the archaeological resource, the fair market value should be determined using the condition of the archaeological resource prior to the violation, to the extent that its prior condition can be ascertained.
(c)
Cost of restoration and repair.
For purposes of this part, the cost of restoration and repair of archaeological resources damaged as a result of a violation of prohibitions or conditions pursuant to this part, shall be the sum of the costs already incurred for emergency restoration or repair work, plus those costs projected to be necessary to complete restoration and repair, which may include, but need not be limited to, the costs of the following:

§ 229.16
Civil penalty amounts.
(a)
Maximum amount of penalty.
(1) Where the person being assessed a civil penalty has not committed any previous violation of any prohibition in § 229.4 or of any term or condition included in a permit issued pursuant to

(i) Agreement by the person being assessed a civil penalty to return to the Federal land manager archaeological resources removed from public lands or Indian lands;
(ii) Agreement by the person being assessed a civil penalty to assist the Federal land manager in activity to preserve, restore, or otherwise contribute to the protection and study of archaeological resources on public lands or Indian lands;

(e) The Secretaries of the Interior, Agriculture, and Defense and the Chairman of the Tennessee Valley Authority will develop a system for documenting and reporting suspected violations of the various provisions of the Act. This system will reference a set of procedures for use by officers, employees, or agents of Federal agencies to assist them in recognizing violations, documenting relevant evidence, and reporting assembled information to the appropriate authorities. Methods employed to document and report such violations should be compatible with existing agency reporting systems for documenting violations of other appropriate Federal statutes and regulations. Summary information to be included in the Secretary's comprehensive report will be based upon the system developed by each Federal land manager for documenting suspected violations.

§ 230.1
Purpose.
This part:
(a) Updates policies and responsibilities for financial institutions that serve Department of Defense (DoD) personnel on DoD installations worldwide. Associated procedures are contained in 32 CFR part 231.
(b) Prescribes consistent arrangements for the provision of services by financial institutions among the DoD Components, and requires that financial institutions operating on DoD installations provide, and are provided, support consistent with the policies stated in this part.
§ 230.2
Applicability.
This part applies to the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), the Military Departments, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), the Combatant Commands, the Inspector General of the Department of Defense, the Defense Agencies, the DoD Field Activities, and all other organizational entities within the Department of Defense (hereafter collectively referred to as “the DoD Components”) and all nonappropriated fund instrumentalities including the Military Exchange Services and morale, welfare and recreation (MWR) activities.
§ 230.3
Definitions.
Terms used in this part are set forth in 32 CFR part 231.
§ 230.4
Policy.
(a) The following pertains to financial institutions on DoD installations:
(1) Except where they already may exist as of May 1, 2000, no more than one banking institution and one credit union shall be permitted to operate on a DoD installation.
(2) Upon the request of an installation commander and with the approval of the Secretary of the Military Department concerned (or designee), duly chartered financial institutions may be authorized to provide financial services on DoD installations to enhance the morale and welfare of DoD personnel and facilitate the administration of public and quasi-public monies. Arrangement for the provision of such services shall be in accordance with this part and the applicable provisions of 32 CFR part 231.
(3) Financial institutions or branches thereof, shall be established on DoD installations only after approval by the Secretary of the Military Department
concerned (or designee) and the appropriate regulatory agency.
(i) Except in limited situations overseas (see paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section), only banking institutions insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and credit unions insured by the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund or by another insurance organization specifically qualified by the Secretary of the Treasury, shall operate on DoD installations. These financial institutions may either be State or federally chartered; however, U.S. credit unions operated overseas shall be federally insured.
(ii) Military banking facilities (MBFs) shall be established on DoD installations only when a demonstrated and justified need cannot be met through other means. An MBF is a financial institution that is established by the Department of the Treasury under statutory authority that is separate from State or Federal laws that govern commercial banking. Section 265 of title 12, United States Code contains the provisions for the Department of the Treasury to establish MBFs. Normally, MBFs shall be authorized only at overseas locations. This form of financial institution may be considered for use at domestic DoD installations only when the cognizant DoD Component has been unable to obtain, through normal means, financial services from a State or federally chartered financial institution authorized to operate in the State in which the installation is located. In times of mobilization, it may become necessary to designate additional MBFs as an emergency measure. The Director, Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) may recommend the designation of MBFs to the Department of the Treasury.
(iii) Retail banking operations shall not be performed by any DoD Component. Solicitations for such services shall be issued, or proposals accepted, only in accordance with the policies identified in this part. The DoD Components shall rely on commercially available sources in accordance with DoD Directive 4100.15.

See footnote 1 to § 231.1(a).
(4) Installation commanders shall not seek the provision of financial services from any entity other than the on-base banking office or credit union. The Director, DFAS, with the concurrence of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) (USD(C)), may approve exceptions to this policy.
(5) Financial institutions authorized to locate on DoD installations shall be provided logistic support as set forth in 32 CFR part 231.
(6) Military disbursing offices, nonappropriated fund instrumentalities (including MWR activities and the Military Exchange Services) and other DoD Component activities requiring financial services shall use on-base financial institutions to the maximum extent feasible.
(7) The Department encourages the delivery of retail financial services on DoD installations via nationally networked automated teller machines (ATMs).
(i) ATMs are considered electronic banking services and, as such, shall be provided only by financial institutions that are chartered and insured in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
(ii) Proposals by the installation commander to install ATMs from other than on-base financial institutions shall comply with the provisions of paragraph (a)(4) of this section.
(8) Expansion of financial services (to include in-store banking) requiring the outgrant of additional space or logistical support shall be approved by the installation commander. Any DoD activity or financial institution seeking to expand financial services shall coordinate such requests with the installation bank/credit union liaison officer prior to the commander's consideration.
(9) The installation commander shall ensure, to the maximum extent feasible, that all financial institutions operating on that installation are given the opportunity to participate in pilot programs to demonstrate new financial-related technology or establish new business lines (e.g., in-store banking) where a determination has been made by the respective DoD Component that the offering of such services is warranted.
(10) The installation commander shall approve requests for termination of financial services that are substantiated by sufficient evidence and forwarded to the Secretary of the Military Department concerned (or designee). The Secretary of the Military Department (or designee) shall coordinate such requests with the USD(C), through the Director, DFAS, before notification to the appropriate regulatory agency.
(11) Additional guidance pertaining to financial services is set forth in 32 CFR part 231.
(b) The following additional provisions pertain only to financial institutions on overseas DoD installations:
(1) The extension of services by MBFs and credit unions overseas shall be consistent with the policies stated in this part and with the applicable status of forces agreements, other intergovernmental agreements, or host-country law.
(2) Financial services at overseas DoD installations may be provided by:
(i) Domestic on-base credit unions operating overseas under a geographic franchise and, where applicable, as authorized by the pertinent status of forces agreements, other intergovernmental agreements, or host-country law.
(ii) MBFs operated under and authorized by the pertinent status of forces agreement, other intergovernmental agreement, or host-country law.
(iii) Domestic and foreign banks located on overseas DoD installations that are:
(A) Chartered to provide financial services in that country, and
(B) A party to a formal operating agreement with the installation commander to provide such services, and
(C) Identified, where applicable, in the status of forces agreements, other intergovernmental agreements, or host-country law.
(3) In countries served by MBFs operated under contract, nonappropriated fund instrumentalities and on-base credit unions that desire, and are authorized, to provide accommodation exchange services shall acquire foreign currency from the MBF at the MBF accommodation rate; and shall sell such foreign currency at a rate of exchange that is no more favorable to the customer than the customer rate available at the MBF.
§ 230.5
Responsibilities.
(a) The Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) (USD(C)) shall develop policies governing establishment, operation, and termination of financial institutions on DoD installations and take final action on requests for exceptions to this part.
(b) The Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology and Logistics) (USD(AT
L)) shall monitor policies and procedures governing logistical support furnished to financial institutions on DoD installations, including the use of DoD real property and equipment.
(c) The Under Secretary of Defense (Personnel and Readiness) (USD(P
R)) shall advise the USD(C) on all aspects of on-base financial institution services that affect the morale and welfare of DoD personnel.
