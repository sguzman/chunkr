The election to apply this section shall be made on the taxpayer's timely filed
(including extensions) income tax return for the taxable year in which the assets included in the general asset account are placed in service by the taxpayer.
(3)
Manner of making election.
In the year of election, a taxpayer makes the election under this section by typing or legibly printing at the top of the Form 4562, “GENERAL ASSET ACCOUNT ELECTION MADE UNDER SECTION 168(i)(4),” or in the manner provided for on Form 4562 and its instructions. The taxpayer shall maintain records (for example, “General Asset Account #1—all 1995 additions in asset class 00.11 for Salt Lake City, Utah facility”) that identify the assets included in each general asset account, that establish the unadjusted depreciable basis and depreciation reserve of the general asset account, and that reflect the amount realized during the taxable year upon dispositions from each general asset account. (But see section 179(c) and § 1.179-5 for the recordkeeping requirements for section 179 property.) The taxpayer's recordkeeping practices should be consistently applied to the general asset accounts. If Form 4562 is revised or renumbered, any reference in this section to that form shall be treated as a reference to the revised or renumbered form.

§ 1.168(i)-2
Lease term.
(a)
In general.
For purposes of section 168, a lease term is determined under all the facts and circumstances. Paragraph (b) of this section and § 1.168(j)-
1T, Q
A 17, describe certain circumstances that will result in a period of time not included in the stated duration of an original lease (additional period) nevertheless being included in the lease term. These rules do not prevent the inclusion of an additional period in the lease term in other circumstances.
(b)
Lessee retains financial obligation
—(1)
In general.
An additional period of time during which a lessee may not continue to be the lessee will nevertheless be included in the lease term if the lessee (or a related person)—
(i) Has agreed that one or both of them will or could be obligated to make a payment of rent or a payment in the nature of rent with respect to such period; or
(ii) Has assumed or retained any risk of loss with respect to the property for such period (including, for example, by holding a note secured by the property).
(2)
Payments in the nature of rent.
For purposes of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, a payment in the nature of rent includes a payment intended to substitute for rent or to fund or supplement the rental payments of another. For example, a payment in the nature of rent includes a payment of any kind (whether denominated as supplemental rent, as liquidated damages, or otherwise) that is required to be made in the event that—
(i) The leased property is not leased for the additional period;
(ii) The leased property is leased for the additional period under terms that do not satisfy specified terms and conditions;
(iii) There is a failure to make a payment of rent with respect to such additional period; or
(iv) Circumstances similar to those described in paragraph (b)(2) (i), (ii), or (iii) of this section occur.
(3)
De minimis rule.
For the purposes of this paragraph (b), obligations to make de minimis payments will be disregarded.
(c)
Multiple leases or subleases.
If property is subject to more than one lease (including any sublease) entered into as part of a single transaction (or a series of related transactions), the lease term includes all periods described in one or more of such leases. For example, if one taxable corporation leases property to another taxable corporation for a 20-year term and, as part of the same transaction, the lessee subleases the property to a tax-exempt entity for a 10-year term, then the lease term of the property for purposes of section 168 is 20 years. During the period of tax-exempt use, the property must be depreciated under the alternative depreciation system using the straight line method over the greater of its class life or 25 years (125 percent of the 20-year lease term).
(d)
Related person.
For purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, a person is related to the lessee if such person is described in section 168(h)(4).
(e)
Changes in status.
Section 168(i)(5) (changes in status) applies if an additional period is included in a lease term under this section and the leased property ceases to be tax-exempt use property for such additional period.
(f)
Example.
The following example illustrates the principles of this section. The example does not address common law doctrines or other authorities that may apply to cause an additional period to be included in the lease term or to recharacterize a lease as a conditional sale or otherwise for federal income tax purposes. Unless otherwise indicated, parties to the transactions are not related to one another.

# Example. Financial obligation with respect to an additional period.
(i)
Facts.
X, a taxable corporation, and Y, a foreign airline whose income is not subject to United States taxation, enter into a lease agreement under which X agrees to lease an aircraft to Y for a period of 10 years. The lease agreement provides that, at the end of the lease period, Y is obligated to find a subsequent lessee (replacement lessee) to enter into a subsequent lease (replacement lease) of the aircraft from X for an additional 10-year period. The provisions of the lease agreement require that any replacement lessee be unrelated to Y and that it not be a tax-exempt entity as defined in section 168(h)(2). The provisions of the lease agreement also set forth the basic terms and conditions of the replacement lease, including its duration and the required rental payments. In the event Y fails to secure a replacement lease, the lease agreement requires Y to make a payment to X in an amount determined under the lease agreement.
(ii)
Application of this section.
The lease agreement between X and Y obligates Y to make a payment in the event the aircraft is
not leased for the period commencing after the initial 10-year lease period and ending on the date the replacement lease is scheduled to end. Accordingly, pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, the term of the lease between X and Y includes such additional period, and the lease term is 20 years for purposes of section 168.
(iii)
Facts modified.
Assume the same facts as in paragraph (i) of this
Example,
except that Y is required to guarantee the payment of rentals under the 10-year replacement lease and to make a payment to X equal to the present value of any excess of the replacement lease rental payments specified in the lease agreement between X and Y, over the rental payments actually agreed to be paid by the replacement lessee. Pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, the term of the lease between X and Y includes the additional period, and the lease term is 20 years for purposes of section 168.
(iv)
Changes in status.
If, upon the conclusion of the stated duration of the lease between X and Y, the aircraft either is returned to X or leased to a replacement lessee that is not a tax-exempt entity as defined in section 168(h)(2), the subsequent method of depreciation will be determined pursuant to section 168(i)(5).
(g)
Effective date
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (g)(2) of this section, this section applies to leases entered into on or after April 20, 1995.
(2)
Special rules.
Paragraphs (b)(1)(ii) and (c) of this section apply to leases entered into after April 26, 1996.

§ 1.168(i)-3
Treatment of excess deferred income tax reserve upon disposition of deregulated public utility property.
(a)
Scope
—(1)
In general.
This section provides rules for the application of section 203(e) of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, Public Law 99-514 (100 Stat. 2146) to a taxpayer with respect to public utility property (within the meaning of section 168(i)(10)) that ceases, whether by disposition, deregulation, or otherwise, to be public utility property with respect to the taxpayer and that is not described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section (deregulated public utility property).
(2)
Exceptions.
This section does not apply to the following property:
(i) Property that ceases to be public utility property with respect to the taxpayer on account of an ordinary retirement within the meaning of § 1.167(a)-11(d)(3)(ii).
(ii) Property transferred by the taxpayer if after the transfer the property is public utility property of the transferee and the taxpayer's excess tax reserve with respect to the property (within the meaning of section 203(e) of the Tax Reform Act of 1986) is treated as an excess tax reserve of the transferee with respect to the property.
(b)
Amount of reduction.
If public utility property of a taxpayer becomes deregulated public utility property to which this section applies, the reduction in the taxpayer's excess tax reserve permitted under section 203(e) of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 is equal to the amount by which the reserve could be reduced under that provision if all such property had remained public utility property of the taxpayer and the taxpayer had continued use of its normalization method of accounting with respect to such property.
(c)
Cross reference.
See § 1.46-6(k) for rules relating to the treatment of accumulated deferred investment tax credits when utilities dispose of regulated public utility property.
(d)
Effective/applicability dates
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, this section applies to public utility property that becomes deregulated public utility property after December 21, 2005.
(2)
Property that becomes public utility property of the transferee.
This section does not apply to property that becomes deregulated public utility property with respect to a taxpayer on account of a transfer on or before March 20, 2008 if after the transfer the property is public utility property of the transferee.
(3)
Application of regulation project (REG-104385-01).
A reduction in the taxpayer's excess deferred income tax reserve will be treated as ratable if it is consistent with the proposed rules in regulation project (REG-104385-01) (68 FR 10190) March 4, 2003, and occurs during the period beginning on March 5, 2003, and ending on the earlier of—
(i) The last date on which the utility's rates are determined under the rate order in effect on December 21, 2005; or
(ii) December 21, 2007.
[T.D. 9387, 73 FR 14937, Mar. 20, 2008]
§ 1.168(i)-4
Changes in use.
(a)
Scope.
This section provides the rules for determining the depreciation allowance for MACRS property (as defined in § 1.168(b)-1T(a)(2)) for which the use changes in the hands of the same taxpayer (change in the use). The allowance for depreciation under this section constitutes the amount of depreciation allowable under section 167(a) for the year of change and any subsequent taxable year. For purposes of this section, the year of change is the taxable year in which a change in the use occurs.
(b)
Conversion to business or income-producing use
—(1)
Depreciation deduction allowable.
This paragraph (b) applies to property that is converted from personal use to use in a taxpayer's trade or business, or for the production of income, during a taxable year. This conversion includes property that was previously used by the taxpayer for personal purposes, including real property (other than land) that is acquired before 1987 and converted from personal use to business or income-producing use after 1986, and depreciable property that was previously used by a tax-exempt entity before the entity changed to a taxable entity. Except as otherwise provided by the Internal Revenue Code or regulations under the Internal Revenue Code, upon a conversion to business or income-producing use, the depreciation allowance for the year of change and any subsequent taxable year is determined as though the property is placed in service by the taxpayer on the date on which the conversion occurs. Thus, except as otherwise provided by the Internal Revenue Code or regulations under the Internal Revenue Code, the taxpayer must use any applicable depreciation method, recovery period, and convention prescribed under section 168 for the property in the year of change, consistent with any election made under section 168 by the taxpayer for that year (see, for example, section 168(b)(5)). See §§ 1.168(k)-1(f)(6)(iii) or 1.168(k)-2(g)(6)(iii), as applicable, and 1.1400L(b)-1(f)(6) for the additional first year depreciation deduction rules applicable to a conversion to business or income-producing use. The depreciable basis of the property for the year of change is the lesser of its fair market value or its adjusted depreciable basis (as defined in § 1.168(b)-1T(a)(4)), as applicable, at the time of the conversion to business or income-producing use.
(2)
Example.
The application of this paragraph (b) is illustrated by the following example:

# Example. A,
a calendar-year taxpayer, purchases a house in 1985 that she occupies as her principal residence. In February 2004,
A
ceases to occupy the house and converts it to residential rental property. At the time of the conversion to residential rental property, the house's fair market value (excluding land) is $130,000 and adjusted depreciable basis attributable to the house (excluding land) is $150,000. Pursuant to this paragraph (b),
A
is considered to have placed in service residential rental property in February 2004 with a depreciable basis of $130,000.
A
depreciates the residential rental property under the general depreciation system by using the straight-line method, a 27.5-year recovery period, and the mid-month convention. Pursuant to §§ 1.168(k)-1T(f)(6)(iii)(B) or 1.1400L(b)-1T(f)(6), this property is not eligible for the additional first year depreciation deduction provided by section 168(k) or section 1400L(b). Thus, the depreciation allowance for the house for 2004 is $4,137, after taking into account the mid-month convention (($130,000 adjusted depreciable basis multiplied by the applicable depreciation rate of 3.636% (1/27.5)) multiplied by the mid-month convention fraction of 10.5/12). The amount of depreciation computed under section 168, however, may be limited under other provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, such as, section 280A.
(c)
Conversion to personal use.
The conversion of MACRS property from business or income-producing use to personal use during a taxable year is treated as a disposition of the property in that taxable year. The depreciation allowance for MACRS property for the year of change in which the property is treated as being disposed of is determined by first multiplying the adjusted depreciable basis of the property as of the first day of the year of change by the applicable depreciation rate for that taxable year (for further guidance, for example, see section 6 of Rev. Proc. 87-57 (1987-2 C. B. 687, 692) (see § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(
b
) of this chapter)). This amount is then multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of months (including fractions of months) the property is deemed to be placed in service during the year of change (taking into account the applicable convention) and the denominator of which is 12. No depreciation deduction is allowable for MACRS property placed in service and disposed of in the same taxable year. See §§ 1.168(k)-1(f)(6)(ii)or 1.168(k)-2(g)(6)(ii), as applicable, and 1.1400L(b)-1(f)(6) for the additional first year depreciation deduction rules applicable to property placed in service and converted to personal use in the same taxable year. Upon the conversion to personal use, no gain, loss, or depreciation recapture under section 1245 or section 1250 is recognized. However, the provisions of section 1245 or section 1250 apply to any disposition of the converted property by the taxpayer at a later date. For listed property (as defined in section 280F(d)(4)), see section 280F(b)(2) for the recapture of excess depreciation upon the conversion to personal use.
(d)
Change in the use results in a different recovery period and/or depreciation method
—(1)
In general.
This paragraph (d) applies to a change in the use of MACRS property during a taxable year subsequent to the placed-in-service year, if the property continues to be MACRS property owned by the same taxpayer and, as a result of the change in the use, has a different recovery period, a different depreciation method, or both. For example, this paragraph (d) applies to MACRS property that—
(i) Begins or ceases to be used predominantly outside the United States;
(ii) Results in a reclassification of the property under section 168(e) due to a change in the use of the property; or
(iii) Begins or ceases to be tax-exempt use property (as defined in section 168(h)).
(2)
Determination of change in the use
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, a change in the use of MACRS property occurs when the primary use of the MACRS property in the taxable year is different from its primary use in the immediately preceding taxable year. The primary use of MACRS property may be determined in any reasonable manner that is consistently applied to the taxpayer's MACRS property.
(ii)
Alternative depreciation system property
—(A)
Property used within or outside the United States.
A change in the use of MACRS property occurs when a taxpayer begins or ceases to use MACRS property predominantly outside the United States during the taxable year. The determination of whether MACRS property is used predominantly outside the United States is made in accordance with the test in § 1.48-1(g)(1)(i) for determining predominant use.
(B)
Tax-exempt bond financed property.
A change in the use of MACRS property occurs when the property changes to tax-exempt bond financed property, as described in section 168(g)(1)(C) and (g)(5), during the taxable year. For purposes of this paragraph (d), MACRS property changes to tax-exempt bond financed property when a tax-exempt bond is first issued after the MACRS property is placed in service. MACRS property continues to be tax-exempt bond financed property in the hands of the taxpayer even if the tax-exempt bond (including any refunding issue) is no longer outstanding or is redeemed.
(C)
Other mandatory alternative depreciation system property.
A change in the use of MACRS property occurs when the property changes to, or changes from, property described in section 168(g)(1)(B) (tax-exempt use property) or (D) (imported property covered by an Executive order) during the taxable year.
(iii)
Change in the use deemed to occur on first day of the year of change.
If a change in the use of MACRS property occurs under this paragraph (d)(2), the depreciation allowance for that MACRS property for the year of change is determined as though the use of the MACRS property changed on the first day of the year of change.
(3)
Change in the use results in a shorter recovery period and/or a more accelerated depreciation method
—(i)
Treated as placed in service in the year of change
—(A)
In general.
If a change in the use results in the MACRS property changing to a shorter recovery period and/or a depreciation method that is more accelerated than the method used for the MACRS property before the change in the use, the depreciation allowances
beginning in the year of change are determined as though the MACRS property is placed in service by the taxpayer in the year of change.
(B)
Computation of depreciation allowance.
The depreciation allowances for the MACRS property for any 12-month taxable year beginning with the year of change are determined by multiplying the adjusted depreciable basis of the MACRS property as of the first day of each taxable year by the applicable depreciation rate for each taxable year. In determining the applicable depreciation rate for the year of change and subsequent taxable years, the taxpayer must use any applicable depreciation method and recovery period prescribed under section 168 for the MACRS property in the year of change, consistent with any election made under section 168 by the taxpayer for that year (see, for example, section 168(b)(5)). If there is a change in the use of MACRS property, the applicable convention that applies to the MACRS property is the same as the convention that applied before the change in the use of the MACRS property. However, the depreciation allowance for the year of change for the MACRS property is determined without applying the applicable convention, unless the MACRS property is disposed of during the year of change. See paragraph (d)(5) of this section for the rules relating to the computation of the depreciation allowance under the optional depreciation tables. If the year of change or any subsequent taxable year is less than 12 months, the depreciation allowance determined under this paragraph (d)(3)(i) must be adjusted for a short taxable year (for further guidance, for example, see Rev. Proc. 89-15 (1989-1 C.B. 816) (see § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(
b
) of this chapter)).
(C)
Special rules.
MACRS property affected by this paragraph (d)(3)(i) is not eligible in the year of change for the election provided under section 168(f)(1), 179, or 1400L(f), or for the additional first year depreciation deduction provided in section 168(k) or 1400L(b). See §§ 1.168(k)-1(f)(6)(iv) or 1.168(k)-2(g)(6)(iv), as applicable, and 1.1400L(b)-1(f)(6) for other additional first year depreciation deduction rules applicable to a change in the use of MACRS property subsequent to its placed-in-service year. For purposes of determining whether the mid-quarter convention applies to other MACRS property placed in service during the year of change, the unadjusted depreciable basis (as defined in § 1.168(b)-1T(a)(3)) or the adjusted depreciable basis of MACRS property affected by this paragraph (d)(3)(i) is not taken into account.
(ii)
Option to disregard the change in the use.
In lieu of applying paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, the taxpayer may elect to determine the depreciation allowance as though the change in the use had not occurred. The taxpayer elects this option by claiming on the taxpayer's timely filed (including extensions) Federal income tax return for the year of change the depreciation allowance for the property as though the change in the use had not occurred. See paragraph (g)(2) of this section for the manner for revoking this election.
(4)
Change in the use results in a longer recovery period and/or a slower depreciation method
—(i)
Treated as originally placed in service with longer recovery period and/or slower depreciation method.
If a change in the use results in a longer recovery period and/or a depreciation method for the MACRS property that is less accelerated than the method used for the MACRS property before the change in the use, the depreciation allowances beginning with the year of change are determined as though the MACRS property had been originally placed in service by the taxpayer with the longer recovery period and/or the slower depreciation method. MACRS property affected by this paragraph (d)(4) is not eligible in the year of change for the election provided under section 168(f)(1), 179, or 1400L(f), or for the additional first year depreciation deduction provided in section 168(k) or 1400L(b). See §§ 1.168(k)-1(f)(6)(iv) or 1.168(k)-2(g)(6)(iv), as applicable, and 1.1400L(b)-1(f)(6) for other additional first year depreciation deduction rules applicable to a change in the use of MACRS property subsequent to its placed-in-service year.
(ii)
Computation of the depreciation allowance.
The depreciation allowances for the MACRS property for any 12-month taxable year beginning with the
year of change are determined by multiplying the adjusted depreciable basis of the MACRS property as of the first day of each taxable year by the applicable depreciation rate for each taxable year. If there is a change in the use of MACRS property, the applicable convention that applies to the MACRS property is the same as the convention that applied before the change in the use of the MACRS property. If the year of change or any subsequent taxable year is less than 12 months, the depreciation allowance determined under this paragraph (d)(4)(ii) must be adjusted for a short taxable year (for further guidance, for example, see Rev. Proc. 89-15 (1989-1 C.B. 816) (see § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(
b
) of this chapter)). See paragraph (d)(5) of this section for the rules relating to the computation of the depreciation allowance under the optional depreciation tables. In determining the applicable depreciation rate for the year of change and any subsequent taxable year—
(A) The applicable depreciation method is the depreciation method that would apply in the year of change and any subsequent taxable year for the MACRS property had the taxpayer used the longer recovery period and/or the slower depreciation method in the placed-in-service year of the property. If the 200-or 150-percent declining balance method would have applied in the placed-in-service year but the method would have switched to the straight line method in the year of change or any prior taxable year, the applicable depreciation method beginning with the year of change is the straight line method; and
(B) The applicable recovery period is either—
(
1
) The longer recovery period resulting from the change in the use if the applicable depreciation method is the 200-or 150-percent declining balance method (as determined under paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(A) of this section) unless the recovery period did not change as a result of the change in the use, in which case the applicable recovery period is the same recovery period that applied before the change in the use; or
(
2
) The number of years remaining as of the beginning of each taxable year (taking into account the applicable convention) had the taxpayer used the longer recovery period in the placed-in-service year of the property if the applicable depreciation method is the straight line method (as determined under paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(A) of this section) unless the recovery period did not change as a result of the change in the use, in which case the applicable recovery period is the number of years remaining as of the beginning of each taxable year (taking into account the applicable convention) based on the recovery period that applied before the change in the use.
(5)
Using optional depreciation tables
—(i)
Taxpayer not bound by prior use of table.
If a taxpayer used an optional depreciation table for the MACRS property before a change in the use, the taxpayer is not bound to use the appropriate new table for that MACRS property beginning in the year of change (for further guidance, for example, see section 8 of Rev. Proc. 87-57 (1987-2 C.B. 687, 693) (see § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(
b
) of this chapter)). If a taxpayer did not use an optional depreciation table for MACRS property before a change in the use and the change in the use results in a shorter recovery period and/or a more accelerated depreciation method (as described in paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section), the taxpayer may use the appropriate new table for that MACRS property beginning in the year of change. If a taxpayer chooses not to use the optional depreciation table, the depreciation allowances for the MACRS property beginning in the year of change are determined under paragraph (d)(3)(i) or (4) of this section, as applicable.
(ii)
Taxpayer chooses to use optional depreciation table after a change in the use.
If a taxpayer chooses to use an optional depreciation table for the MACRS property after a change in the use, the depreciation allowances for the MACRS property for any 12-month taxable year beginning with the year of change are determined as follows:
(A)
Change in the use results in a shorter recovery period and/or a more accelerated depreciation method.
If a change in the use results in a shorter recovery
period and/or a more accelerated depreciation method (as described in paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section), the depreciation allowances for the MACRS property for any 12-month taxable year beginning with the year of change are determined by multiplying the adjusted depreciable basis of the MACRS property as of the first day of the year of change by the annual depreciation rate for each recovery year (expressed as a decimal equivalent) specified in the appropriate optional depreciation table. The appropriate optional depreciation table for the MACRS property is based on the depreciation system, depreciation method, recovery period, and convention applicable to the MACRS property in the year of change as determined under paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section. The depreciation allowance for the year of change for the MACRS property is determined by taking into account the applicable convention (which is already factored into the optional depreciation tables). If the year of change or any subsequent taxable year is less than 12 months, the depreciation allowance determined under this paragraph (d)(5)(ii)(A) must be adjusted for a short taxable year (for further guidance, for example, see Rev. Proc. 89-15 (1989-1 C.B. 816) (see § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(
b
) of this chapter)).
(B)
Change in the use results in a longer recovery period and/or a slower depreciation method
—(

)
Determination of the appropriate optional depreciation table.
If a change in the use results in a longer recovery period and/or a slower depreciation method (as described in paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section), the depreciation allowances for the MACRS property for any 12-month taxable year beginning with the year of change are determined by choosing the optional depreciation table that corresponds to the depreciation system, depreciation method, recovery period, and convention that would have applied to the MACRS property in the placed-in-service year had that property been originally placed in service by the taxpayer with the longer recovery period and/or the slower depreciation method. If there is a change in the use of MACRS property, the applicable convention that applies to the MACRS property is the same as the convention that applied before the change in the use of the MACRS property. If the year of change or any subsequent taxable year is less than 12 months, the depreciation allowance determined under this paragraph (d)(5)(ii)(B) must be adjusted for a short taxable year (for further guidance, for example, see Rev. Proc. 89-15 (1989-1 C.B. 816) (see § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(
b
) of this chapter)).
(

)
Computation of the depreciation allowance.
The depreciation allowances for the MACRS property for any 12-month taxable year beginning with the year of change are computed by first determining the appropriate recovery year in the table identified under paragraph (d)(5)(ii)(B)(
1
) of this section. The appropriate recovery year for the year of change is the year that corresponds to the year of change. For example, if the recovery year for the year of change would have been Year 4 in the table that applied before the change in the use of the MACRS property, then the recovery year for the year of change is Year 4 in the table identified under paragraph (d)(5)(ii)(B)(
1
) of this section. Next, the annual depreciation rate (expressed as a decimal equivalent) for each recovery year is multiplied by a transaction coefficient. The transaction coefficient is the formula (1 / (1−x)) where x equals the sum of the annual depreciation rates from the table identified under paragraph (d)(5)(ii)(B)(
1
) of this section (expressed as a decimal equivalent) for the taxable years beginning with the placed-in-service year of the MACRS property through the taxable year immediately prior to the year of change. The product of the annual depreciation rate and the transaction coefficient is multiplied by the adjusted depreciable basis of the MACRS property as of the beginning of the year of change.

Examples.
The application of this paragraph (d) is illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1. Change in the use results in a shorter recovery period and/or a more accelerated depreciation method and optional depreciation table is not used.
(i)
X
, a calendar-year corporation, places in service in 1999 equipment at a cost of $100,000 and uses this equipment from 1999 through 2003 primarily in its
A
business.
X
depreciates the equipment for 1999 through 2003 under the general depreciation system as 7-year property by using the
200-percent declining balance method (which switched to the straight-line method in 2003), a 7-year recovery period, and a half-year convention. Beginning in 2004,
X
primarily uses the equipment in its
B
business. As a result, the classification of the equipment under section 168(e) changes from 7-year property to 5-year property and the recovery period of the equipment under the general depreciation system changes from 7 years to 5 years. The depreciation method does not change. On January 1, 2004, the adjusted depreciable basis of the equipment is $22,311.
X
depreciates its 5-year recovery property placed in service in 2004 under the general depreciation system by using the 200-percent declining balance method and a 5-year recovery period.
X
does not use the optional depreciation tables.
(ii) Under paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section,
X
's allowable depreciation deduction for the equipment for 2004 and subsequent taxable years is determined as though
X
placed the equipment in service in 2004 for use primarily in its
B
business. The depreciable basis of the equipment as of January 1, 2004, is $22,311 (the adjusted depreciable basis at January 1, 2004). Because
X
does not use the optional depreciation tables, the depreciation allowance for 2004 (the deemed placed-in-service year) for this equipment only is computed without taking into account the half-year convention. Pursuant to paragraph (d)(3)(i)(C) of this section, this equipment is not eligible for the additional first year depreciation deduction provided by section 168(k) or section 1400L(b). Thus,
X
's allowable depreciation deduction for the equipment for 2004 is $8,924 ($22,311 adjusted depreciable basis at January 1, 2004, multiplied by the applicable depreciation rate of 40% (200/5)).
X
's allowable depreciation deduction for the equipment for 2005 is $5,355 ($13,387 adjusted depreciable basis at January 1, 2005, multiplied by the applicable depreciation rate of 40% (200/5)).
(iii) Alternatively, under paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section,
X
may elect to disregard the change in the use and, as a result, may continue to treat the equipment as though it is used primarily in its
A
business. If the election is made,
X
's allowable depreciation deduction for the equipment for 2004 is $8,924 ($22,311 adjusted depreciable basis at January 1, 2004, multiplied by the applicable depreciation rate of 40% (1/2.5 years remaining at January 1, 2004)).
X
's allowable depreciation deduction for the equipment for 2005 is $8,925 ($13,387 adjusted depreciable basis at January 1, 2005, multiplied by the applicable depreciation rate of 66.67% (1/1.5 years remaining at January 1, 2005)).

# Example 2. Change in the use results in a shorter recovery period and/or a more accelerated depreciation method and optional depreciation table is used.
(i) Same facts as in
Example 1
, except that
X
used the optional depreciation tables for computing depreciation for 1999 through 2003. Pursuant to paragraph (d)(5) of this section,
X
chooses to continue to use the optional depreciation table for the equipment.
X
does not make the election provided in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section to disregard the change in use.
(ii) In accordance with paragraph (d)(5)(ii)(A) of this section,
X
must first identify the appropriate optional depreciation table for the equipment. This table is table 1 in Rev. Proc. 87-57 because the equipment will be depreciated in the year of change (2004) under the general depreciation system using the 200-percent declining balance method, a 5-year recovery period, and the half-year convention (which is the convention that applied to the equipment in 1999). Pursuant to paragraph (d)(3)(i)(C) of this section, this equipment is not eligible for the additional first year depreciation deduction provided by section 168(k) or section 1400L(b). For 2004,
X
multiplies its adjusted depreciable basis in the equipment as of January 1, 2004, of $22,311, by the annual depreciation rate in table 1 for recovery year 1 for a 5-year recovery period (.20), to determine the depreciation allowance of $4,462. For 2005,
X
multiplies its adjusted depreciable basis in the equipment as of January 1, 2004, of $22,311, by the annual depreciation rate in table 1 for recovery year 2 for a 5-year recovery period (.32), to determine the depreciation allowance of $7,140.

# Example 3. Change in the use results in a longer recovery period and/or a slower depreciation method.
(i)
Y
, a calendar-year corporation, places in service in January 2002, equipment at a cost of $100,000 and uses this equipment in 2002 and 2003 only within the United States.
Y
elects not to deduct the additional first year depreciation under section 168(k).
Y
depreciates the equipment for 2002 and 2003 under the general depreciation system by using the 200-percent declining balance method, a 5-year recovery period, and a half-year convention. Beginning in 2004,
Y
uses the equipment predominantly outside the United States. As a result of this change in the use, the equipment is subject to the alternative depreciation system beginning in 2004. Under the alternative depreciation system, the equipment is depreciated by using the straight line method and a 9-year recovery period. The adjusted depreciable basis of the equipment at January 1, 2004, is $48,000.
(ii) Pursuant to paragraph (d)(4) of this section,
Y
's allowable depreciation deduction for 2004 and subsequent taxable years is determined as though the equipment had been placed in service in January 2002, as property used predominantly outside the United States. Further, pursuant to paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section, the equipment is not eligible in 2004 for the additional first year depreciation deduction provided by section 168(k) or section 1400L(b). In determining the
applicable depreciation rate for 2004, the applicable depreciation method is the straight line method and the applicable recovery period is 7.5 years, which is the number of years remaining at January 1, 2004, for property placed in service in 2002 with a 9-year recovery period (taking into account the half-year convention). Thus, the depreciation allowance for 2004 is $6,398 ($48,000 adjusted depreciable basis at January 1, 2004, multiplied by the applicable depreciation rate of 13.33% (1/7.5 years)). The depreciation allowance for 2005 is $6,398 ($41,602 adjusted depreciable basis at January 1, 2005, multiplied by the applicable depreciation rate of 15.38% (1/6.5 years remaining at January 1, 2005)).

# Example 4. Change in the use results in a longer recovery period and/or a slower depreciation method and optional depreciation table is used.
(i) Same facts as in
Example 3
, except that
Y
used the optional depreciation tables for computing depreciation in 2002 and 2003. Pursuant to paragraph (d)(5) of this section,
Y
chooses to continue to use the optional depreciation table for the equipment. Further, pursuant to paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section, the equipment is not eligible in 2004 for the additional first year depreciation deduction provided by section 168(k) or section 1400L(b).
(ii) In accordance with paragraph (d)(5)(ii)(B) of this section,
Y
must first determine the appropriate optional depreciation table for the equipment pursuant to paragraph (d)(5)(ii)(B)(
1
) of this section. This table is table 8 in Rev. Proc. 87-57, which corresponds to the alternative depreciation system, the straight line method, a 9-year recovery period, and the half-year convention (because
Y
depreciated 5-year property in 2002 using a half-year convention). Next,
Y
must determine the appropriate recovery year in table 8. Because the year of change is 2004, the depreciation allowance for the equipment for 2004 is determined using recovery year 3 of table 8. For 2004,
Y
multiplies its adjusted depreciable basis in the equipment as of January 1, 2004, of $48,000, by the product of the annual depreciation rate in table 8 for recovery year 3 for a 9-year recovery period (.1111) and the transaction coefficient of 1.200 [1/(1−(.0556 (table 8 for recovery year 1 for a 9-year recovery period) + .1111 (table 8 for recovery year 2 for a 9-year recovery period)))], to determine the depreciation allowance of $6,399. For 2005,
Y
multiplies its adjusted depreciable basis in the equipment as of January 1, 2004, of $48,000, by the product of the annual depreciation rate in table 8 for recovery year 4 for a 9-year recovery period (.1111) and the transaction coefficient (1.200), to determine the depreciation allowance of $6,399.
(e)
Change in the use of MACRS property during the placed-in-service year
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, if a change in the use of MACRS property occurs during the placed-in-service year and the property continues to be MACRS property owned by the same taxpayer, the depreciation allowance for that property for the placed-in-service year is determined by its primary use during that year. The primary use of MACRS property may be determined in any reasonable manner that is consistently applied to the taxpayer's MACRS property. For purposes of this paragraph (e), the determination of whether the mid-quarter convention applies to any MACRS property placed in service during the year of change is made in accordance with § 1.168(d)-1.
(2)
Alternative depreciation system property
—(i)
Property used within and outside the United States.
The depreciation allowance for the placed-in-service year for MACRS property that is used within and outside the United States is determined by its predominant use during that year. The determination of whether MACRS property is used predominantly outside the United States during the placed-in-service year shall be made in accordance with the test in § 1.48-1(g)(1)(i) for determining predominant use.
(ii)
Tax-exempt bond financed property.
The depreciation allowance for the placed-in-service year for MACRS property that changes to tax-exempt bond financed property, as described in section 168(g)(1)(C) and (g)(5), during that taxable year is determined under the alternative depreciation system. For purposes of this paragraph (e), MACRS property changes to tax-exempt bond financed property when a tax-exempt bond is first issued after the MACRS property is placed in service. MACRS property continues to be tax-exempt bond financed property in the hands of the taxpayer even if the tax-exempt bond (including any refunding issue) is not outstanding at, or is redeemed by, the end of the placed-in-service year.
(iii)
Other mandatory alternative depreciation system property.
The depreciation allowance for the placed-in-service year for MACRS property that changes to, or changes from, property described in section 168(g)(1)(B) (tax-exempt use property) or (D) (imported property covered by an Executive order) during
that taxable year is determined under—
(A) The alternative depreciation system if the MACRS property is described in section 168(g)(1)(B) or (D) at the end of the placed-in-service year; or
(B) The general depreciation system if the MACRS property is not described in section 168(g)(1)(B) or (D) at the end of the placed-in-service year, unless other provisions of the Internal Revenue Code or regulations under the Internal Revenue Code require the depreciation allowance for that MACRS property to be determined under the alternative depreciation system (for example, section 168(g)(7)).
(3)
Examples.
The application of this paragraph (e) is illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
(i)
Z,
a utility and calendar-year corporation, acquires and places in service on January 1, 2004, equipment at a cost of $100,000.
Z
uses this equipment in its combustion turbine production plant for 4 months and then uses the equipment in its steam production plant for the remainder of 2004.
Z
's combustion turbine production plant assets are classified as 15-year property and are depreciated by
Z
under the general depreciation system using a 15-year recovery period and the 150-percent declining balance method of depreciation.
Z
's steam production plant assets are classified as 20-year property and are depreciated by
Z
under the general depreciation system using a 20-year recovery period and the 150-percent declining balance method of depreciation.
Z
uses the optional depreciation tables. The equipment is 50-percent bonus depreciation property for purposes of section 168(k).
(ii) Pursuant to this paragraph (e),
Z
must determine depreciation based on the primary use of the equipment during the placed-in-service year.
Z
has consistently determined the primary use of all of its MACRS properties by comparing the number of full months in the taxable year during which a MACRS property is used in one manner with the number of full months in that taxable year during which that MACRS property is used in another manner. Applying this approach,
Z
determines the depreciation allowance for the equipment for 2004 is based on the equipment being classified as 20-year property because the equipment was used by
Z
in its steam production plant for 8 months in 2004. If the half-year convention applies in 2004, the appropriate optional depreciation table is table 1 in Rev. Proc. 87-57, which is the table for MACRS property subject to the general depreciation system, the 150-percent declining balance method, a 20-year recovery period, and the half-year convention. Thus, the depreciation allowance for the equipment for 2004 is $51,875, which is the total of $50,000 for the 50-percent additional first year depreciation deduction allowable (the unadjusted depreciable basis of $100,000 multiplied by .50), plus $1,875 for the 2004 depreciation allowance on the remaining adjusted depreciable basis of $50,000 [(the unadjusted depreciable basis of $100,000 less the additional first year depreciation deduction of $50,000) multiplied by the annual depreciation rate of .0375 in table 1 for recovery year 1 for a 20-year recovery period].

# Example 2. T
, a calendar year corporation, places in service on January 1, 2004, several computers at a total cost of $100,000.
T
uses these computers within the United States for 3 months in 2004 and then moves and uses the computers outside the United States for the remainder of 2004. Pursuant to § 1.48-1(g)(1)(i), the computers are considered as used predominantly outside the United States in 2004. As a result, for 2004, the computers are required to be depreciated under the alternative depreciation system of section 168(g) with a recovery period of 5 years pursuant to section 168(g)(3)(C).
T
uses the optional depreciation tables. If the half-year convention applies in 2004, the appropriate optional depreciation table is table 8 in Rev. Proc. 87-57, which is the table for MACRS property subject to the alternative depreciation system, the straight line method, a 5-year recovery period, and the half-year convention. Thus, the depreciation allowance for the computers for 2004 is $10,000, which is equal to the unadjusted depreciable basis of $100,000 multiplied by the annual depreciation rate of .10 in table 8 for recovery year 1 for a 5-year recovery period. Because the computers are required to be depreciated under the alternative depreciation system in their placed-in-service year, pursuant to section 168(k)(2)(C)(i) and § 1.168(k)-1T(b)(2)(ii), the computers are not eligible for the additional first year depreciation deduction provided by section 168(k).
(f)
No change in accounting method.
A change in computing the depreciation allowance in the year of change for property subject to this section is not a change in method of accounting under section 446(e).

Effective dates
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (g)(2) of this section, this section applies to any change in the use of MACRS property in a taxable year ending on or after June 17, 2004. For any change in the use of MACRS property after December 31, 1986, in a taxable year ending before
June 17, 2004, the Internal Revenue Service will allow any reasonable method of depreciating the property under section 168 in the year of change and the subsequent taxable years that is consistently applied to any property for which the use changes in the hands of the same taxpayer or the taxpayer may choose, on a property-by-property basis, to apply the provisions of this section.

The language “or § 1.168(k)-2(g)(6)(iii), as applicable” in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the language “or § 1.168(k)-2(g)(6)(ii), as applicable” in paragraph (c) of this section, and the language “or § 1.168(k)-2(g)(6)(iv), as applicable” in paragraphs (d)(3)(i)(C) and (d)(4)(i) of this section applies to any change in use of MACRS property, which is qualified property under section 168(k)(2), by a taxpayer during or after the taxpayer's taxable year that includes September 24, 2019.
(ii)
Early application.
A taxpayer may choose to apply the language “or § 1.168(k)-2(g)(6)(iii), as applicable” in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the language “or § 1.168(k)-2(g)(6)(ii), as applicable” in paragraph (c) of this section, and the language “or § 1.168(k)-2(g)(6)(iv), as applicable” in paragraphs (d)(3)(i)(C) and (d)(4)(i) of this section for any change in use of MACRS property, which is qualified property under section 168(k)(2) and acquired and placed in service after September 27, 2017, by the taxpayer during taxable years ending on or after September 28, 2017.
(iii)
Early application of regulation project REG-104397-18.
A taxpayer may rely on the language “or § 1.168(k)-2(f)(6)(iii), as applicable” in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the language “or § 1.168(k)-2(f)(6)(ii), as applicable” in paragraph (c) of this section, and the language “or § 1.168(k)-2(f)(6)(iv), as applicable” in paragraphs (d)(3)(i)(C) and (d)(4)(i) of this section in regulation project REG-104397-18 (2018-41 I.R.B. 558) (see § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(b) of this chapter) for any change in use of MACRS property, which is qualified property under section 168(k)(2) and acquired and placed in service after September 27, 2017, by the taxpayer during taxable years ending on or after September 28, 2017, and ending before the taxpayer's taxable year that includes September 24, 2019.
(3)
Change in method of accounting
—(i)
In general.
If a taxpayer adopted a method of accounting for depreciation due to a change in the use of MACRS property in a taxable year ending on or after December 30, 2003, and the method adopted is not in accordance with the method of accounting for depreciation provided in this section, a change to the method of accounting for depreciation provided in this section is a change in the method of accounting to which the provisions of sections 446(e) and 481 and the regulations under sections 446(e) and 481 apply. Also, a revocation of the election provided in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section to disregard a change in the use is a change in method of accounting to which the provisions of sections 446(e) and 481 and the regulations under sections 446(e) and 481 apply. However, if a taxpayer adopted a method of accounting for depreciation due to a change in the use of MACRS property after December 31, 1986, in a taxable year ending before December 30, 2003, and the method adopted is not in accordance with the method of accounting for depreciation provided in this section, the taxpayer may treat the change to the method of accounting for depreciation provided in this section as a change in method of accounting to which the provisions of sections 446(e) and 481 and the regulations under sections 446(e) and 481 apply.
(ii)
Automatic consent to change method of accounting.
A taxpayer changing its method of accounting in accordance with this paragraph (g)(2) must follow the applicable administrative procedures issued under § 1.446-1(e)(3)(ii) for obtaining the Commissioner's automatic consent to a change in method of accounting (for further guidance, for example,
see
Rev. Proc. 2002-9 (2002-1 C.B. 327), (
see
§ 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(
b
) of this chapter)). Any change in method of accounting made under this paragraph (g)(2) must be made using an adjustment under section 481(a). For purposes of Form 3115,
Application for Change in Accounting Method,
the designated
number for the automatic accounting method change authorized by this paragraph (g)(2) is “88.” If Form 3115 is revised or renumbered, any reference in this section to that form is treated as a reference to the revised or renumbered form.

§ 1.168(i)-6
Like-kind exchanges and involuntary conversions.
(a)
Scope.
This section provides the rules for determining the depreciation allowance for MACRS property acquired in a like-kind exchange or an involuntary conversion, including a like-kind exchange or an involuntary conversion of MACRS property that is exchanged or replaced with other MACRS property in a transaction between members of the same affiliated group. The allowance for depreciation under this section constitutes the amount of depreciation allowable under section 167(a) for the year of replacement and any subsequent taxable year for the replacement MACRS property and for the year of disposition of the relinquished MACRS property. The provisions of this section apply only to MACRS property to which § 1.168(h)-1 (like-kind exchanges of tax-exempt use property) does not apply. Additionally, paragraphs (c) through (f) of this section apply only to MACRS property for which an election under paragraph (i) of this section has not been made.
(b)
Definitions.
For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:
(1)
Replacement MACRS property
is MACRS property (as defined in § 1.168(b)-1(a)(2)) in the hands of the acquiring taxpayer that is acquired for other MACRS property in a like-kind exchange or an involuntary conversion.
(2)
Relinquished MACRS property
is MACRS property that is transferred by the taxpayer in a like-kind exchange, or in an involuntary conversion.
(3)
Time of disposition
is when the disposition of the relinquished MACRS property takes place under the convention, as determined under § 1.168(d)-1, that applies to the relinquished MACRS property.
(4)
Time of replacement
is the later of—
(i) When the replacement MACRS property is placed in service under the convention, as determined under this section, that applies to the replacement MACRS property; or
(ii) The time of disposition of the exchanged or involuntarily converted property.
(5)
Year of disposition
is the taxable year that includes the time of disposition.
(6)
Year of replacement
is the taxable year that includes the time of replacement.
(7)
Exchanged basis
is determined after the depreciation deductions for the year of disposition are determined under paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section and is the lesser of—
(i) The basis in the replacement MACRS property, as determined under section 1031(d) and the regulations under section 1031(d) or section 1033(b) and the regulations under section 1033(b); or
(ii) The adjusted depreciable basis (as defined in § 1.168(b)-1(a)(4)) of the relinquished MACRS property.
(8)
Excess basis
is any excess of the basis in the replacement MACRS property, as determined under section 1031(d) and the regulations under section 1031(d) or section 1033(b) and the regulations under section 1033(b), over the exchanged basis as determined under paragraph (b)(7) of this section.
(9)
Depreciable exchanged basis
is the exchanged basis as determined under paragraph (b)(7) of this section reduced by—
(i) The percentage of such basis attributable to the taxpayer's use of property for the taxable year other than in the taxpayer's trade or business (or for the production of income); and
(ii) Any adjustments to basis provided by other provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) and the regulations under the Code (including section 1016(a)(2) and (3), for example, depreciation deductions in the year of replacement allowable under section 168(k) or 1400L(b)).
(10)
Depreciable excess basis
is the excess basis as determined under paragraph (b)(8) of this section reduced by—
(i) The percentage of such basis attributable to the taxpayer's use of property for the taxable year other
than in the taxpayer's trade or business (or for the production of income);
(ii) Any portion of the basis the taxpayer properly elects to treat as an expense under section 179; and
(iii) Any adjustments to basis provided by other provisions of the Code and the regulations under the Code (including section 1016(a)(2) and (3), for example, depreciation deductions in the year of replacement allowable under section 168(k) or 1400L(b)).
(11)
Like-kind exchange
is an exchange of property in a transaction to which section 1031(a)(1), (b), or (c) applies.
(12)
Involuntary conversion
is a transaction described in section 1033(a)(1) or (2) that resulted in the nonrecognition of any part of the gain realized as the result of the conversion.
(c)
Determination of depreciation allowance
—(1)
Computation of the depreciation allowance for depreciable exchanged basis beginning in the year of replacement
—(i)
In general.
This paragraph (c) provides rules for determining the applicable recovery period, the applicable depreciation method, and the applicable convention used to determine the depreciation allowances for the depreciable exchanged basis beginning in the year of replacement. See paragraph (c)(5) of this section for rules relating to the computation of the depreciation allowance for the year of disposition and for the year of replacement. See paragraph (d)(1) of this section for rules relating to the computation of the depreciation allowance for depreciable excess basis. See paragraph (d)(4) of this section if the replacement MACRS property is acquired before disposition of the relinquished MACRS property in a transaction to which section 1033 applies. See paragraph (e) of this section for rules relating to the computation of the depreciation allowance using the optional depreciation tables.
(ii)
Applicable recovery period, depreciation method, and convention.
The recovery period, depreciation method, and convention determined under this paragraph (c) are the only permissible methods of accounting for MACRS property within the scope of this section unless the taxpayer makes the election under paragraph (i) of this section not to apply this section.
(2)
Effect of depreciation treatment of the replacement MACRS property by previous owners of the acquired property.
If replacement MACRS property is acquired by a taxpayer in a like-kind exchange or an involuntary conversion, the depreciation treatment of the replacement MACRS property by previous owners has no effect on the determination of depreciation allowances for the replacement MACRS property in the hands of the acquiring taxpayer. For example, a taxpayer exchanging, in a like-kind exchange, MACRS property for property that was depreciated under section 168 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (ACRS) by the previous owner must use this section because the replacement property will become MACRS property in the hands of the acquiring taxpayer. In addition, elections made by previous owners in determining depreciation allowances for the replacement MACRS property have no effect on the acquiring taxpayer. For example, a taxpayer exchanging, in a like-kind exchange, MACRS property that the taxpayer depreciates under the general depreciation system of section 168(a) for other MACRS property that the previous owner elected to depreciate under the alternative depreciation system pursuant to section 168(g)(7) does not have to continue using the alternative depreciation system for the replacement MACRS property.
(3)
Recovery period and/or depreciation method of the properties are the same, or both are not the same
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of paragraphs (c)(3) and (c)(4) of this section in determining whether the recovery period and the depreciation method prescribed under section 168 for the replacement MACRS property are the same as the recovery period and the depreciation method prescribed under section 168 for the relinquished MACRS property, the recovery period and the depreciation method for the replacement MACRS property are considered to be the recovery period and the depreciation method that would have applied under section 168, taking into account any elections made by the acquiring taxpayer under section 168(b)(5) or 168(g)(7), had the replacement MACRS property been
placed in service by the acquiring taxpayer at the same time as the relinquished MACRS property.
(ii)
Both the recovery period and the depreciation method are the same.
If both the recovery period and the depreciation method prescribed under section 168 for the replacement MACRS property are the same as the recovery period and the depreciation method prescribed under section 168 for the relinquished MACRS property, the depreciation allowances for the replacement MACRS property beginning in the year of replacement are determined by using the same recovery period and depreciation method that were used for the relinquished MACRS property. Thus, the replacement MACRS property is depreciated over the remaining recovery period (taking into account the applicable convention), and by using the depreciation method, of the relinquished MACRS property. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(5) of this section, the depreciation allowances for the depreciable exchanged basis for any 12-month taxable year beginning with the year of replacement are determined by multiplying the depreciable exchanged basis by the applicable depreciation rate for each taxable year (for further guidance, for example, see section 6 of Rev. Proc. 87-57 (1987-2 CB 687, 692) and § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(
b
) of this chapter).
(iii)
Either the recovery period or the depreciation method is the same, or both are not the same.
If either the recovery period or the depreciation method prescribed under section 168 for the replacement MACRS property is the same as the recovery period or the depreciation method prescribed under section 168 for the relinquished MACRS property, the depreciation allowances for the depreciable exchanged basis beginning in the year of replacement are determined using the recovery period or the depreciation method that is the same as the relinquished MACRS property. See paragraph (c)(4) of this section to determine the depreciation allowances when the recovery period or the depreciation method of the replacement MACRS property is not the same as that of the relinquished MACRS property.
(4)
Recovery period or depreciation method of the properties is not the same.
If the recovery period prescribed under section 168 for the replacement MACRS property (as determined under paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section) is not the same as the recovery period prescribed under section 168 for the relinquished MACRS property, the depreciation allowances for the depreciable exchanged basis beginning in the year of replacement are determined under this paragraph (c)(4). Similarly, if the depreciation method prescribed under section 168 for the replacement MACRS property (as determined under paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section) is not the same as the depreciation method prescribed under section 168 for the relinquished MACRS property, the depreciation method used to determine the depreciation allowances for the depreciable exchanged basis beginning in the year of replacement is determined under this paragraph (c)(4).
(i)
Longer recovery period.
If the recovery period prescribed under section 168 for the replacement MACRS property (as determined under paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section) is longer than that prescribed for the relinquished MACRS property, the depreciation allowances for the depreciable exchanged basis beginning in the year of replacement are determined as though the replacement MACRS property had originally been placed in service by the acquiring taxpayer in the same taxable year the relinquished MACRS property was placed in service by the acquiring taxpayer, but using the longer recovery period of the replacement MACRS property (as determined under paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section) and the convention determined under paragraph (c)(4)(v) of this section. Thus, the depreciable exchanged basis is depreciated over the remaining recovery period (taking into account the applicable convention) of the replacement MACRS property.
(ii)
Shorter recovery period.
If the recovery period prescribed under section 168 for the replacement MACRS property (as determined under paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section) is shorter than that of the relinquished MACRS property, the depreciation allowances for
the depreciable exchanged basis beginning in the year of replacement are determined using the same recovery period as that of the relinquished MACRS property. Thus, the depreciable exchanged basis is depreciated over the remaining recovery period (taking into account the applicable convention) of the relinquished MACRS property.
(iii)
Less accelerated depreciation method
—(A) If the depreciation method prescribed under section 168 for the replacement MACRS property (as determined under paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section) is less accelerated than that of the relinquished MACRS property at the time of disposition, the depreciation allowances for the depreciable exchanged basis beginning in the year of replacement are determined as though the replacement MACRS property had originally been placed in service by the acquiring taxpayer at the same time the relinquished MACRS property was placed in service by the acquiring taxpayer, but using the less accelerated depreciation method. Thus, the depreciable exchanged basis is depreciated using the less accelerated depreciation method.
(B) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(5) of this section, the depreciation allowances for the depreciable exchanged basis for any 12-month taxable year beginning in the year of replacement are determined by multiplying the adjusted depreciable basis by the applicable depreciation rate for each taxable year. If, for example, the depreciation method of the replacement MACRS property in the year of replacement is the 150-percent declining balance method and the depreciation method of the relinquished MACRS property in the year of replacement is the 200-percent declining balance method, and neither method had been switched to the straight line method in the year of replacement or any prior taxable year, the applicable depreciation rate for the year of replacement and subsequent taxable years is determined by using the depreciation rate of the replacement MACRS property as if the replacement MACRS property was placed in service by the acquiring taxpayer at the same time the relinquished MACRS property was placed in service by the acquiring taxpayer, until the 150-percent declining balance method has been switched to the straight line method. If, for example, the depreciation method of the replacement MACRS property is the straight line method, the applicable depreciation rate for the year of replacement is determined by using the remaining recovery period at the beginning of the year of disposition (as determined under this paragraph (c)(4) and taking into account the applicable convention).
(iv)
More accelerated depreciation method
—(A) If the depreciation method prescribed under section 168 for the replacement MACRS property (as determined under paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section) is more accelerated than that of the relinquished MACRS property at the time of disposition, the depreciation allowances for the replacement MACRS property beginning in the year of replacement are determined using the same depreciation method as the relinquished MACRS property.
(B) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(5) of this section, the depreciation allowances for the depreciable exchanged basis for any 12-month taxable year beginning in the year of replacement are determined by multiplying the adjusted depreciable basis by the applicable depreciation rate for each taxable year. If, for example, the depreciation method of the relinquished MACRS property in the year of replacement is the 150-percent declining balance method and the depreciation method of the replacement MACRS property in the year of replacement is the 200-percent declining balance method, and neither method had been switched to the straight line method in the year of replacement or any prior taxable year, the applicable depreciation rate for the year of replacement and subsequent taxable years is the same depreciation rate that applied to the relinquished MACRS property in the year of replacement, until the 150-percent declining balance method has been switched to the straight line method. If, for example, the depreciation method is the straight line method, the applicable depreciation rate for the year of replacement is determined by using the remaining recovery period
at the beginning of the year of disposition (as determined under this paragraph (c)(4) and taking into account the applicable convention).
(v)
Convention.
The applicable convention for the exchanged basis is determined under this paragraph (c)(4)(v).
(A)
Either the relinquished MACRS property or the replacement MACRS property is mid-month property.
If either the relinquished MACRS property or the replacement MACRS property is property for which the applicable convention (as determined under section 168(d)) is the mid-month convention, the exchanged basis must be depreciated using the mid-month convention.
(B)
Neither the relinquished MACRS property nor the replacement MACRS property is mid-month property.
If neither the relinquished MACRS property nor the replacement MACRS property is property for which the applicable convention (as determined under section 168(d)) is the mid-month convention, the applicable convention for the exchanged basis is the same convention that applied to the relinquished MACRS property. If the relinquished MACRS property is placed in service in the year of disposition, and the time of replacement is also in the year of disposition, the convention that applies to the relinquished MACRS property is determined under paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section. If, however, relinquished MACRS property was placed in service in the year of disposition and the time of replacement is in a taxable year subsequent to the year of disposition, the convention that applies to the exchanged basis is the convention that applies in that subsequent taxable year (see paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section).
(5)
Year of disposition and year of replacement.
No depreciation deduction is allowable for MACRS property disposed of by a taxpayer in a like-kind exchange or involuntary conversion in the same taxable year that such property was placed in service by the taxpayer. If replacement MACRS property is disposed of by a taxpayer during the same taxable year that the relinquished MACRS property is placed in service by the taxpayer, no depreciation deduction is allowable for either MACRS property. Otherwise, the depreciation allowances for the year of disposition and for the year of replacement are determined as follows:
(i)
Relinquished MACRS property
—(A)
General rule.
Except as provided in paragraphs (c)(5)(i)(B), (c)(5)(iii), (e), and (i) of this section, the depreciation allowance in the year of disposition for the relinquished MACRS property is computed by multiplying the allowable depreciation deduction for the property for that year by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months (including fractions of months) the property is deemed to be placed in service during the year of disposition (taking into account the applicable convention of the relinquished MACRS property), and the denominator of which is 12. In the case of termination under § 1.168(i)-1(e)(3)(v) of general asset account treatment of an asset, or of all the assets remaining, in a general asset account, the allowable depreciation deduction in the year of disposition for the asset or assets for which general asset account treatment is terminated is determined using the depreciation method, recovery period, and convention of the general asset account. This allowable depreciation deduction is adjusted to account for the period the asset or assets is deemed to be in service in accordance with this paragraph (c)(5)(i).
(B)
Special rule.
If, at the beginning of the year of disposition, the remaining recovery period of the relinquished MACRS property, taking into account the applicable convention of such property, is less than the period between the beginning of the year of disposition and the time of disposition, the depreciation deduction for the relinquished MACRS property for the year of disposition is equal to the adjusted depreciable basis of the relinquished MACRS property at the beginning of the year of disposition. If this paragraph applies, the exchanged basis is zero and no depreciation is allowable for the exchanged basis in the replacement MACRS property.
(ii)
Replacement MACRS property
—(A)
Remaining recovery period of the replacement MACRS property.
The replacement MACRS property is treated as placed in service at the time of replacement under the convention that applies to
the replacement MACRS property as determined under this paragraph (c)(5)(ii). The remaining recovery period of the replacement MACRS property at the time of replacement is the excess of the recovery period for the replacement MACRS property, as determined under paragraph (c) of this section, over the period of time that the replacement MACRS property would have been in service if it had been placed in service when the relinquished MACRS property was placed in service and removed from service at the time of disposition of the relinquished MACRS property. This period is determined by using the convention that applied to the relinquished MACRS property to determine the date that the relinquished MACRS property is deemed to have been placed in service and the date that it is deemed to have been disposed of. The length of time the replacement MACRS property would have been in service is determined by using these dates and the convention that applies to the replacement MACRS property.
(B)
Year of replacement is 12 months.
Except as provided in paragraphs (c)(5)(iii), (e), and (i) of this section, the depreciation allowance in the year of replacement for the depreciable exchanged basis is determined by—
(
1
) Calculating the applicable depreciation rate for the replacement MACRS property as of the beginning of the year of replacement taking into account the depreciation method prescribed for the replacement MACRS property under paragraph (c)(3) of this section and the remaining recovery period of the replacement MACRS property as of the beginning of the year of disposition as determined under this paragraph (c)(5)(ii);
(
2
) Calculating the depreciable exchanged basis of the replacement MACRS property, and adding to that amount the amount determined under paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section for the year of disposition; and
(
3
) Multiplying the product of the amounts determined under paragraphs (c)(5)(ii)(B)(
1
) and (B)(
2
) of this section by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months (including fractions of months) the property is deemed to be in service during the year of replacement (in the year of replacement the replacement MACRS property is deemed to be placed in service by the acquiring taxpayer at the time of replacement under the convention determined under paragraph (c)(4)(v) of this section), and the denominator of which is 12.
(iii)
Year of disposition or year of replacement is less than 12 months.
If the year of disposition or the year of replacement is less than 12 months, the depreciation allowance determined under paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(A) of this section must be adjusted for a short taxable year (for further guidance, for example, see Rev. Proc. 89-15 (1989-1 CB 816) and § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(
b
) of this chapter).
(iv)
Deferred transactions
—(A)
In general.
If the replacement MACRS property is not acquired until after the disposition of the relinquished MACRS property, taking into account the applicable convention of the relinquished MACRS property and replacement MACRS property, depreciation is not allowable during the period between the disposition of the relinquished MACRS property and the acquisition of the replacement MACRS property. The recovery period for the replacement MACRS property is suspended during this period. For purposes of paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section, only the depreciable exchanged basis of the replacement MACRS property is taken into account for calculating the amount in paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(B)(
2
) of this section if the year of replacement is a taxable year subsequent to the year of disposition.
(B)
Allowable depreciation for a qualified intermediary.
[Reserved]
(v)
Remaining recovery period.
The remaining recovery period of the replacement MACRS property is determined as of the beginning of the year of disposition of the relinquished MACRS property. For purposes of determining the remaining recovery period of the replacement MACRS property, the replacement MACRS property is deemed to have been originally placed in service under the convention determined under paragraph (c)(4)(v) of this section, but at the time the relinquished MACRS property was deemed to be placed in service under the convention
that applied to it when it was placed in service.
(6)
Examples.
The application of this paragraph (c) is illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
A1, a calendar-year taxpayer, exchanges Building M, an office building, for Building N, a warehouse in a like-kind exchange. Building M is relinquished in July 2004 and Building N is acquired and placed in service in October 2004. A1 did not make any elections under section 168 for either Building M or Building N. The unadjusted depreciable basis of Building M was $4,680,000 when placed in service in July 1997. Since the recovery period and depreciation method prescribed under section 168 for Building N (39 years, straight line method) are the same as the recovery period and depreciation method prescribed under section 168 for Building M (39 years, straight line method), Building N is depreciated over the remaining recovery period of, and using the same depreciation method and convention as that of, Building M. Applying the applicable convention, Building M is deemed disposed of on July 15, 2004, and Building N is placed in service on October 15, 2004. Thus, Building N will be depreciated using the straight line method over a remaining recovery period of 32 years beginning in October 2004 (the remaining recovery period of 32 years and 6.5 months at the beginning of 2004, less the 6.5 months of depreciation taken prior to the disposition of the exchanged MACRS property (Building M) in 2004). For 2004, the year in which the transaction takes place, the depreciation allowance for Building M is ($120,000)(6.5/12) which equals $65,000. The depreciation allowance for Building N for 2004 is ($120,000)(2.5/12) which equals $25,000. For 2005 and subsequent years, Building N is depreciated over the remaining recovery period of, and using the same depreciation method and convention as that of, Building M. Thus, the depreciation allowance for Building N is the same as Building M, namely $10,000 per month.

# Example 2.
B, a calendar-year taxpayer, placed in service Bridge P in January 1998. Bridge P is depreciated using the half-year convention. In January 2004, B exchanges Bridge P for Building Q, an apartment building, in a like-kind exchange. Pursuant to paragraph (k)(2)(i) of this section, B decided to apply § 1.168(i)-6 to the exchange of Bridge P for Building Q, the replacement MACRS property. B did not make any elections under section 168 for either Bridge P or Building Q. Since the recovery period prescribed under section 168 for Building Q (27.5 years) is longer than that of Bridge P (15 years), Building Q is depreciated as if it had originally been placed in service in July 1998 and disposed of in July 2004 using a 27.5 year recovery period. Additionally, since the depreciation method prescribed under section 168 for Building Q (straight line method) is less accelerated than that of Bridge P (150-percent declining balance method), then the depreciation allowance for Building Q is computed using the straight line method. Thus, when Building Q is acquired and placed in service in 2004, its basis is depreciated over the remaining 21.5 year recovery period using the straight line method of depreciation and the mid-month convention beginning in July 2004.

# Example 3.
C, a calendar-year taxpayer, placed in service Building R, a restaurant, in January 1996. In January 2004, C exchanges Building R for Tower S, a radio transmitting tower, in a like-kind exchange. Pursuant to paragraph (k)(2)(i) of this section, C decided to apply § 1.168(i)-6 to the exchange of Building R for Tower S, the replacement MACRS property. C did not make any elections under section 168 for either Building R or Tower S. Since the recovery period prescribed under section 168 for Tower S (15 years) is shorter than that of Building R (39 years), Tower S is depreciated over the remaining recovery period of Building R. Additionally, since the depreciation method prescribed under section 168 for Tower S (150% declining balance method) is more accelerated than that of Building R (straight line method), then the depreciation allowance for Tower S is also computed using the same depreciation method as Building R. Thus, Tower S is depreciated over the remaining 31 year recovery period of Building R using the straight line method of depreciation and the mid-month convention. Alternatively, C may elect under paragraph (i) of this section to treat Tower S as though it is placed in service in January 2004. In such case, C uses the applicable recovery period, depreciation method, and convention prescribed under section 168 for Tower S.

# Example 4.
(i) In February 2002, D, a calendar-year taxpayer and manufacturer of rubber products, acquired for $60,000 and placed in service Asset T (a special tool) and depreciated Asset T using the straight line method election under section 168(b)(5) and the mid-quarter convention over its 3-year recovery period. D elected not to deduct the additional first year depreciation for 3-year property placed in service in 2002. In June 2004, D exchanges Asset T for Asset U (not a special tool) in a like-kind exchange. D elected not to deduct the additional first year depreciation for 7-year property placed in service in 2004. Since the recovery period prescribed under section 168 for Asset U (7 years) is longer than that of Asset T (3 years), Asset U is depreciated as if it had originally been placed in service in February
2002 using a 7-year recovery period. Additionally, since the depreciation method prescribed under section 168 for Asset U (200-percent declining balance method) is more accelerated than that of Asset T (straight line method) at the time of disposition, the depreciation allowance for Asset U is computed using the straight line method. Asset U is depreciated over its remaining recovery period of 4.75 years using the straight line method of depreciation and the mid-quarter convention.
(ii) The 2004 depreciation allowance for Asset T is $7,500 ($20,000 allowable depreciation deduction for 2004) × 4.5 months ÷ 12).
(iii) The depreciation rate in 2004 for Asset U is 0.1951 (1 ÷ 5.125 years (the length of the applicable recovery period remaining as of the beginning of 2004)). Therefore, the depreciation allowance for Asset U in 2004 is $2,744 (0.1951 × $22,500 (the sum of the $15,000 depreciable exchanged basis of Asset U ($22,500 adjusted depreciable basis at the beginning of 2004 for Asset T, less the $7,500 depreciation allowable for Asset T for 2004) and the $7,500 depreciation allowable for Asset T for 2004) × 7.5 months ÷ 12).

# Example 5.
The facts are the same as in
Example 4
except that D exchanges Asset T for Asset U in June 2005, in a like-kind exchange. Under these facts, the remaining recovery period of Asset T at the beginning of 2005 is 1.5 months and, as a result, is less than the 5-month period between the beginning of 2005 (year of disposition) and June 2005 (time of disposition). Accordingly, pursuant to paragraph (c)(5)(i)(B) of this section, the 2005 depreciation allowance for Asset T is $2,500 ($2,500 adjusted depreciable basis at the beginning of 2005 ($60,000 original basis minus $17,500 depreciation deduction for 2002 minus $20,000 depreciation deduction for 2003 minus $20,000 depreciation deduction for 2004)). Because the exchanged basis of asset U is $0.00, no depreciation is allowable for asset U.

# Example 6.
On January 1, 2004, E, a calendar-year taxpayer, acquired and placed in service Canopy V, a gas station canopy. The purchase price of Canopy V was $60,000. On August 1, 2004, Canopy V was destroyed in a hurricane and was therefore no longer usable in E's business. On October 1, 2004, as part of the involuntary conversion, E acquired and placed in service new Canopy W with the insurance proceeds E received due to the loss of Canopy V. E elected not to deduct the additional first year depreciation for 5-year property placed in service in 2004. E depreciates both canopies under the general depreciation system of section 168(a) by using the 200-percent declining balance method of depreciation, a 5-year recovery period, and the half-year convention. No depreciation deduction is allowable for Canopy V. The depreciation deduction allowable for Canopy W for 2004 is $12,000 ($60,000 × the annual depreciation rate of .40 ×
1/2
year). For 2005, the depreciation deduction for Canopy W is $19,200 ($48,000 adjusted basis × the annual depreciation rate of .40).

# Example 7.
The facts are the same as in
Example 6
, except that E did not make the election out of the additional first year depreciation for 5-year property placed in service in 2004. E depreciates both canopies under the general depreciation system of section 168(a) by using the 200-percent declining balance method of depreciation, a 5-year recovery period, and the half-year convention. No depreciation deduction is allowable for Canopy V. For 2004, E is allowed a 50-percent additional first year depreciation deduction of $30,000 for Canopy W (the unadjusted depreciable basis of $60,000 multiplied by .50), and a regular MACRS depreciation deduction of $6,000 for Canopy W (the depreciable exchanged basis of $30,000 multiplied by the annual depreciation rate of .40 ×
1/2
year). For 2005, E is allowed a regular MACRS depreciation deduction of $9,600 for Canopy W (the depreciable exchanged basis of $24,000 ($30,000 minus regular 2003 depreciation of $6,000) multiplied by the annual depreciation rate of .40).

# Example 8.
In January 2001, F, a calendar-year taxpayer, places in service a paved parking lot, Lot W, and begins depreciating Lot W over its 15-year recovery period. F's unadjusted depreciable basis in Lot W is $1,000x. On April 1, 2004, F disposes of Lot W in a like-kind exchange for Building X, which is nonresidential real property. Lot W is depreciated using the 150 percent declining balance method and the half-year convention. Building X is depreciated using the straight-line method with a 39-year recovery period and using the mid-month convention. Both Lot W and Building X were in service at the time of the exchange. Because Lot W was depreciated using the half-year convention, it is deemed to have been placed in service on July 1, 2001, the first day of the second half of 2001, and to have been disposed of on July 1, 2004, the first day of the second half of 2004. To determine the remaining recovery period of Building X at the time of replacement, Building X is deemed to have been placed in service on July 1, 2001, and removed from service on July 1, 2004. Thus, Building X is deemed to have been in service, at the time of replacement, for 3 years (36 months = 5.5 months in 2001 + 12 months in 2002 + 12 months in 2003 + 6.5 months in 2004) and its remaining recovery period is 36 years (39 − 3). Because Building X is deemed to be placed in service at the time of replacement, July 1, 2004, the first day of the second half of 2004, Building X is depreciated for 5.5 months in 2004. However, at the beginning of the year of replacement the remaining recovery period for Building X is 36 years and 6.5 months (39 years − 2 years and 5.5 months (5.5 months in 2001 + 12 months in 2002 + 12 months in 2003)). The depreciation
rate for building X for 2004 is 0.02737 (= 1/(39-2-5.5/12)). For 2005, the depreciation rate for Building X is 0.02814 (= 1/(39-3-5.5/12)).

# Example 9.
The facts are the same as in
Example 8.
F did not make the election under paragraph (i) of this section for Building Y in the initial exchange. In January 2006, F exchanges Building Y for Building Z, an office building, in a like-kind exchange. F did not make any elections under section 168 for either Building Y or Building Z. Since the recovery period prescribed for Building Y as a result of the initial exchange (39 years) is longer than that of Building Z (27.5 years), Building Z is depreciated over the remaining 33 years of the recovery period of Building Y. The depreciation methods are the same for both Building Y and Building Z so F's exchanged basis in Building Z is depreciated over 33 years, using the straight-line method and the mid-month convention, beginning in January 2006. Alternatively, F could have made the election under paragraph (i) of this section. If F makes such election, Building Z is treated as placed in service by F when acquired in January 2006 and F would recover its exchanged basis in Building Z over 27.5 years, using the straight line method and the mid-month convention, beginning in January 2006.

Special rules for determining depreciation allowances
—(1)
Excess basis
—(i)
In general.
Any excess basis in the replacement MACRS property is treated as property that is placed in service by the acquiring taxpayer in the year of replacement. Thus, the depreciation allowances for the depreciable excess basis are determined by using the applicable recovery period, depreciation method, and convention prescribed under section 168 for the property at the time of replacement. However, if replacement MACRS property is disposed of during the same taxable year the relinquished MACRS property is placed in service by the acquiring taxpayer, no depreciation deduction is allowable for either MACRS property. See paragraph (g) of this section regarding the application of section 179. See paragraph (h) of this section regarding the application of section 168(k) or 1400L(b).
(ii)
Example.
The application of this paragraph (d)(1) is illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
In 1989, G placed in service a hospital. On January 16, 2004, G exchanges this hospital plus $2,000,000 cash for an office building in a like-kind exchange. On January 16, 2004, the hospital has an adjusted depreciable basis of $1,500,000. After the exchange, the basis of the office building is $3,500,000. Pursuant to paragraph (k)(2)(i) of this section, G decided to apply § 1.168(i)-6 to the exchange of the hospital for the office building, the replacement MACRS property. The depreciable exchanged basis of the office building is depreciated in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. The depreciable excess basis of $2,000,000 is treated as being placed in service by G in 2004 and, as a result, is depreciated using the applicable depreciation method, recovery period, and convention prescribed for the office building under section 168 at the time of replacement.
(2)
Depreciable and nondepreciable property
—(i) If land or other nondepreciable property is acquired in a like-kind exchange for, or as a result of an involuntary conversion of, depreciable property, the land or other nondepreciable property is not depreciated. If both MACRS and nondepreciable property are acquired in a like-kind exchange for, or as part of an involuntary conversion of, MACRS property, the basis allocated to the nondepreciable property (as determined under section 1031(d) and the regulations under section 1031(d) or section 1033(b) and the regulations under section 1033(b)) is not depreciated and the basis allocated to the replacement MACRS property (as determined under section 1031(d) and the regulations under section 1031(d) or section 1033(b) and the regulations under section 1033(b)) is depreciated in accordance with this section.
(ii) If MACRS property is acquired, or if both MACRS and nondepreciable property are acquired, in a like-kind exchange for, or as part of an involuntary conversion of, land or other nondepreciable property, the basis in the replacement MACRS property that is attributable to the relinquished nondepreciable property is treated as though the replacement MACRS property is placed in service by the acquiring taxpayer in the year of replacement. Thus, the depreciation allowances for the replacement MACRS property are determined by using the applicable recovery period, depreciation method, and convention prescribed under section 168 for the replacement MACRS property at the time of replacement. See paragraph (g) of this section regarding the application of section 179. See paragraph (h) of this
section regarding the application of section 168(k) or 1400L(b).
(3)
Depreciation limitations for automobiles
—(i)
In general.
Depreciation allowances under section 179 and section 167 (including allowances under sections 168 and 1400L(b)) for a passenger automobile, as defined in section 280F(d)(5), are subject to the limitations of section 280F(a). The depreciation allowances for a passenger automobile that is replacement MACRS property (replacement MACRS passenger automobile) generally are limited in any taxable year to the replacement automobile section 280F limit for the taxable year. The taxpayer's basis in the replacement MACRS passenger automobile is treated as being comprised of two separate components. The first component is the exchanged basis and the second component is the excess basis, if any. The depreciation allowances for a passenger automobile that is relinquished MACRS property (relinquished MACRS passenger automobile) for the taxable year generally are limited to the relinquished automobile section 280F limit for that taxable year. In the year of disposition the sum of the depreciation deductions for the relinquished MACRS passenger automobile and the replacement MACRS passenger automobile may not exceed the replacement automobile section 280F limit unless the taxpayer makes the election under § 1.168(i)-6(i). For purposes of this paragraph (d)(3), the following definitions apply:
(A)
Replacement automobile section 280F limit
is the limit on depreciation deductions under section 280F(a) for the taxable year based on the time of replacement of the replacement MACRS passenger automobile (including the effect of any elections under section 168(k) or section 1400L(b), as applicable).
(B)
Relinquished automobile section 280F limit
is the limit on depreciation deductions under section 280F(a) for the taxable year based on when the relinquished MACRS passenger automobile was placed in service by the taxpayer.
(ii)
Order in which limitations on depreciation under section 280F(a) are applied.
Generally, depreciation deductions allowable under section 280F(a) reduce the basis in the relinquished MACRS passenger automobile and the exchanged basis of the replacement MACRS passenger automobile, before the excess basis of the replacement MACRS passenger automobile is reduced. The depreciation deductions for the relinquished MACRS passenger automobile in the year of disposition and the replacement MACRS passenger automobile in the year of replacement and each subsequent taxable year are allowable in the following order:
(A) The depreciation deduction allowable for the relinquished MACRS passenger automobile as determined under paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section for the year of disposition to the extent of the smaller of the replacement automobile section 280F limit and the relinquished automobile section 280F limit, if the year of disposition is the year of replacement. If the year of replacement is a taxable year subsequent to the year of disposition, the depreciation deduction allowable for the relinquished MACRS passenger automobile for the year of disposition is limited to the relinquished automobile section 280F limit.
(B) The additional first year depreciation allowable on the remaining exchanged basis (remaining carryover basis as determined under § 1.168(k)-1(f)(5), § 1.168(k)-2(g)(5), or § 1.1400L(b)-1(f)(5), as applicable) of the replacement MACRS passenger automobile, as determined under § 1.168(k)-1(f)(5), § 1.168(k)-2(g)(5), or § 1.1400L(b)-1(f)(5), as applicable, to the extent of the excess of the replacement automobile section 280F limit over the amount allowable under paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(A) of this section.
(C) The depreciation deduction allowable for the taxable year on the depreciable exchanged basis of the replacement MACRS passenger automobile determined under paragraph (c) of this section to the extent of any excess over the sum of the amounts allowable under paragraphs (d)(3)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section of the smaller of the replacement automobile section 280F limit and the relinquished automobile section 280F limit.
(D) Any section 179 deduction allowable in the year of replacement on the excess basis of the replacement
MACRS passenger automobile to the extent of the excess of the replacement automobile section 280F limit over the sum of the amounts allowable under paragraphs (d)(3)(ii)(A), (B), and (C) of this section.
(E) The additional first year depreciation allowable on the remaining excess basis of the replacement MACRS passenger automobile, as determined under § 1.168(k)-1(f)(5), § 1.168(k)-2(g)(5), or § 1.1400L(b)-1(f)(5), as applicable, to the extent of the excess of the replacement automobile section 280F limit over the sum of the amounts allowable under paragraphs (d)(3)(ii)(A), (B), (C), and (D) of this section.
(F) The depreciation deduction allowable under paragraph (d) of this section for the depreciable excess basis of the replacement MACRS passenger automobile to the extent of the excess of the replacement automobile section 280F limit over the sum of the amounts allowable under paragraphs (d)(3)(ii)(A), (B), (C), (D), and (E) of this section.
(iii)
Examples.
The application of this paragraph (d)(3) is illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
H, a calendar-year taxpayer, acquired and placed in service Automobile X in January 2000 for $30,000 to be used solely for H's business. In December 2003, H exchanges, in a like-kind exchange, Automobile X plus $15,000 cash for new Automobile Y that will also be used solely in H's business. Automobile Y is 50-percent bonus depreciation property for purposes of section 168(k)(4). Both automobiles are depreciated using the double declining balance method, the half-year convention, and a 5-year recovery period. Pursuant to § 1.168(k)-1(g)(3)(ii) and paragraph (k)(2)(i) of this section, H decided to apply § 1.168(i)-6 to the exchange of Automobile X for Automobile Y, the replacement MACRS property. The relinquished automobile section 280F limit for 2003 for Automobile X is $1,775. The replacement automobile section 280F limit for Automobile Y is $10,710. The exchanged basis for Automobile Y is $17,315 ($30,000 less total depreciation allowable of $12,685 (($3,060 for 2000, $4,900 for 2001, $2,950 for 2002, and $1,775 for 2003)). Without taking section 280F into account, the additional first year depreciation deduction for the remaining exchanged basis is $8,658 ($17,315 × 0.5). Because this amount is less than $8,935 ($10,710 (the replacement automobile section 280F limit for 2003 for Automobile Y) − $1,775 (the depreciation allowable for Automobile X for 2003)), the additional first year depreciation deduction for the exchanged basis is $8,658. No depreciation deduction is allowable in 2003 for the depreciable exchanged basis because the depreciation deductions taken for Automobile X and the remaining exchanged basis exceed the exchanged automobile section 280F limit. An additional first year depreciation deduction of $277 is allowable for the excess basis of $15,000 in Automobile Y. Thus, at the end of 2003 the adjusted depreciable basis in Automobile Y is $23,379 comprised of adjusted depreciable exchanged basis of $8,657 ($17,315 (exchanged basis) − $8,658 (additional first year depreciation for exchanged basis)) and of an adjusted depreciable excess basis of $14,723 ($15,000 (excess basis) − $277 (additional first year depreciation for 2003)).

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1
, except that H used Automobile X only 75 percent for business use. As such, the total allowable depreciation for Automobile X is reduced to reflect that the automobile is only used 75 percent for business. The total allowable depreciation of Automobile X is $9,513.75 ($2,295 for 2000 ($3,060 limit × .75), $3,675 for 2001 ($4,900 limit × .75), $2,212.50 for 2002 ($2,950 limit × .75), and $1,331.25 for 2003 ($1,775 limit × .75). However, under § 1.280F-2T(g)(2)(ii)(A), the exchanged basis is reduced by the excess (if any) of the depreciation that would have been allowable if the exchanged automobile had been used solely for business over the depreciation that was allowable in those years. Thus, the exchanged basis, for purposes of computing depreciation, for Automobile Y is $17,315.

# Example 3.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except that H placed in service Automobile X in January 2002, and H elected not to claim the additional first year depreciation deduction for 5-year property placed in service in 2002 and 2003. The relinquished automobile section 280F limit for Automobile X for 2003 is $4,900. Because the replacement automobile section 280F limit for 2003 for Automobile Y ($3,060) is less than the relinquished automobile section 280F limit for Automobile X for 2003 and is less than $5,388 (($30,000 (cost) − $3,060 (depreciation allowable for 2002)) × 0.4 × 6/12), the depreciation that would be allowable for Automobile X (determined without regard to section 280F) in the year of disposition, the depreciation for Automobile X in the year of disposition is limited to $3,060. For 2003 no depreciation is allowable for the excess basis and the exchanged basis in Automobile Y.

# Example 4.
AB, a calendar-year taxpayer, purchased and placed in service Automobile X1 in February 2000 for $10,000. X1 is a passenger automobile subject to section 280F(a) and is used solely for AB's business. AB depreciated X1 using a 5-year recovery period, the double declining balance method, and the half-year convention. As of January 1, 2003, the adjusted depreciable basis of X1 was
$2,880 ($10,000 original cost minus $2,000 depreciation deduction for 2000, minus $3,200 depreciation deduction for 2001, and $1,920 depreciation deduction for 2002). In November 2003, AB exchanges, in a like-kind exchange, Automobile X1 plus $14,000 cash for new Automobile Y1 that will be used solely in AB's business. Automobile Y1 is 50-percent bonus depreciation property for purposes of section 168(k)(4) and qualifies for the expensing election under section 179. Pursuant to paragraph § 1.168(k)-1(g)(3)(ii) and paragraph (k)(2)(i) of this section, AB decided to apply § 1.168(i)-6 to the exchange of Automobile X1 for Automobile Y1, the replacement MACRS property. AB also makes the election under section 179 for the excess basis of Automobile Y1. AB depreciates Y1 using a five-year recovery period, the double declining balance method and the half-year convention. For 2003, the relinquished automobile section 280F limit for Automobile X1 is $1,775 and the replacement automobile section 280F limit for 2003 for Automobile Y1 is $10,710.
(i) The 2003 depreciation deduction for Automobile X1 is $576. The depreciation deduction calculated for X1 is $576 (the adjusted depreciable basis of Automobile X1 at the beginning of 2003 of $2,880 × 40% ×
1/2
year), which is less than the relinquished automobile section 280F limit and the replacement automobile section 280F limit.
(ii) The additional first year depreciation deduction for the exchanged basis is $1,152. The additional first year depreciation deduction of $1,152 (remaining exchanged basis of $2,304 ($2,880 adjusted basis of Automobile X1 at the beginning of 2003 minus $576) − 0.5)) is less than the replacement automobile section 280F limit minus $576.
(iii) AB's MACRS depreciation deduction allowable in 2003 for the remaining exchanged basis of $1,152 is $47 (the relinquished automobile section 280F limit of $1,775 less the depreciation deduction of $576 taken for Automobile X1 less the additional first year depreciation deduction of $1,152 taken for the exchanged basis) which is less than the depreciation deduction calculated for the depreciable exchanged basis.
(iv) For 2003, AB takes a $1,400 section 179 deduction for the excess basis of Automobile Y1. AB must reduce the excess basis of $14,000 by the section 179 deduction of $1,400 to determine the remaining excess basis of $12,600.
(v) For 2003, AB is allowed a 50-percent additional first year depreciation deduction of $6,300 (the remaining excess basis of $12,600 multiplied by .50).
(vi) For 2003, AB's depreciation deduction for the depreciable excess basis is limited to $1,235. The depreciation deduction computed without regard to the replacement automobile section 280F limit is $1,260 ($6,300 depreciable excess basis × 0.4 × 6/12). However the depreciation deduction for the depreciable excess basis is limited to $1,235 ($10,710 (replacement automobile section 280F limit) − $576 (depreciation deduction for Automobile X1) − $1,152 (additional first year depreciation deduction for the exchanged basis) − $47 (depreciation deduction for exchanged basis) − 1,400 (section 179 deduction) − $6,300 (additional first year depreciation deduction for remaining excess basis)).
(4)
Involuntary conversion for which the replacement MACRS property is acquired and placed in service before disposition of relinquished MACRS property.
If, in an involuntary conversion, a taxpayer acquires and places in service the replacement MACRS property before the date of disposition of the relinquished MACRS property, the taxpayer depreciates the unadjusted depreciable basis of the replacement MACRS property under section 168 beginning in the taxable year when the replacement MACRS property is placed in service by the taxpayer and by using the applicable depreciation method, recovery period, and convention prescribed under section 168 for the replacement MACRS property at the placed-in-service date. However, at the time of disposition of the relinquished MACRS property, the taxpayer determines the exchanged basis and the excess basis of the replacement MACRS property and begins to depreciate the depreciable exchanged basis of the replacement MACRS property in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. The depreciable excess basis of the replacement MACRS property continues to be depreciated by the taxpayer in accordance with the first sentence of this paragraph (d)(4). Further, in the year of disposition of the relinquished MACRS property, the taxpayer must include in taxable income the excess of the depreciation deductions allowable on the unadjusted depreciable basis of the replacement MACRS property over the depreciation deductions that would have been allowable to the taxpayer on the depreciable excess basis of the replacement MACRS property from the date the replacement MACRS property was placed in service by the taxpayer (taking into account the applicable convention) to the time of disposition of the relinquished MACRS property. However, see § 1.168(k)-1(f)(5)(v) for replacement MACRS property that is qualified property or 50-percent bonus
depreciation property and § 1.1400L(b)-1(f)(5) for replacement MACRS property that is qualified New York Liberty Zone property. Further, see § 1.168(k)-2(g)(5)(iv) for replacement MACRS property that is qualified property under section 168(k), as amended by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Public Law 115-97 (131 Stat. 2054 (December 22, 2017)).
(e)
Use of optional depreciation tables
—(1)
Taxpayer not bound by prior use of table.
If a taxpayer used an optional depreciation table for the relinquished MACRS property, the taxpayer is not required to use an optional table for the depreciable exchanged basis of the replacement MACRS property. Conversely, if a taxpayer did not use an optional depreciation table for the relinquished MACRS property, the taxpayer may use the appropriate table for the depreciable exchanged basis of the replacement MACRS property. If a taxpayer decides not to use the table for the depreciable exchanged basis of the replacement MACRS property, the depreciation allowance for this property for the year of replacement and subsequent taxable years is determined under paragraph (c) of this section. If a taxpayer decides to use the optional depreciation tables, no depreciation deduction is allowable for MACRS property placed in service by the acquiring taxpayer and subsequently exchanged or involuntarily converted by such taxpayer in the same taxable year, and, if, during the same taxable year, MACRS property is placed in service by the acquiring taxpayer, exchanged or involuntarily converted by such taxpayer, and the replacement MACRS property is disposed of by such taxpayer, no depreciation deduction is allowable for either MACRS property.
(2)
Determination of the depreciation deduction
—(i)
Relinquished MACRS property.
In the year of disposition, the depreciation allowance for the relinquished MACRS property is computed by multiplying the unadjusted depreciable basis (less the amount of the additional first year depreciation deduction allowed or allowable, whichever is greater, under section 168(k) or section 1400L(b), as applicable) of the relinquished MACRS property by the annual depreciation rate (expressed as a decimal equivalent) specified in the appropriate table for the recovery year corresponding to the year of disposition. This product is then multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months (including fractions of months) the property is deemed to be placed in service during the year of the exchange or involuntary conversion (taking into account the applicable convention) and the denominator of which is 12. However, if the year of disposition is less than 12 months, the depreciation allowance determined under this paragraph (e)(2)(i) must be adjusted for a short taxable year (for further guidance, for example, see Rev. Proc. 89-15 (1989-1 CB 816) and § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(
b
) of this chapter).
(ii)
Replacement MACRS property
—(A)
Determination of the appropriate optional depreciation table.
If a taxpayer chooses to use the appropriate optional depreciation table for the depreciable exchanged basis, the depreciation allowances for the depreciable exchanged basis beginning in the year of replacement are determined by choosing the optional depreciation table that corresponds to the recovery period, depreciation method, and convention of the replacement MACRS property determined under paragraph (c) of this section.
(B)
Calculating the depreciation deduction for the replacement MACRS property.
(
1
) The depreciation deduction for the taxable year is computed by first determining the appropriate recovery year in the table identified under paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(A) of this section. The appropriate recovery year for the year of replacement is the same as the recovery year for the year of disposition, regardless of the taxable year in which the replacement property is acquired. For example, if the recovery year for the year of disposition would have been year 4 in the table that applied before the disposition of the relinquished MACRS property, then the recovery year for the year of replacement is Year 4 in the table identified under paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(A) of this section.
(
2
) Next, the annual depreciation rate (expressed as a decimal equivalent) for each recovery year is multiplied by a transaction coefficient. The transaction coefficient is the formula (1 / (1
− x)) where x equals the sum of the annual depreciation rates from the table identified under paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(A) of this section (expressed as a decimal equivalent) corresponding to the replacement MACRS property (as determined under paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(A) of this section) for the taxable years beginning with the placed-in-service year of the relinquished MACRS property through the taxable year immediately prior to the year of disposition. The product of the annual depreciation rate and the transaction coefficient is multiplied by the depreciable exchanged basis (taking into account paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section). In the year of replacement, this product is then multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months (including fractions of months) the property is deemed to be placed in service by the acquiring taxpayer during the year of replacement (taking into account the applicable convention) and the denominator of which is 12. However, if the year of replacement is the year the relinquished MACRS property is placed in service by the acquiring taxpayer, the preceding sentence does not apply. In addition, if the year of replacement is less than 12 months, the depreciation allowance determined under paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section must be adjusted for a short taxable year (for further guidance, for example, see Rev. Proc. 89-15 (1989-1 CB 816) and § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(
b
) of this chapter).
(iii)
Unrecovered basis.
If the replacement MACRS property would have unrecovered depreciable basis after the final recovery year (for example, due to a deferred exchange), the unrecovered basis is an allowable depreciation deduction in the taxable year that corresponds to the final recovery year unless the unrecovered basis is subject to a depreciation limitation such as section 280F.
(3)
Excess basis.
As provided in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, any excess basis in the replacement MACRS property is treated as property that is placed in service by the acquiring taxpayer at the time of replacement. Thus, if the taxpayer chooses to use the appropriate optional depreciation table for the depreciable excess basis in the replacement MACRS property, the depreciation allowances for the depreciable excess basis are determined by multiplying the depreciable excess basis by the annual depreciation rate (expressed as a decimal equivalent) specified in the appropriate table for each taxable year. The appropriate table for the depreciable excess basis is based on the depreciation method, recovery period, and convention applicable to the depreciable excess basis under section 168 at the time of replacement. However, If the year of replacement is less than 12 months, the depreciation allowance determined under this paragraph (e)(3) must be adjusted for a short taxable year (for further guidance, for example, see Rev. Proc. 89-15 (1989-1 CB 816) and § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(
b
) of this chapter).
(4)
Examples.
The application of this paragraph (e) is illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
J, a calendar-year taxpayer, acquired 5-year property for $10,000 and placed it in service in January 2001. J uses the optional tables to depreciate the property. J uses the half-year convention and did not make any elections for the property. In December 2003, J exchanges the 5-year property for used 7-year property in a like-kind exchange. Pursuant to paragraph (k)(2)(i) of this section, J decided to apply § 1.168(i)-6 to the exchange of the 5-year property for the 7-year property, the replacement MACRS property. The depreciable exchanged basis of the 7-year property equals the adjusted depreciable basis of the 5-year property at the time of disposition of the relinquished MACRS property, namely $3,840 ($10,000 less $2,000 depreciation in 2001, $3,200 depreciation in 2002, and $960 depreciation in 2003). J must first determine the appropriate optional depreciation table pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section. Since the replacement MACRS property has a longer recovery period and the same depreciation method as the relinquished MACRS property, J uses the optional depreciation table corresponding to a 7-year recovery period, the 200% declining balance method, and the half-year convention (because the 5-year property was depreciated using a half-year convention). Had the replacement MACRS property been placed in service in the same taxable year as the placed-in-service year of the relinquished MACRS property, the depreciation allowance for the replacement MACRS property for the year of replacement would be determined using recovery year 3 of the optional table. The depreciation allowance equals the depreciable exchanged basis ($3,840) multiplied by the annual depreciation rate for the current
taxable year (.1749 for recovery year 3) as modified by the transaction coefficient [1 / (1 − (.1429 + .2449))] which equals 1.6335. Thus, J multiplies $3,840, its depreciable exchanged basis in the replacement MACRS property, by the product of .1749 and 1.6335, and then by one-half, to determine the depreciation allowance for 2003, $549. For 2004, J multiples its depreciable exchanged basis in the replacement MACRS property determined at the time of replacement of $3,840 by the product of the modified annual depreciation rate for the current taxable year (.1249 for recovery year 4) and the transaction coefficient (1.6335) to determine its depreciation allowance of $783.

# Example 2.
K, a calendar-year taxpayer, acquired used Asset V for $100,000 and placed it in service in January 1999. K depreciated Asset V under the general depreciation system of section 168(a) by using a 5-year recovery period, the 200-percent declining balance method of depreciation, and the half-year convention. In December 2003, as part of the involuntary conversion, Asset V is involuntarily converted due to an earthquake. In October 2005, K purchases used Asset W with the insurance proceeds from the destruction of Asset V and places Asset W in service to replace Asset V. Pursuant to paragraph (k)(2)(i) of this section, K decided to apply § 1.168(i)-6 to the involuntary conversion of Asset V with the replacement of Asset W, the replacement MACRS property. If Asset W had been placed in service when Asset V was placed in service, it would have been depreciated using a 7-year recovery period, the 200-percent declining balance method, and the half-year convention. K uses the optional depreciation tables to depreciate Asset V and Asset W. For 2003 (recovery year 5 on the optional table), the depreciation deduction for Asset V is $5,760 ((0.1152)($100,000)(1/2)). Thus, the adjusted depreciable basis of Asset V at the time of replacement is $11,520 ($100,000 less $20,000 depreciation in 1999, $32,000 depreciation in 2000, $19,200 depreciation in 2001, $11,520 depreciation in 2002, and $5,760 depreciation in 2003). Under the table that applied to Asset V, the year of disposition was recovery year 5 and the depreciation deduction was determined under the straight line method. The table that applies for Asset W is the table that applies the straight line depreciation method, the half-year convention, and a 7-year recovery period. The appropriate recovery year under this table is recovery year 5. The depreciation deduction for Asset W for 2005 is $1,646 (($11,520)(0.1429)(1/(1−0.5))(1/2)). Thus, the depreciation deduction for Asset W in 2006 (recovery year 6) is $3,290 ($11,520)(0.1428)(1/(1−0.5)). The depreciation deduction for 2007 (recovery year 7) is $3,292 (($11,520)(.1429)(1/(1−.5))). The depreciation deduction for 2008 (recovery year 8) is $3292 ($11,520 less allowable depreciation for Asset W for 2005 through 2007 ($1,646 + $3,290 + $3,292)).

# Example 3.
L, a calendar-year taxpayer, placed in service used Computer X in January 2002 for $5,000. L depreciated Computer X under the general depreciation system of section 168(a) by using the 200-percent declining balance method of depreciation, a 5-year recovery period, and the half-year convention. Computer X is destroyed in a fire in March 2004. For 2004, the depreciation deduction allowable for Computer X equals $480 ([($5,000)(.1920)] × (1/2)). Thus, the adjusted depreciable basis of Computer X was $1,920 when it was destroyed ($5,000 unadjusted depreciable basis less $1,000 depreciation for 2002, $1,600 depreciation for 2003, and $480 depreciation for 2004). In April 2004, as part of the involuntary conversion, L acquired and placed in service used Computer Y with insurance proceeds received due to the loss of Computer X. Computer Y will be depreciated using the same depreciation method, recovery period, and convention as Computer X. L elected to use the optional depreciation tables to compute the depreciation allowance for Computer X and Computer Y. The depreciation deduction allowable for 2004 for Computer Y equals $384 ([$1,920 × (.1920)(1/(1−.52))] × (1/2)).
(f)
Mid-quarter convention.
For purposes of applying the 40-percent test under section 168(d) and the regulations under section 168(d), the following rules apply:
(1)
Exchanged basis.
If, in a taxable year, MACRS property is placed in service by the acquiring taxpayer (but not as a result of a like-kind exchange or involuntary conversion) and—
(i) In the same taxable year, is disposed of by the acquiring taxpayer in a like-kind exchange or an involuntary conversion and replaced by the acquiring taxpayer with replacement MACRS property, the exchanged basis (determined without any adjustments for depreciation deductions during the taxable year) of the replacement MACRS property is taken into account in the year of replacement in the quarter the relinquished MACRS property was placed in service by the acquiring taxpayer; or
(ii) In the same taxable year, is disposed of by the acquiring taxpayer in a like-kind exchange or an involuntary conversion, and in a subsequent taxable year is replaced by the acquiring taxpayer with replacement MACRS
property, the exchanged basis (determined without any adjustments for depreciation deductions during the taxable year) of the replacement MACRS property is taken into account in the year of replacement in the quarter the replacement MACRS property was placed in service by the acquiring taxpayer; or
(iii) In a subsequent taxable year, disposed of by the acquiring taxpayer in a like-kind exchange or involuntary conversion, the exchanged basis of the replacement MACRS property is not taken into account in the year of replacement.
(2)
Excess basis.
Any excess basis is taken into account in the quarter the replacement MACRS property is placed in service by the acquiring taxpayer.
(3)
Depreciable property acquired for nondepreciable property.
Both the exchanged basis and excess basis of the replacement MACRS property described in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section (depreciable property acquired for nondepreciable property), are taken into account for determining whether the mid-quarter convention applies in the year of replacement.
(g)
Section 179 election.
In applying the section 179 election, only the excess basis, if any, in the replacement MACRS property is taken into account. If the replacement MACRS property is described in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section (depreciable property acquired for nondepreciable property), only the excess basis in the replacement MACRS property is taken into account.
(h)
Additional first year depreciation deduction.
See § 1.168(k)-1(f)(5) (for qualified property or 50-percent bonus depreciation property) and § 1.1400L(b)-1(f)(5) (for qualified New York Liberty Zone property). Further, see § 1.168(k)-2(g)(5) for qualified property under section 168(k), as amended by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Public Law 115-97 (131 Stat. 2054 (December 22, 2017)).
(i)
Elections
—(1)
Election not to apply this section.
A taxpayer may elect not to apply this section for any MACRS property involved in a like-kind exchange or involuntary conversion. An election under this paragraph (i)(1) applies only to the taxpayer making the election and the election applies to both the relinquished MACRS property and the replacement MACRS property. If an election is made under this paragraph (i)(1), the depreciation allowances for the replacement MACRS property beginning in the year of replacement and for the relinquished MACRS property in the year of disposition are not determined under this section (except as otherwise provided in this paragraph). Instead, for depreciation purposes only, the sum of the exchanged basis and excess basis, if any, in the replacement MACRS property is treated as property placed in service by the taxpayer at the time of replacement and the adjusted depreciable basis of the relinquished MACRS property is treated as being disposed of by the taxpayer at the time of disposition. While the relinquished MACRS property is treated as being disposed of at the time of disposition for depreciation purposes, the election not to apply this section does not affect the application of sections 1031 and 1033 (for example, if a taxpayer does not make the election under this paragraph (i)(1) and does not recognize gain or loss under section 1031, this result would not change if the taxpayer chose to make the election under this paragraph (i)(1)). In addition, the election not to apply this section does not affect the application of sections 1245 and 1250 to the relinquished MACRS property. Paragraphs (c)(5)(i) (determination of depreciation for relinquished MACRS property in the year of disposition), (c)(5)(iii) (rules for deferred transactions), (g) (section 179 election), and (h) (additional first year depreciation deduction) of this section apply to property to which this paragraph (i)(1) applies. See paragraph (j) of this section for the time and manner of making the election under this paragraph (i)(1).
(2)
Election to treat certain replacement property as MACRS property.
If the tangible depreciable property acquired by a taxpayer in a like-kind exchange or involuntary conversion (the replacement property) replaces tangible depreciable property for which the taxpayer made a valid election under section 168(f)(1) to exclude it from the application of MACRS (the relinquished property), the taxpayer may elect to treat, for depreciation purposes only, the sum
of the exchanged basis and excess basis, if any, of the replacement property as MACRS property that is placed in service by the taxpayer at the time of replacement. An election under this paragraph (i)(2) applies only to the taxpayer making the election and the election applies to both the relinquished property and the replacement property. If an election is made under this paragraph (i)(2), the adjusted depreciable basis of the relinquished property is treated as being disposed of by the taxpayer at the time of disposition. Rules similar to those provided in §§ 1.168(i)-6(b)(3) and (4) apply for purposes of determining the time of disposition and time of replacement under this paragraph (i)(2). While the relinquished property is treated as being disposed of at the time of disposition for depreciation purposes, the election under this paragraph (i)(2) does not affect the application of sections 1031 and 1033, and the application of sections 1245 and 1250 to the relinquished property. If an election is made under this paragraph (i)(2), rules similar to those provided in paragraphs (c)(5)(iii) (rules for deferred transactions), (g) (section 179 election), and (h) (additional first year depreciation deduction) of this section apply to property. Except as provided in paragraph (k)(3)(ii) of this section, a taxpayer makes the election under this paragraph (i)(2) by claiming the depreciation allowance as determined under MACRS for the replacement property on the taxpayer's timely filed (including extensions) original Federal tax return for the placed-in-service year of the replacement property as determined under this paragraph (i)(2).
(j)
Time and manner of making election under paragraph (i)(1) of this section
—(1)
In general.
The election provided in paragraph (i)(1) of this section is made separately by each person acquiring replacement MACRS property. The election is made for each member of a consolidated group by the common parent of the group, by the partnership (and not by the partners separately) in the case of a partnership, or by the S corporation (and not by the shareholders separately) in the case of an S corporation. A separate election under paragraph (i)(1) of this section is required for each like-kind exchange or involuntary conversion. The election provided in paragraph (i)(1) of this section must be made within the time and manner provided in paragraph (j)(2) and (3) of this section and may not be made by the taxpayer in any other manner (for example, the election cannot be made through a request under section 446(e) to change the taxpayer's method of accounting), except as provided in paragraph (k)(2) of this section.
(2)
Time for making election.
The election provided in paragraph (i)(1) of this section must be made by the due date (including extensions) of the taxpayer's Federal tax return for the year of replacement.
(3)
Manner of making election.
The election provided in paragraph (i)(1) of this section is made in the manner provided for on Form 4562, Depreciation and Amortization, and its instructions. If Form 4562 is revised or renumbered, any reference in this section to that form is treated as a reference to the revised or renumbered form.
(4)
Revocation.
The election provided in paragraph (i)(1) of this section, once made, may be revoked only with the consent of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. Such consent will be granted only in extraordinary circumstances. Requests for consent are requests for a letter ruling and must be filed with the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Washington, DC 20224. Requests for consent may not be made in any other manner (for example, through a request under section 446(e) to change the taxpayer's method of accounting).
(k)
Effective date
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraphs (k)(3) and (4) of this section, this section applies to a like-kind exchange or an involuntary conversion of MACRS property for which the time of disposition and the time of replacement both occur after February 27, 2004.
(2)
Application to pre-effective date like-kind exchanges and involuntary conversions.
For a like-kind exchange or an involuntary conversion of MACRS property for which the time of disposition, the time of replacement, or both occur on or before February 27, 2004, a taxpayer may—
(i) Apply the provisions of this section. If a taxpayer's applicable Federal tax return has been filed on or before February 27, 2004, and the taxpayer has treated the replacement MACRS property as acquired, and the relinquished MACRS property as disposed of, in a like-kind exchange or an involuntary conversion, the taxpayer changes its method of accounting for depreciation of the replacement MACRS property and relinquished MACRS property in accordance with this paragraph (k)(2)(i) by following the applicable administrative procedures issued under § 1.446-1(e)(3)(ii) for obtaining the Commissioner's automatic consent to a change in method of accounting (for further guidance, see Rev. Proc. 2002-9 (2002-1 CB 327) and § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(
b
) of this chapter); or
(ii) Rely on prior guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service for determining the depreciation deductions of replacement MACRS property and relinquished MACRS property (for further guidance, for example, see Notice 2000-4 (2001-1 CB 313) and § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(
b
) of this chapter). In relying on such guidance, a taxpayer may use any reasonable, consistent method of determining depreciation in the year of disposition and the year of replacement. If a taxpayer's applicable Federal tax return has been filed on or before February 27, 2004, and the taxpayer has treated the replacement MACRS property as acquired, and the relinquished MACRS property as disposed of, in a like-kind exchange or an involuntary conversion, the taxpayer changes its method of accounting for depreciation of the replacement MACRS property and relinquished MACRS property in accordance with this paragraph (k)(2)(ii) by following the applicable administrative procedures issued under § 1.446-1(e)(3)(ii) for obtaining the Commissioner's automatic consent to a change in method of accounting (for further guidance, see Rev. Proc. 2002-9 (2002-1 CB 327) and § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(
b
) of this chapter).
(3)
Like-kind exchanges and involuntary conversions where the taxpayer made the election under section 168(f)(1) for the relinquished property
—(i)
In general.
If the tangible depreciable property acquired by a taxpayer in a like-kind exchange or involuntary conversion (the replacement property) replaces tangible depreciable property for which the taxpayer made a valid election under section 168(f)(1) to exclude it from the application of MACRS (the relinquished property), paragraph (i)(2) of this section applies to such relinquished property and replacement property for which the time of disposition and the time of replacement (both as determined under paragraph (i)(2) of this section) both occur after February 26, 2007.
(ii)
Application of paragraph (i)(2) of this section to pre-February 26, 2007 like-kind exchanges and involuntary conversions.
If the tangible depreciable property acquired by a taxpayer in a like-kind exchange or involuntary conversion (the replacement property) replaces tangible depreciable property for which the taxpayer made a valid election under section 168(f)(1) to exclude it from the application of MACRS (the relinquished property), the taxpayer may apply paragraph (i)(2) of this section to the relinquished property and the replacement property for which the time of disposition, the time of replacement (both as determined under paragraph (i)(2) of this section), or both occur on or before February 26, 2007. If the taxpayer wants to apply paragraph (i)(2) of this section and the taxpayer's applicable Federal tax return has been filed on or before February 26, 2007, the taxpayer must change its method of accounting for depreciation of the replacement property and relinquished property in accordance with this paragraph (k)(3)(ii) by following the applicable administrative procedures issued under § 1.446-1(e)(3)(ii) for obtaining the Commissioner's automatic consent to a change in method of accounting (for further guidance, see Rev. Proc. 2002-9 (2002-1 CB 327) and § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(b) of this chapter).
(4)
Qualified property under section 168(k) acquired and placed in service after September 27, 2017
—(i)
In general.
The language “1.168(k)-2(g)(5),” in paragraphs (d)(3)(ii)(B) and (E) of this section and the final sentence in paragraphs (d)(4) and (h) of this section
apply to a like-kind exchange or an involuntary conversion of MACRS property, which is qualified property under section 168(k)(2), for which the time of replacement occurs on or after September 24, 2019.
(ii)
Early application.
A taxpayer may choose to apply the language “1.168(k)-2(g)(5),” in paragraphs (d)(3)(ii)(B) and (E) of this section and the final sentence in paragraphs (d)(4) and (h) of this section to a like-kind exchange or an involuntary conversion of MACRS property, which is qualified property under section 168(k)(2), for which the time of replacement occurs on or after September 28, 2017.
(iii)
Early application of regulation project REG-104397-18.
A taxpayer may rely on the language “1.168(k)-2(f)(5),” in paragraphs (d)(3)(ii)(B) and (E) of this section and the final sentence in paragraphs (d)(4) and (h) of this section in regulation project REG-104397-18 (2018-41 I.R.B. 558) (see § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(
b
) of this chapter) for a like-kind exchange or an involuntary conversion of MACRS property, which is qualified property under section 168(k)(2), for which the time of replacement occurs on or after September 28, 2017, and occurs before September 24, 2019.
[T.D. 9314, 72 FR 9251, Mar. 1, 2007, as amended by T.D. 9874, 84 FR 50127, Sept. 24, 2019]
§ 1.168(i)-7
Accounting for MACRS property.
(a)
In general.
A taxpayer may account for MACRS property (as defined in § 1.168(b)-1(a)(2)) by treating each individual asset as an account (a “single asset account” or an “item account”) or by combining two or more assets in a single account (a “multiple asset account” or a “pool”). A taxpayer may establish as many accounts for MACRS property as the taxpayer wants. This section does not apply to assets included in general asset accounts. For rules applicable to general asset accounts, see § 1.168(i)-1.
(b)
Required use of single asset accounts.
A taxpayer must account for an asset in a single asset account if the taxpayer uses the asset both in a trade or business or for the production of income and in a personal activity, or if the taxpayer places in service and disposes of the asset during the same taxable year. Also, if general asset account treatment for an asset terminates under § 1.168(i)-1(c)(1)(ii)(A), (e)(3)(iii), (e)(3)(v), (e)(3)(vii), (g), or (h)(1), as applicable, the taxpayer must account for the asset in a single asset account beginning in the taxable year in which the general asset account treatment for the asset terminates. If a taxpayer accounts for an asset in a multiple asset account or a pool and the taxpayer disposes of the asset, the taxpayer must account for the asset in a single asset account beginning in the taxable year in which the disposition occurs. See § 1.168(i)-8(h)(2)(i). If a taxpayer disposes of a portion of an asset and § 1.168(i)-8(d)(1) applies to that disposition, the taxpayer must account for the disposed portion in a single asset account beginning in the taxable year in which the disposition occurs. See § 1.168(i)-8(h)(3)(i).
(c)
Establishment of multiple asset accounts or pools
—(1)
Assets eligible for multiple asset accounts or pools.
Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, assets that are subject to either the general depreciation system of section 168(a) or the alternative depreciation system of section 168(g) may be accounted for in one or more multiple asset accounts or pools.
(2)
Grouping assets in multiple asset accounts or pools
—(i)
General rules.
Assets that are eligible to be grouped into a single multiple asset account or pool may be divided into more than one multiple asset account or pool. Each multiple asset account or pool must include only assets that—
(A) Have the same applicable depreciation method;
(B) Have the same applicable recovery period;
(C) Have the same applicable convention; and
(D) Are placed in service by the taxpayer in the same taxable year.
(ii)
Special rules.
In addition to the general rules in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, the following rules apply when establishing multiple asset accounts or pools—
(A) Assets subject to the mid-quarter convention may only be grouped into a
multiple asset account or pool with assets that are placed in service in the same quarter of the taxable year;
(B) Assets subject to the mid-month convention may only be grouped into a multiple asset account or pool with assets that are placed in service in the same month of the taxable year;
(C) Passenger automobiles for which the depreciation allowance is limited under section 280F(a) must be grouped into a separate multiple asset account or pool;
(D) Assets not eligible for any additional first year depreciation deduction (including assets for which the taxpayer elected not to deduct the additional first year depreciation) provided by, for example, section 168(k) through (n), 1400L(b), or 1400N(d), must be grouped into a separate multiple asset account or pool;
(E) Assets eligible for the additional first year depreciation deduction may only be grouped into a multiple asset account or pool with assets for which the taxpayer claimed the same percentage of the additional first year depreciation (for example, 30 percent, 50 percent, or 100 percent);
(F) Except for passenger automobiles described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C) of this section, listed property (as defined in section 280F(d)(4)) must be grouped into a separate multiple asset account or pool;
(G) Assets for which the depreciation allowance for the placed-in-service year is not determined by using an optional depreciation table (for further guidance, see section 8 of Rev. Proc. 87-57, 1987-2 CB 687, 693 (see § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter)) must be grouped into a separate multiple asset account or pool; and
(H) Mass assets (as defined in § 1.168(i)-8(b)(3)) that are or will be subject to § 1.168(i)-8(g)(2)(iii) (disposed of or converted mass asset is identified by a mortality dispersion table) must be grouped into a separate multiple asset account or pool.
(d)
Cross references.
See § 1.167(a)-7(c) for the records to be maintained by a taxpayer for each account. In addition, see § 1.168(i)-1(l)(3) for the records to be maintained by a taxpayer for each general asset account.

§ 1.168(i)-8
Dispositions of MACRS property.
(a)
Scope.
This section provides rules applicable to dispositions of MACRS property (as defined in § 1.168(b)-1(a)(2)) or to depreciable property (as defined in § 1.168(b)-1(a)(1)) that would be MACRS property but for an election made by the taxpayer either to expense all or some of the property's cost under
section 179, section 179A, section 179B, section 179C, section 179D, or section 1400I(a)(1), or any similar provision, or to amortize all or some of the property's cost under section 1400I(a)(2) or any similar provision. This section also applies to dispositions described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section of a portion of such property. Except as provided in § 1.168(i)-1(e)(3), this section does not apply to dispositions of assets included in a general asset account. For rules applicable to dispositions of assets included in a general asset account, see § 1.168(i)-1(e).

Definitions.
For purposes of this section—
(1)
Building
has the same meaning as that term is defined in § 1.48-1(e)(1).

Disposition
occurs when ownership of the asset is transferred or when the asset is permanently withdrawn from use either in the taxpayer's trade or business or in the production of income. A disposition includes the sale, exchange, retirement, physical abandonment, or destruction of an asset. A disposition also occurs when an asset is transferred to a supplies, scrap, or similar account, or when a portion of an asset is disposed of as described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. If a structural component, or a portion thereof, of a building is disposed of in a disposition described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, a disposition also includes the disposition of such structural component or such portion thereof.
(3)
Mass assets
is a mass or group of individual items of depreciable assets—
(i) That are not necessarily homogenous;
(ii) Each of which is minor in value relative to the total value of the mass or group;
(iii) Numerous in quantity;
(iv) Usually accounted for only on a total dollar or quantity basis;
(v) With respect to which separate identification is impracticable; and
(vi) Placed in service in the same taxable year.
(4)
Portion of an asset
is any part of an asset that is less than the entire asset as determined under paragraph (c)(4) of this section.
(5)
Structural component
has the same meaning as that term is defined in § 1.48-1(e)(2).
(6)
Unadjusted depreciable basis of the multiple asset account or pool
is the sum of the unadjusted depreciable bases (as defined in § 1.168(b)-1(a)(3)) of all assets included in the multiple asset account or pool.
(c)
Special rules
—(1)
Manner of disposition.
The manner of disposition (for example, normal retirement, abnormal retirement, ordinary retirement, or extraordinary retirement) is not taken into account in determining whether a disposition occurs or gain or loss is recognized.
(2)
Disposition by transfer to a supplies account.
If a taxpayer made an election under § 1.162-3(d) to treat the cost of any rotable spare part, temporary spare part, or standby emergency spare part (as defined in § 1.162-3(c)) as a capital expenditure subject to the allowance for depreciation, the taxpayer can dispose of the rotable, temporary, or standby emergency spare part by transferring it to a supplies account only if the taxpayer has obtained the consent of the Commissioner to revoke the § 1.162-3(d) election. If a taxpayer made an election under § 1.162-3T(d) to treat the cost of any material and supply (as defined in § 1.162-3T(c)(1)) as a capital expenditure subject to the allowance for depreciation, the taxpayer can dispose of the material and supply by transferring it to a supplies account only if the taxpayer has obtained the consent of the Commissioner to revoke the § 1.162-3T(d) election. See § 1.162-3(d)(3) for the procedures for revoking a § 1.162-3(d) or a § 1.162-3T(d) election.
(3)
Leasehold improvements.
This section also applies to—
(i) A lessor of leased property that made an improvement to that property for the lessee of the property, has a depreciable basis in the improvement, and disposes of the improvement, or disposes of a portion of the improvement under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, before or upon the termination of the lease with the lessee. See section 168(i)(8)(B); and
(ii) A lessee of leased property that made an improvement to that property, has a depreciable basis in the improvement, and disposes of the improvement, or disposes of a portion of the improvement under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, before or upon the termination of the lease.
(4)
Determination of asset disposed of
—(i)
General rules.
For purposes of applying this section, the facts and circumstances of each disposition are considered in determining what is the appropriate asset disposed of. The asset for disposition purposes may not consist of items placed in service by the taxpayer on different dates, without taking into account the applicable convention. For purposes of determining what is the appropriate asset disposed of, the unit of property determination under § 1.263(a)-3(e) or in published guidance in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter) under section 263(a) and the distinct asset determination under § 1.1031(a)-3(a)(4) do not apply.
(ii)
Special rules.
In addition to the general rules in paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, the following rules apply for purposes of applying this section:
(A) Each building, including its structural components, is the asset, except as provided in § 1.1250-1(a)(2)(ii) or in paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(B) or (D) of this section.
(B) If a building has two or more condominium or cooperative units, each condominium or cooperative unit, including its structural components, is the asset, except as provided in § 1.1250-1(a)(2)(ii) or in paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(D) of this section.
(C) If a taxpayer properly includes an item in one of the asset classes 00.11 through 00.4 of Rev. Proc. 87-56 (1987-2 CB 674) (see § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter) or properly classifies an item in one of the categories under section 168(e)(3), except for a category that includes buildings or structural components (for example, retail motor fuels outlet, qualified leasehold improvement property, qualified restaurant property, and qualified retail improvement property), each item is the asset provided paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(D) of this section does not apply to the item. For example, each desk is the asset, each computer is the asset, and each qualified smart electric meter is the asset.
(D) If the taxpayer places in service an improvement or addition to an asset after the taxpayer placed the asset in service, the improvement or addition and, if applicable, its structural components are a separate asset.
(d)
Disposition of a portion of an asset
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of applying this section, a disposition includes a disposition of a portion of an asset as a result of a casualty event described in section 165, a disposition of a portion of an asset for which gain, determined without regard to section 1245 or section 1250, is not recognized in whole or in part under section 1031 or section 1033, a transfer of a portion of an asset in a transaction described in section 168(i)(7)(B), or a sale of a portion of an asset, even if the taxpayer does not make the election under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section for that disposed portion. For other transactions, a disposition includes a disposition of a portion of an asset only if the taxpayer makes the election under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section for that disposed portion.
(2)
Partial disposition election
—(i)
In general.
A taxpayer may make an election under this paragraph (d)(2) to apply this section to a disposition of a portion of an asset. If the asset is properly included in one of the asset classes 00.11 through 00.4 of Rev. Proc. 87-56, a taxpayer may make an election under this paragraph (d)(2) to apply this section to a disposition of a portion of such asset only if the taxpayer classifies the replacement portion of the asset under the same asset class as the disposed portion of the asset.
(ii)
Time and manner for making election
—(A)
Time for making election.
Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) or (iv) of this section, a taxpayer must make the election specified in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section by the due date, including extensions, of the original Federal tax return for the taxable year in which the portion of an asset is disposed of by the taxpayer.
(B)
Manner of making election.
Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) or (iv) of this section, a taxpayer must
make the election specified in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section by applying the provisions of this section for the taxable year in which the portion of an asset is disposed of by the taxpayer, by reporting the gain, loss, or other deduction on the taxpayer's timely filed, including extensions, original Federal tax return for that taxable year, and, if the asset is properly included in one of the asset classes 00.11 through 00.4 of Rev. Proc. 87-56, by classifying the replacement portion of such asset under the same asset class as the disposed portion of the asset in the taxable year in which the replacement portion is placed in service by the taxpayer. Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) or (iv)(B) of this section or except as otherwise expressly provided by other guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter), the election specified in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section may not be made through the filing of an application for change in accounting method.
(iii)
Special rule for subsequent Internal Revenue Service adjustment.
This paragraph (d)(2)(iii) applies when a taxpayer deducted the amount paid or incurred for the replacement of a portion of an asset as a repair under § 1.162-4, the taxpayer did not make the election specified in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section for the disposed portion of that asset within the time and in the manner under paragraph (d)(2)(ii) or (iv) of this section, and as a result of an examination of the taxpayer's Federal tax return, the Internal Revenue Service disallows the taxpayer's repair deduction for the amount paid or incurred for the replacement of the portion of that asset and instead capitalizes such amount under § 1.263(a)-2 or § 1.263(a)-3. If this paragraph (d)(2)(iii) applies, the taxpayer may make the election specified in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section for the disposition of the portion of the asset to which the Internal Revenue Service's adjustment pertains by filing an application for change in accounting method, provided the asset of which the disposed portion was a part is owned by the taxpayer at the beginning of the year of change (as defined for purposes of section 446(e)).
(iv)
Special rules for 2012 or 2013 returns.
If, under paragraph (j)(2) of this section, a taxpayer chooses to apply the provisions of this section to a taxable year beginning on or after January 1, 2012, and ending on or before September 19, 2013 (applicable taxable year), and the taxpayer did not make the election specified in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section on its timely filed original Federal tax return for the applicable taxable year, including extensions, the taxpayer must make the election specified in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section for the applicable taxable year by filing either—
(A) An amended Federal tax return for the applicable taxable year on or before 180 days from the due date including extensions of the taxpayer's Federal tax return for the applicable taxable year, notwithstanding that the taxpayer may not have extended the due date; or
(B) An application for change in accounting method with the taxpayer's timely filed original Federal tax return for the first or second taxable year succeeding the applicable taxable year.
(v)
Revocation.
A taxpayer may revoke the election specified in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section only by filing a request for a private letter ruling and obtaining the Commissioner's consent to revoke the election. The Commissioner may grant a request to revoke this election if the taxpayer acted reasonably and in good faith, and the revocation will not prejudice the interests of the Government. See generally § 301.9100-3 of this chapter. The election specified in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section may not be revoked through the filing of an application for change in accounting method.
(e)
Gain or loss on dispositions.
Solely for purposes of this paragraph (e), the term
asset
is an asset within the scope of this section or the portion of such asset that is disposed of in a disposition described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. Except as provided by section 280B and § 1.280B-1, the following rules apply when an asset is disposed of during a taxable year:
(1) If an asset is disposed of by sale, exchange, or involuntary conversion, gain or loss must be recognized under
the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.
(2) If an asset is disposed of by physical abandonment, loss must be recognized in the amount of the adjusted depreciable basis (as defined in § 1.168(b)-1(a)(4)) of the asset at the time of the abandonment, taking into account the applicable convention. However, if the abandoned asset is subject to nonrecourse indebtedness, paragraph (e)(1) of this section applies to the asset instead of this paragraph (e)(2). For a loss from physical abandonment to qualify for recognition under this paragraph (e)(2), the taxpayer must intend to discard the asset irrevocably so that the taxpayer will neither use the asset again nor retrieve it for sale, exchange, or other disposition.
(3) If an asset is disposed of other than by sale, exchange, involuntary conversion, physical abandonment, or conversion to personal use (as, for example, when the asset is transferred to a supplies or scrap account), gain is not recognized. Loss must be recognized in the amount of the excess of the adjusted depreciable basis of the asset at the time of the disposition, taking into account the applicable convention, over the asset's fair market value at the time of the disposition, taking into account the applicable convention.
(f)
Basis of asset disposed of
—(1)
In general.
The adjusted basis of an asset disposed of for computing gain or loss is its adjusted depreciable basis at the time of the asset's disposition, as determined under the applicable convention for the asset.
(2)
Assets disposed of are in multiple asset accounts.
(i) If the taxpayer accounts for the asset disposed of in a multiple asset account or pool and it is impracticable from the taxpayer's records to determine the unadjusted depreciable basis (as defined in § 1.168(b)-1(a)(3)) of the asset disposed of, the taxpayer may use any reasonable method that is consistently applied to all assets in the same multiple asset account or pool for purposes of determining the unadjusted depreciable basis of assets disposed of. Examples of a reasonable method include, but are not limited to, the following:
(A) If the replacement asset is a restoration (as defined in § 1.263(a)-3(k)), and is not a betterment (as defined in § 1.263(a)-3(j)) or an adaptation to a new or different use (as defined in § 1.263(a)-3(l)), discounting the cost of the replacement asset to its placed-in-service year cost using the Producer Price Index for Finished Goods or its successor, the Producer Price Index for Final Demand, or any other index designated by guidance in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter) for purposes of this paragraph (f)(2);
(B) A pro rata allocation of the unadjusted depreciable basis of the multiple asset account or pool based on the replacement cost of the disposed asset and the replacement cost of all of the assets in the multiple asset account or pool; and
(C) A study allocating the cost of the asset to its individual components.
(ii) To determine the adjusted depreciable basis of an asset disposed of in a multiple asset account or pool, the depreciation allowable for the asset disposed of is computed by using the depreciation method, recovery period, and convention applicable to the multiple asset account or pool in which the asset disposed of was included and by including the additional first year depreciation deduction claimed for the asset disposed of.
(3)
Disposition of a portion of an asset.
(i) This paragraph (f)(3) applies only when a taxpayer disposes of a portion of an asset and paragraph (d)(1) of this section applies to that disposition. For computing gain or loss, the adjusted basis of the disposed portion of the asset is the adjusted depreciable basis of that disposed portion at the time of its disposition, as determined under the applicable convention for the asset. If it is impracticable from the taxpayer's records to determine the unadjusted depreciable basis (as defined in § 1.168(b)-1(a)(3)) of the disposed portion of the asset, the taxpayer may use any reasonable method for purposes of determining the unadjusted depreciable basis (as defined in § 1.168(b)-1(a)(3)) of the disposed portion of the asset. If a taxpayer disposes of more than one portion of the same asset and it is impracticable from the taxpayer's records to determine the
unadjusted depreciable basis (as defined in § 1.168(b)-1(a)(3)) of the first disposed portion of the asset, the reasonable method used by the taxpayer must be consistently applied to all portions of the same asset for purposes of determining the unadjusted depreciable basis of each disposed portion of the asset. If the asset, a portion of which is disposed of, is in a multiple asset account or pool and it is impracticable from the taxpayer's records to determine the unadjusted depreciable basis (as defined in § 1.168(b)-1(a)(3)) of the disposed portion of the asset, the reasonable method used by the taxpayer must be consistently applied to all assets in the same multiple asset account or pool for purposes of determining the unadjusted depreciable basis of assets disposed of or any disposed portion of the assets. Examples of a reasonable method include, but are not limited to, the following:
(A) If the replacement portion is a restoration (as defined in § 1.263(a)-3(k)), and is not a betterment (as defined in § 1.263(a)-3(j)) or an adaptation to a new or different use (as defined in § 1.263(a)-3(l)), discounting the cost of the replacement portion of the asset to its placed-in-service year cost using the Producer Price Index for Finished Goods or its successor, the Producer Price Index for Final Demand, or any other index designated by guidance in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter) for purposes of this paragraph (f)(3);
(B) A pro rata allocation of the unadjusted depreciable basis of the asset based on the replacement cost of the disposed portion of the asset and the replacement cost of the asset; and
(C) A study allocating the cost of the asset to its individual components.
(ii) To determine the adjusted depreciable basis of the disposed portion of the asset, the depreciation allowable for the disposed portion is computed by using the depreciation method, recovery period, and convention applicable to the asset in which the disposed portion was included and by including the portion of the additional first year depreciation deduction claimed for the asset that is attributable to the disposed portion.
(g)
Identification of asset disposed of
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (g)(2) or (3) of this section, a taxpayer must use the specific identification method of accounting to identify which asset is disposed of by the taxpayer. Under this method of accounting, the taxpayer can determine the particular taxable year in which the asset disposed of was placed in service by the taxpayer.
(2)
Asset disposed of is in a multiple asset account.
If a taxpayer accounts for the asset disposed of in a multiple asset account or pool and the total dispositions of assets with the same recovery period during the taxable year are readily determined from the taxpayer's records, but it is impracticable from the taxpayer's records to determine the particular taxable year in which the asset disposed of was placed in service by the taxpayer, the taxpayer must identify the asset disposed of by using—
(i) A first-in, first-out method of accounting if the unadjusted depreciable basis of the asset disposed of cannot be readily determined from the taxpayer's records. Under this method of accounting, the taxpayer identifies the multiple asset account or pool with the earliest placed-in-service year that has the same recovery period as the asset disposed of and that has assets at the beginning of the taxable year of the disposition, and the taxpayer treats the asset disposed of as being from that multiple asset account or pool;
(ii) A modified first-in, first-out method of accounting if the unadjusted depreciable basis of the asset disposed of can be readily determined from the taxpayer's records. Under this method of accounting, the taxpayer identifies the multiple asset account or pool with the earliest placed-in-service year that has the same recovery period as the asset disposed of and that has assets at the beginning of the taxable year of the disposition with the same unadjusted depreciable basis as the asset disposed of, and the taxpayer treats the asset disposed of as being from that multiple asset account or pool;
(iii) A mortality dispersion table if the asset disposed of is a mass asset. The mortality dispersion table must be based upon an acceptable sampling of
the taxpayer's actual disposition experience for mass assets or other acceptable statistical or engineering techniques. To use a mortality dispersion table, the taxpayer must adopt recordkeeping practices consistent with the taxpayer's prior practices and consonant with good accounting and engineering practices; or
(iv) Any other method as the Secretary may designate by publication in the
Federal Register
or in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter) on or after September 19, 2013. See paragraph (g)(4) of this section regarding the last-in, first-out method of accounting.
(3)
Disposition of a portion of an asset.
If a taxpayer disposes of a portion of an asset and paragraph (d)(1) of this section applies to that disposition, but it is impracticable from the taxpayer's records to determine the particular taxable year in which the asset was placed in service, the taxpayer must identify the asset by using any applicable method provided in paragraph (g)(2) of this section, after taking into account paragraph (g)(4) of this section.
(4)
Last-in, first-out method of accounting.
For purposes of this paragraph (g), a last-in, first-out method of accounting may not be used. Examples of a last-in, first-out method of accounting include the taxpayer identifying the multiple asset account or pool with the most recent placed-in-service year that has the same recovery period as the asset disposed of and that has assets at the beginning of the taxable year of the disposition, and the taxpayer treating the asset disposed of as being from that multiple asset account or pool, or the taxpayer treating the disposed portion of an asset as being from an asset with the most recent placed-in-service year that is the same as the asset of which the disposed portion is a part.
(h)
Accounting for asset disposed of
—(1)
Depreciation ends.
Depreciation ends for an asset at the time of the asset's disposition, as determined under the applicable convention for the asset. See § 1.167(a)-10(b). If the asset disposed of is in a single asset account initially or as a result of § 1.168(i)-8(h)(2)(i), § 1.168(i)-8(h)(3)(i), or general asset account treatment for the asset terminated under § 1.168(i)-1(c)(1)(ii)(A), (e)(3)(iii), (e)(3)(v), (e)(3)(vii), (g), or (h)(1), as applicable, the single asset account terminates at the time of the asset's disposition, as determined under the applicable convention for the asset. If a taxpayer disposes of a portion of an asset and paragraph (d)(1) of this section applies to that disposition, depreciation ends for that disposed portion of the asset at the time of the disposition of the disposed portion, as determined under the applicable convention for the asset.
(2)
Asset disposed of in a multiple asset account or pool.
If the taxpayer accounts for the asset disposed of in a multiple asset account or pool, then—
(i) As of the first day of the taxable year in which the disposition occurs, the asset disposed of is removed from the multiple asset account or pool and is placed into a single asset account. See § 1.168(i)-7(b);
(ii) The unadjusted depreciable basis of the multiple asset account or pool must be reduced by the unadjusted depreciable basis of the asset disposed of as of the first day of the taxable year in which the disposition occurs. See paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section for determining the unadjusted depreciable basis of the asset disposed of;
(iii) The depreciation reserve of the multiple asset account or pool must be reduced by the greater of the depreciation allowed or allowable for the asset disposed of as of the end of the taxable year immediately preceding the year of disposition. The allowable depreciation is computed by using the depreciation method, recovery period, and convention applicable to the multiple asset account or pool in which the asset disposed of was included and by including the additional first year depreciation deduction claimed for the asset disposed of; and
(iv) In determining the adjusted depreciable basis of the asset disposed of at the time of disposition, taking into account the applicable convention, the depreciation allowable for the asset disposed of is computed by using the depreciation method, recovery period, and convention applicable to the multiple asset account or pool in which the asset disposed of was included and by
including the additional first year depreciation deduction claimed for the asset disposed of.
(3)
Disposition of a portion of an asset.
This paragraph (h)(3) applies only when a taxpayer disposes of a portion of an asset and paragraph (d)(1) of this section applies to that disposition. In this case—
(i) As of the first day of the taxable year in which the disposition occurs, the disposed portion is placed into a single asset account. See § 1.168(i)-7(b);
(ii) The unadjusted depreciable basis of the asset must be reduced by the unadjusted depreciable basis of the disposed portion as of the first day of the taxable year in which the disposition occurs. See paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section for determining the unadjusted depreciable basis of the disposed portion;
(iii) The depreciation reserve of the asset must be reduced by the greater of the depreciation allowed or allowable for the disposed portion as of the end of the taxable year immediately preceding the year of disposition. The allowable depreciation is computed by using the depreciation method, recovery period, and convention applicable to the asset in which the disposed portion was included and by including the portion of the additional first year depreciation deduction claimed for the asset that is attributable to the disposed portion; and
(iv) In determining the adjusted depreciable basis of the disposed portion at the time of disposition, taking into account the applicable convention, the depreciation allowable for the disposed portion is computed by using the depreciation method, recovery period, and convention applicable to the asset in which the disposed portion was included and by including the portion of the additional first year depreciation deduction claimed for the asset that is attributable to the disposed portion.
(i)
Examples.
The application of this section is illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
A owns an office building with four elevators. A replaces one of the elevators. The elevator is a structural component of the office building. In accordance with paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(A) of this section, the office building, including its structural components, is the asset for disposition purposes. A does not make the partial disposition election provided under paragraph (d)(2) of this section for the elevator. Thus, the retirement of the replaced elevator is not a disposition. As a result, depreciation continues for the cost of the building, including the cost of the retired elevator and the building's other structural components, and A does not recognize a loss for this retired elevator. If A must capitalize the amount paid for the replacement elevator pursuant to § 1.263(a)-3, the replacement elevator is a separate asset for disposition purposes pursuant to paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(D) of this section and for depreciation purposes pursuant to section 168(i)(6).

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except A accounts for each structural component of the office building as a separate asset in its fixed asset system. Although A treats each structural component as a separate asset in its records, the office building, including its structural components, is the asset for disposition purposes in accordance with paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(A) of this section. Accordingly, the result is the same as in
Example 1.

# Example 3.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except A makes the partial disposition election provided under paragraph (d)(2) of this section for the elevator. Although the office building, including its structural components, is the asset for disposition purposes, the result of A making the partial disposition election for the elevator is that the retirement of the replaced elevator is a disposition. Thus, depreciation for the retired elevator ceases at the time of its retirement, taking into account the applicable convention, and A recognizes a loss upon this retirement. Further, A must capitalize the amount paid for the replacement elevator pursuant to § 1.263(a)-3(k)(1)(i), and the replacement elevator is a separate asset for disposition purposes pursuant to paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(D) of this section and for depreciation purposes pursuant to section 168(i)(6).

# Example 4.
B, a calendar-year commercial airline company, owns several aircraft that are used in the commercial carrying of passengers and described in asset class 45.0 of Rev. Proc. 87-56. B replaces the existing engines on one of the aircraft with new engines. Assume each aircraft is a unit of property as determined under § 1.263(a)-3(e)(3) and each engine of an aircraft is a major component or substantial structural part of the aircraft as determined under § 1.263(a)-3(k)(6). Assume also that B treats each aircraft as the asset for disposition purposes in accordance with paragraph (c)(4) of this section. B makes the partial disposition election provided under paragraph (d)(2) of this section for the engines in the aircraft. Although the aircraft is the asset for disposition purposes, the result of B making the
partial disposition election for the engines is that the retirement of the replaced engines is a disposition. Thus, depreciation for the retired engines ceases at the time of their retirement, taking into account the applicable convention, and B recognizes a loss upon this retirement. Further, B must capitalize the amount paid for the replacement engines pursuant to § 1.263(a)-3(k)(1)(i), and the replacement engines are a separate asset for disposition purposes pursuant to paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(D) of this section and for depreciation purposes pursuant to section 168(i)(6).

# Example 5.
The facts are the same as in
Example 4,
except B does not make the partial disposition election provided under paragraph (d)(2) of this section for the engines. Thus, the retirement of the replaced engines on one of the aircraft is not a disposition. As a result, depreciation continues for the cost of the aircraft, including the cost of the retired engines, and B does not recognize a loss for these retired engines. If B must capitalize the amount paid for the replacement engines pursuant to § 1.263(a)-3, the replacement engines are a separate asset for disposition purposes pursuant to paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(D) of this section and for depreciation purposes pursuant to section 168(i)(6).

# Example 6.
C, a corporation, owns several trucks that are used in its trade or business and described in asset class 00.241 of Rev. Proc. 87-56. C replaces the engine on one of the trucks with a new engine. Assume each truck is a unit of property as determined under § 1.263(a)-3(e)(3) and each engine is a major component or substantial structural part of the truck as determined under § 1.263(a)-3(k)(6). Because the trucks are described in asset class 00.241 of Rev. Proc. 87-56, C must treat each truck as the asset for disposition purposes. C does not make the partial disposition election provided under paragraph (d)(2) of this section for the engine. Thus, the retirement of the replaced engine on the truck is not a disposition. As a result, depreciation continues for the cost of the truck, including the cost of the retired engine, and C does not recognize a loss for this retired engine. If C must capitalize the amount paid for the replacement engine pursuant to § 1.263(a)-3, the replacement engine is a separate asset for disposition purposes pursuant to paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(D) of this section and for depreciation purposes pursuant to section 168(i)(6).

# Example 7.
D owns a retail building. D replaces 60% of the roof of this building. In accordance with paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(A) of this section, the retail building, including its structural components, is the asset for disposition purposes. Assume D must capitalize the costs incurred for replacing 60% of the roof pursuant to § 1.263(a)-3(k)(1)(vi). D makes the partial disposition election provided under paragraph (d)(2) of this section for the 60% of the replaced roof. Thus, the retirement of 60% of the roof is a disposition. As a result, depreciation for 60% of the roof ceases at the time of its retirement, taking into account the applicable convention, and D recognizes a loss upon this retirement. Further, D must capitalize the amount paid for the 60% of the roof pursuant to § 1.263(a)-3(k)(1)(i) and (vi) and the replacement 60% of the roof is a separate asset for disposition purposes pursuant to paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(D) of this section and for depreciation purposes pursuant to section 168(i)(6).

# Example 8.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 7.
Ten years after replacing 60% of the roof, D replaces 55% of the roof of the building. In accordance with paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(A) and (D) of this section, for disposition purposes, the retail building, including its structural components, except the replacement 60% of the roof, is an asset and the replacement 60% of the roof is a separate asset. Assume D must capitalize the costs incurred for replacing 55% of the roof pursuant to § 1.263(a)-3(k)(1)(vi). D makes the partial disposition election provided under paragraph (d)(2) of this section for the 55% of the replaced roof. Thus, the retirement of 55% of the roof is a disposition.
(ii) However, D cannot determine from its records whether the replaced 55% is part of the 60% of the roof replaced ten years ago or whether the replaced 55% includes part or all of the remaining 40% of the original roof. Pursuant to paragraph (g)(3) of this section, D identifies which asset it disposed of by using the first-in, first-out method of accounting. As a result, D disposed of the remaining 40% of the original roof and 25% of the 60% of the roof replaced ten years ago.
(iii) Thus, depreciation for the remaining 40% of the original roof ceases at the time of its retirement, taking into account the applicable convention, and D recognizes a loss upon this retirement. Further, depreciation for 25% of the 60% of the roof replaced ten years ago ceases at the time of its retirement, taking into account the applicable convention, and D recognizes a loss upon this retirement. Also, D must capitalize the amount paid for the 55% of the roof pursuant to § 1.263(a)-3(k)(1)(i) and (vi), and the replacement 55% of the roof is a separate asset for disposition purposes pursuant to paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(D) of this section and for depreciation purposes pursuant to section 168(i)(6).

# Example 9.
(i) On July 1, 2011, E, a calendar-year taxpayer, purchased and placed in service an existing multi-story office building that costs $20,000,000. The cost of each structural component of the building was not separately stated. E accounts for the building and its structural components in its tax and financial accounting records as a single asset with a cost of $20,000,000. E depreciates the building as nonresidential real property and
uses the optional depreciation table that corresponds with the general depreciation system, the straight-line method, a 39-year recovery period, and the mid-month convention. As of January 1, 2014, the depreciation reserve for the building is $1,261,000.
(ii) On June 30, 2014, E replaces one of the two elevators in the office building. E did not dispose of any other structural components of this building in 2014 and prior years. E makes the partial disposition election provided under paragraph (d)(2) of this section for this elevator. Although the office building, including its structural components, is the asset for disposition purposes, the result of E making the partial disposition election for the elevator is that the retirement of the replaced elevator is a disposition. Assume the replacement elevator is a restoration under § 1.263(a)-3(k), and not a betterment under § 1.263(a)-3(j) or an adaptation to a new or different use under § 1.263(a)-3(l). Because E cannot identify the cost of the elevator from its records and the replacement elevator is a restoration under § 1.263(a)-3(k), E determines the cost of the disposed elevator by discounting the cost of the replacement elevator to its placed-in-service year cost using the Producer Price Index for Final Demand. Using this reasonable method, E determines the cost of the retired elevator by discounting the cost of the replacement elevator to its cost in 2011 (the placed-in-service year) using the Producer Price Index for Final Demand, resulting in $150,000 of the $20,000,000 purchase price for the building to be the cost of the retired elevator. Using the optional depreciation table that corresponds with the general depreciation system, the straight-line method, a 39-year recovery period, and the mid-month convention, the depreciation allowed or allowable for the retired elevator as of December 31, 2013, is $9,458.
(iii) For E's 2014 Federal tax return, the loss for the retired elevator is determined as follows. The depreciation allowed or allowable for 2014 for the retired elevator is $1,763 ((unadjusted depreciable basis of $150,000 × depreciation rate of 2.564% for 2014) × 5.5/12 months). Thus, the adjusted depreciable basis of the retired elevator is $138,779 (the adjusted depreciable basis of $140,542 removed from the building cost less the depreciation allowed or allowable of $1,763 for 2014). As a result, E recognizes a loss of $138,779 for the retired elevator in 2014.
(iv) For E's 2014 Federal tax return, the depreciation allowance for the building is computed as follows. As of January 1, 2014, the unadjusted depreciable basis of the building is reduced from $20,000,000 to $19,850,000 ($20,000,000 less the unadjusted depreciable basis of $150,000 for the retired elevator), and the depreciation reserve of the building is reduced from $1,261,000 to $1,251,542 ($1,261,000 less the depreciation allowed or allowable of $9,458 for the retired elevator as of December 31, 2013). Consequently, the depreciation allowance for the building for 2014 is $508,954 ($19,850,000 × depreciation rate of 2.564% for 2014).
(v) E also must capitalize the amount paid for the replacement elevator pursuant to § 1.263(a)-3(k)(1). The replacement elevator is a separate asset for disposition purposes pursuant to paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(D) of this section and for depreciation purposes pursuant to section 168(i)(6).

# Example 10.
(i) Since 2005, F, a calendar year taxpayer, has accounted for items of MACRS property that are mass assets in pools. Each pool includes only the mass assets that have the same depreciation method, recovery period, and convention, and are placed in service by F in the same taxable year. None of the pools are general asset accounts under section 168(i)(4) and the regulations under section 168(i)(4). F identifies any dispositions of these mass assets by specific identification.
(ii) During 2014, F sells 10 items of mass assets with a 5-year recovery period each for $100. Under the specific identification method, F identifies these mass assets as being from the pool established by F in 2012 for mass assets with a 5-year recovery period. Assume F depreciates this pool using the optional depreciation table that corresponds with the general depreciation system, the 200-percent declining balance method, a 5-year recovery period, and the half-year convention. F elected not to deduct the additional first year depreciation provided by section 168(k) for 5-year property placed in service during 2012. As of January 1, 2014, this pool contains 100 similar items of mass assets with a total cost of $25,000 and a total depreciation reserve of $13,000. Because all the items of mass assets in the pool are similar, F allocates the cost and depreciation allowed or allowable for the pool ratably among each item in the pool. This allocation is a reasonable method because all the items of mass assets in the pool are similar. Using this reasonable method, F allocates a cost of $250 ($25,000 × (1/100)) to each disposed of mass asset and depreciation allowed or allowable of $130 ($13,000 × (1/100)) to each disposed of mass asset. The depreciation allowed or allowable in 2014 for each disposed of mass asset is $24 (($250 × 19.2%)/2). As a result, the adjusted depreciable basis of each disposed of mass asset under section 1011 is $96 ($250 − $130 − $24). Thus, F recognizes a gain of $4 for each disposed of mass asset in 2014, which is subject to section 1245.
(iii) Further, as of January 1, 2014, the unadjusted depreciable basis of the 2012 pool of mass assets with a 5-year recovery period is reduced from $25,000 to $22,500 ($25,000 less the unadjusted depreciable basis of $2,500 for the 10 disposed of items), and the depreciation reserve of this 2012 pool is reduced from
$13,000 to $11,700 ($13,000 less the depreciation allowed or allowable of $1,300 for the 10 disposed of items as of December 31, 2013). Consequently, as of January 1, 2014, the 2012 pool of mass assets with a 5-year recovery period has 90 items with a total cost of $22,500 and a depreciation reserve of $11,700. Thus, the depreciation allowance for this pool for 2014 is $4,320 ($22,500 × 19.2%).

# Example 11.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 10.
Because of changes in F's recordkeeping in 2015, it is impracticable for F to continue to identify disposed of mass assets using specific identification and to determine the unadjusted depreciable basis of the disposed of mass assets. As a result, F files a Form 3115, Application for Change in Accounting Method, to change to a first-in, first-out method beginning with the taxable year beginning on January 1, 2015, on a modified cut-off basis. See § 1.446-1(e)(2)(ii)(
d
)(
2
)(
vii
). Under the first-in, first-out method, the mass assets disposed of in a taxable year are deemed to be from the pool with the earliest placed-in-service year that has assets as of the beginning of the taxable year of the disposition with the same recovery period as the asset disposed of. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue consents to this change in method of accounting.
(ii) During 2015, F sells 20 items of mass assets with a 5-year recovery period each for $50. As of January 1, 2015, the 2008 pool is the pool with the earliest placed-in-service year for mass assets with a 5-year recovery period, and this pool contains 25 items of mass assets with a total cost of $10,000 and a total depreciation reserve of $10,000. Thus, F allocates a cost of $400 ($10,000 × (1/25)) to each disposed of mass asset and depreciation allowed or allowable of $400 to each disposed of mass asset. As a result, the adjusted depreciable basis of each disposed of mass asset is $0. Thus, F recognizes a gain of $50 for each disposed of mass asset in 2015, which is subject to section 1245.
(iii) Further, as of January 1, 2015, the unadjusted depreciable basis of the 2008 pool of mass assets with a 5-year recovery period is reduced from $10,000 to $2,000 ($10,000 less the unadjusted depreciable basis of $8,000 for the 20 disposed of items ($400 × 20)), and the depreciation reserve of this 2008 pool is reduced from $10,000 to $2,000 ($10,000 less the depreciation allowed or allowable of $8,000 for the 20 disposed of items as of December 31, 2014). Consequently, as of January 1, 2015, the 2008 pool of mass assets with a 5-year recovery period has 5 items with a total cost of $2,000 and a depreciation reserve of $2,000.

§ 1.168(j)-1T
Questions and answers concerning tax-exempt entity leasing rules (temporary).
The following questions and answers concern tax-exempt entity leasing under section 168(j) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as enacted by section 31 of the Tax Reform Act of 1984 (“TRA”) (Pub. L. 98-369):

# Consequences of Tax-Exempt Use Status
Q-1. If recovery property is subject to the tax-exempt entity leasing provisions of section 168(j), how must the taxpayer compute the property's recovery deductions?
A-1. The taxpayer must compute the property's recovery deductions in accordance with section 168(j) (1) and (2); that is, the taxpayer must use the straight line method and the specified recovery period. For property other than 18-year real property, the applicable recovery percentages for the specified recovery period are to be determined with reference to the tables contained in Prop. Treas. Reg. § 1.168-2(g)(3)(iv)(A). For 18-year real property for which a 40-year recovery period is required, the applicable recovery percentages are to be determined under the following table:

Q-2. If recovery property that was placed in service after December 31, 1980 by a taxable entity subsequently becomes tax-exempt use property, how are such property's cost recovery deductions under section 168 affected?
A-2. A change to tax-exempt use property, as defined in section 168(j)(3), will cause the cost recovery deductions under the accelerated cost recovery system (ACRS) to be recomputed. The allowable recovery deduction for the taxable year in which the change occurs (and for subsequent taxable years) must be determined as if the property had originally been tax-exempt use property. Proper adjustment must be made under the principles of Prop. Treas. Reg. § 1.168-2(j)(3)(i)(B) to account for the difference between the deductions allowable with respect to the property prior to the year of change and those which would have been allowable had the taxpayer used the recovery period and method for tax-exempt use property under section 168(j) (1) and (2). However, no adjustment is made pursuant to the provisions of this A-2 if section 168(j)(2)(C) applies, that is, if the taxpayer had selected a longer recovery period in the year the property was placed in service than the recovery period prescribed for such property under section 168(j)(1).

# Example 1.
On July 1, 1983, X, a calendar year taxpayer, places in service 5-year recovery property with an unadjusted basis of $100. For 1983, X's allowable deduction is $15 (
i.e.,
.15 × $100). In 1984, the property becomes tax-exempt use property. Under section 168(j), assume the prescribed recovery period is 12 years. For 1984 (and subsequent taxable years), X's allowable deduction is determined as if the property had been tax-exempt use property since 1983, that is, the year it was placed in service. Thus, taxable year 1984 is the property's second recovery year of its 12-year recovery period. Additionally, X must account for the excess allowable recovery deduction of $11 (
i.e.,
the difference between the recovery allowance for 1983 ($15) and the allowance for that year had the property been tax-exempt use property ($4)) in accordance with the principles of Prop. Treas. Reg. § 1.168-2(j)(3)(i)(B). Thus, the recovery allowances in 1984 and 1985 are $7.97, determined as follows:
Unadjusted basis multiplied by the applicable recovery percentage for second recovery year ($100 × .09
$9.00
Excess allowable recovery deduction multiplied by the applicable recovery percentage for second recovery year divided by the sum of the remaining unused applicable percentages for tax-exempt use property existing as of the taxable year of change (1984) (($11 × .09)/.96)
−1.03
Difference—allowable deduction for 1984
$7.97
Unadjusted basis multiplied by the applicable recovery percentage for third recovery year ($100 × .09)
$9.00
Excess allowable recovery deduction multiplied by the applicable recovery percentage for third recovery year divided by the sum of the remaining unused applicable percentages for tax-exempt use property existing as of the taxable year of change (1984) (($11 × .09)/.96)
−1.03
Difference—allowable deduction for 1985
$7.97
Additionally, X must make a similar adjustment for the taxable years 1986 through 1995, that is, his fourth through thirteenth recovery years.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in
Example (1)
except that in 1983, X elected under section 168 (b) (3) with respect to the 5-year property to use the optional recovery percentages over a 25-year recovery period. Based on these facts, the provisions of this A-2 do not apply.

# Definition of Tax-Exempt Use Property

# Mixed Leases of Real and Personal Property
Q-3. How is a mixed lease of real property and personal property (e.g., a building with furniture) to be treated for purposes of applying the rules of section 168(j)(3) defining which property constitutes tax-exempt use property?
A-3. The general rule is that 18-year real property and property other than 18-year real property are tested separately to determine whether each constitutes tax-exempt use property. However, if a lease of section 1245 class property is incidental to a lease of 18-year real property, and the 18-year real property is not tax-exempt use property, then the section 1245 class property also does not constitute tax-exempt use property. A lease of section 1245 class property will be considered incidental if the adjusted basis of all section 1245 class property leased in the same transaction is 1 percent or less of the adjusted basis of all 18-year real property leased in such transaction.

# Buildings Which Are Partially Tax-Exempt Use Property
Q-4. If part of a building is leased to a tax-exempt entity in a disqualified lease and part of the building is leased other than to a tax-exempt entity in a disqualified lease, to what extent do the tax-exempt entity leasing rules apply to such building?
A-4. The taxpaper must determine the amount of the building's unadjusted basis that is properly allocable to the portion of the building that is tax-exempt use property; the section 168(j) rules apply to the allocated amount. Solely for purposes of determining what percentage of the building's basis is subject to the tax-exempt entity leasing rules, no part of the basis is allocated to common areas.

# Example.
A constructs a 3-story building in 1984 at a cost of $900,000. Each floor consists of 30,000 square feet. The only common area (10,000 square feet) in the building is on the first floor. A leases the first floor (other than the common areas) to a firm that is not a tax-exempt entity. A leases the top two floors to a tax-exempt entity in a 25-year lease. The top two floors constitute tax-exempt use property. Assume that square footage is the appropriate method for allocating basis in this case. Thus, A must allocate $675,000 of the $900,000 basis to the tax-exempt use portion, determined as follows:
EC05OC91.040
A must compute his recovery deductions on this portion of the basis ($675,000) in accordance with the rules of section 168(j) (1) and (2).

# Requirement of a Lease
Q-5. Can the use of property by a party other than a tax-exempt entity result in the property being treated as tax-exempt use property within the meaning of section 168(j)(3)?
A-5. Yes, if based on all the facts and circumstances it is more appropriate to characterize the transaction as a lease to a tax-exempt entity. A transaction can be characterized as a lease to a tax-exempt entity under section 168(j)(6)(A), which provides that “the term ‘lease’ includes any grant of a right to use property”; or under the service contract rules of section 7701(e). See Q
A #18 for rules regarding service contracts.

# Example.
A trust is executed on January 1, 1984, to create a pooled income fund (P) that meets the requirements of section 642(c)(5). A university (U) that is tax-exempt under section 501(c)(3) is the remainderman of the pooled income fund. P's purpose is to construct and operate an athletic center on land adjacent to U's campus. Construction of the athletic center, which has a 50-year useful life, was completed and the center was placed in service on February 1, 1985. The athletic center is managed for a fee by M, an unrelated taxable organization which operates athletic facilities open to the public. Office space at the facility is occupied rent-free by both the U athletic department and M. Scheduling of activities at the center is handled jointly by members of U's athletic department and M. General operating expenses of the athletic center are paid by P. Although the athletic center is open to the public for a membership fee, the majority of members are U's students who pay membership fees as part of their tuition. These fees are remitted by U to P. This arrangement is in substance a grant to U of a right to use the facility, and therefore a lease to U under section 168(j)(6)(A). U, as remainderman, will have obtained title to the entire building when the last pooled income fund donor dies. This arrangement is a disqualified lease because either (1) U has the equivalent of a fixed price purchase option under section 168(j)(3)(B)(ii)(II) (if U receives title as remainderman before the end of the useful life of the building), or (2) the lease has a term in excess of 20 years under section 168(j)(3)(B)(ii)(III) (if U does not receive title as remainderman until 20 years have elapsed), or both. Therefore, the allowable recovery deductions (without regard to salvage value) must be computed in accordance
with section 168(j) (1) and (2). In addition, because this arrangement is treated as a lease under section 168(j), the facility is used by U for purposes of section 48(a)(4), and thus no investment tax credit is permitted with respect to any portion of the facility. This arrangement also may be treated as a lease to U for all purposes of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code under section ­7701 (e).

# “More Than 35 Percent of the Property” Test
Q-6. How is the percentage of 18-year real property leased to a tax-exempt entity in a disqualified lease to be determined for purposes of the “more than 35 percent of the property” test of section 168(j)(3)(B)(iii)?
A-6. The phrase “more than 35 percent of the property” means more than 35 percent of the net rentable floor space of the property. The net rentable floor space in a building does not include the common areas of the building, regardless of the terms of the lease. For purposes of the “more than 35 percent of the property” rule, two or more buildings will be treated as separate properties unless they are part of the same project, in which case they will be treated as one property. Two or more buildings will be treated as part of the same project if the buildings are constructed, under a common plan, within a reasonable time of each other on the same site and will be used in an integrated manner.
Q-7. Are disqualified leases to different tax-exempt entities (regardless of whether they are related) aggregated in determining whether 18-year real property is tax-exempt use property?
A-7. Yes.

# Example.
A tax-exempt entity participates in industrial development bond financing for the acquisition of a new building by a taxable entity. The tax-exempt entity leases 60 percent of the net rentable floor space in the building for 5 years. Sixty percent of the building is tax-exempt use property. If the same tax-exempt entity leased only 19 percent of the net rentable floor space in the building for 5 years, no portion of the building would be tax-exempt use property because not more than 35 percent of the property is leased to a tax-exempt entity pursuant to a disqualified lease. If such tax-exempt entity leased only 19 percent of the net rentable floor space in the building for 5 years and another tax-exempt entity leased 20 percent of the net rentable floor space in the building for a term in excess of 20 years (or a related entity leased 20 percent of the building for 5 years), 39 percent of the building would be tax-exempt use property. See A-4 regarding the determination of the amount of the building's unadjusted basis that is properly allocable to the portion of the building that is tax-exempt use property.

# “Predominantly Used” Test
Q-8. What does the term “predominantly used” mean for purposes of the section 168(j)(3)(D) exception to the tax-exempt use property rules?
A-8. “Predominantly used” means that for more than 50 percent of the time used, as determined for each taxable year, the real or personal property is used in an unrelated trade or business the income of which is subject to tax under section 511 (determined without regard to the debt-financed income rules of section 514). If only a portion of property is predominantly used in an unrelated trade or business, the remainder may nevertheless be tax-exempt use property.
Q-9. How is the “predominantly used” test of section 168(j)(3)(D) to be applied to a building?
A-9. The “predominantly used” test is to be applied to a building in the following manner:
(i) Identify the discrete portions (excluding common areas) of the building which are leased to a tax-exempt entity in a disqualified lease under section 168(j)(3)(B)(ii). A discrete portion of a building is an area physically separated from other areas. An area is physically separated from other areas if separated by permanent walls or by partitions serving as room dividers if such partitions remain in place throughout the taxable year. A discrete portion can be the entire building, floors, wings, offices, rooms, or a combination thereof. For example, a building whose entire internal space consists of a single large room used as a gymnasium has only one discrete portion. On the other hand, if the building has 3 stories with 10 offices on each floor, each of the 30 offices is a discrete portion.
(ii) Determine whether each discrete portion is predominantly used in an unrelated trade or business subject to tax under section 511. See A-8 for the rules regarding how to make this determination.
(iii) Once the discrete portions of the building that constitute tax-exempt use property have been identified, an appropriate allocation of basis must be made to such discrete portions. See A-4 for rules regarding how to make such allocation.
(iv) The application of these rules is illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
A building, constructed in 1985, is leased in its entirety to a tax-exempt entity (E) pursuant to a 25-year lease. The building has 25,000 square feet of net rentable floor space and consists of an auditorium (15,000 square feet), a retail shop (10,000 square feet), plus common area of 5,000 square feet. E uses the auditorium 80 percent of the time in its exempt activity and 20 percent of the time in an unrelated trade or business subject to tax under section 511. The retail shop is used 90 percent of the time in an unrelated trade or business subject to tax under section 511 and 10 percent of the time in an exempt activity. Thus, the auditorium is tax-exempt use property; the retail shop is not. An appropriate allocation of basis to the auditorium must be made. See A-4.

# Definition of Tax-Exempt Entity
Q-10. What elections must be made in order to avoid the “5-year lookback” rule of section 168(j)(4)(E)(i)?
A-10. Only organizations which were exempt from tax under section 501(a) as organizations described in section 501(c)(12) (and which are no longer tax-exempt) may avoid the 5-year lookback rule of section 168(j)(4)(E)(i). In order to avoid the 5-year lookback rule with respect to any property, two elections are required. First, the organization must elect not to be exempt from tax under section 501(a) during the tax-exempt use period (as defined in section 168(j)(4)(E)(ii)(II)) with respect to the property. Second, the organization must elect to be taxed on the exempt arbitrage profits as provided in section 31(g)(16) of the Tax Reform Act of 1984. See Temp. Treas. Reg. § 301.9100-6T(a) for the time and manner of making these elections. These elections, once made, are irrevocable.
Q-11. Does the term “tax-exempt entity” include tax-exempt plans of deferred compensation and similar arrangements?
A-11. Yes. For purposes of section 168 (j), the term “tax-exempt entity” includes trusts or other entities that are tax-qualified under section 401 (a), individual retirement accounts, simplified employee pensions, and other tax-exempt arrangements described in subchapter D of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code.

# Special Rules for High Technology Equipment
Q-12. What effect do the tax-exempt entity leasing provisions have on “qualified technological equipment”?
A-12. “Qualified technological equipment” which is leased to a tax-exempt entity for a term of 5 years or less shall not constitute tax-exempt use property. If “qualified technological equipment” which is leased to a tax-exempt entity for a term of more than 5 years constitutes tax-exempt use property (as defined in section 168(j)(3)) and is not used predominantly outside the United States, the rules of section 168(j) (1) and (2) apply except that the recovery period to be used for such equipment shall be 5 years regardless of the length of the lease term. For purposes of section 168(j)(5), “qualified technological equipment” means (1) any computer or peripheral equipment, (2) any high technology telephone station equipment installed on the customer's premises, and (3) any high technology medical equipment. For definitions of these terms, see A-13 through A-16.
Q-13. What is a “computer” as that term is used in section 168(j)(5)(C)(i)(I)?
A-13. Computers are electronically activated devices that are programmable by the user and that are capable of accepting information, applying prescribed processes to it, and supplying the results of those processes with or without human intervention. Computers consist of a central processing unit containing extensive storage, logic, arithmetic, and control capabilities. A computer does not include any equipment which is an integral part of property that is not a user-programmable device, any video games or other devices used by the user primarily for amusement or entertainment purposes, or any typewriters, calculators, adding or accounting machines, copiers, duplicating equipment, or similar equipment. A computer does not include any equipment that is not tangible personal property.
Q-14. What is “peripheral equipment” as that term is used in section 168(j)(5)(C)(i)(I)?
A-14. Peripheral equipment means tangible personal property such as auxiliary machines, whether on-line or off-line, that are designed to be placed under the control of the central processing unit of the computer. Some examples of peripheral equipment are: card readers, card punches, magnetic tape feeds, high speed printers, optical character readers, tape cassettes, mass storage units, paper tape equipment, keypunches, data entry devices, teleprinters, terminals, tape drives, disc drives, disc files, disc packs, visual image projector tubes, card sorters, plotters, and collators. Peripheral equipment does not include equipment not included in Asset Depreciation Range (ADR) 00.12 listed in section 3 of Rev. Proc. 83-35, 1983-1 C.B. 745, 746. Peripheral equipment also does not include any equipment that is an integral part of property that is not a user-programmable device, any video games or other devices used by the user primarily for amusement or entertainment purposes, or any typewriters, calculators, adding or accounting machines, copiers, duplicating equipment, or similar equipment.
Q-15. What does “high technology telephone station equipment” mean as that term is used in section 168(j)(5)(C)(i)(II)?
A-15. High technology telephone station equipment includes only tangible personal property described in asset depreciation range (ADR) class 48.13 listed in section 3 of Rev. Proc. 83-35, 1983-1 C.B. 745, 758 that has a high technology content and which, because of such high technology content, can reasonably be expected to become obsolete before the expiration of its physical useful life. For example, telephone booths and telephones which include only a standard dialing feature are not high technology equipment. However, telephones with features such as an abbreviated dialing short program, an automatic callback, or conference call feature may qualify as high technology equipment. High technology telephone station equipment may include terminal equipment including such extra features but not terminal equipment used in conjunction with features offered through central office capacity. There are no current plans to utilize the regulatory authority provided in section 168(j)(5)(C)(iv).
Q-16. What is “high technology medical equipment” as that term is used in section 168 (j)(5)(C)(i)(III)?
A-16. High technology medical equipment is any electronic, electromechanical, or computer-based high technology equipment which is tangible personal property used in the screening, monitoring, observation, diagnosis, or treatment of human patients in a laboratory, medical, or hospital environment. High technology medical equipment includes only equipment that has a high technology content and which, because of such high technology content, can reasonably be expected to become obsolete before the expiration of its physical useful life. High technology medical equipment may include computer axial tomography (C.A.T.) scanners, nuclear magnetic resonance equipment, clinical chemistry analyzers, drug monitors, diagnostic ultrasound scanners, nuclear cameras, radiographic and fluoroscopic systems, Holter monitors, and bedside monitors. Incidental use of any such equipment for othe purposes, such as research, will not prevent it from qualifying as high technology medical equipment. There are no current plans to utilize the regulatory authority provided in section 168(j)(5)(C)(iv).

# Lease Term
Q-17. What is included in determining the length of a lease term?
A-17. (i) The lease term starts when the property is first made available to the lessee under the lease. The lease term includes not only the stated duration, but also any additional period of time which is within the “realistic contemplation of the parties at the time the property is first put into service.
Hokanson
v.
Commissioner,
730 F.2d 1245, 1248 (9th Cir. 1984). A subsequent period of time is included in the term of the original lease if the circumstances indicate that the parties, upon entering into the original lease, had informally agreed that there would be an extension of the original lease.
(ii) With respect to personal property, the lease term includes all periods for which the tax-exempt lessee or a related party (as defined under section 168(j)(7)) has a legally enforceable option to renew the lease, or the lessor has a legally enforceable option to compel its renewal by the tax-exempt entity or a related party. This is true regardless of the renewal terms of the lease agreement or whether the lease is in fact renewed.
(iii) With respect to real property, the lease term includes all periods for which the tax-exempt lessee or a related party (as defined under section 168(j)(7)) has a legally enforceable option to renew the lease, or the lessor has a legally enforceable option to compel its renewal by the tax-exempt entity or a related party, unless the option to renew is at fair market value, determined at the time of renewal. The
Hokanson
facts and circumstances test (see (i) above) may cause the term of a fair market value renewal option to be treated as part of the original lease term.
(iv) Successive leases that are part of the same transaction or a series of related transactions concerning the same or substantially similar property shall be treated as one lease. This rule applies if at substantially the same time or as part of one arrangement the parties enter into multiple leases covering the same or substantially similar property, each having a different term. If so, then the original lease term will be treated as running through the term of the lease that has the last expiration date of the multiple leases. The multiple lease rule will not apply merely because the parties enter into a new lease at fair market rental value at the end of the original lease term.
(v) The application of the above rules is illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
On December 30, 1984, X, a taxable corporation, and Y, a tax-exempt entity, enter into a requirements contract for a period of 3 years. The requirements contract sets the terms and conditions under which X and Y will do business on those occasions when X actually leases items of personal property to Y. The requirements contract imposes no obligation on either party to actually enter into a lease agreement. Pursuant to this requirements contract, on January 1, 1985, X and Y enter into three separate leases. Under the leases, Y obtained the use of three identical items of personal property, each for a term of six months beginning on January 1, 1985. On March 1, 1985, Y entered into a fourth lease for the use of a fourth item of personal property substantially similar to the other three items for a term of 20 months beginning on that date. The mere fact that all 4 leases were entered into pursuant to the same requirements contract and involved the same or substantially similar property does not require aggregation of the terms of such leases under section 168(j)(6)(B).

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in
example
(1) except that, instead of the 4 leases entered into in example (1), on January 1, 1985, pursuant to the requirements contract, X and Y enter into a lease for an item of personal property for one year. On January 10, 1986, after the end of the one-year lease term, X and Y enter into a second lease with respect to the same or substantially similar equipment. Assuming that the requirements contract itself is not a lease and assuming that the parties did not have any informal or implicit understanding (other than the general expectation of doing some business in the future) to enter into the second lease when the first lease was entered into, these two leases are not aggregated. The mere fact that the parties entered into two leases under the requirements contract does not result in the application of the section 168(j)(6)(B) rules for successive leases.

# Example 3.
The facts are the same as in
example
(2) except that the parties did have an understanding, informal or otherwise, at the time of the first lease that they would enter into a second lease of the same personal property. The terms of the leases are aggregated.

# Example 4.
The facts are the same as in
example
(2) except that, instead of the leases entered into in example (2), on January 1, 1985, X and Y enter into two separate leases, each for a term of one year. One lease is for the period beginning on January 1, 1985 and ending on December 31, 1985. The other lease is for the period beginning on January 1, 1986 and ending on December 31, 1986. Both leases involve the same or substantially similar personal property. Under the successive lease rule, the terms of both leases are aggregated for purposes of determining the term of either lease under section 168(j)(6)(B). This result occurs because the two leases were entered into as part of the same transaction, and they relate to the same or substantially similar personal property.

# Service Contract Issues
Q-18. How is the treatment of service contracts affected by the service contract rules set forth in section 7701(e)?
A-18. If a contract which purports to be a service contract is treated as a lease under section 7701(e), such contract is to be treated as a lease for all purposes of Chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code (including, for example, section 168(j) and section 48(a) (4) and (5)).
Q-19. Does a contract to provide heating, maintenance, etc. services in low-income housing come within the low-income housing exception in section 7701(e)(5) to the service contract rules set forth in section 7701(e)?
A-19. No. Although certain low-income housing operated by or for an organization described in paragraphs (3) or (4) of section 501(c) is not subject to the service contract rules in section 7701(e), a contract, for instance, to provide heating services to low-income housing units, such as by installing and operating a furnace, does not constitute “low-income housing” within the meaning of section 7701(e)(5). Thus, the rules of section 7701(e) apply to such contracts in determining whether they are properly treated as leases.

# Partnership Issues
Q-20. Do the provisions applicable to property leased to partnerships, set forth in section 168(j)(8), and the provisions applicable to property owned by partnerships, set forth in section 168(j)(9), apply to pass-through entities other than partnerships?
A-20. Yes. Rules similar to those provided in paragraphs (8), (9)(A), (9)(B), and (9)(C) of section 168(j) and those provided in Q
A's 21-26 apply to pass-through entities other than partnerships.
Q-21. What rules apply to property owned by a partnership in which one or more partners is a tax-exempt entity?
A-21. If property is owned by a partnership having both taxable and tax-exempt entities as partners, and any allocation to a tax-exempt entity partner is not a “qualified allocation” under section 168(j)(9)(B), then such entity's proportionate share of the property is to be treated as tax-exempt use property for all purposes. However, the property will not be tax-exempt use property if it is predominantly used by the partnership in an activity which, with respect to the tax-exempt entity, is an unrelated trade or business. An activity is an unrelated trade or business with respect to a tax-exempt entity if such entity's distributive share of the partnership's gross income from the activity is includible in computing its unrelated business taxable income under section 512(c) (determined without regard to the debt-financed income rules of section 514). A tax-exempt entity partner's proportionate share of property of a partnership equals such partner's share of that item of the partnership's income or gain (excluding income or gain allocated under section 704(c)) in which the tax-exempt entity has the highest share. If the tax-exempt entity partner's share of any item of income or gain (excluding income or gain allocated under section 704(c)) may vary during the period it is a partner, the previous sentence shall be applied with reference to the highest share of any such item that it may receive at any time during such period. The application of these rules is illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
A partnership (P) operates a factory, which consists of a building and various items of machinery. P has one tax-exempt entity (E) as a partner, and E's proportionate share is 10 percent (
i.e.,
10 percent is the largest share of any item of income or gain that E may receive during the time E is a partner). Unless P's allocations to E are qualified under section 168(j)(9)(B), 10 percent of each item of partnership property (including the building) is tax-exempt use property, notwithstanding the 35 percent threshold test of section 168(j)(3)(B)(iii) that is otherwise applicable to 18-year real property. However, the property will not be tax-exempt use property if it is predominantly used by the partnership in an activity which, with respect to E, is an unrelated trade or business (determined without regard to the debt-financed income rules of section 514).
Q-22. What consititutes a “qualified allocation” under section 168(j)(9)(B)?
A-22. (i) A “qualified allocation” means any allocation to a tax-exempt entity which is consistent with such entity's being allocated the same share (
i.e.,
the identical percentage) of each and every item of partnership income, gain, loss, deduction, credit, and basis during the entire period such entity is a partner. Except as provided in A-23, an allocation is not qualified if it does not have substantial economic effect
under section 704(b). However, for purposes of the two preceding sentences, items allocated under section 704(c) (relating to contributed property) are not taken into account. An allocation is not a “qualified allocation” under section 168(j)(9)(B) if the partnership agreement provides for, or the partners have otherwise formally or informally agreed to, any change (regardless of whether such change is contingent upon the happening of one or more events) in the tax-exempt entity's distributive share of income, gain, loss, deduction, credit, or basis at any time during the entire period the tax-exempt entity is a partner.
(ii) A change in a tax-exempt entity's distributive share of income, gain, loss, deduction, credit, or basis which occurs as a result of a sale or redemption of a partnership interest (or portion thereof) or a contribution of cash or property to the partnership shall be disregarded in determining whether the partnership allocations are qualified, provided that such transaction is based on fair market value at the time of the transaction and that the allocations are qualified after the change. For this purpose, the consideration determined by the parties dealing at arm's length and with adverse interests normally will be deemed to satisfy the fair market value requirement. In addition, a change in a tax-exempt entity's distributive share which occurs as a result of a partner's default (other than a prearranged default) under the terms of the partnership agreement will be disregarded, provided that the allocations are qualified after the change, and that the change does not have the effect of avoiding the restrictions of section 168(j)(9). Any of the above-described transactions between existing partners (and parties related to them) will be closely scrutinized.

# Example 1.
A, a taxable entity, and B, a tax-exempt entity, form a partnership in 1985. A contributes $800,000 to the partnership; B contributes $200,000. The partnership agreement allocates 95 percent of each item of income, gain, loss, deduction, credit, and basis to A; B's share of each of these items is 5 percent. Liquidation proceeds are, throughout the term of the partnership, to be distributed in accordance with the partner's capital account balances, and any partner with a deficit in his capital account following the distribution of liquidation proceeds is required to restore the amount of such deficit to the partnership. Assuming that these allocations have substantial economic effect within the meaning of section 704(b)(2), they are qualified because B's distributive share of each item of income, gain, loss, deduction, credit, and basis will remain the same during the entire period that B is a partner. The fact that the liquidation proceeds may be distributed in a ratio other than 95 percent/5 percent does not cause the allocations not to be qualified.

# Example 2.
A, B, and E are members of a partnership formed on July 1, 1984. On that date the partnership places in service a building and section 1245 class property. A and B are taxable entities; E is a tax-exempt entity. The partnership agreement provides that during the first 5 years of the partnership, A and B are each allocated 40 percent of each item of income, gain, loss, deduction, credit, and basis; E is allocated 20 percent. Thereafter, A, B, and E are each allocated 33
1/3
percent of each item of income, gain, loss, deduction, credit, and basis. Assume that these allocations meet the substantial economic effect test of section 704(b)(2) and E's distributive share of the partnership's income is not unrelated trade or business income subject to tax under section 511. The allocations to E are not qualified allocations under section 168(j)(9)(B) because E's distributive share of partnership items does not remain the same during the entire period that E is a partner in the partnership. Thus, 33
1/3
percent of the building and 33
1/3
percent of the section 1245 class property are tax-exempt use property from the time each is placed in service by the partnership and are thus subject to the cost recovery rules of section 168(j) (1) and (2). In addition, no investment tax credit is allowed for 33
1/3
percent of the section 1245 class property because of section 48(a)(4).
Q-23. In determining whether allocations constitute qualified allocations, what rules are applied to test allocations that are not governed by the substantial economic effect rules?
A-23. A-22 provides the general rules to be used in determining whether an allocation is a qualified allocation, including the rule that the allocation must have substantial economic effect. However, certain allocations are not governed by the substantial economic effect rules (e.g., an allocation of basis of an oil and gas property is generally governed by section 613A(c)(7)(D), rather than section 704(b)), and other allocations cannot satisfy the substantial economic effect rules (e.g., allocations of credits, allocations of deduction and
loss attributable to nonrecourse debt, and allocations of percentage depletion in excess of basis). Since allocations in either of these categories cannot be tested under the substantial economic effect test, these allocations, in order to be qualified, must comply with the relevant Code or regulation section that governs the particular allocation (e.g., in the case of an allocation of basis of an oil and gas property, section 613A(c)(7)(D)).
Q-24. Will the Internal Revenue Service issue letter rulings on the issue of whether an allocation is a “qualified allocation” for purposes of section 168(j)(9)?
A-24. The Internal Revenue Service will accept requests for rulings on the question of whether an allocation is a “qualified allocation” for purposes of section 168(j)(9). Such requests should be submitted in accordance with the appropriate revenue procedure. One requirement of a qualified allocation is that such allocation must have substantial economic effect under section 704(b)(2). Currently, the Service will not rule on the question of whether an allocation has substantial economic effect under section 704(b)(2). Therefore, unless and until this policy is changed, a ruling request regarding a qualified allocation must contain a representation that the subject allocation has substantial economic effect (or complies with A-23, if applicable).
Q-25. Do priority cash distributions which constitute guaranteed payments under section 707(c) disqualify an otherwise qualified allocation?
A-25. Priority cash distributions to partners which constitute guaranteed payments will not disqualify an otherwise qualified allocation if the priority cash distributions are reasonable in amount (e.g., equal to the Federal short-term rate described in section 1274(d)) and are made in equal priorities to all partners in proportion to their capital in the partnership. Other guaranteed payments will be closely scrutinized and, in appropriate cases, will disqualify an otherwise qualified allocation.

# Example.
A and B form Partnership AB to operate a manufacturing business. A is a tax-exempt entity; B is a taxable person. A contributes $500,000 to the partnership; B contributes $100,000. The partnership agreement provides that A and B are each entitled to cash distributions each year, in equal priority, in an amount equal to 8 percent of their capital contribution. Assume that these payments are reasonable in amount and constitute guaranteed payments under section 707(c). Without taking into consideration the guaranteed payments, all allocations constitute qualified allocations under section 168(j)(9)(B) and A-22. These guaranteed payments will not disqualify such allocations.
Q-26. Can property be treated as tax-exempt use property under both the general rule of section 168(j)(3) and the partnership provisions of section 168(j)(9)?
A-26. Yes. For example, a tax-exempt entity may be a partner in a partnership that owns a building 60 percent of which is tax-exempt use property because it is leased to an unrelated tax-exempt entity under a 25-year lease. The status of the remaining 40 percent depends on whether or not allocations under the partnership agreement are qualified under section 168(j)(9). If the allocations are not qualified under section 168(j)(9), the tax-exempt entity's proportionate share (as determined under section 168(j)(9)(C)) of the remaining 40 percent will be tax-exempt use property. For example, if the tax-exempt entity's proportionate share is 30 percent, then 12 percent of the remaining 40 percent (
i.e.,
.30 times .40) is tax-exempt use property and a total of 72 percent of the property (60 percent + 12 percent) is tax-exempt use property.

# Effective Date Questions
Q-27. Does an amendment to a lease (or sublease) to a tax-exempt entity of property which, pursuant to the effective date provisions of section 31(g) of TRA, is not subject to section 168(j) cause such property to be subject to the provisions of section 168(j)?
A-27. An amendment to such a lease (or sublease) does not cause such property to be subject to the provisions of section 168(j) unless the amendment increases the term of the lease (or sublease). However, if the amendment increases the amount of property subject to the lease, the additional property must be tested independently under the effective date provisions of section
31(g) of TRA. See A-31 for special rules regarding improvements to property.

# Example.
On May 1, 1983, X, a taxable entity, and E, a tax-exempt entity, enter into a lease whereby X will lease to E the top 4 floors of a ten-story building for a lease term of 25 years. In 1985, the lease is amended to provide that E will lease an additional floor for the balance of the lease term. At that time the annual rent due under the lease is increased. Pursuant to the provisions of section 31(g)(2)(A) of TRA, section 168(j) does not apply to the lease to E of the top 4 floors of the building. Assuming that no other provision of section 31(g) of TRA provides otherwise, the floor added to the lease in 1985 is subject to the provisions of section 168(j).
Q-28. If property which is not subject to section 168(j) by virtue of the effective date provisions of section 31(g) of TRA is sold, subject to the lease to the tax-exempt entity, what are the consequences?
A-28. Property to which section 168(j) does not apply by virtue of the effective date provisions set forth in section 31(g) (2), (3), and (4) of TRA will not become subject to section 168(j) merely by reason of a transfer of the property subject to the lease by the lessor (or a transfer of the contract to acquire, construct, reconstruct, or rehabilitate the property), so long as the lessee (or party obligated to lease) does not change. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term “transfer” includes the sale-leaseback by a taxable lessor of its interest in the property, subject to the underlying lease to the tax-exempt entity. However, if property is transferred to a partnership or other pass-through entity after the effective date of section 168(j)(9) (see section 31(g) of TRA), such property is subject to the provisions of section 168(j)(9).
Q-29. Can property which was leased to a tax-exempt entity after May 23, 1983 and acquired by a partnership before October 22, 1983 be tax-exempt use property?
A-29. Yes. Because the property was leased to a tax-exempt entity after May 23, 1983, it may be tax-exempt use property under section 168(j)(3) and section 31(g)(1) of TRA. However, if the partnership included a tax-exempt entity as a partner, section 168(j)(9) would be inapplicable under section 31(g)(3)(B) of TRA because the partnership acquired the property before October 22, 1983.
Q-30. What is a binding contract for purposes of the transitional rules in section 31(g) of TRA?
A-30. (i) A contract is binding only if it is enforceable under State law against the taxpayer or a predecessor and does not limit damages to a specified amount, as for example, by a liquidated damages provision. A contract that limits damages to an amount equal to at least 5 percent of the total contract price will not be treated as limiting damages for this purpose. In determining whether a contract limits damages, the fact that there may be little or no damages because the contract price does not significantly differ from fair market value will not be taken into account. For example, if a taxpayer entered into an irrevocable contract to purchase an asset for $100 and the contract contained no provision for liquidated damages, the contract is considered binding notwithstanding the fact that the property had a fair market value of $99 and under local law the seller would only recover the difference in the event the purchaser failed to perform. If the contract provided for a refund of the purchase price in lieu of any damages allowable by law in the event of breach or cancellation, the contract is not considered binding.
(ii) A contract is binding even if subject to a condition, so long as the condition is not within the control of either party or a predecessor in interest. A contract will not be treated as ceasing to be binding merely because the parties make insubstantial changes in its terms or because any term is to be determined by a standard beyond the control of either party. A contract which imposes significant obligations on the taxpayer (or a predecessor) will be treated as binding notwithstanding the fact that insubstantial terms remain to be negotiated by the parties to the contract.
(iii) A binding contract to acquire a component part of a larger piece of property will not be treated as a binding contract to acquire the larger piece of property. For example, if a tax-exempt entity entered into a binding contract on May 1, 1983 to acquire a new
aircraft engine, there would be a binding contract to acquire only the engine, not the entire aircraft.
Q-31. If an improvement is made to a property that is “grandfathered” (
i.e.,
property that is not subject to section 168(j) because of the effective date provisions of section 31(g) of TRA), to what extent will such improvement be grandfathered?
A-31. Section 31(g)(20)(B) provides that a “substantial improvement” to property is treated as a separate property for purposes of the effective date provisions of section 31(g) of TRA. As a result, a “substantial improvement” will not be grandfathered unless such “substantial improvement” is grandfathered under a provision other than section 31(g)(20)(B). A property that is grandfathered will not become subject to section 168(j) merely because an improvement is made to such property, regardless of whether the improvement is a “substantial improvement”. If an improvement other than a “substantial improvement” is made to property (other than land) that is grandfathered, that improvement also will be grandfathered. The determination of whether new construction constitutes an improvement to property or the creation of a new separate property will be based on all facts and circumstances. Furthermore, any improvement to land will be treated as a separate property.

# Example.
On January 3, 1983, T, a taxable entity, entered into a lease of a parking lot to E, a tax-exempt entity. On January 1, 1985, T begins construction of a building for use by E on the site of the parking lot. The building is completed and placed in service in November 1985. The building is treated as a separate property, and is thus subject to the provisions of section 168(j), unless the building is grandfathered under a provision other than section 31(g)(20)(B) of TRA.
Q-32. What is “significant official governmental action” for purposes of the section 31(g)(4) transitional rule of TRA?
A-32. (i) “Significant official governmental action” involves three separate requirements. First, the action must be an official action. Second, the action must be specific action with respect to a particular project. Third, the action must be taken by a governmental entity having authority to commit the tax-exempt entity to the project, to provide funds for it, or to approve the project under State or local law.
(ii) The first requirement of official action means that the governing body must adopt a resolution or ordinance, or take similar official action, on or before November 1, 1983. The action qualifies only if it conforms with Federal, State, and local law (as applicable) and is a proper exercise of the powers of the governing body. Moreover, the action must not have been withdrawn. There must be satisfactory written evidence of the action that was in existence on or before November 1, 1983. Satisfactory written evidence includes a formal resolution or ordinance, minutes of meetings, and binding contracts with third parties pursuant to which third parties are to render services in furtherance of the project.
(iii) The second requirement of specific action is directed at the substance of the action taken. The action must be a specific action with respect to a particular project in which the governing body indicates an intent to have the project (or the design work for it) proceed. This requires that a specific project have been formulated and that the significant official action be a step toward consummation of the project. If the action does not relate to a specific project or merely directs that a proposal or recommendation be formulated, it will not qualify. The following set of actions with respect to a particular project constitute specific action: the hiring of bond counsel or bond underwriters necessary to assist in the issuance and sale of bonds to finance a particular project or the adoption of an inducement resolution relating to bonds to be issued for such a project; applying for an Urban Development Action Grant on behalf of the project described in the application, receiving such a grant concerning the project, or the recommendation of a city planning authority to proceed with a project; the enactment of a State law authorizing the sale, lease, or construction of the property; the appropriation of funds for the property or authorization of a feasibility study or a development services contract with respect to it; the approval of financing arrangements by a regulatory agency; the enactment of
a State law designed to provide funding for a project; the certification of a building as a historic structure by a State agency and the Department of the Interior; or the endorsement of the application for a certification of need with respect to a medical facility by a regulatory agency other than the agency empowered to issue such a certificate.
(iv) The third requirement for significant official governmental action is that the action must be taken by a Federal, State, or local governing body having authority to commit the tax-exempt entity to the project, to provide funds for it, or to approve the project under applicable law.
If the chief executive or another representative of a governing body has such authority, action by such representative would satisfy the requirement of this (iv). A governing body may have the authority to commit the tax-exempt entity to a project notwithstanding the fact that the project cannot be consummated without other governmental action being taken. For example, a city council will be treated as having authority to commit a city to do a sale-leaseback of its city hall notwithstanding the fact that State law needs to be amended to permit such a transaction. Similarly, if a local project cannot be completed without Federal approval, either legislative or administrative, the obtaining of such approval satisfies the requirements of this (iv).
(v) Routine governmental action at a local level will not qualify as significant official governmental action. Routine governmental action includes the granting of building permits or zoning changes and the issuance of environmental impact statements.
(vi) In order to qualify under the transitional rule of TRA section 31(g)(4), a sale and leaseback pursuant to a binding contract entered into before January 1, 1985 must be part of the project as to which there was significant official governmental action. Except as provided in the following sentence, where there has been significant official governmental action on or before November 1, 1983 with respect to the construction, reconstruction or rehabilitation of a property, the sale and leaseback of such property pursuant to a binding contract entered into before January 1, 1985 will be treated as part of the project which was the subject of the significant official governmental action. However, if the construction, reconstruction or rehabilitation was substantially completed prior to January 1, 1983, the sale and leaseback of such property will be treated as a separate project, unless the sale and leaseback was contemplated at the time of the significant official governmental action. Nevertheless, where the sale and leaseback is treated as a separate project, section 31(g)(4) may apply if there was significant official governmental action on or before November 1, 1983, with respect to such sale and leaseback. The application of this provision is illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
In the summer of 1927, the Board of Aldermen of City C passed a resolution authorizing the design and contruction of a new city hall and appropriated the funds necessary for such project. Construction was completed in 1928. At the time of the significant official governmental action, City C had no plan to enter into a sale-leaseback arrangement with respect to the facility. On December 15, 1984, City C entered into a binding sale-leaseback arrangement concerning the city hall. This transaction will not qualify for exclusion from section 168(j) under the section 31(g)(4) of TRA since construction of the facility in question was substantially completed before January 1, 1983. If, however, there had been significant official governmental action on or before November 1, 1983 with respect to the sale-leaseback project, then the transitional rule of section 31(g)(4) of TRA would apply.

§ 1.168(k)-1
Additional first year depreciation deduction.
(a)
Scope and definitions
—(1)
Scope.
This section provides the rules for determining the 30-percent additional first year depreciation deduction allowable under section 168(k)(1) for qualified property and the 50-percent additional first year depreciation deduction allowable under section 168(k)(4) for 50-percent bonus depreciation property.
(2)
Definitions.
For purposes of section 168(k) and this section, the following definitions apply:
(i)
Depreciable property
is property that is of a character subject to the allowance for depreciation as determined under section 167 and the regulations thereunder.
(ii)
MACRS property
is tangible, depreciable property that is placed in service after December 31, 1986 (or after July 31, 1986, if the taxpayer made an election under section 203(a)(1)(B) of the Tax Reform Act of 1986; 100 Stat. 2143) and subject to section 168, except for property excluded from the application of section 168 as a result of section 168(f) or as a result of a transitional rule.
(iii)
Unadjusted depreciable basis
is the basis of property for purposes of section 1011 without regard to any adjustments described in section 1016(a)(2) and (3). This basis reflects the reduction in basis for the percentage of the taxpayer's use of property for the taxable year other than in the taxpayer's trade or business (or for the production of income), for any portion of the basis the taxpayer properly elects to treat as an expense under section 179 or section 179C, and for any adjustments to basis provided by other provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations thereunder (other than section 1016(a)(2) and (3)) (for example, a reduction in basis by the amount of the disabled access credit pursuant to section 44(d)(7)). For property subject to a lease, see section 167(c)(2).
(iv)
Adjusted depreciable basis
is the unadjusted depreciable basis of the property, as defined in § 1.168(k)-1(a)(2)(iii), less the adjustments described in section 1016(a)(2) and (3).
(b)
Qualified property or 50-percent bonus depreciation property
—(1)
In general.
Qualified property or 50-percent bonus depreciation property is depreciable property that meets all the following requirements in the first taxable year in which the property is subject to depreciation by the taxpayer whether or not depreciation deductions for the property are allowable:
(i) The requirements in § 1.168(k)-1(b)(2) (description of property);
(ii) The requirements in § 1.168(k)-1(b)(3) (original use);
(iii) The requirements in § 1.168(k)-1(b)(4) (acquisition of property); and
(iv) The requirements in § 1.168(k)-1(b)(5) (placed-in-service date).
(2)
Description of qualified property or 50-percent bonus depreciation property
—(i)
In general.
Depreciable property will meet the requirements of this paragraph (b)(2) if the property is—
(A) MACRS property (as defined in § 1.168(k)-1(a)(2)(ii)) that has a recovery period of 20 years or less. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) and section 168(k)(2)(B)(i)(II) and 168(k)(4)(C), the recovery period is determined in accordance with section 168(c) regardless of any election made by the taxpayer under section 168(g)(7);
(B) Computer software as defined in, and depreciated under, section 167(f)(1) and the regulations thereunder;
(C) Water utility property as defined in section 168(e)(5) and depreciated under section 168; or
(D) Qualified leasehold improvement property as defined in paragraph (c) of this section and depreciated under section 168.
(ii)
Property not eligible for additional first year depreciation deduction
—(A)
Property that is not qualified property.
For purposes of the 30-percent additional first year depreciation deduction, depreciable property will not meet the requirements of this paragraph (b)(2) if the property is—
(
1
) Described in section 168(f);
(
2
) Required to be depreciated under the alternative depreciation system of section 168(g) pursuant to section 168(g)(1)(A) through (D) or other provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (for example, property described in section 263A(e)(2)(A) if the taxpayer (or any related person as defined in section 263A(e)(2)(B)) has made an election
under section 263A(d)(3), or property described in section 280F(b)(1)).
(
3
) Included in any class of property for which the taxpayer elects not to deduct the 30-percent additional first year depreciation (for further guidance, see paragraph (e) of this section); or
(
4
) Qualified New York Liberty Zone leasehold improvement property as defined in section 1400L(c)(2).
(B)
Property that is not 50-percent bonus depreciation property.
For purposes of the 50-percent additional first year depreciation deduction, depreciable property will not meet the requirements of this paragraph (b)(2) if the property is—
(
1
) Described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A)(
1
), (
2
), or (
4
) of this section; or
(
2
) Included in any class of property for which the taxpayer elects the 30-percent, instead of the 50-percent, additional first year depreciation deduction or elects not to deduct any additional first year depreciation (for further guidance, see paragraph (e) of this section).
(3)
Original use
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of the 30-percent additional first year depreciation deduction, depreciable property will meet the requirements of this paragraph (b)(3) if the original use of the property commences with the taxpayer after September 10, 2001. For purposes of the 50-percent additional first year depreciation deduction, depreciable property will meet the requirements of this paragraph (b)(3) if the original use of the property commences with the taxpayer after May 5, 2003. Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(3)(iii) and (iv) of this section, original use means the first use to which the property is put, whether or not that use corresponds to the use of the property by the taxpayer. Thus, additional capital expenditures incurred by a taxpayer to recondition or rebuild property acquired or owned by the taxpayer satisfies the original use requirement. However, the cost of reconditioned or rebuilt property does not satisfy the original use requirement. The question of whether property is reconditioned or rebuilt property is a question of fact. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(3)(i), property that contains used parts will not be treated as reconditioned or rebuilt if the cost of the used parts is not more than 20 percent of the total cost of the property, whether acquired or self-constructed.
(ii)
Conversion to business or income-producing use
—(A)
Personal use to business or income-producing use.
If a taxpayer initially acquires new property for personal use and subsequently uses the property in the taxpayer's trade or business or for the taxpayer's production of income, the taxpayer is considered the original user of the property. If a person initially acquires new property for personal use and a taxpayer subsequently acquires the property from the person for use in the taxpayer's trade or business or for the taxpayer's production of income, the taxpayer is not considered the original user of the property.
(B)
Inventory to business or income-producing use.
If a taxpayer initially acquires new property and holds the property primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of the taxpayer's business and subsequently withdraws the property from inventory and uses the property primarily in the taxpayer's trade or business or primarily for the taxpayer's production of income, the taxpayer is considered the original user of the property. If a person initially acquires new property and holds the property primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of the person's business and a taxpayer subsequently acquires the property from the person for use primarily in the taxpayer's trade or business or primarily for the taxpayer's production of income, the taxpayer is considered the original user of the property. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(B), the original use of the property by the taxpayer commences on the date on which the taxpayer uses the property primarily in the taxpayer's trade or business or primarily for the taxpayer's production of income.
(iii)
Sale-leaseback, syndication, and certain other transactions
—(A)
Sale-leaseback transaction.
If new property is originally placed in service by a person after September 10, 2001 (for qualified property), or after May 5, 2003 (for 50-percent bonus depreciation property),
and is sold to a taxpayer and leased back to the person by the taxpayer within three months after the date the property was originally placed in service by the person, the taxpayer-lessor is considered the original user of the property.
(B)
Syndication transaction and certain other transactions.
If new property is originally placed in service by a lessor (including by operation of paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(A) of this section) after September 10, 2001 (for qualified property), or after May 5, 2003 (for 50-percent bonus depreciation property), and is sold by the lessor or any subsequent purchaser within three months after the date the property was originally placed in service by the lessor (or, in the case of multiple units of property subject to the same lease, within three months after the date the final unit is placed in service, so long as the period between the time the first unit is placed in service and the time the last unit is placed in service does not exceed 12 months), and the user of the property after the last sale during the three-month period remains the same as when the property was originally placed in service by the lessor, the purchaser of the property in the last sale during the three-month period is considered the original user of the property.
(C)
Sale-leaseback transaction followed by a syndication transaction and certain other transactions.
If a sale-leaseback transaction that satisfies the requirements in paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this section is followed by a transaction that satisfies the requirements in paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B) of this section, the original user of the property is determined in accordance with paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B) of this section.
(iv)
Fractional interests in property.
If, in the ordinary course of its business, a taxpayer sells fractional interests in property to third parties unrelated to the taxpayer, each first fractional owner of the property is considered as the original user of its proportionate share of the property. Furthermore, if the taxpayer uses the property before all of the fractional interests of the property are sold but the property continues to be held primarily for sale by the taxpayer, the original use of any fractional interest sold to a third party unrelated to the taxpayer subsequent to the taxpayer's use of the property begins with the first purchaser of that fractional interest. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(3)(iv), persons are not related if they do not have a relationship described in section 267(b) or 707(b) and the regulations thereunder.
(v)
Examples.
The application of this paragraph (b)(3) is illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
On August 1, 2002,
A
buys from
B
for $20,000 a machine that has been previously used by
B
in
B
's trade or business. On March 1, 2003,
A
makes a $5,000 capital expenditure to recondition the machine. The $20,000 purchase price does not qualify for the additional first year depreciation deduction because the original use requirement of this paragraph (b)(3) is not met. However, the $5,000 expenditure satisfies the original use requirement of this paragraph (b)(3) and, assuming all other requirements are met, qualifies for the 30-percent additional first year depreciation deduction, regardless of whether the $5,000 is added to the basis of the machine or is capitalized as a separate asset.

# Example 2.
C, an automobile dealer, uses some of its automobiles as demonstrators in order to show them to prospective customers. The automobiles that are used as demonstrators by
C
are held by
C
primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of its business. On September 1, 2002,
D
buys from
C
an automobile that was previously used as a demonstrator by
C. D
will use the automobile solely for business purposes. The use of the automobile by
C
as a demonstrator does not constitute a “use” for purposes of the original use requirement and, therefore,
D
will be considered the original user of the automobile for purposes of this paragraph (b)(3). Assuming all other requirements are met,
D
's purchase price of the automobile qualifies for the 30-percent additional first year depreciation deduction for
D,
subject to any limitation under section 280F.

# Example 3.
On April 1, 2000,
E
acquires a horse to be used in
E
's thoroughbred racing business. On October 1, 2003,
F
buys the horse from
E
and will use the horse in
F
's horse breeding business. The use of the horse by
E
in its racing business prevents the original use of the horse from commencing with
F.
Thus,
F
's purchase price of the horse does not qualify for the additional first year depreciation deduction.

# Example 4.
In the ordinary course of its business,
G
sells fractional interests in its aircraft to unrelated parties.
G
holds out for sale eight equal fractional interests in an aircraft. On January 1, 2003,
G
sells five of the eight fractional interests in the aircraft
to
H,
an unrelated party, and
H
begins to use its proportionate share of the aircraft immediately upon purchase. On June 1, 2003, G sells to I, an unrelated party to G, the remaining unsold
3/8
fractional interests in the aircraft.
H
is considered the original user as to its
5/8
fractional interest in the aircraft and
I
is considered the original user as to its
3/8
fractional interest in the aircraft. Thus, assuming all other requirements are met,
H
's purchase price for its
5/8
fractional interest in the aircraft qualifies for the 30-percent additional first year depreciation deduction and I's purchase price for its
3/8
fractional interest in the aircraft qualifies for the 50-percent additional first year depreciation deduction.

# Example 5.
On September 1, 2001, JJ, an equipment dealer, buys new tractors that are held by JJ primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of its business. On October 15, 2001, JJ withdraws the tractors from inventory and begins to use the tractors primarily for producing rental income. The holding of the tractors by JJ as inventory does not constitute a “use” for purposes of the original use requirement and, therefore, the original use of the tractors commences with JJ on October 15, 2001, for purposes of paragraph (b)(3) of this section. However, the tractors are not eligible for the additional first year depreciation deduction because JJ acquired the tractors before September 11, 2001.
(4)
Acquisition of property
—(i)
In general
—(A)
Qualified property.
For purposes of the 30-percent additional first year depreciation deduction, depreciable property will meet the requirements of this paragraph (b)(4) if the property is—
(
1
) Acquired by the taxpayer after September 10, 2001, and before January 1, 2005, but only if no written binding contract for the acquisition of the property was in effect before September 11, 2001; or
(
2
) Acquired by the taxpayer pursuant to a written binding contract that was entered into after September 10, 2001, and before January 1, 2005.
(B)
50-percent bonus depreciation property.
For purposes of the 50-percent additional first year depreciation deduction, depreciable property will meet the requirements of this paragraph (b)(4) if the property is—
(
1
) Acquired by the taxpayer after May 5, 2003, and before January 1, 2005, but only if no written binding contract for the acquisition of the property was in effect before May 6, 2003; or
(
2
) Acquired by the taxpayer pursuant to a written binding contract that was entered into after May 5, 2003, and before January 1, 2005.
(ii)
Definition of binding contract
—(A)
In general.
A contract is binding only if it is enforceable under State law against the taxpayer or a predecessor, and does not limit damages to a specified amount (for example, by use of a liquidated damages provision). For this purpose, a contractual provision that limits damages to an amount equal to at least 5 percent of the total contract price will not be treated as limiting damages to a specified amount. In determining whether a contract limits damages, the fact that there may be little or no damages because the contract price does not significantly differ from fair market value will not be taken into account. For example, if a taxpayer entered into an irrevocable written contract to purchase an asset for $100 and the contract contained no provision for liquidated damages, the contract is considered binding notwithstanding the fact that the asset had a fair market value of $99 and under local law the seller would only recover the difference in the event the purchaser failed to perform. If the contract provided for a full refund of the purchase price in lieu of any damages allowable by law in the event of breach or cancellation, the contract is not considered binding.
(B)
Conditions.
A contract is binding even if subject to a condition, as long as the condition is not within the control of either party or a predecessor. A contract will continue to be binding if the parties make insubstantial changes in its terms and conditions or because any term is to be determined by a standard beyond the control of either party. A contract that imposes significant obligations on the taxpayer or a predecessor will be treated as binding notwithstanding the fact that certain terms remain to be negotiated by the parties to the contract.
(C)
Options.
An option to either acquire or sell property is not a binding contract.
(D)
Supply agreements.
A binding contract does not include a supply or similar agreement if the amount and design specifications of the property to be
purchased have not been specified. The contract will not be a binding contract for the property to be purchased until both the amount and the design specifications are specified. For example, if the provisions of a supply or similar agreement state the design specifications of the property to be purchased, a purchase order under the agreement for a specific number of assets is treated as a binding contract.
(E)
Components.
A binding contract to acquire one or more components of a larger property will not be treated as a binding contract to acquire the larger property. If a binding contract to acquire the component does not satisfy the requirements of this paragraph (b)(4), the component does not qualify for the 30-percent or 50-percent additional first year depreciation deduction, as applicable.
(iii)
Self-constructed property
—(A)
In general.
If a taxpayer manufactures, constructs, or produces property for use by the taxpayer in its trade or business (or for its production of income), the acquisition rules in paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section are treated as met for qualified property if the taxpayer begins manufacturing, constructing, or producing the property after September 10, 2001, and before January 1, 2005, and for 50-percent bonus depreciation property if the taxpayer begins manufacturing, constructing, or producing the property after May 5, 2003, and before January 1, 2005. Property that is manufactured, constructed, or produced for the taxpayer by another person under a written binding contract (as defined in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section) that is entered into prior to the manufacture, construction, or production of the property for use by the taxpayer in its trade or business (or for its production of income) is considered to be manufactured, constructed, or produced by the taxpayer. If a taxpayer enters into a written binding contract (as defined in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section) after September 10, 2001, and before January 1, 2005, with another person to manufacture, construct, or produce property described in section 168(k)(2)(B) (longer production period property) or section 168(k)(2)(C) (certain aircraft) and the manufacture, construction, or production of this property begins after December 31, 2004, the acquisition rule in paragraph (b)(4)(i)(A)(
2
) or (b)(4)(i)(B)(
2
) of this section is met.
(B)
When does manufacture, construction, or production begin
—(
1
)
In general.
For purposes of paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section, manufacture, construction, or production of property begins when physical work of a significant nature begins. Physical work does not include preliminary activities such as planning or designing, securing financing, exploring, or researching. The determination of when physical work of a significant nature begins depends on the facts and circumstances. For example, if a retail motor fuels outlet or other facility is to be constructed on-site, construction begins when physical work of a significant nature commences at the site; that is, when work begins on the excavation for footings, pouring the pads for the outlet, or the driving of foundation pilings into the ground. Preliminary work, such as clearing a site, test drilling to determine soil condition, or excavation to change the contour of the land (as distinguished from excavation for footings) does not constitute the beginning of construction. However, if a retail motor fuels outlet or other facility is to be assembled on-site from modular units manufactured off-site and delivered to the site where the outlet will be used, manufacturing begins when physical work of a significant nature commences at the off-site location.
(
2
)
Safe harbor.
For purposes of paragraph (b)(4)(iii)(B)(
1
) of this section, a taxpayer may choose to determine when physical work of a significant nature begins in accordance with this paragraph (b)(4)(iii)(B)(
2
). Physical work of a significant nature will not be considered to begin before the taxpayer incurs (in the case of an accrual basis taxpayer) or pays (in the case of a cash basis taxpayer) more than 10 percent of the total cost of the property (excluding the cost of any land and preliminary activities such as planning or designing, securing financing, exploring, or researching). When property is manufactured, constructed, or produced for the taxpayer by another person, this safe harbor test must be satisfied by
the taxpayer. For example, if a retail motor fuels outlet or other facility is to be constructed for an accrual basis taxpayer by another person for the total cost of $200,000 (excluding the cost of any land and preliminary activities such as planning or designing, securing financing, exploring, or researching), construction is deemed to begin for purposes of this paragraph (b)(4)(iii)(B)(
2
) when the taxpayer has incurred more than 10 percent (more than $20,000) of the total cost of the property. A taxpayer chooses to apply this paragraph (b)(4)(iii)(B)(
2
) by filing an income tax return for the placed-in-service year of the property that determines when physical work of a significant nature begins consistent with this paragraph (b)(4)(iii)(B)(
2
).
(C)
Components of self-constructed property
—(
1
)
Acquired components.
If a binding contract (as defined in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section) to acquire a component does not satisfy the requirements of paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section, the component does not qualify for the 30-percent or 50-percent additional first year depreciation deduction, as applicable. A binding contract (as defined in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section) to acquire one or more components of a larger self-constructed property will not preclude the larger self-constructed property from satisfying the acquisition rules in paragraph (b)(4)(iii)(A) of this section. Accordingly, the unadjusted depreciable basis of the larger self-constructed property that is eligible for the 30-percent or 50-percent additional first year depreciation deduction, as applicable (assuming all other requirements are met), must not include the unadjusted depreciable basis of any component that does not satisfy the requirements of paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section. If the manufacture, construction, or production of the larger self-constructed property begins before September 11, 2001, for qualified property, or before May 6, 2003, for 50-percent bonus depreciation property, the larger self-constructed property and any acquired components related to the larger self-constructed property do not qualify for the 30-percent or 50-percent additional first year depreciation deduction, as applicable. If a binding contract to acquire the component is entered into after September 10, 2001, for qualified property, or after May 5, 2003, for 50-percent bonus depreciation property, and before January 1, 2005, but the manufacture, construction, or production of the larger self-constructed property does not begin before January 1, 2005, the component qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction (assuming all other requirements are met) but the larger self-constructed property does not.
(
2
)
Self-constructed components.
If the manufacture, construction, or production of a component does not satisfy the requirements of paragraph (b)(4)(iii)(A) of this section, the component does not qualify for the 30-percent or 50-percent additional first year depreciation deduction, as applicable. However, if the manufacture, construction, or production of a component does not satisfy the requirements of paragraph (b)(4)(iii)(A) of this section, but the manufacture, construction, or production of the larger self-constructed property satisfies the requirements of paragraph (b)(4)(iii)(A) of this section, the larger self-constructed property qualifies for the 30-percent or 50-percent additional first year depreciation deduction, as applicable (assuming all other requirements are met) even though the component does not qualify for the 30-percent or 50-percent additional first year depreciation deduction. Accordingly, the unadjusted depreciable basis of the larger self-constructed property that is eligible for the 30-percent or 50-percent additional first year depreciation deduction, as applicable (assuming all other requirements are met), must not include the unadjusted depreciable basis of any component that does not qualify for the 30-percent or 50-percent additional first year depreciation deduction. If the manufacture, construction, or production of the larger self-constructed property began before September 11, 2001, for qualified property, or before May 6, 2003, for 50-percent bonus depreciation property, the larger self-constructed property and any self-constructed components related to the larger self-constructed property do not qualify for the 30-percent or 50-percent additional first
year depreciation deduction, as applicable. If the manufacture, construction, or production of a component begins after September 10, 2001, for qualified property, or after May 5, 2003, for 50-percent bonus depreciation property, and before January 1, 2005, but the manufacture, construction, or production of the larger self-constructed property does not begin before January 1, 2005, the component qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction (assuming all other requirements are met) but the larger self-constructed property does not.
(iv)
Disqualified transactions
—(A)
In general.
Property does not satisfy the requirements of this paragraph (b)(4) if the user of the property as of the date on which the property was originally placed in service (including by operation of paragraphs (b)(5)(ii), (iii), and (iv) of this section), or a related party to the user or to the taxpayer, acquired, or had a written binding contract (as defined in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section) in effect for the acquisition of the property at any time before September 11, 2001 (for qualified property), or before May 6, 2003 (for 50-percent bonus depreciation property). In addition, property manufactured, constructed, or produced for the use by the user of the property or by a related party to the user or to the taxpayer does not satisfy the requirements of this paragraph (b)(4) if the manufacture, construction, or production of the property for the user or the related party began at any time before September 11, 2001 (for qualified property), or before May 6, 2003 (for 50-percent bonus depreciation property).
(B)
Related party defined.
For purposes of this paragraph (b)(4)(iv), persons are related if they have a relationship specified in section 267(b) or 707(b) and the regulations thereunder.
(v)
Examples.
The application of this paragraph (b)(4) is illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
On September 1, 2001,
J,
a corporation, entered into a written agreement with
K,
a manufacturer, to purchase 20 new lamps for $100 each within the next two years. Although the agreement specifies the number of lamps to be purchased, the agreement does not specify the design of the lamps to be purchased. Accordingly, the agreement is not a binding contract pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(D) of this section.

# Example 2.
Same facts as
Example 1.
On December 1, 2001,
J
placed a purchase order with
K
to purchase 20 new model XPC5 lamps for $100 each for a total amount of $2,000. Because the agreement specifies the number of lamps to be purchased and the purchase order specifies the design of the lamps to be purchased, the purchase order placed by
J
with
K
on December 1, 2001, is a binding contract pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(D) of this section. Accordingly, the cost of the 20 lamps qualifies for the 30-percent additional first year depreciation deduction.

# Example 3.
Same facts as
Example 1
except that the written agreement between
J
and
K
is to purchase 100 model XPC5 lamps for $100 each within the next two years. Because this agreement specifies the amount and design of the lamps to be purchased, the agreement is a binding contract pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(D) of this section. Accordingly, because the agreement was entered into before September 11, 2001, any lamp acquired by
J
under this contract does not qualify for the additional first year depreciation deduction.

# Example 4.
On September 1, 2001,
L
began constructing an electric generation power plant for its own use. On November 1, 2002,
L
ceases construction of the power plant prior to its completion. Between September 1, 2001, and November 1, 2002,
L
incurred $3,000,000 for the construction of the power plant. On May 6, 2003,
L
resumed construction of the power plant and completed its construction on August 31, 2003. Between May 6, 2003, and August 31, 2003,
L
incurred another $1,600,000 to complete the construction of the power plant and, on September 1, 2003,
L
placed the power plant in service. None of
L
's total expenditures of $4,600,000 qualify for the additional first year depreciation deduction because, pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(iii)(A) of this section,
L
began constructing the power plant before September 11, 2001.

# Example 5.
Same facts as
Example 4
except that
L
began constructing the electric generation power plant for its own use on October 1, 2001.
L
's total expenditures of $4,600,000 qualify for the additional first year depreciation deduction because, pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(iii)(A) of this section,
L
began constructing the power plant after September 10, 2001, and placed the power plant in service before January 1, 2005. Accordingly, the additional first year depreciation deduction for the power plant will be $1,380,000, computed as $4,600,000 multiplied by 30 percent.

# Example 6.
On August 1, 2001,
M
entered into a written binding contract to acquire a new turbine. The new turbine is a component part of a new electric generation power plant that is being constructed on
M
's behalf. The construction of the new electric generation
power plant commenced in November 2001, and the new electric generation power plant was completed in November 2002. Because
M
entered into a written binding contract to acquire a component part (the new turbine) prior to September 11, 2001, pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(iii)(C) of this section, the component part does not qualify for the additional first year depreciation deduction. However, pursuant to paragraphs (b)(4)(iii)(A) and (C) of this section, the new plant constructed for
M
will qualify for the 30-percent additional first year depreciation deduction because construction of the new plant began after September 10, 2001, and before May 6, 2003. Accordingly, the unadjusted depreciable basis of the new plant that is eligible for the 30-percent additional first year depreciation deduction must not include the unadjusted depreciable basis of the new turbine.

# Example 7.
Same facts as
Example 6
except that
M
entered into the written binding contract to acquire the new turbine on September 30, 2002, and construction of the new plant commenced on August 1, 2001. Because
M
began construction of the new plant prior to September 11, 2001, pursuant to paragraphs (b)(4)(iii)(A) and (C) of this section, neither the new plant constructed for
M
nor the turbine will qualify for the additional first year depreciation deduction because self-construction of the new plant began prior to September 11, 2001.

# Example 8.
On September 1, 2001,
N
began constructing property for its own use. On October 1, 2001,
N
sold its rights to the property to
O,
a related party under section 267(b). Pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(iv) of this section, the property is not eligible for the additional first year depreciation deduction because
N
and
O
are related parties and construction of the property by
N
began prior to September 11, 2001.

# Example 9.
On September 1, 2001,
P
entered into a written binding contract to acquire property. On October 1, 2001,
P
sold its rights to the property to
Q,
a related party under section 267(b). Pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(iv) of this section, the property is not eligible for the additional first year depreciation deduction because
P
and
Q
are related parties and a written binding contract for the acquisition of the property was in effect prior to September 11, 2001.

# Example 10.
Prior to September 11, 2001,
R
began constructing an electric generation power plant for its own use. On May 1, 2003, prior to the completion of the power plant,
R
transferred the rights to own and use this power plant to
S,
an unrelated party, for $6,000,000. Between May 6, 2003, and June 30, 2003,
S
, a calendar-year taxpayer, began construction, and incurred another $1,200,000 to complete the construction, of the power plant and, on August 1, 2003,
S
placed the power plant in service. Because
R
and
S
are not related parties, the transaction between
R
and
S
will not be a disqualified transaction pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(iv) of this section. Accordingly,
S
's total expenditures of $7,200,000 for the power plant qualify for the additional first year depreciation deduction.
S
's additional first year depreciation deduction for the power plant will be $2,400,000, computed as $6,000,000 multiplied by 30 percent, plus $1,200,000 multiplied by 50 percent. The $6,000,000 portion of the total $7,200,000 unadjusted depreciable basis qualifies for the 30-percent additional first year depreciation deduction because that portion of the total unadjusted depreciable basis was acquired by
S
after September 10, 2001, and before May 6, 2003. However, because
S
began construction to complete the power plant after May 5, 2003, the $1,200,000 portion of the total $7,200,000 unadjusted depreciable basis qualifies for the 50-percent additional first year depreciation deduction.

# Example 11.
On September 1, 2001,
T
acquired and placed in service equipment. On October 15, 2001,
T
sells the equipment to
U,
an unrelated party, and leases the property back from
U
in a sale-leaseback transaction. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(iv) of this section, the equipment does not qualify for the additional first year depreciation deduction because
T,
the user of the equipment, acquired the equipment prior to September 11, 2001. In addition, the sale-leaseback rules in paragraphs (b)(3)(iii)(A) and (b)(5)(ii)(A) of this section do not apply because the equipment was originally placed in service by
T
before September 11, 2001.

# Example 12.
On July 1, 2001, KK began constructing property for its own use. KK placed this property in service on September 15, 2001. On October 15, 2001, KK sells the property to LL, an unrelated party, and leases the property back from LL in a sale-leaseback transaction. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(iv) of this section, the property does not qualify for the additional first year depreciation deduction because the property was constructed for KK, the user of the property, and that construction began prior to September 11, 2001.

# Example 13.
On June 1, 2004, MM decided to construct property described in section 168(k)(2)(B) for its own use. However, one of the component parts of the property had to be manufactured by another person for MM. On August 15, 2004, MM entered into a written binding contract with NN to acquire this component part of the property for $100,000. The manufacture of the component part commenced on September 1, 2004, and MM received the completed component part on February 1, 2005. The cost of this component part is 9 percent of the total cost of the property to be constructed by MM. MM began constructing the property described in section 168(k)(2)(B) on January 15, 2005, and placed this property (including all component parts) in service on November 1, 2005.
Pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(iii)(C)(
2
) of this section, the self-constructed component part of $100,000 manufactured by NN for MM is eligible for the additional first year depreciation deduction (assuming all other requirements are met) because the manufacturing of the component part began after September 10, 2001, and before January 1, 2005, and the property described in section 168(k)(2)(B), the larger self-constructed property, was placed in service by MM before January 1, 2006. However, pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(iii)(A) of this section, the cost of the property described in section 168(k)(2)(B) (excluding the cost of the self-constructed component part of $100,000 manufactured by NN for MM) is not eligible for the additional first year depreciation deduction because construction of the property began after December 31, 2004.

# Example 14.
On December 1, 2004, OO entered into a written binding contract (as defined in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section) with PP to manufacture an aircraft described in section 168(k)(2)(C) for use in OO's trade or business. PP begins to manufacture the aircraft on February 1, 2005. OO places the aircraft in service on August 1, 2005. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(iii)(A) of this section, the aircraft meets the requirements of paragraph (b)(4)(i)(B)(
2
) of this section because the aircraft was acquired by OO pursuant to a written binding contract entered into after May 5, 2003, and before January 1, 2005.
(5)
Placed-in-service date
—(i)
In general.
Depreciable property will meet the requirements of this paragraph (b)(5) if the property is placed in service by the taxpayer for use in its trade or business or for production of income before January 1, 2005, or, in the case of property described in section 168(k)(2)(B) or (C), is placed in service by the taxpayer for use in its trade or business or for production of income before January 1, 2006 (or placed in service by the taxpayer for use in its trade or business or for production of income before January 1, 2007, in the case of property described in section 168(k)(2)(B) or (C) to which section 105 of the Gulf Opportunity Zone Act of 2005 (Pub. L. 109-135, 119 Stat. 2577) applies (for further guidance, see Announcement 2006-29 (2006-19 I.R.B. 879) and § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(
b
) of this chapter)).
(ii)
Sale-leaseback, syndication, and certain other transactions
—(A)
Sale-leaseback transaction.
If qualified property is originally placed in service after September 10, 2001, or 50-percent bonus depreciation property is originally placed in service after May 5, 2003, by a person and sold to a taxpayer and leased back to the person by the taxpayer within three months after the date the property was originally placed in service by the person, the property is treated as originally placed in service by the taxpayer-lessor not earlier than the date on which the property is used by the lessee under the leaseback.
(B)
Syndication transaction and certain other transactions.
If qualified property is originally placed in service after September 10, 2001, or 50-percent bonus depreciation property is originally placed in service after May 5, 2003, by a lessor (including by operation of paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(A) of this section) and is sold by the lessor or any subsequent purchaser within three months after the date the property was originally placed in service by the lessor (or, in the case of multiple units of property subject to the same lease, within three months after the date the final unit is placed in service, so long as the period between the time the first unit is placed in service and the time the last unit is placed in service does not exceed 12 months), and the user of the property after the last sale during this three-month period remains the same as when the property was originally placed in service by the lessor, the property is treated as originally placed in service by the purchaser of the property in the last sale during the three-month period but not earlier than the date of the last sale.
(C)
Sale-leaseback transaction followed by a syndication transaction and certain other transactions.
If a sale-leaseback transaction that satisfies the requirements in paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(A) of this section is followed by a transaction that satisfies the requirements in paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(B) of this section, the placed-in-service date of the property is determined in accordance with paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(B) of this section.
(iii)
Technical termination of a partnership.
For purposes of this paragraph (b)(5), in the case of a technical termination of a partnership under section 708(b)(1)(B), qualified property or 50-percent bonus depreciation property placed in service by the terminated partnership during the taxable year of
termination is treated as originally placed in service by the new partnership on the date the qualified property or the 50-percent bonus depreciation property is contributed by the terminated partnership to the new partnership.
(iv)
Section 168(i)(7) transactions.
For purposes of this paragraph (b)(5), if qualified property or 50-percent bonus depreciation property is transferred in a transaction described in section 168(i)(7) in the same taxable year that the qualified property or the 50-percent bonus depreciation property is placed in service by the transferor, the transferred property is treated as originally placed in service on the date the transferor placed in service the qualified property or the 50-percent bonus depreciation property, as applicable. In the case of multiple transfers of qualified property or 50-percent bonus depreciation property in multiple transactions described in section 168(i)(7) in the same taxable year, the placed in service date of the transferred property is deemed to be the date on which the first transferor placed in service the qualified property or the 50-percent bonus depreciation property, as applicable.
(v)
Example.
The application of this paragraph (b)(5) is illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
On September 15, 2004, QQ acquired and placed in service new equipment. This equipment is not described in section 168(k)(2)(B) or (C). On December 1, 2004, QQ sells the equipment to RR and leases the equipment back from RR in a sale-leaseback transaction. On February 15, 2005, RR sells the equipment to TT subject to the lease with QQ. As of February 15, 2005, QQ is still the user of the equipment. The sale-leaseback transaction of December 1, 2004, between QQ and RR satisfies the requirements of paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(A) of this section. The sale transaction of February 15, 2005, between RR and TT satisfies the requirements of paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(B) of this section. Consequently, pursuant to paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(C) of this section, the equipment is treated as originally placed in service by TT on February 15, 2005. Further, pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(C) of this section, TT is considered the original user of the equipment. Accordingly, the equipment is not eligible for the additional first year depreciation deduction.
(c)
Qualified leasehold improvement property
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of section 168(k), qualified leasehold improvement property means any improvement, which is section 1250 property, to an interior portion of a building that is nonresidential real property if—
(i) The improvement is made under or pursuant to a lease by the lessee (or any sublessee) of the interior portion, or by the lessor of that interior portion;
(ii) The interior portion of the building is to be occupied exclusively by the lessee (or any sublessee) of that interior portion; and
(iii) The improvement is placed in service more than 3 years after the date the building was first placed in service by any person.
(2)
Certain improvements not included.
Qualified leasehold improvement property does not include any improvement for which the expenditure is attributable to:
(i) The enlargement of the building;
(ii) Any elevator or escalator;
(iii) Any structural component benefiting a common area; or
(iv) The internal structural framework of the building.
(3)
Definitions.
For purposes of this paragraph (c), the following definitions apply:
(i)
Building
has the same meaning as that term is defined in § 1.48-1(e)(1).
(ii)
Common area
means any portion of a building that is equally available to all users of the building on the same basis for uses that are incidental to the primary use of the building. For example, stairways, hallways, lobbies, common seating areas, interior and exterior pedestrian walkways and pedestrian bridges, loading docks and areas, and rest rooms generally are treated as common areas if they are used by different lessees of a building.
(iii)
Elevator
and
escalator
have the same meanings as those terms are defined in § 1.48-1(m)(2).
(iv)
Enlargement
has the same meaning as that term is defined in § 1.48-12(c)(10).
(v)
Internal structural framework
has the same meaning as that term is defined in § 1.48-12(b)(3)(i)(D)(iii).
(vi)
Lease
has the same meaning as that term is defined in section 168(h)(7). In addition, a commitment to enter into a lease is treated as a lease, and the parties to the commitment are treated as lessor and lessee. However, a lease between related persons is not considered a lease. For purposes of the preceding sentence, related persons are—
(A) Members of an affiliated group (as defined in section 1504 and the regulations thereunder); and
(B) Persons having a relationship described in section 267(b) and the regulations thereunder. For purposes of applying section 267(b), the language “80 percent or more” is used instead of “more than 50 percent.”
(vii)
Nonresidential real property
has the same meaning as that term is defined in section 168(e)(2)(B).
(viii)
Structural component
has the same meaning as that term is defined in § 1.48-1(e)(2).
(d)
Computation of depreciation deduction for qualified property or 50-percent bonus depreciation property
—(1)
Additional first year depreciation deduction
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, the additional first year depreciation deduction is allowable in the first taxable year in which the qualified property or 50-percent bonus depreciation property is placed in service by the taxpayer for use in its trade or business or for the production of income. Except as provided in paragraph (f)(5) of this section, the allowable additional first year depreciation deduction for qualified property is determined by multiplying the unadjusted depreciable basis (as defined in § 1.168(k)-1(a)(2)(iii)) of the qualified property by 30 percent. Except as provided in paragraph (f)(5) of this section, the allowable additional first year depreciation deduction for 50-percent bonus depreciation property is determined by multiplying the unadjusted depreciable basis (as defined in § 1.168(k)-1(a)(2)(iii)) of the 50-percent bonus depreciation property by 50 percent. Except as provided in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the 30-percent or 50-percent additional first year depreciation deduction is not affected by a taxable year of less than 12 months. See paragraph (f)(1) of this section for qualified property or 50-percent bonus depreciation property placed in service and disposed of in the same taxable year. See paragraph (f)(5) of this section for qualified property or 50-percent bonus depreciation property acquired in a like-kind exchange or as a result of an involuntary conversion.
(ii)
Property having a longer production period.
For purposes of paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section, the unadjusted depreciable basis (as defined in § 1.168(k)-1(a)(2)(iii)) of qualified property or 50-percent bonus depreciation property described in section 168(k)(2)(B) is limited to the property's unadjusted depreciable basis attributable to the property's manufacture, construction, or production after September 10, 2001 (for qualified property), or May 5, 2003 (for 50-percent bonus depreciation property), and before January 1, 2005.
(iii)
Alternative minimum tax.
The 30-percent or 50-percent additional first year depreciation deduction is allowed for alternative minimum tax purposes for the taxable year in which the qualified property or the 50-percent bonus depreciation property is placed in service by the taxpayer. In general, the 30-percent or 50-percent additional first year depreciation deduction for alternative minimum tax purposes is based on the unadjusted depreciable basis of the property for alternative minimum tax purposes. However, see paragraph (f)(5)(iii)(D) of this section for qualified property or 50-percent bonus depreciation property acquired in a like-kind exchange or as a result of an involuntary conversion.
(2)
Otherwise allowable depreciation deduction.
(i)
In general.
Before determining the amount otherwise allowable as a depreciation deduction for the qualified property or the 50-percent bonus depreciation property for the placed-in-service year and any subsequent taxable year, the taxpayer must determine the remaining adjusted depreciable basis of the qualified property or the 50-percent bonus depreciation property. This remaining adjusted depreciable basis is equal to the unadjusted depreciable basis of the qualified property or the 50-percent bonus depreciation property reduced by the amount of the additional first year
depreciation allowed or allowable, whichever is greater. The remaining adjusted depreciable basis of the qualified property or the 50-percent bonus depreciation property is then depreciated using the applicable depreciation provisions under the Internal Revenue Code for the qualified property or the 50-percent bonus depreciation property. The remaining adjusted depreciable basis of the qualified property or the 50-percent bonus depreciation property that is MACRS property is also the basis to which the annual depreciation rates in the optional depreciation tables apply (for further guidance, see section 8 of Rev. Proc. 87-57 (1987-2 C.B. 687) and § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(
b
) of this chapter). The depreciation deduction allowable for the remaining adjusted depreciable basis of the qualified property or the 50-percent bonus depreciation property is affected by a taxable year of less than 12 months.
(ii)
Alternative minimum tax.
For alternative minimum tax purposes, the depreciation deduction allowable for the remaining adjusted depreciable basis of the qualified property or the 50-percent bonus depreciation property is based on the remaining adjusted depreciable basis for alternative minimum tax purposes. The remaining adjusted depreciable basis of the qualified property or the 50-percent bonus depreciable property for alternative minimum tax purposes is depreciated using the same depreciation method, recovery period (or useful life in the case of computer software), and convention that apply to the qualified property or the 50-percent bonus depreciation property for regular tax purposes.
(3)
Examples.
This paragraph (d) is illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
On March 1, 2003,
V,
a calendar-year taxpayer, purchased and placed in service qualified property that costs $1 million and is 5-year property under section 168(e).
V
depreciates its 5-year property placed in service in 2003 using the optional depreciation table that corresponds with the general depreciation system, the 200-percent declining balance method, a 5-year recovery period, and the half-year convention. For 2003,
V
is allowed a 30-percent additional first year depreciation deduction of $300,000 (the unadjusted depreciable basis of $1 million multiplied by .30). Next,
V
must reduce the unadjusted depreciable basis of $1 million by the additional first year depreciation deduction of $300,000 to determine the remaining adjusted depreciable basis of $700,000. Then,
V
's depreciation deduction allowable in 2003 for the remaining adjusted depreciable basis of $700,000 is $140,000 (the remaining adjusted depreciable basis of $700,000 multiplied by the annual depreciation rate of .20 for recovery year 1).

# Example 2.
On June 1, 2003,
W,
a calendar-year taxpayer, purchased and placed in service 50-percent bonus depreciation property that costs $126,000. The property qualifies for the expensing election under section 179 and is 5-year property under section 168(e).
W
did not purchase any other section 179 property in 2003.
W
makes the election under section 179 for the property and depreciates its 5-year property placed in service in 2003 using the optional depreciation table that corresponds with the general depreciation system, the 200-percent declining balance method, a 5-year recovery period, and the half-year convention. For 2003,
W
is first allowed a $100,000 deduction under section 179. Next,
W
must reduce the cost of $126,000 by the section 179 deduction of $100,000 to determine the unadjusted depreciable basis of $26,000. Then, for 2003,
W
is allowed a 50-percent additional first year depreciation deduction of $13,000 (the unadjusted depreciable basis of $26,000 multiplied by .50). Next,
W
must reduce the unadjusted depreciable basis of $26,000 by the additional first year depreciation deduction of $13,000 to determine the remaining adjusted depreciable basis of $13,000. Then,
W
's depreciation deduction allowable in 2003 for the remaining adjusted depreciable basis of $13,000 is $2,600 (the remaining adjusted depreciable basis of $13,000 multiplied by the annual depreciation rate of .20 for recovery year 1).
(e)
Election not to deduct additional first year depreciation
—(1)
In general.
If a taxpayer makes an election under this paragraph (e), the election applies to all qualified property or 50-percent bonus depreciation property, as applicable, that is in the same class of property and placed in service in the same taxable year. The rules of this paragraph (e) apply to the following elections provided under section 168(k):
(i)
Qualified property.
A taxpayer may make an election not to deduct the 30-percent additional first year depreciation for any class of property that is qualified property placed in service during the taxable year. If this election is made, no additional first year depreciation deduction is allowable for the property placed in service during the taxable year in the class of property.
(ii)
50-percent bonus depreciation property.
For any class of property that is 50-percent bonus depreciation property placed in service during the taxable year, a taxpayer may make an election—
(A) To deduct the 30-percent, instead of the 50-percent, additional first year depreciation. If this election is made, the allowable additional first year depreciation deduction is determined as though the class of property is qualified property under section 168(k)(2); or
(B) Not to deduct both the 30-percent and the 50-percent additional first year depreciation. If this election is made, no additional first year depreciation deduction is allowable for the class of property.
(2)
Definition of class of property.
For purposes of this paragraph (e), the term class of property means:
(i) Except for the property described in paragraphs (e)(2)(ii) and (iv) of this section, each class of property described in section 168(e) (for example, 5-year property);
(ii) Water utility property as defined in section 168(e)(5) and depreciated under section 168;
(iii) Computer software as defined in, and depreciated under, section 167(f)(1) and the regulations thereunder; or
(iv) Qualified leasehold improvement property as defined in paragraph (c) of this section and depreciated under section 168.
(3)
Time and manner for making election
—(i)
Time for making election.
Except as provided in paragraph (e)(4) of this section, any election specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section must be made by the due date (including extensions) of the Federal tax return for the taxable year in which the qualified property or the 50-percent bonus depreciation property, as applicable, is placed in service by the taxpayer.
(ii)
Manner of making election.
Except as provided in paragraph (e)(4) of this section, any election specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section must be made in the manner prescribed on Form 4562, “Depreciation and Amortization,” and its instructions. The election is made separately by each person owning qualified property or 50-percent bonus depreciation property (for example, for each member of a consolidated group by the common parent of the group, by the partnership, or by the S corporation). If Form 4562 is revised or renumbered, any reference in this section to that form shall be treated as a reference to the revised or renumbered form.
(4)
Special rules for 2000 or 2001 returns.
For the election specified in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section for qualified property placed in service by the taxpayer during the taxable year that included September 11, 2001, the taxpayer should refer to the guidance provided by the Internal Revenue Service for the time and manner of making this election on the 2000 or 2001 Federal tax return for the taxable year that included September 11, 2001 (for further guidance,
see
sections 3.03(3) and 4 of Rev. Proc. 2002-33 (2002-1 C.B. 963), Rev. Proc. 2003-50 (2003-29 I.R.B. 119), and § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(
b
) of this chapter).
(5)
Failure to make election.
If a taxpayer does not make the applicable election specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section within the time and in the manner prescribed in paragraph (e)(3) or (4) of this section, the amount of depreciation allowable for that property under section 167(f)(1) or under section 168, as applicable, must be determined for the placed-in-service year and for all subsequent taxable years by taking into account the additional first year depreciation deduction. Thus, any election specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall not be made by the taxpayer in any other manner (for example, the election cannot be made through a request under section 446(e) to change the taxpayer's method of accounting).
(6)
Alternative minimum tax.
If a taxpayer makes an election specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section for a class of property, the depreciation adjustments under section 56 and the regulations under section 56 apply to the property to which that election applies for purposes of computing the taxpayer's alternative minimum taxable income.
(7)
Revocation of election
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (e)(7)(ii) of this section, an election specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, once made, may be revoked only
with the written consent of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. To seek the Commissioner's consent, the taxpayer must submit a request for a letter ruling.
(ii)
Automatic 6-month extension.
If a taxpayer made an election specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section for a class of property, an automatic extension of 6 months from the due date of the taxpayer's Federal tax return (excluding extensions) for the placed-in-service year of the class of property is granted to revoke that election, provided the taxpayer timely filed the taxpayer's Federal tax return for the placed-in-service year of the class of property and, within this 6-month extension period, the taxpayer (and all taxpayers whose tax liability would be affected by the election) files an amended Federal tax return for the placed-in-service year of the class of property in a manner that is consistent with the revocation of the election.
(f)
Special rules
—(1)
Property placed in service and disposed of in the same taxable year
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraphs (f)(1)(ii) and (iii) of this section, the additional first year depreciation deduction is not allowed for qualified property or 50-percent bonus depreciation property placed in service and disposed of during the same taxable year. Also if qualified property or 50-percent bonus depreciation property is placed in service and disposed of during the same taxable year and then reacquired and again placed in service in a subsequent taxable year, the additional first year depreciation deduction is not allowable for the property in the subsequent taxable year.
(ii)
Technical termination of a partnership.
In the case of a technical termination of a partnership under section 708(b)(1)(B), the additional first year depreciation deduction is allowable for any qualified property or 50-percent bonus depreciation property placed in service by the terminated partnership during the taxable year of termination and contributed by the terminated partnership to the new partnership. The allowable additional first year depreciation deduction for the qualified property or the 50-percent bonus depreciation property shall not be claimed by the terminated partnership but instead shall be claimed by the new partnership for the new partnership's taxable year in which the qualified property or the 50-percent bonus depreciation property was contributed by the terminated partnership to the new partnership. However, if qualified property or 50-percent bonus depreciation property is both placed in service and contributed to a new partnership in a transaction described in section 708(b)(1)(B) by the terminated partnership during the taxable year of termination, and if such property is disposed of by the new partnership in the same taxable year the new partnership received such property from the terminated partnership, then no additional first year depreciation deduction is allowable to either partnership.
(iii)
Section 168(i)(7) transactions.
If any qualified property or 50-percent bonus depreciation property is transferred in a transaction described in section 168(i)(7) in the same taxable year that the qualified property or the 50-percent bonus depreciation property is placed in service by the transferor, the additional first year depreciation deduction is allowable for the qualified property or the 50-percent bonus depreciation property. The allowable additional first year depreciation deduction for the qualified property or the 50-percent bonus depreciation property for the transferor's taxable year in which the property is placed in service is allocated between the transferor and the transferee on a monthly basis. This allocation shall be made in accordance with the rules in § 1.168(d)-1(b)(7)(ii) for allocating the depreciation deduction between the transferor and the transferee. However, if qualified property or 50-percent bonus depreciation property is both placed in service and transferred in a transaction described in section 168(i)(7) by the transferor during the same taxable year, and if such property is disposed of by the transferee (other than by a transaction described in section 168(i)(7)) during the same taxable year the transferee received such property from the transferor, then no additional first year depreciation deduction is allowable to either party.
(iv)
Examples.
The application of this paragraph (f)(1) is illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
X
and
Y
are equal partners in
Partnership XY,
a general partnership. On February 1, 2002,
Partnership XY
purchased and placed in service new equipment at a cost of $30,000. On March 1, 2002,
X
sells its entire 50 percent interest to
Z
in a transfer that terminates the partnership under section 708(b)(1)(B). As a result, terminated
Partnership XY
is deemed to have contributed the equipment to new
Partnership XY.
Pursuant to paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section, new
Partnership XY,
not terminated
Partnership XY,
is eligible to claim the 30-percent additional first year depreciation deduction allowable for the equipment for the taxable year 2002 (assuming all other requirements are met).

# Example 2.
On January 5, 2002,
BB
purchased and placed in service new office desks for a total amount of $8,000. On August 20, 2002,
BB
transferred the office desks to
Partnership BC
in a transaction described in section 721.
BB
and
Partnership BC
are calendar-year taxpayers. Because the transaction between
BB
and
Partnership BC
is a transaction described in section 168(i)(7), pursuant to paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of this section the 30-percent additional first year depreciation deduction allowable for the desks is allocated between
BB
and
Partnership BC
in accordance with the rules in § 1.168(d)-1(b)(7)(ii) for allocating the depreciation deduction between the transferor and the transferee. Accordingly, the 30-percent additional first year depreciation deduction allowable for the desks for 2002 of $2,400 (the unadjusted depreciable basis of $8,000 multiplied by .30) is allocated between
BB
and
Partnership BC
based on the number of months that
BB
and
Partnership BC
held the desks in service. Thus, because the desks were held in service by
BB
for 7 of 12 months, which includes the month in which
BB
placed the desks in service but does not include the month in which the desks were transferred,
BB
is allocated $1,400 (
7/12
× $2,400 additional first year depreciation deduction).
Partnership BC
is allocated $1,000, the remaining
5/12
of the $2,400 additional first year depreciation deduction allowable for the desks.
(2)
Redetermination of basis.
If the unadjusted depreciable basis (as defined in § 1.168(k)-1(a)(2)(iii)) of qualified property or 50-percent bonus depreciation property is redetermined (for example, due to contingent purchase price or discharge of indebtedness) before January 1, 2005, or, in the case of property described in section 168(k)(2)(B) or (C), is redetermined before January 1, 2006 (or redetermined before January 1, 2007, in the case of property described in section 168(k)(2)(B) or (C) to which section 105 of the Gulf Opportunity Zone Act of 2005 (Pub. L. 109-135, 119 Stat. 2577) applies (for further guidance, see Announcement 2006-29 (2006-19 I.R.B. 879) and § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(
b
) of this chapter)), the additional first year depreciation deduction allowable for the qualified property or the 50-percent bonus depreciation property is redetermined as follows:
(i)
Increase in basis.
For the taxable year in which an increase in basis of qualified property or 50-percent bonus depreciation property occurs, the taxpayer shall claim an additional first year depreciation deduction for qualified property by multiplying the amount of the increase in basis for this property by 30 percent or, for 50-percent bonus depreciation property, by multiplying the amount of the increase in basis for this property by 50 percent. For purposes of this paragraph (f)(2)(i), the 30-percent additional first year depreciation deduction applies to the increase in basis if the underlying property is qualified property and the 50-percent additional first year depreciation deduction applies to the increase in basis if the underlying property is 50-percent bonus depreciation property. To determine the amount otherwise allowable as a depreciation deduction for the increase in basis of qualified property or 50-percent bonus depreciation property, the amount of the increase in basis of the qualified property or the 50-percent bonus depreciation property must be reduced by the additional first year depreciation deduction allowed or allowable, whichever is greater, for the increase in basis and the remaining increase in basis of—
(A) Qualified property or 50-percent bonus depreciation property (except for computer software described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section) is depreciated over the recovery period of the qualified property or the 50-percent bonus depreciation property, as applicable, remaining as of the beginning of the taxable year in which the increase in basis occurs, and using the same depreciation method and convention applicable to the qualified property or 50-percent bonus depreciation property, as
applicable, that applies for the taxable year in which the increase in basis occurs; and
(B) Computer software (as defined in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section) that is qualified property or 50-percent bonus depreciation property is depreciated ratably over the remainder of the 36-month period (the useful life under section 167(f)(1)) as of the beginning of the first day of the month in which the increase in basis occurs.
(ii)
Decrease in basis.
For the taxable year in which a decrease in basis of qualified property or 50-percent bonus depreciation property occurs, the taxpayer shall reduce the total amount otherwise allowable as a depreciation deduction for all of the taxpayer's depreciable property by the excess additional first year depreciation deduction previously claimed for the qualified property or the 50-percent bonus depreciation property. If, for such taxable year, the excess additional first year depreciation deduction exceeds the total amount otherwise allowable as a depreciation deduction for all of the taxpayer's depreciable property, the taxpayer shall take into account a negative depreciation deduction in computing taxable income. The excess additional first year depreciation deduction for qualified property is determined by multiplying the amount of the decrease in basis for this property by 30 percent. The excess additional first year depreciation deduction for 50-percent bonus depreciation property is determined by multiplying the amount of the decrease in basis for this property by 50 percent. For purposes of this paragraph (f)(2)(ii), the 30-percent additional first year depreciation deduction applies to the decrease in basis if the underlying property is qualified property and the 50-percent additional first year depreciation deduction applies to the decrease in basis if the underlying property is 50-percent bonus depreciation property. Also, if the taxpayer establishes by adequate records or other sufficient evidence that the taxpayer claimed less than the additional first year depreciation deduction allowable for the qualified property or the 50-percent bonus depreciation property before the decrease in basis or if the taxpayer claimed more than the additional first year depreciation deduction allowable for the qualified property or the 50-percent bonus depreciation property before the decrease in basis, the excess additional first year depreciation deduction is determined by multiplying the amount of the decrease in basis by the additional first year depreciation deduction percentage actually claimed by the taxpayer for the qualified property or the 50-percent bonus depreciation property, as applicable, before the decrease in basis. To determine the amount to reduce the total amount otherwise allowable as a depreciation deduction for all of the taxpayer's depreciable property for the excess depreciation previously claimed (other than the additional first year depreciation deduction) resulting from the decrease in basis of the qualified property or the 50-percent bonus depreciation property, the amount of the decrease in basis of the qualified property or the 50-percent bonus depreciation property must be adjusted by the excess additional first year depreciation deduction that reduced the total amount otherwise allowable as a depreciation deduction (as determined under this paragraph) and the remaining decrease in basis of—
(A) Qualified property or 50-percent bonus depreciation property (except for computer software described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section) reduces the amount otherwise allowable as a depreciation deduction over the recovery period of the qualified property or the 50-percent bonus depreciation property, as applicable, remaining as of the beginning of the taxable year in which the decrease in basis occurs, and using the same depreciation method and convention of the qualified property or 50-percent bonus depreciation property, as applicable, that applies in the taxable year in which the decrease in basis occurs. If, for any taxable year, the reduction to the amount otherwise allowable as a depreciation deduction (as determined under this paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(A)) exceeds the total amount otherwise allowable as a depreciation deduction for all of the taxpayer's depreciable property, the taxpayer shall take into account a negative depreciation deduction in computing taxable income; and
(B) Computer software (as defined in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section) that is qualified property or 50-percent bonus depreciation property reduces the amount otherwise allowable as a depreciation deduction over the remainder of the 36-month period (the useful life under section 167(f)(1)) as of the beginning of the first day of the month in which the decrease in basis occurs. If, for any taxable year, the reduction to the amount otherwise allowable as a depreciation deduction (as determined under this paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(B)) exceeds the total amount otherwise allowable as a depreciation deduction for all of the taxpayer's depreciable property, the taxpayer shall take into account a negative depreciation deduction in computing taxable income.
(iii)
Definition.
Except as otherwise expressly provided by the Internal Revenue Code (for example, section 1017(a)), the regulations under the Internal Revenue Code, or other guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(
b
) of this chapter), for purposes of this paragraph (f)(2):
(A) An increase in basis occurs in the taxable year an amount is taken into account under section 461; and
(B) A decrease in basis occurs in the taxable year an amount would be taken into account under section 451.
(iv)
Examples.
The application of this paragraph (f)(2) is illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
(i) On May 15, 2002,
CC,
a cash-basis taxpayer, purchased and placed in service qualified property that is 5-year property at a cost of $200,000. In addition to the $200,000,
CC
agrees to pay the seller 25 percent of the gross profits from the operation of the property in 2002. On May 15, 2003,
CC
paid to the seller an additional $10,000.
CC
depreciates the 5-year property placed in service in 2002 using the optional depreciation table that corresponds with the general depreciation system, the 200-percent declining balance method, a 5-year recovery period, and the half-year convention.
(ii) For 2002,
CC
is allowed a 30-percent additional first year depreciation deduction of $60,000 (the unadjusted depreciable basis of $200,000 multiplied by .30). In addition,
CC
's depreciation deduction for 2002 for the remaining adjusted depreciable basis of $140,000 (the unadjusted depreciable basis of $200,000 reduced by the additional first year depreciation deduction of $60,000) is $28,000 (the remaining adjusted depreciable basis of $140,000 multiplied by the annual depreciation rate of .20 for recovery year 1).
(iii) For 2003,
CC
's depreciation deduction for the remaining adjusted depreciable basis of $140,000 is $44,800 (the remaining adjusted depreciable basis of $140,000 multiplied by the annual depreciation rate of .32 for recovery year 2). In addition, pursuant to paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section,
CC
is allowed an additional first year depreciation deduction for 2003 for the $10,000 increase in basis of the qualified property. Consequently,
CC
is allowed an additional first year depreciation deduction of $3,000 (the increase in basis of $10,000 multiplied by .30). Also,
CC
is allowed a depreciation deduction for 2003 attributable to the remaining increase in basis of $7,000 (the increase in basis of $10,000 reduced by the additional first year depreciation deduction of $3,000). The depreciation deduction allowable for 2003 attributable to the remaining increase in basis of $7,000 is $3,111 (the remaining increase in basis of $7,000 multiplied by .4444, which is equal to 1/remaining recovery period of 4.5 years at January 1, 2003, multiplied by 2). Accordingly, for 2003,
CC
's total depreciation deduction allowable for the qualified property is $50,911.

# Example 2.
(i) On May 15, 2002, DD, a calendar-year taxpayer, purchased and placed in service qualified property that is 5-year property at a cost of $400,000. To purchase the property, DD borrowed $250,000 from Bank2. On May 15, 2003, Bank2 forgives $50,000 of the indebtedness. DD makes the election provided in section 108(b)(5) to apply any portion of the reduction under section 1017 to the basis of the depreciable property of the taxpayer. DD depreciates the 5-year property placed in service in 2002 using the optional depreciation table that corresponds with the general depreciation system, the 200-percent declining balance method, a 5-year recovery period, and the half-year convention.
(ii) For 2002, DD is allowed a 30-percent additional first year depreciation deduction of $120,000 (the unadjusted depreciable basis of $400,000 multiplied by .30). In addition, DD's depreciation deduction allowable for 2002 for the remaining adjusted depreciable basis of $280,000 (the unadjusted depreciable basis of $400,000 reduced by the additional first year depreciation deduction of $120,000) is $56,000 (the remaining adjusted depreciable basis of $280,000 multiplied by the annual depreciation rate of .20 for recovery year 1).
(iii) For 2003, DD's deduction for the remaining adjusted depreciable basis of $280,000 is $89,600 (the remaining adjusted depreciable basis of $280,000 multiplied by the annual depreciation rate .32 for recovery year 2). Although Bank2 forgave the indebtedness in 2003, the basis of the property is reduced on January 1, 2004, pursuant to sections 108(b)(5)
and 1017(a) under which basis is reduced at the beginning of the taxable year following the taxable year in which the discharge of indebtedness occurs.
(iv) For 2004, DD's deduction for the remaining adjusted depreciable basis of $280,000 is $53,760 (the remaining adjusted depreciable basis of $280,000 multiplied by the annual depreciation rate .192 for recovery year 3). However, pursuant to paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section, DD must reduce the amount otherwise allowable as a depreciation deduction for 2004 by the excess depreciation previously claimed for the $50,000 decrease in basis of the qualified property. Consequently, DD must reduce the amount of depreciation otherwise allowable for 2004 by the excess additional first year depreciation of $15,000 (the decrease in basis of $50,000 multiplied by .30). Also, DD must reduce the amount of depreciation otherwise allowable for 2004 by the excess depreciation attributable to the remaining decrease in basis of $35,000 (the decrease in basis of $50,000 reduced by the excess additional first year depreciation of $15,000). The reduction in the amount of depreciation otherwise allowable for 2004 for the remaining decrease in basis of $35,000 is $19,999 (the remaining decrease in basis of $35,000 multiplied by .5714, which is equal to 1/remaining recovery period of 3.5 years at January 1, 2004, multiplied by 2). Accordingly, assuming the qualified property is the only depreciable property owned by DD, for 2004, DD's total depreciation deduction allowable for the qualified property is $18,761 ($53,760 minus $15,000 minus $19,999).
(3)
Section 1245 and 1250 depreciation recapture.
For purposes of section 1245 and the regulations thereunder, the additional first year depreciation deduction is an amount allowed or allowable for depreciation. Further, for purposes of section 1250(b) and the regulations thereunder, the additional first year depreciation deduction is not a straight line method.
(4)
Coordination with section 169.
The additional first year depreciation deduction is allowable in the placed-in-service year of a certified pollution control facility (as defined in § 1.169-2(a)) that is qualified property or 50-percent bonus depreciation property, even if the taxpayer makes the election to amortize the certified pollution control facility under section 169 and the regulations thereunder in the certified pollution control facility's placed-in-service year.
(5)
Like-kind exchanges and involuntary conversions
—(i)
Scope.
The rules of this paragraph (f)(5) apply to acquired MACRS property or acquired computer software that is qualified property or 50-percent bonus depreciation property at the time of replacement provided the time of replacement is after September 10, 2001, and before January 1, 2005, or, in the case of acquired MACRS property or acquired computer software that is qualified property, or 50-percent bonus depreciation property, described in section 168(k)(2)(B) or (C), the time of replacement is after September 10, 2001, and before January 1, 2006 (or the time of replacement is after September 10, 2001, and before January 1, 2007, in the case of property described in section 168(k)(2)(B) or (C) to which section 105 of the Gulf Opportunity Zone Act of 2005 (Pub. L. 109-135, 119 Stat. 2577) applies (for further guidance, see Announcement 2006-29 (2006-19 I.R.B. 879) and § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(

Computation
—(A)
In general.
Assuming all other requirements of section 168(k) and this section are met, the remaining carryover basis for the year of replacement and the remaining excess basis, if any, for the year of replacement for the acquired MACRS property or the acquired computer software, as applicable, are eligible for the additional first year depreciation deduction. The 30-percent additional first year depreciation deduction applies to the remaining carryover basis and the remaining excess basis, if any, of the acquired MACRS property or the acquired computer software if the time of replacement is after September 10, 2001, and before May 6, 2003, or if the taxpayer made the election provided in paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(A) of this section. The 50-percent additional first year depreciation deduction applies to the remaining carryover basis and the remaining excess basis, if any, of the acquired MACRS property or the acquired computer software if the time of replacement is after May 5, 2003, and before January 1, 2005, or, in the case of acquired MACRS property or acquired computer software that is 50-percent bonus depreciation property described in section 168(k)(2)(B) or (C), the time of replacement is after May 5, 2003, and before January 1, 2006 (or the time of replacement is after May 5, 2003, and before January 1, 2007, in the case of 50-percent bonus depreciation property described in section 168(k)(2)(B) or (C) to which section 105 of the Gulf Opportunity Zone Act of 2005 (Pub. L. 109-135, 119 Stat. 2577) applies (for further guidance, see Announcement 2006-29 (2006-19 I.R.B. 879) and § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(
b
) of this chapter)). The additional first year depreciation deduction is computed separately for the remaining carryover basis and the remaining excess basis.
(B)
Year of disposition and year of replacement.
The additional first year depreciation deduction is allowable for the acquired MACRS property or acquired computer software in the year of replacement. However, the additional first year depreciation deduction is not allowable for the exchanged or involuntarily converted MACRS property or the exchanged or involuntarily converted computer software if the exchanged or involuntarily converted MACRS property or the exchanged or involuntarily converted computer software, as applicable, is placed in service and disposed of in an exchange or involuntary conversion in the same taxable year.
(C)
Property having a longer production period.
For purposes of paragraph (f)(5)(iii)(A) of this section, the total of the remaining carryover basis and the remaining excess basis, if any, of the acquired MACRS property that is qualified property or 50-percent bonus depreciation property described in section 168(k)(2)(B) is limited to the total of the property's remaining carryover basis and remaining excess basis, if any, attributable to the property's manufacture, construction, or production after September 10, 2001 (for qualified property), or May 5, 2003 (for 50-percent bonus depreciation property), and before January 1, 2005.
(D)
Alternative minimum tax.
The 30-percent or 50-percent additional first year depreciation deduction is allowed for alternative minimum tax purposes for the year of replacement of acquired MACRS property or acquired computer software that is qualified property or 50-percent bonus depreciation property. The 30-percent or 50-percent additional first year depreciation deduction for alternative minimum tax purposes is based on the remaining carryover basis and the remaining excess basis, if any, of the acquired MACRS property or the acquired computer software for alternative minimum tax purposes.
(iv)
Sale-leaseback transaction.
For purposes of this paragraph (f)(5), if MACRS property or computer software is sold to a taxpayer and leased back to a person by the taxpayer within three months after the time of disposition of the MACRS property or computer software, as applicable, the time of replacement for this MACRS property or computer software, as applicable, shall not be earlier than the date on which the MACRS property or computer software, as applicable, is used by the lessee under the leaseback.
(v)
Acquired MACRS property or acquired computer software that is acquired and placed in service before disposition of involuntarily converted MACRS property or involuntarily converted computer software.
If, in an involuntary conversion, a taxpayer acquires and places in service the acquired MACRS property or the acquired computer software before the time of disposition of the involuntarily converted MACRS property or the involuntarily converted computer software and the time of disposition of the involuntarily converted MACRS property or the involuntarily converted computer software is after December 31, 2004, or, in the case of property described in section 168(k)(2)(B) or (C), after December 31, 2005 (or after December 31, 2006, in the case of property described in section 168(k)(2)(B) or (C) to which section 105 of the Gulf Opportunity Zone Act of 2005 (Pub. L. 109-135, 119 Stat. 2577) applies (for further guidance, see Announcement 2006-29 (2006-19 I.R.B. 879) and § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(
b
) of this chapter)), then—
(A)
Time of replacement.
The time of replacement for purposes of this paragraph (f)(5) is when the acquired MACRS property or acquired computer software is placed in service by the taxpayer, provided the threat or imminence of requisition or condemnation of the involuntarily converted MACRS property or involuntarily converted computer software existed before January 1, 2005, or, in the case of property described in section 168(k)(2)(B) or (C), existed before January 1, 2006 (or existed before January 1, 2007, in the case of property described in section 168(k)(2)(B) or (C) to which section 105 of the Gulf Opportunity Zone Act of 2005 (Pub. L. 109-135, 119 Stat. 2577) applies (for further guidance, see Announcement 2006-29 (2006-19 I.R.B. 879) and § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(
b
) of this chapter)); and
(B)
Depreciation of acquired MACRS property or acquired computer software.
The taxpayer depreciates the acquired
MACRS property or acquired computer software in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section. However, at the time of disposition of the involuntarily converted MACRS property, the taxpayer determines the exchanged basis (as defined in § 1.168(i)-6(b)(7)) and the excess basis (as defined in § 1.168(i)-6(b)(8)) of the acquired MACRS property and begins to depreciate the depreciable exchanged basis (as defined in § 1.168(i)-6(b)(9) of the acquired MACRS property in accordance with § 1.168(i)-6(c). The depreciable excess basis (as defined in § 1.168(i)-6(b)(10)) of the acquired MACRS property continues to be depreciated by the taxpayer in accordance with the first sentence of this paragraph (f)(5)(v)(B). Further, in the year of disposition of the involuntarily converted MACRS property, the taxpayer must include in taxable income the excess of the depreciation deductions allowable, including the additional first year depreciation deduction allowable, on the unadjusted depreciable basis of the acquired MACRS property over the additional first year depreciation deduction that would have been allowable to the taxpayer on the remaining carryover basis of the acquired MACRS property at the time of replacement (as defined in paragraph (f)(5)(v)(A) of this section) plus the depreciation deductions that would have been allowable, including the additional first year depreciation deduction allowable, to the taxpayer on the depreciable excess basis of the acquired MACRS property from the date the acquired MACRS property was placed in service by the taxpayer (taking into account the applicable convention) to the time of disposition of the involuntarily converted MACRS property. Similar rules apply to acquired computer software.
(vi)
Examples.
The application of this paragraph (f)(5) is illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
(i) In December 2002, EE, a calendar-year corporation, acquired for $200,000 and placed in service Canopy V1, a gas station canopy. Canopy V1 is qualified property under section 168(k)(1) and is 5-year property under section 168(e). EE depreciated Canopy V1 under the general depreciation system of section 168(a) by using the 200-percent declining balance method of depreciation, a 5-year recovery period, and the half-year convention. EE elected to use the optional depreciation tables to compute the depreciation allowance for Canopy V1. On January 1, 2003, Canopy V1 was destroyed in a fire and was no longer usable in EE's business. On June 1, 2003, in an involuntary conversion, EE acquired and placed in service new Canopy W1 with all of the $160,000 of insurance proceeds EE received due to the loss of Canopy V1. Canopy W1 is 50-percent bonus depreciation property under section 168(k)(4) and is 5-year property under section 168(e). Pursuant to paragraph (g)(3)(ii) of this section and § 1.168(i)-6(k)(2)(i), EE decided to apply § 1.168(i)-6 to the involuntary conversion of Canopy V1 with the replacement of Canopy W1, the acquired MACRS property.
(ii) For 2002, EE is allowed a 30-percent additional first year depreciation deduction of $60,000 for Canopy V1 (the unadjusted depreciable basis of $200,000 multiplied by .30), and a regular MACRS depreciation deduction of $28,000 for Canopy V1 (the remaining adjusted depreciable basis of $140,000 multiplied by the annual depreciation rate of .20 for recovery year 1).
(iii) For 2003, EE is allowed a regular MACRS depreciation deduction of $22,400 for Canopy V1 (the remaining adjusted depreciable basis of $140,000 multiplied by the annual depreciation rate of .32 for recovery year 2 ×

Example 1,
except EE elected not to deduct the additional first year depreciation for 5-year property placed in service in 2002. EE deducted the additional first year depreciation for 5-year property placed in service in 2003.
(ii) For 2002, EE is allowed a regular MACRS depreciation deduction of $40,000 for Canopy V1 (the unadjusted depreciable basis of $200,000 multiplied by the annual depreciation rate of .20 for recovery year 1).
(iii) For 2003, EE is allowed a regular MACRS depreciation deduction of $32,000 for Canopy V1 (the unadjusted depreciable basis of $200,000 multiplied by the annual depreciation rate of .32 for recovery year 2 ×
1/2
year).
(iv) Pursuant to paragraph (f)(5)(iii)(A) of this section, the additional first year depreciation deduction allowable for Canopy W1 equals $64,000 (.50 of Canopy W1's remaining carryover basis at the time of replacement of $128,000 (Canopy V1's unadjusted depreciable basis of $200,000 minus 2002 regular MACRS depreciation deduction of $40,000 minus 2003
regular MACRS depreciation deduction of $32,000)).

# Example 3.
(i) In December 2001, FF, a calendar-year corporation, acquired for $10,000 and placed in service Computer X2. Computer X2 is qualified property under section 168(k)(1) and is 5-year property under section 168(e). FF depreciated Computer X2 under the general depreciation system of section 168(a) by using the 200-percent declining balance method of depreciation, a 5-year recovery period, and the half-year convention. FF elected to use the optional depreciation tables to compute the depreciation allowance for Computer X2. On January 1, 2002, FF acquired new Computer Y2 by exchanging Computer X2 and $1,000 cash in a like-kind exchange. Computer Y2 is qualified property under section 168(k)(1) and is 5-year property under section 168(e). Pursuant to paragraph (g)(3)(ii) of this section and § 1.168(i)-6(k)(2)(i), FF decided to apply § 1.168(i)-6 to the exchange of Computer X2 for Computer Y2, the acquired MACRS property.
(ii) For 2001, FF is allowed a 30-percent additional first year depreciation deduction of $3,000 for Computer X2 (unadjusted basis of $10,000 multiplied by .30), and a regular MACRS depreciation deduction of $1,400 for Computer X2 (the remaining adjusted depreciable basis of $7,000 multiplied by the annual depreciation rate of .20 for recovery year 1).
(iii) For 2002, FF is allowed a regular MACRS depreciation deduction of $1,120 for Computer X2 (the remaining adjusted depreciable basis of $7,000 multiplied by the annual depreciation rate of .32 for recovery year 2 ×
1/2
year).
(iv) Pursuant to paragraph (f)(5)(iii)(A) of this section, the 30-percent additional first year depreciation deduction for Computer Y2 is allowable for the remaining carryover basis at the time of replacement of $4,480 (Computer X2's unadjusted depreciable basis of $10,000 minus additional first year depreciation deduction allowable of $3,000 minus 2001 regular MACRS depreciation deduction of $1,400 minus 2002 regular MACRS depreciation deduction of $1,120) and for the remaining excess basis at the time of replacement of $1,000 (cash paid for Computer Y2). Thus, the 30-percent additional first year depreciation deduction for the remaining carryover basis at the time of replacement equals $1,344 ($4,480 multiplied by .30) and for the remaining excess basis at the time of replacement equals $300 ($1,000 multiplied by .30), which totals $1,644.

# Example 4.
(i) In September 2002, GG, a June 30 year-end corporation, acquired for $20,000 and placed in service Equipment X3. Equipment X3 is qualified property under section 168(k)(1) and is 5-year property under section 168(e). GG depreciated Equipment X3 under the general depreciation system of section 168(a) by using the 200-percent declining balance method of depreciation, a 5-year recovery period, and the half-year convention. GG elected to use the optional depreciation tables to compute the depreciation allowance for Equipment X3. In December 2002, GG acquired new Equipment Y3 by exchanging Equipment X3 and $5,000 cash in a like-kind exchange. Equipment Y3 is qualified property under section 168(k)(1) and is 5-year property under section 168(e). Pursuant to paragraph (g)(3)(ii) of this section and § 1.168(i)-6(k)(2)(i), GG decided to apply § 1.168(i)-6 to the exchange of Equipment X3 for Equipment Y3, the acquired MACRS property.
(ii) Pursuant to paragraph (f)(5)(iii)(B) of this section, no additional first year depreciation deduction is allowable for Equipment X3 and, pursuant to § 1.168(d)-1T(b)(3)(ii), no regular depreciation deduction is allowable for Equipment X3, for the taxable year ended June 30, 2003.
(iii) Pursuant to paragraph (f)(5)(iii)(A) of this section, the 30-percent additional first year depreciation deduction for Equipment Y3 is allowable for the remaining carryover basis at the time of replacement of $20,000 (Equipment X3's unadjusted depreciable basis of $20,000) and for the remaining excess basis at the time of replacement of $5,000 (cash paid for Equipment Y3). Thus, the 30-percent additional first year depreciation deduction for the remaining carryover basis at the time of replacement equals $6,000 ($20,000 multiplied by .30) and for the remaining excess basis at the time of replacement equals $1,500 ($5,000 multiplied by .30), which totals $7,500.

# Example 5.
(i) Same facts as in
Example 4.
GG depreciated Equipment Y3 under the general depreciation system of section 168(a) by using the 200-percent declining balance method of depreciation, a 5-year recovery period, and the half-year convention. GG elected to use the optional depreciation tables to compute the depreciation allowance for Equipment Y3. On July 1, 2003, GG acquired new Equipment Z1 by exchanging Equipment Y3 in a like-kind exchange. Equipment Z1 is 50-percent bonus depreciation property under section 168(k)(4) and is 5-year property under section 168(e). Pursuant to paragraph (g)(3)(ii) of this section and § 1.168(i)-6(k)(2)(i), GG decided to apply § 1.168(i)-6 to the exchange of Equipment Y3 for Equipment Z1, the acquired MACRS property.
(ii) For the taxable year ending June 30, 2003, the regular MACRS depreciation deduction allowable for the remaining carryover basis at the time of replacement (after taking into account the additional first year depreciation deduction) of Equipment Y3 is $2,800 (the remaining carryover basis at the time of replacement of $20,000 minus the additional first year depreciation deduction of $6,000, multiplied by the annual depreciation
rate of .20 for recovery year 1) and for the remaining excess basis at the time of replacement (after taking into account the additional first year depreciation deduction) of Equipment Y3 is $700 (the remaining excess basis at the time of replacement of $5,000 minus the additional first year depreciation deduction of $1,500, multiplied by the annual depreciation rate of .20 for recovery year 1), which totals $3,500.
(iii) For the taxable year ending June 30, 2004, the regular MACRS depreciation deduction allowable for the remaining carryover basis (after taking into account the additional first year depreciation deduction) of Equipment Y3 is $2,240 (the remaining carryover basis at the time of replacement of $20,000 minus the additional first year depreciation deduction of $6,000, multiplied by the annual depreciation rate of .32 for recovery year 2 ×
1/2
year) and for the remaining excess basis (after taking into account the additional first year depreciation deduction) of Equipment Y3 is $560 (the remaining excess basis at the time of replacement of $5,000 minus the additional first year depreciation deduction of $1,500, multiplied by the annual depreciation rate of .32 for recovery year 2 ×
1/2
year), which totals $2,800.
(iv) For the taxable year ending June 30, 2004, pursuant to paragraph (f)(5)(iii)(A) of this section, the 50-percent additional first year depreciation deduction for Equipment Z1 is allowable for the remaining carryover basis at the time of replacement of $11,200 (Equipment Y3's unadjusted depreciable basis of $25,000 minus the total additional first year depreciation deduction of $7,500 minus the total 2003 regular MACRS depreciation deduction of $3,500 minus the total 2004 regular depreciation deduction (taking into account the half-year convention) of $2,800). Thus, the 50-percent additional first year depreciation deduction for the remaining carryover basis at the time of replacement equals $5,600 ($11,200 multiplied by .50).

# Example 6.
(i) In April 2004, SS, a calendar year-end corporation, acquired and placed in service Equipment K89. Equipment K89 is 50-percent bonus depreciation property under section 168(k)(4). In November 2004, SS acquired and placed in service used Equipment N78 by exchanging Equipment K89 in a like-kind exchange.
(ii) Pursuant to paragraph (f)(5)(iii)(B) of this section, no additional first year deduction is allowable for Equipment K89 and, pursuant to § 1.168(d)-1T(b)(3)(ii), no regular depreciation deduction is allowable for Equipment K89, for the taxable year ended December 31, 2004.
(iii) Equipment N78 is not qualified property under section 168(k)(1) or 50-percent bonus depreciation property under section 168(k)(4) because the original use requirement of paragraph (b)(3) of this section is not met. Accordingly, no additional first year depreciation deduction is allowable for Equipment N78.
(6)
Change in use
—(i)
Change in use of depreciable property.
The determination of whether the use of depreciable property changes is made in accordance with section 168(i)(5) and regulations thereunder.
(ii)
Conversion to personal use.
If qualified property or 50-percent bonus depreciation property is converted from business or income-producing use to personal use in the same taxable year in which the property is placed in service by a taxpayer, the additional first year depreciation deduction is not allowable for the property.
(iii)
Conversion to business or income-producing use
—(A)
During the same taxable year.
If, during the same taxable year, property is acquired by a taxpayer for personal use and is converted by the taxpayer from personal use to business or income-producing use, the additional first year depreciation deduction is allowable for the property in the taxable year the property is converted to business or income-producing use (assuming all of the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section are met). See paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section relating to the original use rules for a conversion of property to business or income-producing use.
(B)
Subsequent to the acquisition year.
If property is acquired by a taxpayer for personal use and, during a subsequent taxable year, is converted by the taxpayer from personal use to business or income-producing use, the additional first year depreciation deduction is allowable for the property in the taxable year the property is converted to business or income-producing use (assuming all of the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section are met). For purposes of paragraphs (b)(4) and (5) of this section, the property must be acquired by the taxpayer for personal use after September 10, 2001 (for qualified property), or after May 5, 2003 (for 50-percent bonus depreciation property), and converted by the taxpayer from personal use to business or income-producing use by January 1, 2005. See paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section relating to the original use rules for a conversion of property to business or income-producing use.
(iv)
Depreciable property changes use subsequent to the placed-in-service year
—(A) If the use of qualified property or 50-percent bonus depreciation property changes in the hands of the same taxpayer subsequent to the taxable year the qualified property or the 50-percent bonus depreciation property, as applicable, is placed in service and, as a result of the change in use, the property is no longer qualified property or 50-percent bonus depreciation property, as applicable, the additional first year depreciation deduction allowable for the qualified property or the 50-percent bonus depreciation property, as applicable, is not redetermined.
(B) If depreciable property is not qualified property or 50-percent bonus depreciation property in the taxable year the property is placed in service by the taxpayer, the additional first year depreciation deduction is not allowable for the property even if a change in the use of the property subsequent to the taxable year the property is placed in service results in the property being qualified property or 50-percent bonus depreciation property in the taxable year of the change in use.
(v)
Examples.
The application of this paragraph (f)(6) is illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
(i) On January 1, 2002, HH, a calendar year corporation, purchased and placed in service several new computers at a total cost of $100,000. HH used these computers within the United States for 3 months in 2002 and then moved and used the computers outside the United States for the remainder of 2002. On January 1, 2003, HH permanently returns the computers to the United States for use in its business.
(ii) For 2002, the computers are considered as used predominantly outside the United States in 2002 pursuant to § 1.48-1(g)(1)(i). As a result, the computers are required to be depreciated under the alternative depreciation system of section 168(g). Pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A)
2
) of this section, the computers are not qualified property in 2002, the placed-in-service year. Thus, pursuant to (f)(6)(iv)(B) of this section, no additional first year depreciation deduction is allowed for these computers, regardless of the fact that the computers are permanently returned to the United States in 2003.

# Example 2.
(i) On February 8, 2002,
II,
a calendar year corporation, purchased and placed in service new equipment at a cost of $1,000,000 for use in its California plant. The equipment is 5-year property under section 168(e) and is qualified property under section 168(k).
II
depreciates its 5-year property placed in service in 2002 using the optional depreciation table that corresponds with the general depreciation system, the 200-percent declining balance method, a 5-year recovery period, and the half-year convention. On June 4, 2003, due to changes in
II
's business circumstances,
II
permanently moves the equipment to its plant in Mexico.
(ii) For 2002,
II
is allowed a 30-percent additional first year depreciation deduction of $300,000 (the adjusted depreciable basis of $1,000,000 multiplied by .30). In addition,
II
's depreciation deduction allowable in 2002 for the remaining adjusted depreciable basis of $700,000 (the unadjusted depreciable basis of $1,000,000 reduced by the additional first year depreciation deduction of $300,000) is $140,000 (the remaining adjusted depreciable basis of $700,000 multiplied by the annual depreciation rate of .20 for recovery year 1).
(iii) For 2003, the equipment is considered as used predominantly outside the United States pursuant to § 1.48-1(g)(1)(i). As a result of this change in use, the adjusted depreciable basis of $560,000 for the equipment is required to be depreciated under the alternative depreciation system of section 168(g) beginning in 2003. However, the additional first year depreciation deduction of $300,000 allowed for the equipment in 2002 is not redetermined.
(7)
Earnings and profits.
The additional first year depreciation deduction is not allowable for purposes of computing earnings and profits.
(8)
Limitation of amount of depreciation for certain passenger automobiles.
For a passenger automobile as defined in section 280F(d)(5), the limitation under section 280F(a)(1)(A)(i) is increased by—
(i) $4,600 for qualified property acquired by a taxpayer after September 10, 2001, and before May 6, 2003; and
(ii) $7,650 for qualified property or 50-percent bonus depreciation property acquired by a taxpayer after May 5, 2003.
(9)
Section 754 election.
In general, for purposes of section 168(k) any increase in basis of qualified property or 50-percent bonus depreciation property due to a section 754 election is not eligible for the additional first year depreciation deduction. However, if qualified property or 50-percent bonus depreciation property is placed in service by a partnership in the taxable year the partnership terminates under section 708(b)(1)(B), any increase in basis of the
qualified property or the 50-percent bonus depreciation property due to a section 754 election is eligible for the additional first year depreciation deduction.
(10)
Coordination with section 47
—(i)
In general.
If qualified rehabilitation expenditures (as defined in section 47(c)(2) and § 1.48-12(c)) incurred by a taxpayer with respect to a qualified rehabilitated building (as defined in section 47(c)(1) and § 1.48-12(b)) are qualified property or 50-percent bonus depreciation property, the taxpayer may claim the rehabilitation credit provided by section 47(a) (provided the requirements of section 47 are met)—
(A) With respect to the portion of the basis of the qualified rehabilitated building that is attributable to the qualified rehabilitation expenditures if the taxpayer makes the applicable election under paragraph (e)(1)(i) or (e)(1)(ii)(B) of this section not to deduct any additional first year depreciation for the class of property that includes the qualified rehabilitation expenditures; or
(B) With respect to the portion of the remaining rehabilitated basis of the qualified rehabilitated building that is attributable to the qualified rehabilitation expenditures if the taxpayer claims the additional first year depreciation deduction on the unadjusted depreciable basis (as defined in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section but before the reduction in basis for the amount of the rehabilitation credit) of the qualified rehabilitation expenditures and the taxpayer depreciates the remaining adjusted depreciable basis (as defined in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section) of such expenditures using straight line cost recovery in accordance with section 47(c)(2)(B)(i) and § 1.48-12(c)(7)(i). For purposes of this paragraph (f)(10)(i)(B), the remaining rehabilitated basis is equal to the unadjusted depreciable basis (as defined in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section but before the reduction in basis for the amount of the rehabilitation credit) of the qualified rehabilitation expenditures that are qualified property or 50-percent bonus depreciation property reduced by the additional first year depreciation allowed or allowable, whichever is greater.
(ii)
Example.
The application of this paragraph (f)(10) is illustrated by the following example.

# Example.
(i) Between February 8, 2004, and June 4, 2004, UU, a calendar-year taxpayer, incurred qualified rehabilitation expenditures of $200,000 with respect to a qualified rehabilitated building that is nonresidential real property under section 168(e). These qualified rehabilitation expenditures are 50-percent bonus depreciation property and qualify for the 10-percent rehabilitation credit under section 47(a)(1). UU's basis in the qualified rehabilitated building is zero before incurring the qualified rehabilitation expenditures and UU placed the qualified rehabilitated building in service in July 2004. UU depreciates its nonresidential real property placed in service in 2004 under the general depreciation system of section 168(a) by using the straight line method of depreciation, a 39-year recovery period, and the mid-month convention. UU elected to use the optional depreciation tables to compute the depreciation allowance for its depreciable property placed in service in 2004. Further, for 2004, UU did not make any election under paragraph (e) of this section.
(ii) Because UU did not make any election under paragraph (e) of this section, UU is allowed a 50-percent additional first year depreciation deduction of $100,000 for the qualified rehabilitation expenditures for 2004 (the unadjusted depreciable basis of $200,000 (before reduction in basis for the rehabilitation credit) multiplied by .50). For 2004, UU also is allowed to claim a rehabilitation credit of $10,000 for the remaining rehabilitated basis of $100,000 (the unadjusted depreciable basis (before reduction in basis for the rehabilitation credit) of $200,000 less the additional first year depreciation deduction of $100,000). Further, UU's depreciation deduction for 2004 for the remaining adjusted depreciable basis of $90,000 (the unadjusted depreciable basis (before reduction in basis for the rehabilitation credit) of $200,000 less the additional first year depreciation deduction of $100,000 less the rehabilitation credit of $10,000) is $1,059.30 (the remaining adjusted depreciable basis of $90,000 multiplied by the depreciation rate of .01177 for recovery year 1, placed in service in month 7).
(11)
Coordination with section 514(a)(3).
The additional first year depreciation deduction is not allowable for purposes of section 514(a)(3).
(g)
Effective date
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraphs (g)(2), (3), and (5) of this section, this section applies to qualified property under section 168(k)(2) acquired by a taxpayer after September 10, 2001, and to 50-percent bonus depreciation property under
section 168(k)(4) acquired by a taxpayer after May 5, 2003.
(2)
Technical termination of a partnership or section 168(i)(7) transactions.
If qualified property or 50 percent bonus depreciation property is transferred in a technical termination of a partnership under section 708(b)(1)(B) or in a transaction described in section 168(i)(7) for a taxable year ending on or before September 8, 2003, and the additional first year depreciation deduction allowable for the property was not determined in accordance with paragraph (f)(1)(ii) or (iii) of this section, as applicable, the Internal Revenue Service will allow any reasonable method of determining the additional first year depreciation deduction allowable for the property in the year of the transaction that is consistently applied to the property by all parties to the transaction.
(3)(i)
Like-kind exchanges and involuntary conversions.
If a taxpayer did not claim on a federal tax return for a taxable year ending on or before September 8, 2003, the additional first year depreciation deduction for the remaining carryover basis of qualified property or 50-percent bonus depreciation property acquired in a transaction described in section 1031(a), (b), or (c), or in a transaction to which section 1033 applies and the taxpayer did not make an election not to deduct the additional first year depreciation deduction for the class of property applicable to the remaining carryover basis, the Internal Revenue Service will treat the taxpayer's method of not claiming the additional first year depreciation deduction for the remaining carryover basis as a permissible method of accounting and will treat the amount of the additional first year depreciation deduction allowable for the remaining carryover basis as being equal to zero, provided the taxpayer does not claim the additional first year depreciation deduction for the remaining carryover basis in accordance with paragraph (g)(4)(ii) of this section.
(ii) Paragraphs (f)(5)(ii)(F)(
2
) and (f)(5)(v) of this section apply to a like-kind exchange or an involuntary conversion of MACRS property and computer software for which the time of disposition and the time of replacement both occur after February 27, 2004. For a like-kind exchange or an involuntary conversion of MACRS property for which the time of disposition, the time of replacement, or both occur on or before February 27, 2004, see § 1.168(i)-6(k)(2)(ii). For a like-kind exchange or involuntary conversion of computer software for which the time of disposition, the time of replacement, or both occur on or before February 27, 2004, a taxpayer may rely on prior guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service for determining the depreciation deductions of the acquired computer software and the exchanged or involuntarily converted computer software (for further guidance, see § 1.168(k)-1T(f)(5) published in the
Federal Register
on September 8, 2003 (68 FR 53000)). In relying on such guidance, a taxpayer may use any reasonable, consistent method of determining depreciation in the year of disposition and the year of replacement.
(4)
Change in method of accounting
—(i)
Special rules for 2000 or 2001 returns.
If a taxpayer did not claim on the Federal tax return for the taxable year that included September 11, 2001, any additional first year depreciation deduction for a class of property that is qualified property and did not make an election not to deduct the additional first year depreciation deduction for that class of property, the taxpayer should refer to the guidance provided by the Internal Revenue Service for the time and manner of claiming the additional first year depreciation deduction for the class of property (for further guidance,
see
section 4 of Rev. Proc. 2002-33 (2002-1 C.B. 963), Rev. Proc. 2003-50 (2003-29 I.R.B. 119), and § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(

Rehabilitation credit.
If a taxpayer did not claim on a Federal tax return for any taxable year ending on or before September 1, 2006, the rehabilitation credit provided by section 47(a) with respect to the portion of the basis of a qualified rehabilitated building that is attributable to qualified rehabilitation expenditures and the qualified rehabilitation expenditures are qualified property or 50-percent bonus depreciation property, and the taxpayer did not make the applicable election specified in paragraph (e)(1)(i) or (e)(1)(ii)(B) of this section for the class of property that includes the qualified rehabilitation expenditures, the taxpayer may claim the rehabilitation credit for the remaining rehabilitated basis (as defined in paragraph (f)(10)(i)(B) of this section) of the qualified rehabilitated building that is attributable to the qualified rehabilitation expenditures (assuming all the requirements of section 47 are met) in accordance with paragraph (f)(10)(i)(B) of this section by filing an amended Federal tax return for the taxable year for which the rehabilitation credit is to be claimed. The amended Federal tax return must include the adjustment to the tax liability for the rehabilitation credit and any collateral adjustments to taxable income or to the tax liability (for example, the amount of depreciation allowed or allowable in that taxable year for the qualified rehabilitated building). Such adjustments must also be made on amended Federal tax returns for any affected succeeding taxable years.

For example, an initial live staged performance does not include a preview of the production if the preview is primarily
to determine the need for further production activity; and
(iv)
Predecessor
includes—
(A) A transferor of an asset to a transferee in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies;
(B) A transferor of the asset to a transferee in a transaction in which the transferee's basis in the asset is determined, in whole or in part, by reference to the basis of the asset in the hands of the transferor;
(C) A partnership that is considered as continuing under section 708(b)(2) and § 1.708-1; or
(D) The decedent in the case of an asset acquired by the estate.
(b)
Qualified property
—(1)
In general.
Qualified property is depreciable property, as defined in § 1.168(b)-1(a)(1), that meets all the following requirements in the first taxable year in which the property is subject to depreciation by the taxpayer whether or not depreciation deductions for the property are allowable:
(i) The requirements in § 1.168(k)-2(b)(2) (description of qualified property);
(ii) The requirements in § 1.168(k)-2(b)(3) (original use or used property acquisition requirements);
(iii) The requirements in § 1.168(k)-2(b)(4) (placed-in-service date); and
(iv) The requirements in § 1.168(k)-2(b)(5) (acquisition of property).
(2)
Description of qualified property
—(i)
In general.
Depreciable property will meet the requirements of this paragraph (b)(2) if the property is—
(A) MACRS property, as defined in § 1.168(b)-1(a)(2), that has a recovery period of 20 years or less. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) and section 168(k)(2)(A)(i)(I), the recovery period is determined in accordance with section 168(c) regardless of any election made by the taxpayer under section 168(g)(7). This paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) includes the following MACRS property that is acquired by the taxpayer after September 27, 2017, and placed in service by the taxpayer after September 27, 2017, and before January 1, 2018:
(
1
) Qualified leasehold improvement property as defined in section 168(e)(6) as in effect on the day before amendment by section 13204(a)(1) of the Act;
(
2
) Qualified restaurant property, as defined in section 168(e)(7) as in effect on the day before amendment by section 13204(a)(1) of the Act, that is qualified improvement property as defined in § 1.168(b)-1(a)(5)(i)(C) and (a)(5)(ii); and
(
3
) Qualified retail improvement property as defined in section 168(e)(8) as in effect on the day before amendment by section 13204(a)(1) of the Act;
(B) Computer software as defined in, and depreciated under, section 167(f)(1) and § 1.167(a)-14;
(C) Water utility property as defined in section 168(e)(5) and depreciated under section 168;
(D) Qualified improvement property as defined in § 1.168(b)-1(a)(5)(i)(C) and (a)(5)(ii) and depreciated under section 168;
(E) A qualified film or television production, as defined in section 181(d) and § 1.181-3, for which a deduction would have been allowable under section 181 and §§ 1.181-1 through 1.181-6 without regard to section 181(a)(2) and (g), § 1.181-1(b)(1)(i) and (ii), and (b)(2)(i), or section 168(k). Only production costs of a qualified film or television production are allowable as a deduction under section 181 and §§ 1.181-1 through 1.181-6 without regard, for purposes of section 168(k), to section 181(a)(2) and (g), § 1.181-1(b)(1)(i) and (ii), and (b)(2)(i). The taxpayer that claims the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section for the production costs of a qualified film or television production must be the owner, as defined in § 1.181-1(a)(2), of the qualified film or television production. See § 1.181-1(a)(3) for the definition of production costs;
(F) A qualified live theatrical production, as defined in section 181(e), for which a deduction would have been allowable under section 181 and §§ 1.181-1 through 1.181-6 without regard to section 181(a)(2) and (g), § 1.181-1(b)(1)(i) and (ii), and (b)(2)(i), or section 168(k). Only production costs of a qualified live theatrical production are allowable as a deduction under section 181 and §§ 1.181-1 through 1.181-6 without regard, for purposes of section 168(k), to section 181(a)(2) and (g), § 1.181-1(b)(1)(i) and (ii), and (b)(2)(i). The taxpayer that claims the additional first
year depreciation deduction under this section for the production costs of a qualified live theatrical production must be the owner, as defined in § 1.181-1(a)(2), of the qualified live theatrical production. In applying § 1.181-1(a)(2)(ii) to a person that acquires a finished or partially-finished qualified live theatrical production, such person is treated as an owner of that production, but only if the production is acquired prior to its initial live staged performance. Rules similar to the rules in § 1.181-1(a)(3) for the definition of production costs of a qualified film or television production apply for defining production costs of a qualified live theatrical production; or
(G) A specified plant, as defined in section 168(k)(5)(B), for which the taxpayer has properly made an election to apply section 168(k)(5) for the taxable year in which the specified plant is planted, or grafted to a plant that has already been planted, by the taxpayer in the ordinary course of the taxpayer's farming business, as defined in section 263A(e)(4) (for further guidance, see paragraph (f) of this section).
(ii)
Property not eligible for additional first year depreciation deduction.
Depreciable property will not meet the requirements of this paragraph (b)(2) if the property is—
(A) Described in section 168(f) (for example, automobiles for which the taxpayer uses the optional business standard mileage rate);
(B) Required to be depreciated under the alternative depreciation system of section 168(g) pursuant to section 168(g)(1)(A), (B), (C), (D), (F), or (G), or other provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (for example, property described in section 263A(e)(2)(A) if the taxpayer or any related person, as defined in section 263A(e)(2)(B), has made an election under section 263A(d)(3), or property described in section 280F(b)(1)). If section 168(h)(6) applies to the property, only the tax-exempt entity's proportionate share of the property, as determined under section 168(h)(6), is treated as tax-exempt use property described in section 168(g)(1)(B) and in this paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B). This paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) does not apply to property for which the adjusted basis is required to be determined using the alternative depreciation system of section 168(g) pursuant to section 250(b)(2)(B) or 951A(d)(3), as applicable, or to property for which the adjusted basis is required to be determined using the alternative depreciation system of section 168(g) for allocating business interest expense between excepted and non-excepted trades or businesses under section 163(j), but only if the property is not required to be depreciated under the alternative depreciation system of section 168(g) pursuant to section 168(g)(1)(A), (B), (C), (D), (F), or (G), or other provisions of the Code, other than section 163(j), 250(b)(2)(B), or 951A(d)(3), as applicable;
(C) Included in any class of property for which the taxpayer elects not to deduct the additional first year depreciation (for further guidance, see paragraph (f) of this section);
(D) A specified plant that is placed in service by the taxpayer during the taxable year and for which the taxpayer made an election to apply section 168(k)(5) for a prior taxable year;
(E) Included in any class of property for which the taxpayer elects to apply section 168(k)(4). This paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(E) applies to property placed in service by the taxpayer in any taxable year beginning before January 1, 2018;
(F) Primarily used in a trade or business described in section 163(j)(7)(A)(iv) and §§ 1.163(j)-1(b)(15)(i) and 1.163(j)-10(c)(3)(iii)(C)(
3
), and placed in service by the taxpayer in any taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017. For purposes of section 168(k)(9)(A) and this paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(F), the term
primarily used
has the same meaning as that term is used in § 1.167(a)-11(b)(4)(iii)(
b
) and (e)(3)(iii) for classifying property. This paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(F) does not apply to property that is leased to a lessee's trade or business described in section 163(j)(7)(A)(iv) and §§ 1.163(j)-1(b)(15)(i) and 1.163(j)-10(c)(3)(iii)(C)(
3
), by a lessor's trade or business that is not described in section 163(j)(7)(A)(iv) and §§ 1.163(j)-1(b)(15)(i) and 1.163(j)-10(c)(3)(iii)(C)(
3
) for the taxable year; or
(G) Used in a trade or business that has had floor plan financing indebtedness, as defined in section 163(j)(9)(B) and § 1.163(j)-1(b)(18), if the floor plan financing interest expense, as defined in section 163(j)(9)(A) and § 1.163(j)-1(b)(19), related to such indebtedness is taken into account under section 163(j)(1)(C) for the taxable year. Such property also must be placed in service by the taxpayer in any taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017. Solely for purposes of section 168(k)(9)(B) and this paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(G), floor plan financing interest expense is taken into account for the taxable year by a trade or business that has had floor plan financing indebtedness only if the business interest expense, as defined in section 163(j)(5) and § 1.163(j)-1(b)(3), of the trade or business for the taxable year (which includes floor plan financing interest expense) exceeds the sum of the amounts calculated under section 163(j)(1)(A) and (B) for the trade or business for the taxable year. If the trade or business has taken floor plan financing interest expense into account pursuant to this paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(G) for a taxable year, this paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(G) applies to any property placed in service by that trade or business in that taxable year. This paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(G) does not apply to property that is leased to a lessee's trade or business that has had floor plan financing indebtedness, by a lessor's trade or business that has not had floor plan financing indebtedness during the taxable year or that has had floor plan financing indebtedness but did not take into account floor plan financing interest expense for the taxable year pursuant to this paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(G).
(iii)
Examples.
The application of this paragraph (b)(2) is illustrated by the following examples. Unless the facts specifically indicate otherwise, assume that the parties are not related within the meaning of section 179(d)(2)(A) or (B) and § 1.179-4(c), and are not described in section 163(j)(3):
(A)
Example 1.
On February 8, 2018,
A
finishes the production of a qualified film, as defined in § 1.181-3. On June 4, 2018,
B
acquires this finished production from
A.
The initial release or broadcast, as defined in § 1.181-1(a)(7), of this qualified film is on July 28, 2018. Because
B
acquired the qualified film before its initial release or broadcast,
B
is treated as the owner of the qualified film for purposes of section 181 and § 1.181-1(a)(2). Assuming all other requirements of this section are met and all requirements of section 181 and §§ 1.181-1 through 1.181-6, other than section 181(a)(2) and (g), and § 1.181-1(b)(1)(i) and (ii), and (b)(2)(i), are met,
B'
s acquisition cost of the qualified film qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section.
(B)
Example 2.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1
of paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(A) of this section, except that
B
acquires a limited license or right to release the qualified film in Europe. As a result,
B
is not treated as the owner of the qualified film pursuant to § 1.181-1(a)(2). Accordingly, paragraph (b)(2)(i)(E) of this section is not satisfied, and
B'
s acquisition cost of the license or right does not qualify for the additional first year depreciation deduction.
(C)
Example 3. C
owns a film library. All of the films in this film library are completed and have been released or broadcasted. In 2018,
D
buys this film library from
C
. Because
D
acquired the films after their initial release or broadcast,
D'
s acquisition cost of the film library does not qualify for a deduction under section 181. As a result, paragraph (b)(2)(i)(E) of this section is not satisfied, and
D'
s acquisition cost of the film library does not qualify for the additional first year depreciation deduction.
(D)
Example 4.
During 2019, E Corporation, a domestic corporation, acquired new equipment for use in its manufacturing trade or business in Mexico. To determine its qualified business asset investment for purposes of section 250, E Corporation must determine the adjusted basis of the new equipment using the alternative depreciation system of section 168(g) pursuant to sections 250(b)(2)(B) and 951A(d)(3). E Corporation also is required to depreciate the new equipment under the alternative depreciation system of section 168(g) pursuant to section 168(g)(1)(A). As a result, the new equipment does not qualify for the additional first year
depreciation deduction pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this section.
(E)
Example 5.
The facts are the same as in
Example 4
of paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(D) of this section, except E Corporation acquired the new equipment for use in its manufacturing trade or business in California. The new equipment is not described in section 168(g)(1)(A), (B), (C), (D), (F), or (G). No other provision of the Internal Revenue Code, other than section 250(b)(2)(B) or 951A(d)(3), requires the new equipment to be depreciated using the alternative depreciation system of section 168(g). To determine its qualified business asset investment for purposes of section 250, E Corporation must determine the adjusted basis of the new equipment using the alternative depreciation system of section 168(g) pursuant to sections 250(b)(2)(B) and 951A(d)(3). Because E Corporation is not required to depreciate the new equipment under the alternative depreciation system of section 168(g), paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this section does not apply to this new equipment. Assuming all other requirements are met, the new equipment qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section.
(F)
Example 6.
In 2019, a financial institution buys new equipment for $1 million and then leases this equipment to a lessee that primarily uses the equipment in a trade or business described in section 163(j)(7)(A)(iv) and §§ 1.163(j)-1(b)(15)(i) and 1.163(j)-10(c)(3)(iii)(C)(
3
). The financial institution is not described in section 163(j)(7)(A)(iv) and §§ 1.163(j)-1(b)(15)(i) and § 1.163(j)-10(c)(3)(iii)(C)(
3
). As a result, paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(F) of this section does not apply to this new equipment. Assuming all other requirements are met, the financial institution's purchase price of $1 million for the new equipment qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section.
(G)
Example 7.
During its taxable year beginning in 2020,
F,
a corporation that is an automobile dealer, buys new computers for $50,000 for use in its trade or business of selling automobiles. For purposes of section 163(j),
F
has the following for 2020: $700 of adjusted taxable income, $40 of business interest income, $400 of business interest expense (which includes $100 of floor plan financing interest expense). The sum of the amounts calculated under section 163(j)(1)(A) and (B) for
F
for 2020 is $390 ($40 + ($700 × 50 percent)).
F'
s business interest expense, which includes floor plan financing interest expense, for 2020 is $400. As a result,
F'
s floor plan financing interest expense is taken into account by
F
for 2020 pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(G) of this section. Accordingly,
F'
s purchase price of $50,000 for the computers does not qualify for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section.
(H)
Example 8.
The facts are the same as in
Example 7
in paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(G) of this section, except
F
buys new computers for $30,000 for use in its trade or business of selling automobiles and, for purposes of section 163(j),
F
has $1,300 of adjusted taxable income. The sum of the amounts calculated under section 163(j)(1)(A) and (B) for
F
for 2020 is $690 ($40 + ($1,300 × 50 percent)).
F'
s business interest expense, which includes floor plan financing interest expense, for 2020 is $400. As a result,
F'
s floor plan financing interest expense is not taken into account by
F
for 2020 pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(G) of this section. Assuming all other requirements are met,
F'
s purchase price of $30,000 for the computers qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section.
(I)
Example 9.
(
1
)
G,
a calendar-year taxpayer, owns an office building for use in its trade or business and
G
placed in service such building in 2000. In November 2018,
G
made and placed in service an improvement to the inside of such building at a cost of $100,000. In January 2019,
G
entered into a written contract with
H
for
H
to construct an improvement to the inside of the building. In March 2019,
H
completed construction of the improvement at a cost of $750,000 and
G
placed in service such improvement. Both improvements to the building are section 1250 property and are not described in § 1.168(b)-1(a)(5)(ii).
(
2
) Both the improvement to the office building made by
G
in November 2018 and the improvement to the office building that was constructed by
H
for
G
in 2019 are improvements made by
G
under § 1.168(b)-1(a)(5)(i)(A). Further, each improvement is made to the inside of the office building, is section 1250 property, and is not described in § 1.168(b)-1(a)(5)(ii). As a result, each improvement meets the definition of qualified improvement property in section 168(e)(6) and § 1.168(b)-1(a)(5)(i)(A) and (a)(5)(ii). Accordingly, each improvement is 15-year property under section 168(e)(3) and is described in § 1.168(k)-2(b)(2)(i)(A). Assuming all other requirements of this section are met, each improvement made by
G
qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction for
G
under this section.
(3)
Original use or used property acquisition requirements
—(i)
In general.
Depreciable property will meet the requirements of this paragraph (b)(3) if the property meets the original use requirements in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section or if the property meets the used property acquisition requirements in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section.
(ii)
Original use
—(A)
In general.
Depreciable property will meet the requirements of this paragraph (b)(3)(ii) if the original use of the property commences with the taxpayer. Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(3)(ii)(B) and (C) of this section, original use means the first use to which the property is put, whether or not that use corresponds to the use of the property by the taxpayer. Additional capital expenditures paid or incurred by a taxpayer to recondition or rebuild property acquired or owned by the taxpayer satisfy the original use requirement. However, the cost of reconditioned or rebuilt property does not satisfy the original use requirement (but may satisfy the used property acquisition requirements in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section). The question of whether property is reconditioned or rebuilt property is a question of fact. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A), property that contains used parts will not be treated as reconditioned or rebuilt if the cost of the used parts is not more than 20 percent of the total cost of the property, whether acquired or self-constructed.
(B)
Conversion to business or income-producing use
—(
1
)
Personal use to business or income-producing use.
If a taxpayer initially acquires new property for personal use and subsequently uses the property in the taxpayer's trade or business or for the taxpayer's production of income, the taxpayer is considered the original user of the property. If a person initially acquires new property for personal use and a taxpayer subsequently acquires the property from the person for use in the taxpayer's trade or business or for the taxpayer's production of income, the taxpayer is not considered the original user of the property.
(
2
)
Inventory to business or income-producing use.
If a taxpayer initially acquires new property and holds the property primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of the taxpayer's business and subsequently withdraws the property from inventory and uses the property primarily in the taxpayer's trade or business or primarily for the taxpayer's production of income, the taxpayer is considered the original user of the property. If a person initially acquires new property and holds the property primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of the person's business and a taxpayer subsequently acquires the property from the person for use primarily in the taxpayer's trade or business or primarily for the taxpayer's production of income, the taxpayer is considered the original user of the property. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(B)(
2
), the original use of the property by the taxpayer commences on the date on which the taxpayer uses the property primarily in the taxpayer's trade or business or primarily for the taxpayer's production of income.
(C)
Fractional interests in property.
If, in the ordinary course of its business, a taxpayer sells fractional interests in new property to third parties unrelated to the taxpayer, each first fractional owner of the property is considered as the original user of its proportionate share of the property. Furthermore, if the taxpayer uses the property before all of the fractional interests of the property are sold but the property continues to be held primarily for sale by the taxpayer, the original use of any
fractional interest sold to a third party unrelated to the taxpayer subsequent to the taxpayer's use of the property begins with the first purchaser of that fractional interest. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(C), persons are not related if they do not have a relationship described in section 267(b) and § 1.267(b)-1, or section 707(b) and § 1.707-1.
(iii)
Used property acquisition requirements
—(A)
In general.
Depreciable property will meet the requirements of this paragraph (b)(3)(iii) if the acquisition of the used property meets the following requirements:
(
1
) Such property was not used by the taxpayer or a predecessor at any time prior to such acquisition;
(
2
) The acquisition of such property meets the requirements of section 179(d)(2)(A), (B), and (C), and § 1.179-4(c)(1)(ii), (iii), and (iv); or § 1.179-4(c)(2) (property is acquired by purchase); and
(
3
) The acquisition of such property meets the requirements of section 179(d)(3) and § 1.179-4(d) (cost of property) (for further guidance regarding like-kind exchanges and involuntary conversions, see paragraph (g)(5) of this section).
(B)
Property was not used by the taxpayer at any time prior to acquisition
—(
1
)
In general.
Solely for purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A)(
1
) of this section, the property is treated as used by the taxpayer or a predecessor at any time prior to acquisition by the taxpayer or predecessor if the taxpayer or the predecessor had a depreciable interest in the property at any time prior to such acquisition, whether or not the taxpayer or the predecessor claimed depreciation deductions for the property. To determine if the taxpayer or a predecessor had a depreciable interest in the property at any time prior to the acquisition, only the five calendar years immediately prior to the current calendar year in which the property is placed in service by the taxpayer, and the portion of such current calendar year before the placed-in-service date of the property without taking into account the applicable convention, are taken into account (lookback period). If either the taxpayer or a predecessor, or both, have not been in existence for the entire lookback period, only the portion of the lookback period during which the taxpayer or a predecessor, or both, as applicable, have been in existence is taken into account to determine if the taxpayer or a predecessor had a depreciable interest in the property at any time prior to the acquisition. If a lessee has a depreciable interest in the improvements made to leased property and subsequently the lessee acquires the leased property of which the improvements are a part, the unadjusted depreciable basis, as defined in § 1.168(b)-1(a)(3), of the acquired property that is eligible for the additional first year depreciation deduction, assuming all other requirements are met, must not include the unadjusted depreciable basis attributable to the improvements.
(
2
)
Taxpayer has a depreciable interest in a portion of the property.
If a taxpayer initially acquires a depreciable interest in a portion of the property and subsequently acquires a depreciable interest in an additional portion of the same property, such additional depreciable interest is not treated as used by the taxpayer at any time prior to its acquisition by the taxpayer under paragraphs (b)(3)(iii)(A)(
1
) and (b)(3)(iii)(B)(
1
) of this section. This paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B)(
2
) does not apply if the taxpayer or a predecessor previously had a depreciable interest in the subsequently acquired additional portion. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B)(
2
), a portion of the property is considered to be the percentage interest in the property. If a taxpayer holds a depreciable interest in a portion of the property, sells that portion or a part of that portion, and subsequently acquires a depreciable interest in another portion of the same property, the taxpayer will be treated as previously having a depreciable interest in the property up to the amount of the portion for which the taxpayer held a depreciable interest in the property before the sale.
(
3
)
Substantial renovation of property.
If a taxpayer acquires and places in service substantially renovated property and the taxpayer or a predecessor previously had a depreciable interest in the property before it was substantially renovated, the taxpayer's or predecessor's depreciable interest in
the property before it was substantially renovated is not taken into account for determining whether the substantially renovated property was used by the taxpayer or a predecessor at any time prior to its acquisition by the taxpayer under paragraphs (b)(3)(iii)(A)(
1
) and (b)(3)(iii)(B)(
1
) of this section. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B)(
3
), property is substantially renovated if the cost of the used parts is not more than 20 percent of the total cost of the substantially renovated property, whether acquired or self-constructed.
(
4
)
De minimis use of property.
If a taxpayer acquires and places in service property, the taxpayer or a predecessor did not previously have a depreciable interest in the property, the taxpayer disposes of the property to an unrelated party within 90 calendar days after the date the property was originally placed in service by the taxpayer, without taking into account the applicable convention, and the taxpayer reacquires and again places in service the property, then the taxpayer's depreciable interest in the property during that 90-day period is not taken into account for determining whether the property was used by the taxpayer or a predecessor at any time prior to its reacquisition by the taxpayer under paragraphs (b)(3)(iii)(A)(
1
) and (b)(3)(iii)(B)(
1
) of this section. If the taxpayer originally acquired the property before September 28, 2017, as determined under § 1.168(k)-1(b)(4), and the taxpayer reacquires and again places in service the property during the same taxable year the taxpayer disposed of the property to the unrelated party, then this paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B)(
4
) does not apply. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B)(
4
), an
unrelated party
is a person not described in section 179(d)(2)(A) or (B), and § 1.179-4(c)(1)(ii) or (iii) or (c)(2).
(C)
Special rules for a series of related transactions
—(
1
)
In general.
Solely for purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section, each transferee in a series of related transactions tests its relationship under section 179(d)(2)(A) or (B) with the transferor from which the transferee directly acquires the depreciable property (immediate transferor) and with the original transferor of the depreciable property in the series. The transferee is treated as related to the immediate transferor or the original transferor if the relationship exists either when the transferee acquires, or immediately before the first transfer of, the depreciable property in the series. A series of related transactions may include, for example, a transfer of partnership assets followed by a transfer of an interest in the partnership that owned the assets; or a disposition of property and a disposition, directly or indirectly, of the transferor or transferee of the property. For special rules that may apply when the transferor and transferee of the property are members of a consolidated group, as defined in § 1.1502-1(h), see § 1.1502-68.

Special rules
—(
i
)
Property placed in service and disposed of in same taxable year or property not placed in service.
Any party in a series of related transactions that is neither the original transferor nor the ultimate transferee is disregarded (disregarded party) for purposes of testing the relationships under paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(C)(
1
) of this section if the party places in service and disposes of the depreciable property subject to the series, other than in a transaction described in paragraph (g)(1)(iii) of this section, during the party's same taxable year, or if the party does not place in service the depreciable property subject to the series for use in the party's trade or business or production of income. In either case, the party to which the disregarded party disposed of the depreciable property tests its relationship with the party from which the disregarded party acquired the depreciable property and with the original transferor of the depreciable property in the series. If the series has consecutive disregarded parties, the party to which the last disregarded party disposed of the depreciable property tests its relationship with the party from which the first disregarded party acquired the depreciable property and with the original transferor of the depreciable property in the series. The rules for testing the relationships in paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(C)(
1
) of this section continue to apply for the other transactions in the series.
(
ii
)
All section 168(i)(7) transactions.
This paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(C) does not apply if all transactions in a series of related transactions are described in paragraph (g)(1)(iii) of this section (section 168(i)(7) transactions in which property is transferred in the same taxable year that the property is placed in service by the transferor).
(
iii
)
One or more section 168(i)(7) transactions.
Any step in a series of related transactions that is neither the original step nor the ultimate step is disregarded (disregarded step) for purposes of testing the relationships under paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(C)(
1
) of this section if the step is a transaction described in paragraph (g)(1)(iii) of this section. In this case, the relationship is not tested between the transferor and transferee of that transaction. Instead, the relationship is tested between the transferor in the disregarded step and the party to which the transferee in the disregarded step disposed of the depreciable property, the transferee in the disregarded step and the party to which the transferee in the disregarded step disposed of the depreciable property, and the original transferor of the depreciable property in the series and the party to which the transferee in the disregarded step disposed of the depreciable property. If the series has consecutive disregarded steps, the relationship is tested between the transferor in the first disregarded step and the party to which the transferee in the last disregarded step disposed of the depreciable property, the transferee in the last disregarded step and the party to which the transferee in the last disregarded step disposed of the depreciable property, and the original transferor of the depreciable property in the series and the party to which the transferee in the last disregarded step disposed of the depreciable property. The rules for testing the relationships in paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(C)(
1
) of this section continue to apply for the other transactions in the series.
(
iv
)
Syndication transaction.
This paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(C) does not apply to a syndication transaction described in paragraph (b)(3)(vi) of this section.
(
v
)
Certain relationships disregarded.
If a party acquires depreciable property in a series of related transactions in which the party acquires stock, meeting the requirements of section 1504(a)(2), of a corporation in a fully taxable transaction followed by a liquidation of the acquired corporation under section 331, any relationship created as part of such series of related transactions is disregarded in determining whether any party is related to such acquired corporation for purposes of testing the relationships under paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(C)(
1
) of this section.
(
vi
)
Transferors that cease to exist for Federal tax purposes.
Any transferor in a series of related transactions that ceases to exist for Federal tax purposes during the series is deemed, for purposes of testing the relationships under paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(C)(
1
) of this section, to be in existence at the time of any transfer in the series.
(
vii
)
Newly created party.
If a transferee in a series of related transactions acquires depreciable property from a transferor that was not in existence immediately prior to the first transfer of such property in such series (new transferor), the transferee tests its relationship with the party from which the new transferor acquired such property and with the original transferor of the depreciable property in the series for purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(C)(
1
) of this section. If the series has consecutive new transferors, the party to which the last new transferor disposed of the depreciable property tests its relationship with the party from which the first new transferor acquired the depreciable property and with the original transferor of the depreciable property in the series. The rules for testing the relationships in paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(C)(
1
) of this section continue to apply for the other transactions in the series.
(
viii
)
Application of paragraph (g)(1) of this section.
Paragraph (g)(1) of this section applies to each step in a series of related transactions.
(iv)
Application to partnerships
—(A)
Section 704(c) remedial allocations.
Remedial allocations under section 704(c) do not satisfy the requirements of paragraph (b)(3) of this section. See § 1.704-3(d)(2).
(B)
Basis determined under section 732.
Any basis of distributed property determined under section 732 does not satisfy the requirements of paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
(C)
Section 734(b) adjustments.
Any increase in basis of depreciable property under section 734(b) does not satisfy the requirements of paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
(D)
Section 743(b) adjustments
—(
1
)
In general.
For purposes of determining whether the transfer of a partnership interest meets the requirements of paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, each partner is treated as having a depreciable interest in the partner's proportionate share of partnership property. Any increase in basis of depreciable property under section 743(b) satisfies the requirements of paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this section if—
(
i
) At any time prior to the transfer of the partnership interest that gave rise to such basis increase, neither the transferee partner nor a predecessor of the transferee partner had any depreciable interest in the portion of the property deemed acquired to which the section 743(b) adjustment is allocated under section 755 and § 1.755-1; and
(
ii
) The transfer of the partnership interest that gave rise to such basis increase satisfies the requirements of paragraphs (b)(3)(iii)(A)(
2
) and (
3
) of this section.
(
2
)
Relatedness tested at partner level.
Solely for purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(iv)(D)(
1
)(
ii
) of this section, whether the parties are related or unrelated is determined by comparing the transferor and the transferee of the transferred partnership interest.
(v)
Application to members of a consolidated group.
For rules applicable to the acquisition of depreciable property by a member of a consolidated group, see § 1.1502-68.
(vi)
Syndication transaction.
If new property is acquired and placed in service by a lessor, or if used property is acquired and placed in service by a lessor and the lessor or a predecessor did not previously have a depreciable interest in the used property, and the property is sold by the lessor or any subsequent purchaser within three months after the date the property was originally placed in service by the lessor (or, in the case of multiple units of property subject to the same lease, within three months after the date the final unit is placed in service, so long as the period between the time the first unit is placed in service and the time the last unit is placed in service does not exceed 12 months), and the user of the property after the last sale during the three-month period remains the same as when the property was originally placed in service by the lessor, the purchaser of the property in the last sale during the three-month period is considered the taxpayer that acquired the property for purposes of applying paragraphs (b)(3)(ii) and (iii) of this section. The purchaser of the property in the last sale during the three-month period is treated, for purposes of applying paragraph (b)(3) of this section, as—
(A) The original user of the property in this transaction if the lessor acquired and placed in service new property; or
(B) The taxpayer having the depreciable interest in the property in this transaction if the lessor acquired and placed in service used property.
(vii)
Examples.
The application of this paragraph (b)(3) is illustrated by the following examples. Unless the facts specifically indicate otherwise, assume that the parties are not related within the meaning of section 179(d)(2)(A) or (B) and § 1.179-4(c), no corporation is a member of a consolidated or controlled group, and the parties do not have predecessors:
(A)
Example 1.
(
1
) On August 1, 2018,
A
buys a new machine for $35,000 from an unrelated party for use in
A'
s trade or business. On July 1, 2020,
B
buys that machine from
A
for $20,000 for use in
B'
s trade or business. On October 1, 2020,
B
makes a $5,000 capital expenditure to recondition the machine.
B
did not have any depreciable interest in the machine before
B
acquired it on July 1, 2020.
(
2
)
A'
s purchase price of $35,000 satisfies the original use requirement of paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section and, assuming all other requirements are met, qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section.
(
3
)
B'
s purchase price of $20,000 does not satisfy the original use requirement of paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, but it does satisfy the used property acquisition requirements of paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section. Assuming all other requirements are met, the $20,000 purchase price qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section. Further,
B'
s $5,000 expenditure satisfies the original use requirement of paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section and, assuming all other requirements are met, qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section, regardless of whether the $5,000 is added to the basis of the machine or is capitalized as a separate asset.
(B)
Example 2. C,
an automobile dealer, uses some of its automobiles as demonstrators in order to show them to prospective customers. The automobiles that are used as demonstrators by
C
are held by
C
primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of its business. On November 1, 2017,
D
buys from
C
an automobile that was previously used as a demonstrator by
C. D
will use the automobile solely for business purposes. The use of the automobile by
C
as a demonstrator does not constitute a “use” for purposes of the original use requirement and, therefore,
D
will be considered the original user of the automobile for purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section. Assuming all other requirements are met,
D'
s purchase price of the automobile qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction for
D
under this section, subject to any limitation under section 280F.
(C)
Example 3.
On April 1, 2015,
E
acquires a horse to be used in
E'
s thoroughbred racing business. On October 1, 2018,
F
buys the horse from
E
and will use the horse in
F'
s horse breeding business.
F
did not have any depreciable interest in the horse before
F
acquired it on October 1, 2018. The use of the horse by
E
in its racing business prevents
F
from satisfying the original use requirement of paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section. However,
F'
s acquisition of the horse satisfies the used property acquisition requirements of paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section. Assuming all other requirements are met,
F'
s purchase price of the horse qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction for
F
under this section.
(D)
Example 4.
In the ordinary course of its business,
G
sells fractional interests in its aircraft to unrelated parties.
G
holds out for sale eight equal fractional interests in an aircraft. On October 1, 2017,
G
sells five of the eight fractional interests in the aircraft to
H
and
H
begins to use its proportionate share of the aircraft immediately upon purchase. On February 1, 2018,
G
sells to
I
the remaining unsold
3/8
fractional interests in the aircraft.
H
is considered the original user as to its
5/8
fractional interest in the aircraft and
I
is considered the original user as to its
3/8
fractional interest in the aircraft. Thus, assuming all other requirements are met,
H'
s purchase price for its
5/8
fractional interest in the aircraft qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section and
I'
s purchase price for its
3/8
fractional interest in the aircraft qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section.
(E)
Example 5.
On September 1, 2017,
J,
an equipment dealer, buys new tractors that are held by
J
primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of its business. On October 15, 2017,
J
withdraws the tractors from inventory and begins to use the tractors primarily for producing rental income. The holding of the tractors by
J
as inventory does not constitute a “use” for purposes of the original use requirement and, therefore, the original use of the tractors commences with
J
on October 15, 2017, for purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section. However, the tractors are not eligible for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section because
J
acquired the tractors before September 28, 2017.
(F)
Example 6. K
is in the trade or business of leasing equipment to others. During 2016,
K
buys a new machine (Machine #1) and then leases it to
L
for use in
L'
s trade or business. The lease between
K
and
L
for Machine #1 is a true lease for Federal income tax purposes. During 2018,
L
enters into a written binding contract with
K
to buy Machine #1 at its fair market value on May 15, 2018.
L
did not have any depreciable interest in Machine #1 before
L
acquired it on May 15, 2018. As a result,
L'
s acquisition of Machine #1 satisfies the used property acquisition requirements of paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section. Assuming all other requirements are met,
L'
s purchase price of Machine #1 qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction for
L
under this section.
(G)
Example 7.
The facts are the same as in
Example 6
of paragraph (b)(3)(vii)(F) of this section, except that
K
and
L
are related parties within the meaning of section 179(d)(2)(A) or (B) and § 1.179-4(c). As a result,
L'
s acquisition of Machine #1 does not satisfy the used property acquisition requirements of paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section. Thus, Machine #1 is not eligible for the additional first year depreciation deduction for
L.
(H)
Example 8.
The facts are the same as in
Example 6
of paragraph (b)(3)(vii)(F) of this section, except
L
incurred capital expenditures of $5,000 to improve Machine #1 on September 5, 2017, and has a depreciable interest in such improvements.
L'
s purchase price of $5,000 for the improvements to Machine #1 satisfies the original use requirement of § 1.168(k)-1(b)(3)(i) and, assuming all other requirements are met, qualifies for the 50-percent additional first year depreciation deduction. Because
L
had a depreciable interest only in the improvements to Machine #1,
L'
s acquisition of Machine #1, excluding
L'
s improvements to such machine, satisfies the used property acquisition requirements of paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section. Assuming all other requirements are met,
L'
s unadjusted depreciable basis of Machine #1, excluding the amount of such unadjusted depreciable basis attributable to
L'
s improvements to Machine #1, qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction for
L
under this section.
(I)
Example 9.
During 2016,
M
and
N
purchased used equipment for use in their trades or businesses and each own a 50 percent interest in such equipment. Prior to this acquisition,
M
and
N
did not have any depreciable interest in the equipment. Assume this ownership arrangement is not a partnership. During 2018,
N
enters into a written binding contract with
M
to buy
M'
s interest in the equipment. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B)(
2
) of this section,
N
is not treated as using
M'
s interest in the equipment prior to
N'
s acquisition of
M'
s interest. As a result,
N'
s acquisition of
M'
s interest in the equipment satisfies the used property acquisition requirements of paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section. Assuming all other requirements are met,
N'
s purchase price of
M'
s interest in the equipment qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction for
N
under this section.
(J)
Example 10.
The facts are the same as in
Example 9
of paragraph (b)(3)(vii)(I) of this section, except
N
had a 100-percent depreciable interest in the equipment during 2011 through 2015, and
M
purchased from
N
a 50-percent interest in the equipment during 2016. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B)(
1
) of this section, the lookback period is 2013 through 2017 to determine if
N
had a depreciable interest in
M'
s 50-percent interest in the equipment
N
acquired from
M
in 2018. Because
N
had a 100-percent depreciable interest in the equipment during 2013 through 2015,
N
had a depreciable interest in
M'
s 50-percent interest in the equipment during the lookback period. As a result,
N'
s acquisition of
M'
s interest in the equipment during 2018 does not satisfy the used property acquisition requirements of paragraphs (b)(3)(iii)(A)(
1
) and (b)(3)(iii)(B)(
1
) of this section. Paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B)(
2
) of this section does not apply because
N
initially acquired a 100-percent depreciable interest in the equipment. Accordingly,
N'
s purchase price of
M'
s interest in the equipment during 2018 does not qualify for the additional first year depreciation deduction for
N.
(K)
Example 11.
The facts are the same as in
Example 9
of paragraph (b)(3)(vii)(I) of this section, except
N
had a 100-percent depreciable interest in the equipment only during 2011, and
M
purchased from
N
a 50-percent interest in the equipment during 2012. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B)(
1
) of this section, the lookback period is 2013 through 2017 to determine if
N
had a depreciable interest in
M'
s 50-percent interest in the equipment
N
acquired from
M
in 2018. Because
N
had a depreciable interest in only its 50-percent interest in the equipment during this
lookback period,
N'
s acquisition of
M'
s interest in the equipment during 2018 satisfies the used property acquisition requirements of paragraphs (b)(3)(iii)(A)(
1
) and (b)(3)(iii)(B)(
1
) of this section. Assuming all other requirements are met,
N'
s purchase price of
M'
s interest in the equipment during 2018 qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction for
N
under this section.
(L)
Example 12.
The facts are the same as in
Example 9
of paragraph (b)(3)(vii)(I) of this section, except during 2018,
M
also enters into a written binding contract with
N
to buy
N'
s interest in the equipment. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B)(
2
) of this section, both
M
and
N
are treated as previously having a depreciable interest in a 50-percent portion of the equipment. Accordingly, the acquisition by
M
of
N'
s 50-percent interest and the acquisition by
N
of
M'
s 50-percent interest in the equipment during 2018 do not qualify for the additional first year depreciation deduction.
(M)
Example 13. O
and
P
form an equal partnership,
OP,
in 2018.
O
contributes cash to
OP,
and
P
contributes equipment to
OP. OP'
s basis in the equipment contributed by
P
is determined under section 723. Because
OP'
s basis in such equipment is determined in whole or in part by reference to
P'
s adjusted basis in such equipment,
OP'
s acquisition of such equipment does not satisfy section 179(d)(2)(C) and § 1.179-4(c)(1)(iv) and, thus, does not satisfy the used property acquisition requirements of paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section. Accordingly,
OP'
s acquisition of such equipment is not eligible for the additional first year depreciation deduction.
(N)
Example 14. Q,
R,
and
S
form an equal partnership,
QRS,
in 2019. Each partner contributes $100, which
QRS
uses to purchase a retail motor fuels outlet for $300. Assume this retail motor fuels outlet is
QRS'
only property and is qualified property under section 168(k)(2)(A)(i).
QRS
makes an election not to deduct the additional first year depreciation for all qualified property placed in service during 2019.
QRS
has a section 754 election in effect.
QRS
claimed depreciation of $15 for the retail motor fuels outlet for 2019. During 2020, when the retail motor fuels outlet's fair market value is $600,
Q
sells all of its partnership interest to
T
in a fully taxable transaction for $200.
T
never previously had a depreciable interest in the retail motor fuels outlet.
T
takes an outside basis of $200 in the partnership interest previously owned by
Q. T'
s share of the partnership's previously taxed capital is $95. Accordingly,
T'
s section 743(b) adjustment is $105 and is allocated entirely to the retail motor fuels outlet under section 755. Assuming all other requirements are met,
T'
s section 743(b) adjustment qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section.
(O)
Example 15.
The facts are the same as in
Example 14
of paragraph (b)(3)(vii)(N) of this section, except that
Q
sells his partnership interest to
U,
a related person within the meaning of section 179(d)(2)(A) or (B) and § 1.179-4(c).
U'
s section 743(b) adjustment does not qualify for the additional first year depreciation deduction.
(P)
Example 16.
The facts are the same as in
Example 14
of paragraph (b)(3)(vii)(N) of this section, except that
Q
dies and his partnership interest is transferred to
V. V
takes a basis in
Q'
s partnership interest under section 1014. As a result, section 179(d)(2)(C)(ii) and § 1.179-4(c)(1)(iv) are not satisfied, and
V'
s section 743(b) adjustment does not qualify for the additional first year depreciation deduction.
(Q)
Example 17.
The facts are the same as in
Example 14
of paragraph (b)(3)(vii)(N) of this section, except that
QRS
purchased the retail motor fuels outlet from
T
prior to
T
purchasing
Q'
s partnership interest in
QRS. T
had a depreciable interest in such retail motor fuels outlet. Because
T
had a depreciable interest in the retail motor fuels outlet before
T
acquired its interest in
QRS, T'
s section 743(b) adjustment does not qualify for the additional first year depreciation deduction.
(R)
Example 18.

)
W,
a freight transportation company, acquires and places in service a used aircraft during 2019 (Airplane #1). Prior to this acquisition,
W
never had a depreciable interest in this aircraft. During September 2020,
W
enters into a written binding contract
with a third party to renovate Airplane #1. The third party begins to renovate Airplane #1 in October 2020 and delivers the renovated aircraft (Airplane #2) to
W
in February 2021. To renovate Airplane #1, the third party used mostly new parts but also used parts from Airplane #1. The cost of the used parts is not more than 20 percent of the total cost of the renovated airplane, Airplane #2.
W
uses Airplane #2 in its trade or business.
(
2
) Although Airplane #2 contains used parts, the cost of the used parts is not more than 20 percent of the total cost of Airplane #2. As a result, Airplane #2 is not treated as reconditioned or rebuilt property, and
W
is considered the original user of Airplane #2, pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A) of this section. Accordingly, assuming all other requirements are met, the amount paid or incurred by
W
for Airplane #2 qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction for
W
under this section.
(S)
Example 19.
(

)
X,
a freight transportation company, acquires and places in service a new aircraft in 2019 (Airplane #1). During 2022,
X
sells Airplane #1 to
AB
and
AB
uses Airplane #1 in its trade or business. Prior to this acquisition,
AB
never had a depreciable interest in Airplane #1. During January 2023,
AB
enters into a written binding contract with a third party to renovate Airplane #1. The third party begins to renovate Airplane #1 in February 2023 and delivers the renovated aircraft (Airplane #2) to
AB
in June 2023. To renovate Airplane #1, the third party used mostly new parts but also used parts from Airplane #1. The cost of the used parts is not more than 20 percent of the total cost of the renovated airplane, Airplane #2.
AB
uses Airplane #2 in its trade or business. During 2025,
AB
sells Airplane #2 to
X
and
X
uses Airplane #2 in its trade or business.
(
2
) With respect to
X'
s purchase of Airplane #1 in 2019,
X
is the original user of this airplane pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A) of this section. Accordingly, assuming all other requirements are met,
X'
s purchase price for Airplane #1 qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction for
X
under this section.
(
3
) Because
AB
never had a depreciable interest in Airplane #1 prior to its acquisition in 2022, the requirements of paragraphs (b)(3)(iii)(A)(
1
) and (b)(3)(ii)(B)(
1
) of this section are satisfied. Accordingly, assuming all other requirements are met,
AB'
s purchase price for Airplane #1 qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction for
AB
under this section.
(
4
) Although Airplane #2 contains used parts, the cost of the used parts is not more than 20 percent of the total cost of Airplane #2. As a result, Airplane #2 is not treated as reconditioned or rebuilt property, and
AB
is considered the original user of Airplane #2, pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A) of this section. Accordingly, assuming all other requirements are met, the amount paid or incurred by
AB
for Airplane #2 qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction for
AB
under this section.
(
5
) With respect to
X'
s purchase of Airplane #2 in 2025, Airplane #2 is substantially renovated property pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B)(
3
) of this section. Also, pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B)(
3
) of this section,
X'
s depreciable interest in Airplane #1 is not taken into account for determining if
X
previously had a depreciable interest in Airplane #2 prior to its acquisition during 2025. As a result, Airplane #2 is not treated as used by
X
at any time before its acquisition of Airplane #2 in 2025 pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B)(
3
) of this section. Accordingly, assuming all other requirements are met,
X'
s purchase price of Airplane #2 qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction for
X
under this section.

Example 20.
In November 2017, AA Corporation purchases a used drill press costing $10,000 and is granted a trade-in allowance of $2,000 on its old drill press. The used drill press is qualified property under section 168(k)(2)(A)(i). The old drill press had a basis of $1,200. Under sections 1012 and 1031(d), the basis of the used drill press is $9,200 ($1,200 basis of old drill press plus cash expended of $8,000). Only $8,000 of the basis of the used drill press satisfies the requirements of section
179(d)(3) and § 1.179-4(d) and, thus, satisfies the used property acquisition requirement of paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section. The remaining $1,200 of the basis of the used drill press does not satisfy the requirements of section 179(d)(3) and § 1.179-4(d) because it is determined by reference to the old drill press. Accordingly, assuming all other requirements are met, only $8,000 of the basis of the used drill press is eligible for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section.

) M Corporation acquires and places in service a used airplane on March 26, 2018. Prior to this acquisition, M Corporation never had a depreciable interest in this airplane. On March 26, 2018, M Corporation also leases the used airplane to N Corporation, an airline company. On May 27, 2018, M Corporation sells to O Corporation the used airplane subject to the lease with N Corporation. M Corporation and O Corporation are related parties within the meaning of section 179(d)(2)(A) or (B) and § 1.179-4(c). As of May 27, 2018, N Corporation is still the lessee of the used airplane. Prior to this acquisition, O Corporation never had a depreciable interest in the used airplane. O Corporation is a calendar-year taxpayer.
(
2
) The sale transaction of May 27, 2018, satisfies the requirements of a syndication transaction described in paragraph (b)(3)(vi) of this section. As a result, O Corporation is considered the taxpayer that acquired the used airplane for purposes of applying the used property acquisition requirements in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section. In applying these rules, the fact that M Corporation and O Corporation are related parties is not taken into account because O Corporation, not M Corporation, is treated as acquiring the used airplane. Also, O Corporation, not M Corporation, is treated as having the depreciable interest in the used airplane. Further, pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(iv) of this section, the used airplane is treated as originally placed in service by O Corporation on May 27, 2018. Because O Corporation never had a depreciable interest in the used airplane and assuming all other requirements are met, O Corporation's purchase price of the used airplane qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction for O Corporation under this section.

) The facts are the same as in
Example 21
of paragraph (b)(3)(vii)(U)(

) of this section. Additionally, on September 5, 2018, O Corporation sells to P Corporation the used airplane subject to the lease with N Corporation. Prior to this acquisition, P Corporation never had a depreciable interest in the used airplane.
(
2
) Because O Corporation, a calendar-year taxpayer, placed in service and disposed of the used airplane during 2018, the used airplane is not eligible for the additional first year depreciation deduction for O Corporation pursuant to paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section.
(
3
) Because P Corporation never had a depreciable interest in the used airplane and assuming all other requirements are met, P Corporation's purchase price of the used airplane qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction for P Corporation under this section.

(
2
) The sale transaction of May 27, 2018, satisfies the requirements of a syndication transaction described in paragraph (b)(3)(vi) of this section. As a result, O Corporation is considered the taxpayer that acquired the used airplane for purposes of applying the used property acquisition requirements in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section. Also, O Corporation, not M Corporation, is treated as having the depreciable interest in the used airplane. Further, pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(iv) of this section, the used airplane is treated as originally placed in service by O Corporation on May 27, 2018. Because O Corporation never had a depreciable interest in the used airplane before its acquisition in 2018 and assuming all other requirements are met, O Corporation's purchase price of
the used airplane qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction for O Corporation under this section.
(
3
) Prior to its acquisition of the used airplane on March 26, 2020, M Corporation never had a depreciable interest in the used airplane pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(vi) of this section. Assuming all other requirements are met, M Corporation's purchase price of the used airplane on March 26, 2020, qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction for M Corporation under this section.

Example 24.
(

) J, K, and L are corporations that are unrelated parties within the meaning of section 179(d)(2)(A) or (B) and § 1.179-4(c). None of J, K, or L is a member of a consolidated group. J has a depreciable interest in Equipment #5. During 2018, J sells Equipment #5 to K. During 2020, J merges into L in a transaction described in section 368(a)(1)(A). In 2021, L acquires Equipment #5 from K.
(
2
) Because J is the predecessor of L, and because J previously had a depreciable interest in Equipment #5, L's acquisition of Equipment #5 does not satisfy paragraphs (b)(3)(iii)(A)(
1
) and (b)(3)(iii)(B)(
1
) of this section. Thus, L's acquisition of Equipment #5 does not satisfy the used property acquisition requirements of paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section. Accordingly, L's acquisition of Equipment #5 is not eligible for the additional first year depreciation deduction.

JL
uses the machine in its trade or business for the remainder of its taxable year ending June 30, 2023.
(

)
JL
's acquisition of the machine on April 22, 2020, satisfies the original use requirement in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section. Assuming all other requirements are met,
JL
's purchase price of the machine qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction for
JL
for the taxable year ending June 30, 2020, under this section.
(

)
JM
placed in service the machine on May 1, 2022, and disposed of it on February 1, 2023. As a result,
JM
placed in service and disposed of the machine during the same taxable year (
JM
's taxable year beginning April 1, 2022, and ending March 31, 2023). Accordingly,
JM
's acquisition of the machine on May 1, 2022, does not qualify for the additional first year depreciation deduction pursuant to paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section.
(
4
) Pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B)(
1
) of this section, the lookback period is calendar years 2018 through 2022 and January 1, 2023, through January 31, 2023, to determine if
JL
had a depreciable interest in the machine when
JL
reacquired it on February 1, 2023. As a result,
JL
's depreciable interest in the machine during the period April 22, 2020, to April 30, 2022, is taken into account for determining whether the machine was used by
JL
or a predecessor at any time prior to its reacquisition by
JL
on February 1, 2023. Accordingly, the reacquisition of the machine by
JL
on February 1, 2023, does not qualify for the additional first year depreciation deduction.

a party unrelated to either
EF

On April 1, 2018,
Partnership T
buys Property from
EG
and places it in service for use in its trade or business.
(

)
EF
is not
Partnership T
's predecessor with respect to Property within the meaning of paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(B) of this section. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B)(

Partnership T
had a depreciable interest in Property that
Partnership T
acquired
on April 1, 2018.
EF
need not be examined in the lookback period to see if
EF
had a depreciable interest in Property, because
EF
is not
Partnership T
's predecessor. Because
Partnership T
did not have a depreciable interest in Property in the lookback period prior to its acquisition of Property on April 1, 2018,
Partnership T
's acquisition of Property on April 1, 2018, satisfies the used property acquisition requirement of paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B)(

Partnership T
's purchase price of Property qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section.

EF
or
Partnership T
had a depreciable interest in Property that
Partnership T
acquired on April 1, 2018. Because
EF
had a depreciable interest in Property from 2013 to 2015 and
Partnership T
had a depreciable interest in Property from January through June 2016,
Partnership T
's acquisition of Property on April 1, 2018, does not satisfy the used property acquisition requirement of paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B)(

Y Corporation did not have a depreciable interest in Property at any time during the lookback period. Because X Corporation had a depreciable interest in Property from 2013 through 2014, X Corporation's acquisition of Property on April 1, 2018, does not satisfy the used property acquisition requirement of paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B)(

Example 30.
(
1
) On September 5, 2017,
Y,
a calendar-year taxpayer, acquires and places in service a new machine (Machine #1), and begins using Machine #1 in its manufacturing trade or business. On November 1, 2017,
Y
sells Machine #1 to
Z,
then
Z
leases Machine #1 back to
Y
for 4 years, and
Y
continues to use Machine #1 in its manufacturing trade or business. The lease agreement contains a purchase option provision allowing
Y
to buy Machine #1 at the end of the lease term. On November 1, 2021,
Y
exercises the purchase option in the lease agreement and buys Machine #1 from
Z.
The lease between
Y
and
Z
for Machine #1 is a true lease for Federal tax purposes.
(
2
) Because
Y,
a calendar-year taxpayer, placed in service and disposed of Machine #1 during 2017, Machine #1 is not eligible for the additional first year depreciation deduction for
Y
pursuant to § 1.168(k)-1(f)(1)(i).
(
3
) The use of Machine #1 by
Y
prevents
Z
from satisfying the original use requirement of paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section. However,
Z
's acquisition of Machine #1 satisfies the used property acquisition requirements of paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section. Assuming all other requirements are met,
Z
's purchase price of Machine #1 qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction for
Z
under this section.
(

Y
's depreciable interest in Machine #1 during that 90-day period is not taken into account for determining whether Machine #1 was used by
Y
or a predecessor at any time prior to its reacquisition by
Y
on November 1, 2021. Accordingly, assuming all other requirements are met,

) In August 2017,
FD,
a calendar-year taxpayer, entered into a written binding contract with
X
for
X
to manufacture a machine for
FD
for use in its trade or business. Before September 28, 2017,
FD
incurred more than 10 percent of the total cost of the machine. On February 8, 2020,
X
delivered the machine to
FD
and
FD
placed in service the machine. The machine is property described in section 168(k)(2)(B) as in effect on the day before the date of the enactment of the Act.
FD
's entire unadjusted depreciable basis of the machine is attributable to the machine's manufacture before January 1, 2020.
FD
uses the safe harbor test in § 1.168(k)-1(b)(4)(iii)(B)(
2
) to determine when manufacturing of the machine began. On March 26, 2020,
FD
sells the machine to
FE
for use in
FE
's trade or business.
FE
is a calendar-year taxpayer and is not related to
FD.
On November 7, 2020,
FD
buys the machine from
FE
and places in service the machine.
FD
uses the machine in its trade or business for the remainder of 2020.
(
2
) Because
FD
incurred more than 10 percent of the cost of the machine before September 28, 2017, and
FD
uses the safe harbor test in § 1.168(k)-1(b)(4)(iii)(B)(
2
) to determine when the manufacturing of the machine began,
FD
acquired the machine before September 28, 2017. If
FD
had not disposed of the machine on March 26, 2020, the cost of the machine would have qualified for the 30-percent additional first year depreciation deduction pursuant to section 168(k)(8), assuming all requirements are met under section 168(k)(2) as in effect on the day before the date of the enactment of the Act. However, because
FD
placed in service the machine on February 8, 2020, and disposed of it on March 26, 2020, FD's acquisition of the machine on February 8, 2020, does not qualify for the additional first year depreciation deduction pursuant to § 1.168(k)-1(f)(1)(i).
(
3
) Because
FE
placed in service the machine on March 26, 2020, and disposed of it on November 7, 2020,

sold the machine to
FE
within 90 calendar days of placing the machine in service originally on February 8, 2020. After
FD
reacquired the machine on November 7, 2020,
FD
did not dispose of the machine during the remainder of 2020.
FD
originally acquired this machine before September 28, 2017. As a result, paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B)(

) of this section does not apply. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B)(
1
) of this section, the lookback period is 2015 through 2019 and January 1, 2020, through November 6, 2020, to determine if
FD
had a depreciable interest in the machine when
FD
reacquired it on November 7, 2020. As a result,
FD
's depreciable interest in the machine during the period February 8, 2020, to March 26, 2020, is taken into account for determining whether the machine was used by
FD
or a predecessor
at any time prior to its reacquisition by
FD
on November 7, 2020. Accordingly, the reacquisition of the machine by
FD
on November 7, 2020, does not qualify for the additional first year depreciation deduction.

) In a series of related transactions, a father sells a machine to an unrelated individual on December 15, 2019, who sells the machine to the father's daughter on January 2, 2020, for use in the daughter's trade or business. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(C)(
1
) of this section, a transferee tests its relationship with the transferor from which the transferee directly acquires the depreciable property, and with the original transferor of the depreciable property in the series. The relationship is tested when the transferee acquires, and immediately before the first transfer of, the depreciable property in the series. As a result, the following relationships are tested under section 179(d)(2)(A): The unrelated individual tests its relationship to the father as of December 15, 2019; and the daughter tests her relationship to the unrelated individual as of January 2, 2020, and December 15, 2019, and to the father as of January 2, 2020, and December 15, 2019.
(
2
) Because the individual is not related to the father within the meaning of section 179(d)(2)(A) and § 1.179-4(c)(1)(ii) as of December 15, 2019, the individual's acquisition of the machine satisfies the used property acquisition requirement of paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A)(
2
) of this section. Accordingly, assuming the unrelated individual placed the machine in service for use in its trade or business in 2019 and all other requirements of this section are satisfied, the unrelated individual's purchase price of the machine qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section.
(
3
) The individual and the daughter are not related parties within the meaning of section 179(d)(2)(A) and § 1.179-4(c)(1)(ii) as of January 2, 2020, or December 15, 2019. However, the father and his daughter are related parties within the meaning of section 179(d)(2)(A) and § 1.179-4(c)(1)(ii) as of January 2, 2020, or December 15, 2019. Accordingly, the daughter's acquisition of the machine does not satisfy the used property acquisition requirements of paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section and is not eligible for the additional first year depreciation deduction.

1
) of this section, a transferee tests its relationship with the transferor from which the transferee directly acquires the depreciable property, and with the original transferor of the depreciable property in the series. The relationship is tested when the transferee acquires, and immediately before the first transfer of, the depreciable property in the series. As a result, the following relationships are tested under section 179(d)(2)(A): The son tests his relationship to the father as of December 15, 2019; and the daughter tests her relationship to her brother as of January 2, 2020, and December 15, 2019, and to the father as of January 2, 2020, and December 15, 2019.

Placed-in-service date
—(i)
In general.
Depreciable property will meet the requirements of this paragraph (b)(4) if the property is placed in service by the taxpayer for use in its trade or business or for production of income after September 27, 2017; and, except as provided in paragraphs (b)(2)(i)(A) and (D) of this section, before January 1, 2027, or, in the case of property described in section 168(k)(2)(B) or (C), before January 1, 2028.
(ii)
Specified plant.
If the taxpayer has properly made an election to apply section 168(k)(5) for a specified plant, the requirements of this paragraph (b)(4) are satisfied only if the specified plant is planted before January 1, 2027, or is grafted before January 1, 2027, to a plant that has already been planted, by the taxpayer in the ordinary course of the taxpayer's farming business, as defined in section 263A(e)(4).
(iii)
Qualified film, television, or live theatrical production
—(A)
Qualified film or television production.
For purposes of this paragraph (b)(4), a qualified film or television production is treated as placed in service at the time of initial release or broadcast as defined under § 1.181-1(a)(7). The taxpayer that places
in service a qualified film or television production must be the owner, as defined in § 1.181-1(a)(2), of the qualified film or television production.
(B)
Qualified live theatrical production.
For purposes of this paragraph (b)(4), a qualified live theatrical production is treated as placed in service at the time of the initial live staged performance. The taxpayer that places in service a qualified live theatrical production must be the owner, as defined in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(F) of this section and in § 1.181-1(a)(2), of the qualified live theatrical production.
(iv)
Syndication transaction.
If new property is acquired and placed in service by a lessor, or if used property is acquired and placed in service by a lessor and the lessor and any predecessor did not previously have a depreciable interest in the used property, and the property is sold by the lessor or any subsequent purchaser within three months after the date the property was originally placed in service by the lessor (or, in the case of multiple units of property subject to the same lease, within three months after the date the final unit is placed in service, so long as the period between the time the first unit is placed in service and the time the last unit is placed in service does not exceed 12 months), and the user of the property after the last sale during this three-month period remains the same as when the property was originally placed in service by the lessor, the property is treated as originally placed in service by the purchaser of the property in the last sale during the three-month period but not earlier than the date of the last sale for purposes of sections 167 and 168, and §§ 1.46-3(d) and 1.167(a)-11(e)(1).
(v)
Technical termination of a partnership.
For purposes of this paragraph (b)(4), in the case of a technical termination of a partnership under section 708(b)(1)(B) occurring in a taxable year beginning before January 1, 2018, qualified property placed in service by the terminated partnership during the taxable year of termination is treated as originally placed in service by the new partnership on the date the qualified property is contributed by the terminated partnership to the new partnership.
(vi)
Section 168(i)(7) transactions.
For purposes of this paragraph (b)(4), if qualified property is transferred in a transaction described in section 168(i)(7) in the same taxable year that the qualified property is placed in service by the transferor, the transferred property is treated as originally placed in service on the date the transferor placed in service the qualified property. In the case of multiple transfers of qualified property in multiple transactions described in section 168(i)(7) in the same taxable year, the placed-in-service date of the transferred property is deemed to be the date on which the first transferor placed in service the qualified property.
(5)
Acquisition of property
—(i)
In general.
This paragraph (b)(5) provides rules for the acquisition requirements in section 13201(h) of the Act. These rules apply to all property, including self-constructed property or property described in section 168(k)(2)(B) or (C).
(ii)
Acquisition date
—(A)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(5)(vi) of this section, depreciable property will meet the requirements of this paragraph (b)(5) if the property is acquired by the taxpayer after September 27, 2017, or is acquired by the taxpayer pursuant to a written binding contract entered into by the taxpayer after September 27, 2017. Property that is manufactured, constructed, or produced for the taxpayer by another person under a written binding contract that is entered into prior to the manufacture, construction, or production of the property for use by the taxpayer in its trade or business or for its production of income is not acquired pursuant to a written binding contract but is considered to be self-constructed property under this paragraph (b)(5). For determination of acquisition date, see paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(B) of this section for property acquired pursuant to a written binding contract, paragraph (b)(5)(iv) of this section for self-constructed property, and paragraph (b)(5)(v) of this section for property not acquired pursuant to a written binding contract.
(B)
Determination of acquisition date for property acquired pursuant to a written binding contract.
Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(5)(vi) and (vii) of this
section, the acquisition date of property that the taxpayer acquired pursuant to a written binding contract is the later of—
(
1
) The date on which the contract was entered into;
(
2
) The date on which the contract is enforceable under State law;
(
3
) If the contract has one or more cancellation periods, the date on which all cancellation periods end. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(B)(
3
), a cancellation period is the number of days stated in the contract for any party to cancel the contract without penalty; or
(
4
) If the contract has one or more contingency clauses, the date on which all conditions subject to such clauses are satisfied. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(B)(
4
), a contingency clause is one that provides for a condition (or conditions) or action (or actions) that is within the control of any party or a predecessor.
(iii)
Definition of binding contract
—(A)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(5)(iii)(G) of this section, a contract is binding only if it is enforceable under State law against the taxpayer or a predecessor, and does not limit damages to a specified amount (for example, by use of a liquidated damages provision). For this purpose, any contractual provision that limits damages to an amount equal to at least 5 percent of the total contract price will not be treated as limiting damages to a specified amount. If a contract has multiple provisions that limit damages, only the provision with the highest damages is taken into account in determining whether the contract limits damages. Also, in determining whether a contract limits damages, the fact that there may be little or no damages because the contract price does not significantly differ from fair market value will not be taken into account. For example, if a taxpayer entered into an irrevocable written contract to purchase an asset for $100 and the contract did not contain a provision for liquidated damages, the contract is considered binding notwithstanding the fact that the asset had a fair market value of $99 and under local law the seller would only recover the difference in the event the purchaser failed to perform. If the contract provided for a full refund of the purchase price in lieu of any damages allowable by law in the event of breach or cancellation, the contract is not considered binding.
(B)
Conditions.
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(5)(iii)(G) of this section, a contract is binding even if subject to a condition, as long as the condition is not within the control of either party or a predecessor. A contract will continue to be binding if the parties make insubstantial changes in its terms and conditions or if any term is to be determined by a standard beyond the control of either party. A contract that imposes significant obligations on the taxpayer or a predecessor will be treated as binding notwithstanding the fact that certain terms remain to be negotiated by the parties to the contract.
(C)
Options.
An option to either acquire or sell property is not a binding contract.
(D)
Letter of intent.
A letter of intent for an acquisition is not a binding contract.
(E)
Supply agreements.
A binding contract does not include a supply or similar agreement if the amount and design specifications of the property to be purchased have not been specified. The contract will not be a binding contract for the property to be purchased until both the amount and the design specifications are specified. For example, if the provisions of a supply or similar agreement state the design specifications of the property to be purchased, a purchase order under the agreement for a specific number of assets is treated as a binding contract.
(F)
Components.
A binding contract to acquire one or more components of a larger property will not be treated as a binding contract to acquire the larger property. If a binding contract to acquire the component does not satisfy the requirements of this paragraph (b)(5), the component does not qualify for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section.
(G)
Acquisition of a trade or business or an entity.
A contract to acquire all or substantially all of the assets of a
trade or business or to acquire an entity (for example, a corporation, a partnership, or a limited liability company) is binding if it is enforceable under State law against the parties to the contract. The presence of a condition outside the control of the parties, including, for example, regulatory agency approval, will not prevent the contract from being a binding contract. Further, the fact that insubstantial terms remain to be negotiated by the parties to the contract, or that customary conditions remain to be satisfied, does not prevent the contract from being a binding contract. This paragraph (b)(5)(iii)(G) also applies to a contract for the sale of the stock of a corporation that is treated as an asset sale as a result of an election under section 338 or under section 336(e) made for a disposition described in § 1.336-2(b)(1).
(iv)
Self-constructed property
—(A)
In general.
If a taxpayer manufactures, constructs, or produces property for use by the taxpayer in its trade or business or for its production of income, the acquisition rules in paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section are treated as met for the property if the taxpayer begins manufacturing, constructing, or producing the property after September 27, 2017. Property that is manufactured, constructed, or produced for the taxpayer by another person under a written binding contract, as defined in paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this section, that is entered into prior to the manufacture, construction, or production of the property for use by the taxpayer in its trade or business or for its production of income is considered to be manufactured, constructed, or produced by the taxpayer. If a taxpayer enters into a written binding contract, as defined in paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this section, before September 28, 2017, with another person to manufacture, construct, or produce property and the manufacture, construction, or production of this property begins after September 27, 2017, the acquisition rules in paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section are met.
(B)
When does manufacture, construction, or production begin
—(
1
)
In general.
For purposes of paragraph (b)(5)(iv)(A) of this section, manufacture, construction, or production of property begins when physical work of a significant nature begins. Physical work does not include preliminary activities such as planning or designing, securing financing, exploring, or researching. The determination of when physical work of a significant nature begins depends on the facts and circumstances. For example, if a retail motor fuels outlet is to be constructed on-site, construction begins when physical work of a significant nature commences at the site; that is, when work begins on the excavation for footings, pouring the pads for the outlet, or the driving of foundation pilings into the ground. Preliminary work, such as clearing a site, test drilling to determine soil condition, or excavation to change the contour of the land (as distinguished from excavation for footings) does not constitute the beginning of construction. However, if a retail motor fuels outlet is to be assembled on-site from modular units manufactured off-site and delivered to the site where the outlet will be used, manufacturing begins when physical work of a significant nature commences at the off-site location.
(

)
Safe harbor.
For purposes of paragraph (b)(5)(iv)(B)(
1
) of this section, a taxpayer may choose to determine when physical work of a significant nature begins in accordance with this paragraph (b)(5)(iv)(B)(
2
). Physical work of a significant nature will be considered to begin at the time the taxpayer incurs (in the case of an accrual basis taxpayer) or pays (in the case of a cash basis taxpayer) more than 10 percent of the total cost of the property, excluding the cost of any land and preliminary activities such as planning or designing, securing financing, exploring, or researching. When property is manufactured, constructed, or produced for the taxpayer by another person, this safe harbor test must be satisfied by the taxpayer. For example, if a retail motor fuels outlet or other facility is to be constructed for an accrual basis taxpayer by another person for the total cost of $200,000, excluding the cost of any land and preliminary activities such as planning or designing, securing financing, exploring, or researching, construction is deemed to begin for purposes of this
paragraph (b)(5)(iv)(B)(
2
) when the taxpayer has incurred more than 10 percent (more than $20,000) of the total cost of the property. A taxpayer chooses to apply this paragraph (b)(5)(iv)(B)(
2
) by filing a Federal income tax return for the placed-in-service year of the property that determines when physical work of a significant nature begins consistent with this paragraph (b)(5)(iv)(B)(
2
).
(C)
Components of self-constructed property
—(
1
)
Acquired components.
If a binding contract, as defined in paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this section, to acquire a component does not satisfy the requirements of paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section, the component does not qualify for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section. A binding contract described in the preceding sentence to acquire one or more components of a larger self-constructed property will not preclude the larger self-constructed property from satisfying the acquisition rules in paragraph (b)(5)(iv)(A) of this section. Accordingly, the unadjusted depreciable basis of the larger self-constructed property that is eligible for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section, assuming all other requirements are met, must not include the unadjusted depreciable basis of any component that does not satisfy the requirements of paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section. If the manufacture, construction, or production of the larger self-constructed property begins before September 28, 2017, the larger self-constructed property and any acquired components related to the larger self-constructed property do not qualify for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section. If a binding contract to acquire the component is entered into after September 27, 2017, but the manufacture, construction, or production of the larger self-constructed property does not begin before January 1, 2027, the component qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section, assuming all other requirements are met, but the larger self-constructed property does not.
(
2
)
Self-constructed components.
If the manufacture, construction, or production of a component does not satisfy the requirements of this paragraph (b)(5)(iv), the component does not qualify for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section. However, if the manufacture, construction, or production of a component does not satisfy the requirements of this paragraph (b)(5)(iv), but the manufacture, construction, or production of the larger self-constructed property satisfies the requirements of this paragraph (b)(5)(iv), the larger self-constructed property qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section, assuming all other requirements are met, even though the component does not qualify for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section. Accordingly, the unadjusted depreciable basis of the larger self-constructed property that is eligible for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section, assuming all other requirements are met, must not include the unadjusted depreciable basis of any component that does not qualify for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section. If the manufacture, construction, or production of the larger self-constructed property began before September 28, 2017, the larger self-constructed property and any self-constructed components related to the larger self-constructed property do not qualify for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section. If the manufacture, construction, or production of a component begins after September 27, 2017, but the manufacture, construction, or production of the larger self-constructed property does not begin before January 1, 2027, the component qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section, assuming all other requirements are met, but the larger self-constructed property does not.
(v)
Determination of acquisition date for property not acquired pursuant to a written binding contract.
Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(5)(iv), (vi), and (vii) of this section, the acquisition
date of property that the taxpayer acquires pursuant to a contract that does not meet the definition of a written binding contract in paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this section, is the date on which the taxpayer paid, in the case of a cash basis taxpayer, or incurred, in the case of an accrual basis taxpayer, more than 10 percent of the total cost of the property, excluding the cost of any land and preliminary activities such as planning and designing, securing financing, exploring, or researching. The preceding sentence also applies to property that is manufactured, constructed, or produced for the taxpayer by another person under a written contract that does not meet the definition of a binding contract in paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this section, and that is entered into prior to the manufacture, construction, or production of the property for use by the taxpayer in its trade or business or for its production of income. This paragraph (b)(5)(v) does not apply to an acquisition described in paragraph (b)(5)(iii)(G) of this section.
(vi)
Qualified film, television, or live theatrical production
—(A)
Qualified film or television production.
For purposes of section 13201(h)(1)(A) of the Act, a qualified film or television production is treated as acquired on the date principal photography commences.
(B)
Qualified live theatrical production.
For purposes of section 13201(h)(1)(A) of the Act, a qualified live theatrical production is treated as acquired on the date when all of the necessary elements for producing the live theatrical production are secured. These elements may include a script, financing, actors, set, scenic and costume designs, advertising agents, music, and lighting.
(vii)
Specified plant.
If the taxpayer has properly made an election to apply section 168(k)(5) for a specified plant, the requirements of this paragraph (b)(5) are satisfied if the specified plant is planted after September 27, 2017, or is grafted after September 27, 2017, to a plant that has already been planted, by the taxpayer in the ordinary course of the taxpayer's farming business, as defined in section 263A(e)(4).
(viii)
Examples.
The application of this paragraph (b)(5) is illustrated by the following examples. Unless the facts specifically indicate otherwise, assume that the parties are not related within the meaning of section 179(d)(2)(A) or (B) and § 1.179-4(c), paragraph (c) of this section does not apply, and the parties do not have predecessors:
(A)
Example 1.
On September 1, 2017,
BB,
a corporation, entered into a written agreement with
CC,
a manufacturer, to purchase 20 new lamps for $100 each within the next two years. Although the agreement specifies the number of lamps to be purchased, the agreement does not specify the design of the lamps to be purchased. Accordingly, the agreement is not a binding contract pursuant to paragraph (b)(5)(iii)(E) of this section.
(B)
Example 2.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1
of paragraph (b)(5)(viii)(A) of this section. On December 1, 2017,
BB
placed a purchase order with
CC
to purchase 20 new model XPC5 lamps for $100 each for a total amount of $2,000. Because the agreement specifies the number of lamps to be purchased and the purchase order specifies the design of the lamps to be purchased, the purchase order placed by
BB
with
CC
on December 1, 2017, is a binding contract pursuant to paragraph (b)(5)(iii)(E) of this section. Accordingly, assuming all other requirements are met, the cost of the 20 lamps qualifies for the 100-percent additional first year depreciation deduction.
(C)
Example 3.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1
of paragraph (b)(5)(viii)(A) of this section, except that the written agreement between
BB
and
CC
is to purchase 100 model XPC5 lamps for $100 each within the next two years. Because this agreement specifies the amount and design of the lamps to be purchased, the agreement is a binding contract pursuant to paragraph (b)(5)(iii)(E) of this section. However, because the agreement was entered into before September 28, 2017, no lamp acquired by
BB
under this contract qualifies for the 100-percent additional first year depreciation deduction.
(D)
Example 4.
On September 1, 2017,
DD
began constructing a retail motor fuels outlet for its own use. On November 1, 2018,
DD
ceases construction of the retail motor fuels outlet prior to
its completion. Between September 1, 2017, and November 1, 2018,
DD
incurred $3,000,000 of expenditures for the construction of the retail motor fuels outlet. On May 1, 2019,
DD
resumed construction of the retail motor fuels outlet and completed its construction on August 31, 2019. Between May 1, 2019, and August 31, 2019,
DD
incurred another $1,600,000 of expenditures to complete the construction of the retail motor fuels outlet and, on September 1, 2019,
DD
placed the retail motor fuels outlet in service. None of
DD'
s total expenditures of $4,600,000 qualify for the 100-percent additional first year depreciation deduction because, pursuant to paragraph (b)(5)(iv)(A) of this section,
DD
began constructing the retail motor fuels outlet before September 28, 2017.
(E)
Example 5.
The facts are the same as in
Example 4
of paragraph (b)(5)(viii)(D) of this section except that
DD
began constructing the retail motor fuels outlet for its own use on October 1, 2017, and
DD
incurred the $3,000,000 between October 1, 2017, and November 1, 2018.
DD'
s total expenditures of $4,600,000 qualify for the 100-percent additional first year depreciation deduction because, pursuant to paragraph (b)(5)(iv)(A) of this section,
DD
began constructing the retail motor fuels outlet after September 27, 2017, and
DD
placed the retail motor fuels outlet in service on September 1, 2019. Accordingly, assuming all other requirements are met, the additional first year depreciation deduction for the retail motor fuels outlet will be $4,600,000, computed as $4,600,000 multiplied by 100 percent.
(F)
Example 6.
On August 15, 2017,
EE,
an accrual basis taxpayer, entered into a written binding contract with
FF
to manufacture an aircraft described in section 168(k)(2)(C) for use in
EE'
s trade or business.
FF
begins to manufacture the aircraft on October 1, 2017. The completed aircraft is delivered to
EE
on February 15, 2018, at which time
EE
incurred the total cost of the aircraft.
EE
places the aircraft in service on March 1, 2018. Pursuant to paragraphs (b)(5)(ii)(A) and (b)(5)(iv)(A) of this section, the aircraft is considered to be manufactured by
EE.
Because
EE
began manufacturing the aircraft after September 27, 2017, the aircraft qualifies for the 100-percent additional first year depreciation deduction, assuming all other requirements are met.
(G)
Example 7.
On June 1, 2017,
HH
entered into a written binding contract with GG to acquire a new component part of property that is being constructed by
HH
for its own use in its trade or business.
HH
commenced construction of the property in November 2017, and placed the property in service in November 2018. Because
HH
entered into a written binding contract to acquire a component part prior to September 28, 2017, pursuant to paragraphs (b)(5)(ii) and (b)(5)(iv)(C)(
1
) of this section, the component part does not qualify for the 100-percent additional first year depreciation deduction. However, pursuant to paragraphs (b)(5)(iv)(A) and (b)(5)(iv)(C)(
1
) of this section, the property constructed by
HH
will qualify for the 100-percent additional first year depreciation deduction, because construction of the property began after September 27, 2017, assuming all other requirements are met. Accordingly, the unadjusted depreciable basis of the property that is eligible for the 100-percent additional first year depreciation deduction must not include the unadjusted depreciable basis of the component part.
(H)
Example 8.
The facts are the same as in
Example 7
of paragraph (b)(5)(viii)(G) of this section except that
HH
entered into the written binding contract with GG to acquire the new component part on September 30, 2017, and
HH
commenced construction of the property on August 1, 2017. Pursuant to paragraphs (b)(5)(iv)(A) and (C) of this section, neither the property constructed by
HH
nor the component part will qualify for the 100-percent additional first year depreciation deduction, because
HH
began construction of the property prior to September 28, 2017.
(I)
Example 9.
On September 1, 2017,
II
acquired and placed in service equipment. On January 15, 2018,
II
sells the equipment to
JJ
and leases the property back from
JJ
in a sale-leaseback transaction. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section,
II'
s cost of the equipment does not qualify for the 100-
percent additional first year depreciation deduction because
II
acquired the equipment prior to September 28, 2017. However,
JJ
acquired used equipment from an unrelated party after September 27, 2017, and, assuming all other requirements are met,
JJ'
s cost of the used equipment qualifies for the 100-percent additional first year depreciation deduction for
JJ.
(J)
Example 10.
On July 1, 2017,
KK
began constructing property for its own use in its trade or business.
KK
placed this property in service on September 15, 2017. On January 15, 2018,
KK
sells the property to
LL
and leases the property back from
LL
in a sale-leaseback transaction. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(5)(iv) of this section,
KK'
s cost of the property does not qualify for the 100-percent additional first year depreciation deduction because
KK
began construction of the property prior to September 28, 2017. However,
LL
acquired used property from an unrelated party after September 27, 2017, and, assuming all other requirements are met,
LL'
s cost of the used property qualifies for the 100-percent additional first year depreciation deduction for
LL.
(K)
Example 11. MM,
a calendar year taxpayer, is engaged in a trade or business described in section 163(j)(7)(A)(iv). In December 2018,
MM
began constructing a new electric generation power plant for its own use.
MM
placed in service this new power plant, including all component parts, in 2020. Even though
MM
began constructing the power plant after September 27, 2017, none of
MM'
s total expenditures of the power plant qualify for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section because, pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(F) of this section, the power plant is property that is primarily used in a trade or business described in section 163(j)(7)(A)(iv) and the power plant was placed in service in
MM'
s taxable year beginning after 2017.
(c)
Election for components of larger self-constructed property for which the manufacture, construction, or production begins before September 28, 2017
—(1)
In general.
A taxpayer may elect to treat any acquired or self-constructed component, as described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, of the larger self-constructed property, as described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, as being eligible for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section, assuming all requirements of section 168(k) and this section are met. The taxpayer may make this election for one or more such components.
(2)
Eligible larger self-constructed property
—(i)
In general.
Solely for purposes of this paragraph (c), a larger self-constructed property is property that is manufactured, constructed, or produced by the taxpayer for its own use in its trade or business or production of income. Solely for purposes of this paragraph (c), property that is manufactured, constructed, or produced for the taxpayer by another person under a written binding contract, as defined in paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this section, or under a written contract that does not meet the definition of a binding contract in paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this section, that is entered into prior to the manufacture, construction, or production of the property for use by the taxpayer in its trade or business or production of income is considered to be manufactured, constructed, or produced by the taxpayer. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section, such larger self-constructed property must be property—
(A) That is described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A), (B), (C), or (D) of this section. Solely for purposes of the preceding sentence, the requirement that property has to be acquired after September 27, 2017, is disregarded;
(B) That meets the requirements under paragraph (b) of this section, determined without regard to the acquisition date requirement in paragraph (b)(5) of this section; and
(C) For which the taxpayer begins the manufacture, construction, or production before September 28, 2017.
(ii)
Residential rental property or nonresidential real property.
If the taxpayer constructs, manufactures, or produces residential rental property or nonresidential real property, as defined in section 168(e)(2), or an improvement to such property, for use in its trade or business or production of income, all
property that is constructed, manufactured, or produced as part of such residential rental property, nonresidential real property, or improvement, as applicable, and that is described in paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A) of this section is the larger self-constructed property for purposes of applying the rules in this paragraph (c).
(iii)
Beginning of manufacturing, construction, or production.
Solely for purposes of paragraph (c)(2)(i)(C) of this section, the determination of when manufacture, construction, or production of the larger self-constructed property begins is made in accordance with the rules in paragraph (b)(5)(iv)(B) of this section if the larger self-constructed property is manufactured, constructed, or produced by the taxpayer for its own use in its trade or business or production of income, or is manufactured, constructed, or produced for the taxpayer by another person under a written binding contract, as defined in paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this section, that is entered into prior to the manufacture, construction, or production of the property for use by the taxpayer in its trade or business or production of income. If the larger self-constructed property is manufactured, constructed, or produced for the taxpayer by another person under a written contract that does not meet the definition of a binding contract in paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this section, that is entered into prior to the manufacture, construction, or production of the property for use by the taxpayer in its trade or business or production of income, the determination of when manufacture, construction, or production of the larger self-constructed property begins is made in accordance with the rules in paragraph (b)(5)(v) of this section. If the taxpayer enters into a written binding contract, as defined in paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this section, before September 28, 2017, with another person to manufacture, construct, or produce the larger self-constructed property and the manufacture, construction, or production of this property begins after September 27, 2017, as determined under paragraph (b)(5)(iv)(B) of this section, this paragraph (c) does not apply. If the taxpayer enters into a written contract that does not meet the definition of a binding contract in paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this section before September 28, 2017, with another person to manufacture, construct, or produce the larger self-constructed property and the manufacture, construction, or production of this property begins after September 27, 2017, as determined under paragraph (b)(5)(v) of this section, this paragraph (c) does not apply.
(iv)
Exception.
This paragraph (c) does not apply to any larger self-constructed property that is included in a class of property for which the taxpayer made an election under section 168(k)(7) (formerly section 168(k)(2)(D)(iii)) not to deduct the additional first year depreciation deduction.
(3)
Eligible components
—(i)
In general.
Solely for purposes of this paragraph (c), a component of the larger self-constructed property, as described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, must be qualified property under section 168(k)(2) and paragraph (b) of this section. Solely for purposes of the preceding sentence, a component will satisfy the acquisition date requirement in paragraph (b)(5) of this section if it satisfies the requirements in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) or (iii) of this section, as applicable.
(ii)
Acquired components.
If a component of the larger self-constructed property is acquired pursuant to a written binding contract, as defined in paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this section, the component must be acquired by the taxpayer after September 27, 2017, as determined under the rules in paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(B) of this section. If a component of the larger self-constructed property is acquired pursuant to a written contract that does not meet the definition of a binding contract in paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this section, the component must be acquired by the taxpayer after September 27, 2017, as determined under the rules in paragraph (b)(5)(v) of this section.
(iii)
Self-constructed components.
The manufacture, construction, or production of a component of a larger self-constructed property must begin after September 27, 2017. The determination of when manufacture, construction, or
production of the component begins is made in accordance with the rules in—
(A) Paragraph (b)(5)(iv)(B) of this section if the component is manufactured, constructed, or produced by the taxpayer for its own use in its trade or business or for its production of income, or is manufactured, constructed, or produced for the taxpayer by another person under a written binding contract, as defined in paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this section, that is entered into prior to the manufacture, construction, or production of the component for use by the taxpayer in its trade or business or for its production of income; or
(B) Paragraph (b)(5)(v) of this section if the component is manufactured, constructed, or produced for the taxpayer by another person under a written contract that does not meet the definition of a binding contract in paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this section, that is entered into prior to the manufacture, construction, or production of the component for use by the taxpayer in its trade or business or for its production of income.
(4)
Special rules
—(i)
Installation costs.
If the taxpayer pays, in the case of a cash basis taxpayer, or incurs, in the case of an accrual basis taxpayer, costs, including labor costs, to install a component of the larger self-constructed property, as described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, such costs are eligible for the additional first year depreciation under this section, assuming all requirements are met, only if the component being installed meets the requirements in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
(ii)
Property described in section 168(k)(2)(B).
The rules in paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section apply for determining the unadjusted depreciable basis, as defined in § 1.168(b)-1(a)(3), of larger self-constructed property described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section and in section 168(k)(2)(B).
(5)
Computation of additional first year depreciation deduction
—(i)
Election is made.
Before determining the allowable additional first year depreciation deduction for the larger self-constructed property, as described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, for which the taxpayer makes the election specified in this paragraph (c) for one or more components of such property, the taxpayer must determine the portion of the unadjusted depreciable basis, as defined in § 1.168(b)-1(a)(3), of the larger self-constructed property, including all components, attributable to the component that meets the requirements of paragraphs (c)(3) and (c)(4)(i) of this section (component basis). The additional first year depreciation deduction for the component basis is determined by multiplying such component basis by the applicable percentage for the placed-in-service year of the larger self-constructed property. The additional first year depreciation deduction, if any, for the remaining unadjusted depreciable basis of the larger self-constructed property, as described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, is determined under section 168(k), as in effect on the day before the date of the enactment of the Act, and section 168(k)(8). For purposes of this paragraph (c), the remaining unadjusted depreciable basis of the larger self-constructed property is equal to the unadjusted depreciable basis, as defined in § 1.168(b)-1(a)(3), of the larger self-constructed property, including all components, reduced by the sum of the component basis of the components for which the taxpayer makes the election specified in this paragraph (c).
(ii)
Election is not made.
If the taxpayer does not make the election specified in this paragraph (c), the additional first year depreciation deduction, if any, for the larger self-constructed property, including all components, is determined under section 168(k), as in effect on the day before the date of the enactment of the Act, and section 168(k)(8).
(6)
Time and manner for making election
—(i)
Time for making election.
The election specified in this paragraph (c) must be made by the due date, including extensions, of the Federal tax return for the taxable year in which the taxpayer placed in service the larger self-constructed property.
(ii)
Manner of making election.
The election specified in this paragraph (c) must be made by attaching a statement to such return indicating that the taxpayer is making the election
provided in this paragraph (c) and whether the taxpayer is making the election for all or some of the components described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. The election is made separately by each person owning qualified property (for example, for each member of a consolidated group by the agent for the group (within the meaning of § 1.1502-77(a) and (c)), by the partnership (including a lower-tier partnership), or by the S corporation).
(7)
Revocation of election
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of this section, the election specified in this paragraph (c), once made, may be revoked only by filing a request for a private letter ruling and obtaining the Commissioner of Internal Revenue's written consent to revoke the election. The Commissioner may grant a request to revoke the election if the taxpayer acted reasonably and in good faith, and the revocation will not prejudice the interests of the Government. See generally § 301.9100-3 of this chapter. The election specified in this paragraph (c) may not be revoked through a request under section 446(e) to change the taxpayer's method of accounting.
(ii)
Automatic 6-month extension.
If a taxpayer made the election specified in this paragraph (c), an automatic extension of 6 months from the due date of the taxpayer's Federal tax return, excluding extensions, for the placed-in-service year of the larger self-constructed property is granted to revoke that election, provided the taxpayer timely filed the taxpayer's Federal tax return for that placed-in-service year and, within this 6-month extension period, the taxpayer, and all taxpayers whose tax liability would be affected by the election, file an amended Federal tax return for the placed-in-service year in a manner that is consistent with the revocation of the election.
(8)
Additional procedural guidance.
The IRS may publish procedural guidance in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(
b
) of this chapter) that provides alternative procedures for complying with paragraph (c)(6) or (c)(7)(i) of this section.
(9)
Examples.
The application of this paragraph (c) is illustrated by the following examples. Unless the facts specifically indicate otherwise, assume that the larger self-constructed property is described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the components that are acquired or self-constructed after September 27, 2017, are described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the taxpayer is an accrual basis taxpayer, and none of the costs paid or incurred after September 27, 2017, are for the installation of components that do not meet the requirements of paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
(i)
Example 1.
(A)
BC,
a calendar year taxpayer, is engaged in a trade or business described in section 163(j)(7)(A)(iv) and §§ 1.163(j)-1(b)(15)(i) and 1.163(j)-10(c)(3)(iii)(C)(
3
). In December 2015,
BC
decided to construct an electric generation power plant for its own use. This plant is property described in section 168(k)(2)(B) as in effect on the day before the date of the enactment of the Act. However, the turbine for the plant had to be manufactured by another person for
BC.
In January 2016,
BC
entered into a written binding contract with
CD
to acquire the turbine.
BC
received the completed turbine in August 2017 at which time
BC
incurred the cost of the turbine. The cost of the turbine is 11 percent of the total cost of the electric generation power plant to be constructed by
BC. BC
began constructing the electric generation power plant in October 2017 and placed in service this new power plant, including all component parts, in 2020.
(B) The larger self-constructed property is the electric generation power plant to be constructed by
BC.
For determining if the construction of this power plant begins before September 28, 2017, paragraph (b)(5)(iv)(B) of this section provides that manufacture, construction, or production of property begins when physical work of a significant nature begins.
BC
uses the safe harbor test in paragraph (b)(5)(iv)(B)(
2
) of this section to determine when physical work of a significant nature begins for the electric generation power plant. Because the turbine that was manufactured by
CD
for
BC
is more than 10 percent of the total cost of the electric generation power plant, physical work of a significant nature for this plant began before September 28, 2017.
(C) The power plant is described in section 168(k)(9)(A) and paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(F) of this section and, therefore, is not larger self-constructed property eligible for the election pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(i)(B) of this section. Accordingly, none of
BC'
s expenditures for components of the power plant that are acquired or self-constructed after September 27, 2017, are eligible for the election specified in this paragraph (c). Assuming all requirements are met under section 168(k)(2) as in effect on the day before the date of the enactment of the Act, the unadjusted depreciable basis of the power plant, including all components, attributable to its construction before January 1, 2020, is eligible for the 30-percent additional first year depreciation deduction pursuant to section 168(k)(8).
(ii)
Example 2.
(A) In August 2017,
BD,
a calendar-year taxpayer, entered into a written binding contract with
CE
for
CE
to manufacture a locomotive for
BD
for use in its trade or business. Before September 28, 2017,
BD
acquired or self-constructed components of the locomotive. These components cost $500,000, which is more than 10 percent of the total cost of the locomotive, and
BD
incurred such costs before September 28, 2017. After September 27, 2017,
BD
acquired or self-constructed components of the locomotive and these components cost $4,000,000. In February 2019,
CE
delivered the locomotive to
BD
and
BD
placed in service the locomotive. The total cost of the locomotive is $4,500,000. The locomotive is property described in section 168(k)(2)(B) as in effect on the day before the date of the enactment of the Act. On its timely filed Federal income tax return for 2019,
BD
made the election specified in this paragraph (c).
(B) The larger self-constructed property is the locomotive being manufactured by
CE
for
BD.
For determining if the manufacturing of this locomotive begins before September 28, 2017, paragraph (b)(5)(iv)(B) of this section provides that manufacture, construction, or production of property begins when physical work of a significant nature begins.
BD
uses the safe harbor test in paragraph (b)(5)(iv)(B)(
2
) of this section to determine when physical work of a significant nature begins for the locomotive. Because
BD
had incurred more than 10 percent of the total cost of the locomotive before September 28, 2017, physical work of a significant nature for this locomotive began before September 28, 2017.
(C) Because
BD
made the election specified in this paragraph (c), the cost of $4,000,000 for the locomotive's components acquired or self-constructed after September 27, 2017, qualifies for the 100-percent additional first year depreciation deduction under this section, assuming all other requirements are met. The remaining cost of the locomotive is $500,000 and such amount qualifies for the 40-percent additional first year depreciation deduction pursuant to section 168(k)(8), assuming all other requirements in section 168(k) as in effect on the day before the date of the enactment of the Act are met.
(iii)
Example 3.
(A) In February 2016,
BF,
a calendar-year taxpayer, entered into a written binding contract with
CG
for
CG
to manufacture a vessel for
BF
for use in its trade or business. Before September 28, 2017,
BF
acquired or self-constructed components for the vessel. These components cost $30,000,000, which is more than 10 percent of the total cost of the vessel, and
BF
incurred such costs before September 28, 2017. After September 27, 2017,
BF
acquired or self-constructed components for the vessel and these components cost $15,000,000. In February 2021,
CG
delivered the vessel to
BF
and
BF
placed in service the vessel. The vessel is property described in section 168(k)(2)(B) as in effect on the day before the date of the enactment of the Act. The total cost of the vessel is $45,000,000. On its timely filed Federal income tax return for 2021,
BF
made the election specified in this paragraph (c).
(B) The larger self-constructed property is the vessel being manufactured by
CG
for
BF.
For determining if the manufacturing of this vessel begins before September 28, 2017, paragraph (b)(5)(iv)(B) of this section provides that manufacture, construction, or production of property begins when physical work of a significant nature begins.
BF
uses the safe harbor test in paragraph (b)(5)(iv)(B)(
2
) of this section
to determine when physical work of a significant nature begins for the vessel. Because
BF
had incurred more than 10 percent of the total cost of the vessel before September 28, 2017, physical work of a significant nature for this vessel began before September 28, 2017.
(C) Because
BF
made the election specified in this paragraph (c), the cost of $15,000,000 for the vessel's components acquired or self-constructed after September 27, 2017, qualifies for the 100-percent additional first year depreciation deduction under this section, assuming all other requirements are met. Pursuant to section 168(k)(8) and because
BF
placed in service the vessel after 2020, none of the remaining cost of the vessel is eligible for any additional first year depreciation deduction under section 168(k) and this section nor under section 168(k) as in effect on the day before the date of the enactment of the Act.
(iv)
Example 4.
(A) In March 2017,
BG,
a calendar year taxpayer, entered into a written contract with
CH
for
CH
to construct a building for
BG
to use in its retail business. This written contract does not meet the definition of a binding contract in paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this section. In September 2019, the construction of the building was completed and placed in service by
BG.
The total cost is $10,000,000. Of this amount, $3,000,000 is the total cost for all section 1245 properties constructed as part of the building, and $7,000,000 is for the building. Under section 168(e), section 1245 properties in the total amount of $2,400,000 are 5-year property and in the total amount of $600,000 are 7-year property. The building is nonresidential real property under section 168(e). Before September 28, 2017,
BG
acquired or self-constructed certain components and the total cost of these components is $500,000 for the section 1245 properties and $3,000,000 for the building.
BG
incurred these costs before September 28, 2017. After September 27, 2017,
BG
acquired or self-constructed the remaining components of the section 1245 properties and these components cost $2,500,000.
BG
incurred these costs of $2,500,000 after September 27, 2017. On its timely filed Federal income tax return for 2019,
BG
made the election specified in this paragraph (c).
(B) All section 1245 properties are constructed as part of the construction of the building and are described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) of this section. The building is not described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A), (B), (C), or (D) of this section. As a result, under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, the larger self-constructed property is all section 1245 properties with a total cost of $3,000,000. For determining if the construction of these section 1245 properties begins before September 28, 2017, paragraph (b)(5)(v) of this section provides that manufacture, construction, or production of property begins when the taxpayer incurs more than 10 percent of the total cost of the property. Because
BG
incurred more than 10 percent of the total cost of the section 1245 properties before September 28, 2017, construction of the section 1245 properties began before September 28, 2017.
(C) Because
BG
made the election specified in this paragraph (c), the cost of $2,500,000 for the section 1245 components acquired or self-constructed by
BG
after September 27, 2017, qualifies for the 100-percent additional first year depreciation deduction under this section, assuming all other requirements are met. The remaining cost of the section 1245 components is $500,000 and such amount qualifies for the 30-percent additional first year depreciation deduction pursuant to section 168(k)(8), assuming all other requirements in section 168(k), as in effect on the day before the date of the enactment of the Act, are met. Because the building is not qualified property under section 168(k), as in effect on the day before the date of the enactment of the Act, none of the cost of $7,000,000 for the building is eligible for any additional first year depreciation deduction under section 168(k) and this section or under section 168(k), as in effect on the day before the date of the enactment of the Act.
(d)
Property described in section 168(k)(2)(B) or (C)
—(1)
In general.
Property described in section 168(k)(2)(B) or (C) will meet the acquisition requirements of section 168(k)(2)(B)(i)(III) or (k)(2)(C)(i) if the property is acquired by the taxpayer before January 1, 2027, or acquired by the taxpayer pursuant
to a written binding contract that is entered into before January 1, 2027. Property described in section 168(k)(2)(B) or (C), including its components, also must meet the acquisition requirement in section 13201(h)(1)(A) of the Act (for further guidance, see paragraph (b)(5) of this section).
(2)
Definition of binding contract.
For purposes of this paragraph (d), the rules in paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this section for a binding contract apply.
(3)
Self-constructed property
—(i)
In general.
If a taxpayer manufactures, constructs, or produces property for use by the taxpayer in its trade or business or for its production of income, the acquisition rules in paragraph (d)(1) of this section are treated as met for the property if the taxpayer begins manufacturing, constructing, or producing the property before January 1, 2027. Property that is manufactured, constructed, or produced for the taxpayer by another person under a written binding contract, as defined in paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this section, that is entered into prior to the manufacture, construction, or production of the property for use by the taxpayer in its trade or business or for its production of income is considered to be manufactured, constructed, or produced by the taxpayer. If a taxpayer enters into a written binding contract, as defined in paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this section, before January 1, 2027, with another person to manufacture, construct, or produce property described in section 168(k)(2)(B) or (C) and the manufacture, construction, or production of this property begins after December 31, 2026, the acquisition rule in paragraph (d)(1) of this section is met.
(ii)
When does manufacture, construction, or production begin
—(A)
In general.
For purposes of this paragraph (d)(3), manufacture, construction, or production of property begins when physical work of a significant nature begins. Physical work does not include preliminary activities such as planning or designing, securing financing, exploring, or researching. The determination of when physical work of a significant nature begins depends on the facts and circumstances. For example, if a retail motor fuels outlet is to be constructed on-site, construction begins when physical work of a significant nature commences at the site; that is, when work begins on the excavation for footings, pouring the pads for the outlet, or the driving of foundation pilings into the ground. Preliminary work, such as clearing a site, test drilling to determine soil condition, or excavation to change the contour of the land (as distinguished from excavation for footings) does not constitute the beginning of construction. However, if a retail motor fuels outlet is to be assembled on-site from modular units manufactured off-site and delivered to the site where the outlet will be used, manufacturing begins when physical work of a significant nature commences at the off-site location.
(B)
Safe harbor.
For purposes of paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, a taxpayer may choose to determine when physical work of a significant nature begins in accordance with this paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(B). Physical work of a significant nature will be considered to begin at the time the taxpayer incurs (in the case of an accrual basis taxpayer) or pays (in the case of a cash basis taxpayer) more than 10 percent of the total cost of the property, excluding the cost of any land and preliminary activities such as planning or designing, securing financing, exploring, or researching. When property is manufactured, constructed, or produced for the taxpayer by another person, this safe harbor test must be satisfied by the taxpayer. For example, if a retail motor fuels outlet is to be constructed for an accrual basis taxpayer by another person for the total cost of $200,000, excluding the cost of any land and preliminary activities such as planning or designing, securing financing, exploring, or researching, construction is deemed to begin for purposes of this paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(B) when the taxpayer has incurred more than 10 percent (more than $20,000) of the total cost of the property. A taxpayer chooses to apply this paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(B) by filing a Federal income tax return for the placed-in-service year of the property that determines when physical work of a significant nature begins consistent with this paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(B).
(iii)
Components of self-constructed property
—(A)
Acquired components.
If a binding contract, as defined in paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this section, to acquire a component does not satisfy the requirements of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the component does not qualify for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section. A binding contract described in the preceding sentence to acquire one or more components of a larger self-constructed property will not preclude the larger self-constructed property from satisfying the acquisition rules in paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section. Accordingly, the unadjusted depreciable basis of the larger self-constructed property that is eligible for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section, assuming all other requirements are met, must not include the unadjusted depreciable basis of any component that does not satisfy the requirements of paragraph (d)(1) of this section. If a binding contract to acquire the component is entered into before January 1, 2027, but the manufacture, construction, or production of the larger self-constructed property does not begin before January 1, 2027, the component qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section, assuming all other requirements are met, but the larger self-constructed property does not.
(B)
Self-constructed components.
If the manufacture, construction, or production of a component by the taxpayer does not satisfy the requirements of paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, the component does not qualify for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section. However, if the manufacture, construction, or production of a component does not satisfy the requirements of paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, but the manufacture, construction, or production of the larger self-constructed property satisfies the requirements of paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, the larger self-constructed property qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section, assuming all other requirements are met, even though the component does not qualify for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section. Accordingly, the unadjusted depreciable basis of the larger self-constructed property that is eligible for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section, assuming all other requirements are met, must not include the unadjusted depreciable basis of any component that does not qualify for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section. If the manufacture, construction, or production of a component begins before January 1, 2027, but the manufacture, construction, or production of the larger self-constructed property does not begin before January 1, 2027, the component qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section, assuming all other requirements are met, but the larger self-constructed property does not.
(iv)
Determination of acquisition date for property not acquired pursuant to a written binding contract.
For purposes of the acquisition rules in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the following property is acquired by the taxpayer before January 1, 2027, if the taxpayer paid, in the case of a cash basis taxpayer, or incurred, in the case of an accrual basis taxpayer, more than 10 percent of the total cost of the property before January 1, 2027, excluding the cost of any land and preliminary activities such as planning and designing, securing financing, exploring, or researching:
(A) Property that the taxpayer acquires pursuant to a contract that does not meet the definition of a written binding contract in paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this section; or
(B) Property that is manufactured, constructed, or produced for the taxpayer by another person under a written contract that does not meet the definition of a binding contract in paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this section, and that is entered into prior to the manufacture, construction, or production of the property for use by the taxpayer in its trade or business or production of income.
(4)
Examples.
The application of this paragraph (d) is illustrated by the following examples:
(A)
Example 1.
(
1
) On June 1, 2016,
NN
decided to construct property described in section 168(k)(2)(B) for its own use.
However, one of the component parts of the property had to be manufactured by another person for
NN.
On August 15, 2016,
NN
entered into a written binding contract with
OO
to acquire this component part of the property for $100,000.
OO
began manufacturing the component part on November 1, 2016, and delivered the completed component part to
NN
on September 1, 2017, at which time
NN
incurred $100,000 for the cost of the component. The cost of this component part is 9 percent of the total cost of the property to be constructed by
NN. NN
did not incur any other cost of the property to be constructed before
NN
began construction.
NN
began constructing the property described in section 168(k)(2)(B) on October 15, 2017, and placed in service this property, including all component parts, on November 1, 2020.
NN
uses the safe harbor test in paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(B) of this section to determine when physical work of a significant nature begins for the property described in section 168(k)(2)(B).
(
2
) Because the component part of $100,000 that was manufactured by
OO
for
NN
is not more than 10 percent of the total cost of the property described in section 168(k)(2)(B), physical work of a significant nature for the property described in section 168(k)(2)(B) did not begin before September 28, 2017.
(
3
) Pursuant to paragraphs (b)(5)(iv)(C)(
2
) and (d)(1) of this section, the self-constructed component part of $100,000 manufactured by
OO
for
NN
is not eligible for the 100-percent additional first year depreciation deduction because the manufacturing of such component part began before September 28, 2017. However, pursuant to paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, the cost of the property described in section 168(k)(2)(B), excluding the cost of the component part of $100,000 manufactured by
OO
for
NN,
is eligible for the 100-percent additional first year depreciation deduction, assuming all other requirements are met, because construction of the property began after September 27, 2017, and before January 1, 2027, and the property described in section 168(k)(2)(B) was placed in service by
NN
during 2020.
(B)
Example 2.
(
1
) On June 1, 2026,
PP
decided to construct property described in section 168(k)(2)(B) for its own use. However, one of the component parts of the property had to be manufactured by another person for
PP.
On August 15, 2026,
PP
entered into a written binding contract with
XP
to acquire this component part of the property for $100,000.
XP
began manufacturing the component part on September 1, 2026, and delivered the completed component part to
PP
on February 1, 2027, at which time
PP
incurred $100,000 for the cost of the component. The cost of this component part is 9 percent of the total cost of the property to be constructed by
PP. PP
did not incur any other cost of the property to be constructed before
PP
began construction.
PP
began constructing the property described in section 168(k)(2)(B) on January 15, 2027, and placed this property, including all component parts, in service on November 1, 2027.
(
2
) Pursuant to paragraph (d)(3)(iii)(B) of this section, the self-constructed component part of $100,000 manufactured by
XP
for
PP
is eligible for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section, assuming all other requirements are met, because the manufacturing of the component part began before January 1, 2027, and the property described in section 168(k)(2)(B), the larger self-constructed property, was placed in service by
PP
before January 1, 2028. However, pursuant to paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, the cost of the property described in section 168(k)(2)(B), excluding the cost of the self-constructed component part of $100,000 manufactured by
XP
for
PP,
is not eligible for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section because construction of the property began after December 31, 2026.
(C)
Example 3.
On December 1, 2026,
QQ
entered into a written binding contract, as defined in paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this section, with
RR
to manufacture an aircraft described in section 168(k)(2)(C) for use in
QQ'
s trade or business.
RR
begins to manufacture the aircraft on February 1, 2027.
QQ
places the aircraft in service on August 1, 2027. Pursuant to paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, the aircraft meets the requirements of paragraph (d)(1) of this
section because the aircraft was acquired by
QQ
pursuant to a written binding contract entered into before January 1, 2027. Further, the aircraft was placed in service by
QQ
before January 1, 2028. Thus, assuming all other requirements are met,
QQ'
s cost of the aircraft is eligible for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section.
(e)
Computation of depreciation deduction for qualified property
—(1)
Additional first year depreciation deduction
—(i)
Allowable taxable year.
The additional first year depreciation deduction is allowable—
(A) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(1)(i)(B) or (g) of this section, in the taxable year in which the qualified property is placed in service by the taxpayer for use in its trade or business or for the production of income; or
(B) In the taxable year in which the specified plant is planted, or grafted to a plant that has already been planted, by the taxpayer in the ordinary course of the taxpayer's farming business, as defined in section 263A(e)(4), if the taxpayer properly made the election to apply section 168(k)(5) (for further guidance, see paragraph (f) of this section).
(ii)
Computation.
Except as provided in paragraph (g)(5) of this section, the allowable additional first year depreciation deduction for qualified property is determined by multiplying the unadjusted depreciable basis, as defined in § 1.168(b)-1(a)(3), of the qualified property by the applicable percentage. Except as provided in paragraph (g)(1) of this section, the additional first year depreciation deduction is not affected by a taxable year of less than 12 months. See paragraph (g)(1) of this section for qualified property placed in service or planted or grafted, as applicable, and disposed of during the same taxable year. See paragraph (g)(5) of this section for qualified property acquired in a like-kind exchange or as a result of an involuntary conversion.
(iii)
Property described in section 168(k)(2)(B).
For purposes of paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section, the unadjusted depreciable basis, as defined in § 1.168(b)-1(a)(3), of qualified property described in section 168(k)(2)(B) is limited to the property's unadjusted depreciable basis attributable to the property's manufacture, construction, or production before January 1, 2027. The amounts of unadjusted depreciable basis attributable to the property's manufacture, construction, or production before January 1, 2027, are referred to as “progress expenditures.” Rules similar to the rules in section 4.02(1)(b) of Notice 2007-36 (2007-17 I.R.B. 1000) (see § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(
b
) of this chapter) apply for determining progress expenditures, regardless of whether the property is manufactured, constructed, or produced for the taxpayer by another person under a written binding contract, as defined in paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this section, or under a written contract that does not meet the definition of a binding contract in paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this section. The IRS may publish procedural guidance in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(
b
) of this chapter) that provides alternative procedures for complying with this paragraph (e)(1)(iii).
(iv)
Alternative minimum tax
—(A)
In general.
The additional first year depreciation deduction is allowable for alternative minimum tax purposes—
(
1
) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(1)(iv)(A)(
2
) of this section, in the taxable year in which the qualified property is placed in service by the taxpayer; or
(
2
) In the taxable year in which a specified plant is planted by the taxpayer, or grafted by the taxpayer to a plant that was previously planted, if the taxpayer properly made the election to apply section 168(k)(5) (for further guidance, see paragraph (f) of this section).
(B)
Special rules.
In general, the additional first year depreciation deduction for alternative minimum tax purposes is based on the unadjusted depreciable basis of the property for alternative minimum tax purposes. However, see paragraph (g)(5)(iii)(E) of this section for qualified property acquired in a like-kind exchange or as a result of an involuntary conversion.
(2)
Otherwise allowable depreciation deduction
—(i)
In general.
Before determining the amount otherwise allowable as a depreciation deduction for the qualified property for the placed-in-
service year and any subsequent taxable year, the taxpayer must determine the remaining adjusted depreciable basis of the qualified property. This remaining adjusted depreciable basis is equal to the unadjusted depreciable basis, as defined in § 1.168(b)-1(a)(3), of the qualified property reduced by the amount of the additional first year depreciation allowed or allowable, whichever is greater. The remaining adjusted depreciable basis of the qualified property is then depreciated using the applicable depreciation provisions under the Internal Revenue Code for the qualified property. The remaining adjusted depreciable basis of the qualified property that is MACRS property is also the basis to which the annual depreciation rates in the optional depreciation tables apply (for further guidance, see section 8 of Rev. Proc. 87-57 (1987-2 C.B. 687) and § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(
b
) of this chapter). The depreciation deduction allowable for the remaining adjusted depreciable basis of the qualified property is affected by a taxable year of less than 12 months.
(ii)
Alternative minimum tax.
For alternative minimum tax purposes, the depreciation deduction allowable for the remaining adjusted depreciable basis of the qualified property is based on the remaining adjusted depreciable basis for alternative minimum tax purposes. The remaining adjusted depreciable basis of the qualified property for alternative minimum tax purposes is depreciated using the same depreciation method, recovery period (or useful life in the case of computer software), and convention that apply to the qualified property for regular tax purposes.
(3)
Examples.
This paragraph (e) is illustrated by the following examples:
(i)
Example 1.
On March 1, 2023,
SS,
a calendar-year taxpayer, purchased and placed in service qualified property that costs $1 million and is 5-year property under section 168(e).
SS
depreciates its 5-year property placed in service in 2023 using the optional depreciation table that corresponds with the general depreciation system, the 200-percent declining balance method, a 5-year recovery period, and the half-year convention. For 2023,
SS
is allowed an 80-percent additional first year depreciation deduction of $800,000 (the unadjusted depreciable basis of $1 million multiplied by 0.80). Next,
SS
must reduce the unadjusted depreciable basis of $1 million by the additional first year depreciation deduction of $800,000 to determine the remaining adjusted depreciable basis of $200,000. Then,
SS'
depreciation deduction allowable in 2023 for the remaining adjusted depreciable basis of $200,000 is $40,000 (the remaining adjusted depreciable basis of $200,000 multiplied by the annual depreciation rate of 0.20 for recovery year 1).
(ii)
Example 2.
On June 1, 2023,
TT,
a calendar-year taxpayer, purchased and placed in service qualified property that costs $1,500,000. The property qualifies for the expensing election under section 179 and is 5-year property under section 168(e).
TT
did not purchase any other section 179 property in 2023.
TT
makes the election under section 179 for the property and depreciates its 5-year property placed in service in 2023 using the optional depreciation table that corresponds with the general depreciation system, the 200-percent declining balance method, a 5-year recovery period, and the half-year convention. Assume the maximum section 179 deduction for 2023 is $1,000,000. For 2023,
TT
is first allowed a $1,000,000 deduction under section 179. Next,
TT
must reduce the cost of $1,500,000 by the section 179 deduction of $1,000,000 to determine the unadjusted depreciable basis of $500,000. Then, for 2023,
TT
is allowed an 80-percent additional first year depreciation deduction of $400,000 (the unadjusted depreciable basis of $500,000 multiplied by 0.80). Next,
TT
must reduce the unadjusted depreciable basis of $500,000 by the additional first year depreciation deduction of $400,000 to determine the remaining adjusted depreciable basis of $100,000. Then,
TT'
s depreciation deduction allowable in 2023 for the remaining adjusted depreciable basis of $100,000 is $20,000 (the remaining adjusted depreciable basis of $100,000 multiplied by the annual depreciation rate of 0.20 for recovery year 1).
(f)
Elections under section 168(k)
—(1)
Election not to deduct additional first year depreciation
—(i)
In general.
A taxpayer may make an election not to deduct the additional first year depreciation for any class of property that is
qualified property placed in service during the taxable year. If this election is made, the election applies to all qualified property that is in the same class of property and placed in service in the same taxable year, and no additional first year depreciation deduction is allowable for the property placed in service during the taxable year in the class of property, except as provided in § 1.743-1(j)(4)(i)(B)(
1
).
(ii)
Definition of class of property.
For purposes of this paragraph (f)(1), the term
class of property
means:

Time and manner for making election
—(A)
Time for making election.
Except as provided in paragraph (f)(6) of this section, any election specified in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section must be made by the due date, including extensions, of the Federal tax return for the taxable year in which the qualified property is placed in service by the taxpayer.
(B)
Manner of making election.
Except as provided in paragraph (f)(6) of this section, any election specified in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section must be made in the manner prescribed on Form 4562, “Depreciation and Amortization,” and its instructions. The election is made separately by each person owning qualified property (for example, for each member of a consolidated group by the common parent of the group, by the partnership (including a lower-tier partnership; also including basis adjustments in the partnership assets under section 743(b)), or by the S corporation). If Form 4562 is revised or renumbered, any reference in this section to that form shall be treated as a reference to the revised or renumbered form.
(iv)
Failure to make election.
If a taxpayer does not make the election specified in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section within the time and in the manner prescribed in paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of this section, the amount of depreciation allowable for that property under section 167 or 168, as applicable, must be determined for the placed-in-service year and for all subsequent taxable years by taking into account the additional first year depreciation deduction. Thus, any election specified in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section shall not be made by the taxpayer in any other manner (for example, the election cannot be made through a request under section 446(e) to change the taxpayer's method of accounting).
(2)
Election to apply section 168(k)(5)

Except as provided in paragraph (f)(6) of this section, any election specified in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section must be made in the manner prescribed on Form 4562, “Depreciation and Amortization,” and its instructions. The election is made separately by each person owning specified plants (for example, for each member of a consolidated group by the common parent of the group, by the partnership (including a lower-tier partnership), or by the S corporation). If Form 4562 is revised or renumbered, any reference in this section to that form shall be treated as a reference to the revised or renumbered form.
(iii)
Failure to make election.
If a taxpayer does not make the election specified in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section for a specified plant within the time and in the manner prescribed in paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section, the specified plant is treated as qualified property under section 168(k), assuming all requirements are met, in the taxable year in which such plant is placed in service by the taxpayer. Thus, any election specified in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section shall not be made by the taxpayer in any other manner (for example, the election cannot be made through a request under section 446(e) to change the taxpayer's method of accounting).
(3)
Election for qualified property placed in service during the 2017 taxable year
—(i)
In general.
A taxpayer may make an election to deduct 50 percent, instead of 100 percent, additional first year depreciation for all qualified property acquired after September 27, 2017, by the taxpayer and placed in service by the taxpayer during its taxable year that includes September 28, 2017. If a taxpayer makes an election to apply section 168(k)(5) for its taxable year that includes September 28, 2017, the taxpayer also may make an election to deduct 50 percent, instead of 100 percent, additional first year depreciation for all specified plants that are planted, or grafted to a plant that has already been planted, after September 27, 2017, by the taxpayer in the ordinary course of the taxpayer's farming business during such taxable year.

Except as provided in paragraph (f)(6) of this section, any election specified in paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section must be made in the manner prescribed on the 2017 Form 4562, “Depreciation and Amortization,” and its instructions. The election is made separately by each person owning qualified property (for example, for each member of a consolidated group by the common parent of the group, by the partnership (including a lower-tier partnership), or by the S corporation).
(iii)
Failure to make election.
If a taxpayer does not make the election specified in paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section within the time and in the manner prescribed in paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of this section, the amount of depreciation allowable for qualified property under section 167 or 168, as applicable, acquired and placed in service, or planted or grafted, as applicable, by the taxpayer after September 27, 2017, must be determined for the taxable year that includes September 28, 2017, and for all subsequent taxable years by taking into account the 100-percent additional first year depreciation deduction, unless the taxpayer makes the election specified in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section within the time and in the manner prescribed in paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of this section for the class of property in which the qualified property is included. Thus, any election specified in paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section shall not be made by the taxpayer in any other manner (for example, the election cannot be made through a request under section 446(e) to change the taxpayer's method of accounting).
(4)
Alternative minimum tax.
If a taxpayer makes an election specified in paragraph (f)(1) of this section for a class of property or in paragraph (f)(2)
of this section for a specified plant, the depreciation adjustments under section 56 and the regulations in this part under section 56 do not apply to the property or specified plant, as applicable, to which that election applies for purposes of computing the taxpayer's alternative minimum taxable income. If a taxpayer makes an election specified in paragraph (f)(3) of this section for all qualified property, see paragraphs (e)(1)(iv) and (e)(2)(ii) of this section.
(5)
Revocation of election
-(i)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraphs (f)(5)(ii) and (f)(6) of this section, an election specified in this paragraph (f), once made, may be revoked only by filing a request for a private letter ruling and obtaining the Commissioner of Internal Revenue's written consent to revoke the election. The Commissioner may grant a request to revoke the election if the taxpayer acted reasonably and in good faith, and the revocation will not prejudice the interests of the Government. See generally § 301.9100-3 of this chapter. An election specified in this paragraph (f) may not be revoked through a request under section 446(e) to change the taxpayer's method of accounting.
(ii)
Automatic 6-month extension.
If a taxpayer made an election specified in this paragraph (f), an automatic extension of 6 months from the due date of the taxpayer's Federal tax return, excluding extensions, for the placed-in-service year or the taxable year in which the specified plant is planted or grafted, as applicable, is granted to revoke that election, provided the taxpayer timely filed the taxpayer's Federal tax return for the placed-in-service year or the taxable year in which the specified plant is planted or grafted, as applicable, and, within this 6-month extension period, the taxpayer, and all taxpayers whose tax liability would be affected by the election, file an amended Federal tax return for the placed-in-service year or the taxable year in which the specified plant is planted or grafted, as applicable, in a manner that is consistent with the revocation of the election.
(6)
Special rules for 2016 and 2017 returns.
For an election specified in this paragraph (f) for qualified property placed in service, or for a specified plant that is planted, or grafted to a plant that has already been planted, by the taxpayer during its taxable year that included September 28, 2017, the taxpayer should refer to Rev. Proc. 2019-33 (2019-34 I.R.B. 662) (see§ 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(
b
) of this chapter) for the time and manner of making the election on the 2016 or 2017 Federal tax return.
(7)
Additional procedural guidance.
The IRS may publish procedural guidance in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(
b
) of this chapter) that provides alternative procedures for complying with paragraph (f)(1)(iii), (f)(1)(iv), (f)(2)(ii), (f)(2)(iii), (f)(3)(ii), (f)(3)(iii), or (f)(5)(i) of this section.
(g)
Special rules
—(1)
Property placed in service and disposed of in the same taxable year
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraphs (g)(1)(ii) and (iii) of this section and by the application of paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B)(
4
) of this section, the additional first year depreciation deduction is not allowed for qualified property placed in service or planted or grafted, as applicable, and disposed of during the same taxable year. If a partnership interest is acquired and disposed of during the same taxable year, the additional first year depreciation deduction is not allowed for any section 743(b) adjustment arising from the initial acquisition. Also, if qualified property is placed in service and disposed of during the same taxable year and then reacquired and again placed in service in a subsequent taxable year, the additional first year depreciation deduction is not allowable for the property in the subsequent taxable year, except as otherwise provided by the application of paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B) of this section.
(ii)
Technical termination of a partnership.
In the case of a technical termination of a partnership under section 708(b)(1)(B) in a taxable year beginning before January 1, 2018, the additional first year depreciation deduction is allowable for any qualified property placed in service or planted or grafted, as applicable, by the terminated partnership during the taxable year of termination and contributed by the terminated partnership to the new partnership. The allowable additional first
year depreciation deduction for the qualified property shall not be claimed by the terminated partnership but instead shall be claimed by the new partnership for the new partnership's taxable year in which the qualified property was contributed by the terminated partnership to the new partnership. However, if qualified property is both placed in service or planted or grafted, as applicable, and contributed to a new partnership in a transaction described in section 708(b)(1)(B) by the terminated partnership during the taxable year of termination, and if such property is disposed of by the new partnership in the same taxable year the new partnership received such property from the terminated partnership, then no additional first year depreciation deduction is allowable to either partnership.
(iii)
Section 168(i)(7) transactions.
If any qualified property is transferred in a transaction described in section 168(i)(7) in the same taxable year that the qualified property is placed in service or planted or grafted, as applicable, by the transferor, the additional first year depreciation deduction is allowable for the qualified property. If a partnership interest is purchased and transferred in a transaction described in section 168(i)(7) in the same taxable year, the additional first year depreciation deduction is allowable for any section 743(b) adjustment that arises from the initial acquisition with respect to qualified property held by the partnership, provided the requirements of paragraph (b)(3)(iv)(D) of this section and all other requirements of section 168(k) and this section are satisfied. The allowable additional first year depreciation deduction for the qualified property for the transferor's taxable year in which the property is placed in service or planted or grafted, as applicable, is allocated between the transferor and the transferee on a monthly basis. The allowable additional first year depreciation deduction for a section 743(b) adjustment with respect to qualified property held by the partnership is allocated between the transferor and the transferee on a monthly basis notwithstanding that under § 1.743-1(f) a transferee's section 743(b) adjustment is determined without regard to a transferors section 743(b) adjustment. These allocations shall be made in accordance with the rules in § 1.168(d)-1(b)(7)(ii) for allocating the depreciation deduction between the transferor and the transferee. However, solely for purposes of this section, if the qualified property is transferred in a section 721(a) transaction to a partnership that has as a partner a person, other than the transferor, who previously had a depreciable interest in the qualified property, in the same taxable year that the qualified property is acquired or planted or grafted, as applicable, by the transferor, the qualified property is deemed to be placed in service or planted or grafted, as applicable, by the transferor during that taxable year, and the allowable additional first year depreciation deduction is allocated entirely to the transferor and not to the partnership. Additionally, if qualified property is both placed in service or planted or grafted, as applicable, and transferred in a transaction described in section 168(i)(7) by the transferor during the same taxable year, and if such property is disposed of by the transferee, other than by a transaction described in section 168(i)(7), during the same taxable year the transferee received such property from the transferor, then no additional first year depreciation deduction is allowable to either party.
(iv)
Examples.
The application of this paragraph (g)(1) is illustrated by the following examples:
(A)
Example 1. UU
and
VV
are equal partners in
Partnership JL,
a general partnership.
Partnership JL
is a calendar-year taxpayer. On October 1, 2017,
Partnership JL
purchased and placed in service qualified property at a cost of $30,000. On November 1, 2017,
UU
sells its entire 50 percent interest to
WW
in a transfer that terminates the partnership under section 708(b)(1)(B). As a result, terminated
Partnership JL
is deemed to have contributed the qualified property to new
Partnership JL.
Pursuant to paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section, new
Partnership JL,
not terminated
Partnership JL,
is eligible to claim the 100-percent additional first year depreciation deduction allowable for the qualified property for the taxable year 2017, assuming all other requirements are met.
(B)
Example 2.
On January 5, 2018,
XX
purchased and placed in service qualified property for a total amount of $9,000. On August 20, 2018,
XX
transferred this qualified property to
Partnership BC
in a transaction described in section 721(a). No other partner of
Partnership BC
has ever had a depreciable interest in the qualified property.
XX
and
Partnership BC
are calendar-year taxpayers. Because the transaction between
XX
and
Partnership BC
is a transaction described in section 168(i)(7), pursuant to paragraph (g)(1)(iii) of this section, the 100-percent additional first year depreciation deduction allowable for the qualified property is allocated between
XX
and
Partnership BC
in accordance with the rules in § 1.168(d)-1(b)(7)(ii) for allocating the depreciation deduction between the transferor and the transferee. Accordingly, the 100-percent additional first year depreciation deduction allowable of $9,000 for the qualified property for 2018 is allocated between
XX
and
Partnership BC
based on the number of months that
XX
and
Partnership BC
held the qualified property in service during 2018. Thus, because the qualified property was held in service by
XX
for 7 of 12 months, which includes the month in which
XX
placed the qualified property in service but does not include the month in which the qualified property was transferred,
XX
is allocated $5,250 (
7/12
× $9,000 additional first year depreciation deduction).
Partnership BC
is allocated $3,750, the remaining
5/12
of the $9,000 additional first year depreciation deduction allowable for the qualified property.
(2)
Redetermination of basis.
If the unadjusted depreciable basis, as defined in § 1.168(b)-1(a)(3), of qualified property is redetermined (for example, due to contingent purchase price or discharge of indebtedness) before January 1, 2027, or in the case of property described in section 168(k)(2)(B) or (C), is redetermined before January 1, 2028, the additional first year depreciation deduction allowable for the qualified property is redetermined as follows:
(i)
Increase in basis.
For the taxable year in which an increase in basis of qualified property occurs, the taxpayer shall claim an additional first year depreciation deduction for qualified property by multiplying the amount of the increase in basis for this property by the applicable percentage for the taxable year in which the underlying property was placed in service by the taxpayer. For purposes of this paragraph (g)(2)(i), the additional first year depreciation deduction applies to the increase in basis only if the underlying property is qualified property. To determine the amount otherwise allowable as a depreciation deduction for the increase in basis of qualified property, the amount of the increase in basis of the qualified property must be reduced by the additional first year depreciation deduction allowed or allowable, whichever is greater, for the increase in basis and the remaining increase in basis of—
(A) Qualified property, except for computer software described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section, a qualified film or television production described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(E) of this section, or a qualified live theatrical production described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(F) of this section, is depreciated over the recovery period of the qualified property remaining as of the beginning of the taxable year in which the increase in basis occurs, and using the same depreciation method and convention applicable to the qualified property that applies for the taxable year in which the increase in basis occurs; and
(B) Computer software, as defined in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section, that is qualified property is depreciated ratably over the remainder of the 36-month period, the useful life under section 167(f)(1), as of the beginning of the first day of the month in which the increase in basis occurs.
(ii)
Decrease in basis.
For the taxable year in which a decrease in basis of qualified property occurs, the taxpayer shall reduce the total amount otherwise allowable as a depreciation deduction for all of the taxpayer's depreciable property by the excess additional first year depreciation deduction previously claimed for the qualified
property. If, for such taxable year, the excess additional first year depreciation deduction exceeds the total amount otherwise allowable as a depreciation deduction for all of the taxpayer's depreciable property, the taxpayer shall take into account a negative depreciation deduction in computing taxable income. The excess additional first year depreciation deduction for qualified property is determined by multiplying the amount of the decrease in basis for this property by the applicable percentage for the taxable year in which the underlying property was placed in service by the taxpayer. For purposes of this paragraph (g)(2)(ii), the additional first year depreciation deduction applies to the decrease in basis only if the underlying property is qualified property. Also, if the taxpayer establishes by adequate records or other sufficient evidence that the taxpayer claimed less than the additional first year depreciation deduction allowable for the qualified property before the decrease in basis, or if the taxpayer claimed more than the additional first year depreciation deduction allowable for the qualified property before the decrease in basis, the excess additional first year depreciation deduction is determined by multiplying the amount of the decrease in basis by the additional first year depreciation deduction percentage actually claimed by the taxpayer for the qualified property before the decrease in basis. To determine the amount to reduce the total amount otherwise allowable as a depreciation deduction for all of the taxpayer's depreciable property for the excess depreciation previously claimed, other than the additional first year depreciation deduction, resulting from the decrease in basis of the qualified property, the amount of the decrease in basis of the qualified property must be adjusted by the excess additional first year depreciation deduction that reduced the total amount otherwise allowable as a depreciation deduction, as determined under this paragraph (g)(2)(ii), and the remaining decrease in basis of—
(A) Qualified property, except for computer software described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section, a qualified film or television production described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(E) of this section, or a qualified live theatrical production described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(F) of this section, reduces the amount otherwise allowable as a depreciation deduction over the recovery period of the qualified property remaining as of the beginning of the taxable year in which the decrease in basis occurs, and using the same depreciation method and convention of the qualified property that applies in the taxable year in which the decrease in basis occurs. If, for any taxable year, the reduction to the amount otherwise allowable as a depreciation deduction, as determined under this paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(A), exceeds the total amount otherwise allowable as a depreciation deduction for all of the taxpayer's depreciable property, the taxpayer shall take into account a negative depreciation deduction in computing taxable income; and
(B) Computer software, as defined in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section, that is qualified property reduces the amount otherwise allowable as a depreciation deduction over the remainder of the 36-month period, the useful life under section 167(f)(1), as of the beginning of the first day of the month in which the decrease in basis occurs. If, for any taxable year, the reduction to the amount otherwise allowable as a depreciation deduction, as determined under this paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(B), exceeds the total amount otherwise allowable as a depreciation deduction for all of the taxpayer's depreciable property, the taxpayer shall take into account a negative depreciation deduction in computing taxable income.
(iii)
Definitions.
Except as otherwise expressly provided by the Internal Revenue Code (for example, section 1017(a)), the regulations under the Internal Revenue Code, or other guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin for purposes of this paragraph (g)(2)—
(A) An increase in basis occurs in the taxable year an amount is taken into account under section 461; and
(B) A decrease in basis occurs in the taxable year an amount would be taken into account under section 451.
(iv)
Examples.
The application of this paragraph (g)(2) is illustrated by the following examples:
(A)
Example 1.
(
1
) On May 15, 2023,
YY,
a cash-basis taxpayer, purchased and placed in service qualified property that is 5-year property at a cost of $200,000. In addition to the $200,000,
YY
agrees to pay the seller 25 percent of the gross profits from the operation of the property in 2023. On May 15, 2024,
YY
paid to the seller an additional $10,000.
YY
depreciates the 5-year property placed in service in 2023 using the optional depreciation table that corresponds with the general depreciation system, the 200-percent declining balance method, a 5-year recovery period, and the half-year convention.
(
2
) For 2023,
YY
is allowed an 80-percent additional first year depreciation deduction of $160,000 (the unadjusted depreciable basis of $200,000 multiplied by 0.80). In addition,
YY'
s depreciation deduction for 2023 for the remaining adjusted depreciable basis of $40,000 (the unadjusted depreciable basis of $200,000 reduced by the additional first year depreciation deduction of $160,000) is $8,000 (the remaining adjusted depreciable basis of $40,000 multiplied by the annual depreciation rate of 0.20 for recovery year 1).
(
3
) For 2024,
YY'
s depreciation deduction for the remaining adjusted depreciable basis of $40,000 is $12,800 (the remaining adjusted depreciable basis of $40,000 multiplied by the annual depreciation rate of 0.32 for recovery year 2). In addition, pursuant to paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section,
YY
is allowed an additional first year depreciation deduction for 2024 for the $10,000 increase in basis of the qualified property. Consequently,
YY
is allowed an additional first year depreciation deduction of $8,000 (the increase in basis of $10,000 multiplied by 0.80, the applicable percentage for 2023). Also,
YY
is allowed a depreciation deduction for 2024 attributable to the remaining increase in basis of $2,000 (the increase in basis of $10,000 reduced by the additional first year depreciation deduction of $8,000). The depreciation deduction allowable for 2024 attributable to the remaining increase in basis of $2,000 is $889 (the remaining increase in basis of $2,000 multiplied by 0.4444, which is equal to 1/remaining recovery period of 4.5 years at January 1, 2024, multiplied by 2). Accordingly, for 2024,
YY'
s total depreciation deduction allowable for the qualified property is $21,689 ($12,800 plus $8,000 plus $889).
(B)
Example 2.
(
1
) On May 15, 2023,
ZZ,
a calendar-year taxpayer, purchased and placed in service qualified property that is 5-year property at a cost of $400,000. To purchase the property,
ZZ
borrowed $250,000 from Bank1. On May 15, 2024, Bank1 forgives $50,000 of the indebtedness.
ZZ
makes the election provided in section 108(b)(5) to apply any portion of the reduction under section 1017 to the basis of the depreciable property of the taxpayer.
ZZ
depreciates the 5-year property placed in service in 2023 using the optional depreciation table that corresponds with the general depreciation system, the 200-percent declining balance method, a 5-year recovery period, and the half-year convention.
(
2
) For 2023,
ZZ
is allowed an 80-percent additional first year depreciation deduction of $320,000 (the unadjusted depreciable basis of $400,000 multiplied by 0.80). In addition,
ZZ'
s depreciation deduction allowable for 2023 for the remaining adjusted depreciable basis of $80,000 (the unadjusted depreciable basis of $400,000 reduced by the additional first year depreciation deduction of $320,000) is $16,000 (the remaining adjusted depreciable basis of $80,000 multiplied by the annual depreciation rate of 0.20 for recovery year 1).
(
3
) For 2024,
ZZ'
s deduction for the remaining adjusted depreciable basis of $80,000 is $25,600 (the remaining adjusted depreciable basis of $80,000 multiplied by the annual depreciation rate 0.32 for recovery year 2). Although Bank1 forgave the indebtedness in 2024, the basis of the property is reduced on January 1, 2025, pursuant to sections 108(b)(5) and 1017(a) under which basis is reduced at the beginning of the taxable year following the taxable year in which the discharge of indebtedness occurs.
(
4
) For 2025,
ZZ'
s deduction for the remaining adjusted depreciable basis of $80,000 is $15,360 (the remaining adjusted depreciable basis of $80,000 multiplied by the annual depreciation rate 0.192 for recovery year 3). However,
pursuant to paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section,
ZZ
must reduce the amount otherwise allowable as a depreciation deduction for 2025 by the excess depreciation previously claimed for the $50,000 decrease in basis of the qualified property. Consequently,
ZZ
must reduce the amount of depreciation otherwise allowable for 2025 by the excess additional first year depreciation of $40,000 (the decrease in basis of $50,000 multiplied by 0.80, the applicable percentage for 2023). Also,
ZZ
must reduce the amount of depreciation otherwise allowable for 2025 by the excess depreciation attributable to the remaining decrease in basis of $10,000 (the decrease in basis of $50,000 reduced by the excess additional first year depreciation of $40,000). The reduction in the amount of depreciation otherwise allowable for 2025 for the remaining decrease in basis of $10,000 is $5,714 (the remaining decrease in basis of $10,000 multiplied by 0.5714, which is equal to (1/remaining recovery period of 3.5 years at January 1, 2025, multiplied by 2). Accordingly, assuming the qualified property is the only depreciable property owned by
ZZ,
for 2025,
ZZ
has a negative depreciation deduction for the qualified property of $30,354 ($15,360 minus $40,000 minus $5,714).
(3)
Sections 1245 and 1250 depreciation recapture.
For purposes of section 1245 and §§ 1.1245-1 through -6, the additional first year depreciation deduction is an amount allowed or allowable for depreciation. Further, for purposes of section 1250(b) and § 1.1250-2, the additional first year depreciation deduction is not a straight line method.
(4)
Coordination with section 169.
The additional first year depreciation deduction is allowable in the placed-in-service year of a certified pollution control facility, as defined in § 1.169-2(a), that is qualified property even if the taxpayer makes the election to amortize the certified pollution control facility under section 169 and §§ 1.169-1 through -4 in the certified pollution control facility's placed-in-service year.
(5)

(iii)
Computation
—(A)
In general.
If the replacement MACRS property or the replacement computer software, as applicable, meets the original use requirement in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section and all other requirements of section 168(k) and this section, the remaining exchanged basis for the year of replacement and the remaining excess basis, if any, for the year of replacement for the replacement MACRS property or the replacement computer software, as applicable, are eligible for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section. If the replacement MACRS property or the replacement computer software, as applicable, meets the used property acquisition requirements in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section and all other requirements of section 168(k) and this section, only the remaining excess basis for the year of replacement for the replacement MACRS property or the replacement computer software, as applicable, is eligible for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section. See paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A)(
3
) of this section. The additional first year depreciation deduction applies to the remaining exchanged basis and any remaining excess basis, as applicable, of the replacement MACRS property or the replacement computer software, as applicable, if the time of replacement is after September 27, 2017, and before January 1, 2027; or, in the case of replacement MACRS property or replacement computer software, as applicable, described in section 168(k)(2)(B) or (C), the time of replacement is after September 27, 2017, and before January 1, 2028. The additional first year depreciation deduction is computed separately for the remaining exchanged basis and any remaining excess basis, as applicable.
(B)
Year of disposition and year of replacement.
The additional first year depreciation deduction is allowable for
the replacement MACRS property or replacement computer software in the year of replacement. However, the additional first year depreciation deduction is not allowable for the relinquished MACRS property or the relinquished computer software, as applicable, if the relinquished MACRS property or the relinquished computer software, as applicable, is placed in service and disposed of in a like-kind exchange or in an involuntary conversion in the same taxable year.
(C)
Property described in section 168(k)(2)(B).
For purposes of paragraph (g)(5)(iii)(A) of this section, the total of the remaining exchanged basis and the remaining excess basis, if any, of the replacement MACRS property that is qualified property described in section 168(k)(2)(B) and meets the original use requirement in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section is limited to the total of the property's remaining exchanged basis and remaining excess basis, if any, attributable to the property's manufacture, construction, or production after September 27, 2017, and before January 1, 2027. For purposes of paragraph (g)(5)(iii)(A) of this section, the remaining excess basis, if any, of the replacement MACRS property that is qualified property described in section 168(k)(2)(B) and meets the used property acquisition requirements in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section is limited to the property's remaining excess basis, if any, attributable to the property's manufacture, construction, or production after September 27, 2017, and before January 1, 2027.
(D)
Effect of § 1.168(i)-6(i)(1) election.
If a taxpayer properly makes the election under § 1.168(i)-6(i)(1) not to apply § 1.168(i)-6 for any MACRS property, as defined in § 1.168(b)-1(a)(2), involved in a like-kind exchange or involuntary conversion, then:
(
1
) If the replacement MACRS property meets the original use requirement in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section and all other requirements of section 168(k) and this section, the total of the exchanged basis, as defined in § 1.168(i)-6(b)(7), and the excess basis, as defined in § 1.168(i)-6(b)(8), if any, in the replacement MACRS property is eligible for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section; or
(
2
) If the replacement MACRS property meets the used property acquisition requirements in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section and all other requirements of section 168(k) and this section, only the excess basis, as defined in § 1.168(i)-6(b)(8), if any, in the replacement MACRS property is eligible for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section.
(E)
Alternative minimum tax.
The additional first year depreciation deduction is allowed for alternative minimum tax purposes for the year of replacement of replacement MACRS property or replacement computer software, as applicable, that is qualified property. If the replacement MACRS property or the replacement computer software, as applicable, meets the original use requirement in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section and all other requirements of section 168(k) and this section, the additional first year depreciation deduction for alternative minimum tax purposes is based on the remaining exchanged basis and the remaining excess basis, if any, of the replacement MACRS property or the replacement computer software, as applicable, for alternative minimum tax purposes. If the replacement MACRS property or the replacement computer software, as applicable, meets the used property acquisition requirements in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section and all other requirements of section 168(k) and this section, the additional first year depreciation deduction for alternative minimum tax purposes is based on the remaining excess basis, if any, of the replacement MACRS property or the replacement computer software, as applicable, for alternative minimum tax purposes.
(iv)
Replacement MACRS property or replacement computer software that is acquired and placed in service before disposition of relinquished MACRS property or relinquished computer software.
If, in an involuntary conversion, a taxpayer acquires and places in service the replacement MACRS property or the replacement computer software, as applicable, before the time of disposition of the involuntarily converted MACRS property or the involuntarily converted computer software, as applicable; and the time of disposition of the
involuntarily converted MACRS property or the involuntarily converted computer software, as applicable, is after December 31, 2026, or, in the case of property described in service 168(k)(2)(B) or (C), after December 31, 2027, then—
(A) The time of replacement for purposes of this paragraph (g)(5) is when the replacement MACRS property or replacement computer software, as applicable, is placed in service by the taxpayer, provided the threat or imminence of requisition or condemnation of the involuntarily converted MACRS property or involuntarily converted computer software, as applicable, existed before January 1, 2027, or, in the case of property described in section 168(k)(2)(B) or (C), existed before January 1, 2028; and
(B) The taxpayer depreciates the replacement MACRS property or replacement computer software, as applicable, in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section. However, at the time of disposition of the involuntarily converted MACRS property, the taxpayer determines the exchanged basis, as defined in § 1.168(i)-6(b)(7), and the excess basis, as defined in § 1.168(i)-6(b)(8), of the replacement MACRS property and begins to depreciate the depreciable exchanged basis, as defined in § 1.168(i)-6(b)(9), of the replacement MACRS property in accordance with § 1.168(i)-6(c). The depreciable excess basis, as defined in § 1.168(i)-6(b)(10), of the replacement MACRS property continues to be depreciated by the taxpayer in accordance with the first sentence of this paragraph (g)(5)(iv)(B). Further, in the year of disposition of the involuntarily converted MACRS property, the taxpayer must include in taxable income the excess of the depreciation deductions allowable, including the additional first year depreciation deduction allowable, on the unadjusted depreciable basis of the replacement MACRS property over the additional first year depreciation deduction that would have been allowable to the taxpayer on the remaining exchanged basis of the replacement MACRS property at the time of replacement, as defined in paragraph (g)(5)(iv)(A) of this section, plus the depreciation deductions that would have been allowable, including the additional first year depreciation deduction allowable, to the taxpayer on the depreciable excess basis of the replacement MACRS property from the date the replacement MACRS property was placed in service by the taxpayer, taking into account the applicable convention, to the time of disposition of the involuntarily converted MACRS property. Similar rules apply to replacement computer software.
(v)
Examples.
The application of this paragraph (g)(5) is illustrated by the following examples:
(A)
Example 1.
(
1
) In April 2016,
CSK,
a calendar-year corporation, acquired for $200,000 and placed in service Canopy V1, a gas station canopy. Canopy V1 is qualified property under section 168(k)(2), as in effect on the day before amendment by the Act, and is 5-year property under section 168(e).
CSK
depreciated Canopy V1 under the general depreciation system of section 168(a) by using the 200-percent declining balance method of depreciation, a 5-year recovery period, and the half-year convention.
CSK
elected to use the optional depreciation tables to compute the depreciation allowance for Canopy V1. In November 2017, Canopy V1 was destroyed in a fire and was no longer usable in
CSK'
s business. In December 2017, in an involuntary conversion,
CSK
acquired and placed in service Canopy W1 with all of the $160,000 of insurance proceeds
CSK
received due to the loss of Canopy V1. Canopy W1 is qualified property under section 168(k)(2) and this section, and is 5-year property under section 168(e). Canopy W1 also meets the original use requirement in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section.
CSK
did not make the election under § 1.168(i)-6(i)(1).
(
2
) For 2016,
CSK
is allowed a 50-percent additional first year depreciation deduction of $100,000 for Canopy V1 (the unadjusted depreciable basis of $200,000 multiplied by 0.50), and a regular MACRS depreciation deduction of $20,000 for Canopy V1 (the remaining adjusted depreciable basis of $100,000 multiplied by the annual depreciation rate of 0.20 for recovery year 1).
(
3
) For 2017,
CSK
is allowed a regular MACRS depreciation deduction of $16,000 for Canopy V1 (the remaining adjusted depreciable basis of $100,000
multiplied by the annual depreciation rate of 0.32 for recovery year 2 ×
1/2
year).
(
4
) Pursuant to paragraph (g)(5)(iii)(A) of this section, the additional first year depreciation deduction allowable for Canopy W1 for 2017 equals $64,000 (100 percent of Canopy W1's remaining exchanged basis at the time of replacement of $64,000 (Canopy V1's remaining adjusted depreciable basis of $100,000 minus 2016 regular MACRS depreciation deduction of $20,000 minus 2017 regular MACRS depreciation deduction of $16,000)).
(B)
Example 2.
(
1
) The facts are the same as in
Example 1
of paragraph (g)(5)(v)(A)(
1
) of this section, except
CSK
elected not to deduct the additional first year depreciation for 5-year property placed in service in 2016.
CSK
deducted the additional first year depreciation for 5-year property placed in service in 2017.
(
2
) For 2016,
CSK
is allowed a regular MACRS depreciation deduction of $40,000 for Canopy V1 (the unadjusted depreciable basis of $200,000 multiplied by the annual depreciation rate of 0.20 for recovery year 1).
(
3
) For 2017,
CSK
is allowed a regular MACRS depreciation deduction of $32,000 for Canopy V1 (the unadjusted depreciable basis of $200,000 multiplied by the annual depreciation rate of 0.32 for recovery year 2 ×
1/2
year).
(
4
) Pursuant to paragraph (g)(5)(iii)(A) of this section, the additional first year depreciation deduction allowable for Canopy W1 for 2017 equals $128,000 (100 percent of Canopy W1's remaining exchanged basis at the time of replacement of $128,000 (Canopy V1's unadjusted depreciable basis of $200,000 minus 2016 regular MACRS depreciation deduction of $40,000 minus 2017 regular MACRS depreciation deduction of $32,000)).
(C)
Example 3.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1
of paragraph (g)(5)(v)(A)(
1
) of this section, except Canopy W1 meets the used property acquisition requirements in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section. Because the remaining excess basis of Canopy W1 is zero,
CSK
is not allowed any additional first year depreciation for Canopy W1 pursuant to paragraph (g)(5)(iii)(A) of this section.
(D)
Example 4.
(
1
) In December 2016,
AB,
a calendar-year corporation, acquired for $10,000 and placed in service Computer X2. Computer X2 is qualified property under section 168(k)(2), as in effect on the day before amendment by the Act, and is 5-year property under section 168(e).
AB
depreciated Computer X2 under the general depreciation system of section 168(a) by using the 200-percent declining balance method of depreciation, a 5-year recovery period, and the half-year convention.
AB
elected to use the optional depreciation tables to compute the depreciation allowance for Computer X2. In November 2017,
AB
acquired Computer Y2 by exchanging Computer X2 and $1,000 cash in a like-kind exchange. Computer Y2 is qualified property under section 168(k)(2) and this section, and is 5-year property under section 168(e). Computer Y2 also meets the original use requirement in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section.
AB
did not make the election under § 1.168(i)-6(i)(1).
(
2
) For 2016,
AB
is allowed a 50-percent additional first year depreciation deduction of $5,000 for Computer X2 (unadjusted basis of $10,000 multiplied by 0.50), and a regular MACRS depreciation deduction of $1,000 for Computer X2 (the remaining adjusted depreciable basis of $5,000 multiplied by the annual depreciation rate of 0.20 for recovery year 1).
(
3
) For 2017,
AB
is allowed a regular MACRS depreciation deduction of $800 for Computer X2 (the remaining adjusted depreciable basis of $5,000 multiplied by the annual depreciation rate of 0.32 for recovery year 2 ×
1/2
year).
(
4
) Pursuant to paragraph (g)(5)(iii)(A) of this section, the 100-percent additional first year depreciation deduction for Computer Y2 for 2017 is allowable for the remaining exchanged basis at the time of replacement of $3,200 (Computer X2's unadjusted depreciable basis of $10,000 minus additional first year depreciation deduction allowable of $5,000 minus the 2016 regular MACRS depreciation deduction of $1,000 minus the 2017 regular MACRS depreciation deduction of $800) and for the remaining excess basis at the time of replacement of $1,000 (cash paid for Computer Y2). Thus, the 100-percent
additional first year depreciation deduction allowable for Computer Y2 totals $4,200 for 2017.
(E)
Example 5.
(
1
) In July 2017,
BC,
a calendar-year corporation, acquired for $20,000 and placed in service Equipment X3. Equipment X3 is qualified property under section 168(k)(2), as in effect on the day before amendment by the Act, and is 5-year property under section 168(e).
BC
depreciated Equipment X3 under the general depreciation system of section 168(a) by using the 200-percent declining balance method of depreciation, a 5-year recovery period, and the half-year convention.
BC
elected to use the optional depreciation tables to compute the depreciation allowance for Equipment X3. In December 2017,
BC
acquired Equipment Y3 by exchanging Equipment X3 and $5,000 cash in a like-kind exchange. Equipment Y3 is qualified property under section 168(k)(2) and this section, and is 5-year property under section 168(e). Equipment Y3 also meets the used property acquisition requirements in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section.
BC
did not make the election under § 1.168(i)-6(i)(1).
(
2
) Pursuant to § 1.168(k)-1(f)(5)(iii)(B), no additional first year depreciation deduction is allowable for Equipment X3 and, pursuant to § 1.168(d)-1(b)(3)(ii), no regular depreciation deduction is allowable for Equipment X3, for 2017.
(
3
) Pursuant to paragraph (g)(5)(iii)(A) of this section, no additional first year depreciation deduction is allowable for Equipment Y3's remaining exchanged basis at the time of replacement of $20,000 (Equipment X3's unadjusted depreciable basis of $20,000). However, pursuant to paragraph (g)(5)(iii)(A) of this section, the 100-percent additional first year depreciation deduction is allowable for Equipment Y3's remaining excess basis at the time of replacement of $5,000 (cash paid for Equipment Y3). Thus, the 100-percent additional first year depreciation deduction allowable for Equipment Y3 is $5,000 for 2017.
(F)
Example 6.
(
1
) The facts are the same as in
Example 5
of paragraph (g)(5)(v)(E)(
1
) of this section, except
BC
properly makes the election under § 1.168(i)-6(i)(1) not to apply § 1.168(i)-6 to Equipment X3 and Equipment Y3.
(
2
) Pursuant to § 1.168(k)-1(f)(5)(iii)(B), no additional first year depreciation deduction is allowable for Equipment X3 and, pursuant to § 1.168(d)-1(b)(3)(ii), no regular depreciation deduction is allowable for Equipment X3, for 2017.
(
3
) Pursuant to § 1.168(i)-6(i)(1),
BC
is treated as placing Equipment Y3 in service in December 2017 with a basis of $25,000 (the total of the exchanged basis of $20,000 and the excess basis of $5,000). However, pursuant to paragraph (g)(5)(iii)(D)(
2
) of this section, the 100-percent additional first year depreciation deduction is allowable only for Equipment Y3's excess basis at the time of replacement of $5,000 (cash paid for Equipment Y3). Thus, the 100-percent additional first year depreciation deduction allowable for Equipment Y3 is $5,000 for 2017.
(6)
Change in use
—(i)
Change in use of MACRS property.
The determination of whether the use of MACRS property, as defined in § 1.168(b)-1(a)(2), changes is made in accordance with section 168(i)(5) and § 1.168(i)-4.
(ii)
Conversion to personal use.
If qualified property is converted from business or income-producing use to personal use in the same taxable year in which the property is placed in service by a taxpayer, the additional first year depreciation deduction is not allowable for the property.
(iii)
Conversion to business or income-producing use
—(A)
During the same taxable year.
If, during the same taxable year, property is acquired by a taxpayer for personal use and is converted by the taxpayer from personal use to business or income-producing use, the additional first year depreciation deduction is allowable for the property in the taxable year the property is converted to business or income-producing use, assuming all of the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section are met. See paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section relating to the original use rules for a conversion of property to business or income-producing use. See § 1.168(i)-4(b)(1) for determining the depreciable basis of the property at the time of conversion to business or income-producing use.
(B)
Subsequent to the acquisition year.
If property is acquired by a taxpayer for personal use and, during a subsequent taxable year, is converted by the taxpayer from personal use to business or income-producing use, the additional first year depreciation deduction is allowable for the property in the taxable year the property is converted to business or income-producing use, assuming all of the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section are met. For purposes of paragraphs (b)(4) and (5) of this section, the property must be acquired by the taxpayer for personal use after September 27, 2017, and converted by the taxpayer from personal use to business or income-producing use by January 1, 2027. See paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section relating to the original use rules for a conversion of property to business or income-producing use. See § 1.168(i)-4(b)(1) for determining the depreciable basis of the property at the time of conversion to business or income-producing use.
(iv)
Depreciable property changes use subsequent to the placed-in-service year.
(A) If the use of qualified property changes in the hands of the same taxpayer subsequent to the taxable year the qualified property is placed in service and, as a result of the change in use, the property is no longer qualified property, the additional first year depreciation deduction allowable for the qualified property is not redetermined.
(B) If depreciable property is not qualified property in the taxable year the property is placed in service by the taxpayer, the additional first year depreciation deduction is not allowable for the property even if a change in the use of the property subsequent to the taxable year the property is placed in service results in the property being qualified property in the taxable year of the change in use.
(v)
Examples.
The application of this paragraph (g)(6) is illustrated by the following examples:
(A)
Example 1.
(
1
) On January 1, 2019,
FFF,
a calendar year corporation, purchased and placed in service several new computers at a total cost of $100,000.
FFF
used these computers within the United States for 3 months in 2019 and then moved and used the computers outside the United States for the remainder of 2019. On January 1, 2020,
FFF
permanently returns the computers to the United States for use in its business.
(
2
) For 2019, the computers are considered as used predominantly outside the United States in 2019 pursuant to § 1.48-1(g)(1)(i). As a result, the computers are required to be depreciated under the alternative depreciation system of section 168(g). Pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, the computers are not qualified property in 2019, the placed-in-service year. Thus, pursuant to paragraph (g)(6)(iv)(B) of this section, no additional first year depreciation deduction is allowed for these computers, regardless of the fact that the computers are permanently returned to the United States in 2020.
(B)
Example 2.
(
1
) On February 8, 2023,
GGG,
a calendar year corporation, purchased and placed in service new equipment at a cost of $1,000,000 for use in its California plant. The equipment is 5-year property under section 168(e) and is qualified property under section 168(k).
GGG
depreciates its 5-year property placed in service in 2023 using the optional depreciation table that corresponds with the general depreciation system, the 200-percent declining balance method, a 5-year recovery period, and the half-year convention. On June 4, 2024, due to changes in
GGG'
s business circumstances,
GGG
permanently moves the equipment to its plant in Mexico.
(
2
) For 2023,
GGG
is allowed an 80-percent additional first year depreciation deduction of $800,000 (the adjusted depreciable basis of $1,000,000 multiplied by 0.80). In addition,
GGG'
s depreciation deduction allowable in 2023 for the remaining adjusted depreciable basis of $200,000 (the unadjusted depreciable basis of $1,000,000 reduced by the additional first year depreciation deduction of $800,000) is $40,000 (the remaining adjusted depreciable basis of $200,000 multiplied by the annual depreciation rate of 0.20 for recovery year 1).
(
3
) For 2024, the equipment is considered as used predominantly outside the United States pursuant to § 1.48-1(g)(1)(i). As a result of this change in use, the adjusted depreciable basis of $160,000 for the equipment is required to be depreciated under the alternative
depreciation system of section 168(g) beginning in 2024. However, the additional first year depreciation deduction of $800,000 allowed for the equipment in 2023 is not redetermined.
(7)
Earnings and profits.
The additional first year depreciation deduction is not allowable for purposes of computing earnings and profits.
(8)
Limitation of amount of depreciation for certain passenger automobiles.
For a passenger automobile as defined in section 280F(d)(5), the limitation under section 280F(a)(1)(A)(i) is increased by $8,000 for qualified property acquired and placed in service by a taxpayer after September 27, 2017.
(9)
Coordination with section 47
—(i)
In general.
If qualified rehabilitation expenditures, as defined in section 47(c)(2) and § 1.48-12(c), incurred by a taxpayer with respect to a qualified rehabilitated building, as defined in section 47(c)(1) and § 1.48-12(b), are qualified property, the taxpayer may claim the rehabilitation credit provided by section 47(a), provided the requirements of section 47 are met—
(A) With respect to the portion of the basis of the qualified rehabilitated building that is attributable to the qualified rehabilitation expenditures if the taxpayer makes the applicable election under paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section not to deduct any additional first year depreciation for the class of property that includes the qualified rehabilitation expenditures; or
(B) With respect to the portion of the remaining rehabilitated basis of the qualified rehabilitated building that is attributable to the qualified rehabilitation expenditures if the taxpayer claims the additional first year depreciation deduction on the unadjusted depreciable basis, as defined in § 1.168(b)-1(a)(3) but before the reduction in basis for the amount of the rehabilitation credit, of the qualified rehabilitation expenditures; and the taxpayer depreciates the remaining adjusted depreciable basis, as defined in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, of such expenditures using straight line cost recovery in accordance with section 47(c)(2)(B)(i) and § 1.48-12(c)(7)(i). For purposes of this paragraph (g)(9)(i)(B), the remaining rehabilitated basis is equal to the unadjusted depreciable basis, as defined in § 1.168(b)-1(a)(3) but before the reduction in basis for the amount of the rehabilitation credit, of the qualified rehabilitation expenditures that are qualified property reduced by the additional first year depreciation allowed or allowable, whichever is greater.
(ii)
Example.
The application of this paragraph (g)(9) is illustrated by the following example:
(A) Between February 8, 2023, and June 4, 2023,
JM,
a calendar-year taxpayer, incurred qualified rehabilitation expenditures of $200,000 with respect to a qualified rehabilitated building that is nonresidential real property under section 168(e). These qualified rehabilitation expenditures are qualified property and qualify for the 20-percent rehabilitation credit under section 47(a)(1).
JM'
s basis in the qualified rehabilitated building is zero before incurring the qualified rehabilitation expenditures and
JM
placed the qualified rehabilitated building in service in July 2023.
JM
depreciates its nonresidential real property placed in service in 2023 under the general depreciation system of section 168(a) by using the straight line method of depreciation, a 39-year recovery period, and the mid-month convention.
JM
elected to use the optional depreciation tables to compute the depreciation allowance for its depreciable property placed in service in 2023. Further, for 2023,
JM
did not make any election under paragraph (f) of this section.
(B) Because
JM
did not make any election under paragraph (f) of this section,
JM
is allowed an 80-percent additional first year depreciation deduction of $160,000 for the qualified rehabilitation expenditures for 2023 (the unadjusted depreciable basis of $200,000 (before reduction in basis for the rehabilitation credit) multiplied by 0.80).
JM
also is allowed to claim a rehabilitation credit of $8,000 for the remaining rehabilitated basis of $40,000 (the unadjusted depreciable basis (before reduction in basis for the rehabilitation credit) of $200,000 less the additional first year depreciation deduction of $160,000, multiplied by 0.20 to calculate the rehabilitation credit). For 2023, the ratable share of the rehabilitation
credit of $8,000 is $1,600. Further,
JM'
s depreciation deduction for 2023 for the remaining adjusted depreciable basis of $32,000 (the unadjusted depreciable basis (before reduction in basis for the rehabilitation credit) of $200,000 less the additional first year depreciation deduction of $160,000 less the rehabilitation credit of $8,000) is $376.64 (the remaining adjusted depreciable basis of $32,000 multiplied by the depreciation rate of 0.01177 for recovery year 1, placed in service in month 7).
(10)
Coordination with section 514(a)(3).
The additional first year depreciation deduction is not allowable for purposes of section 514(a)(3).
(11)
Mid-quarter convention.
In determining whether the mid-quarter convention applies for a taxable year under section 168(d)(3) and § 1.168(d)-1, the depreciable basis, as defined in § 1.168(d)-1(b)(4), for the taxable year the qualified property is placed in service by the taxpayer is not reduced by the allowed or allowable additional first year depreciation deduction for that taxable year. See § 1.168(d)-1(b)(4).
(h)
Applicability dates
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraphs (h)(2) and (3) of this section, this section applies to—
(i) Depreciable property acquired after September 27, 2017, by the taxpayer and placed in service by the taxpayer during or after the taxpayer's taxable year that begins on or after January 1, 2021;
(ii) A specified plant for which the taxpayer properly made an election to apply section 168(k)(5) and that is planted, or grafted to a plant that was previously planted, by the taxpayer during or after the taxpayer's taxable year that begins on or after January 1, 2021; and
(iii) Components acquired or self-constructed after September 27, 2017, of larger self-constructed property described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section and placed in service by the taxpayer during or after the taxpayer's taxable year that begins on or after January 1, 2021.
(2)
Applicability of this section for prior taxable years.
For taxable years beginning before January 1, 2021, see § 1.168(k)-2 as contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised as of April 1, 2020.
(3)
Early application of this section and § 1.1502-68
—(i)
In general.
Subject to paragraphs (h)(3)(ii) and (iii) of this section, and provided that all members of a consolidated group consistently apply the same set of rules, a taxpayer may choose to apply both the rules of this section and the rules of § 1.1502-68 (to the extent relevant), in their entirety and in a consistent manner, to—
(A) Depreciable property acquired after September 27, 2017, by the taxpayer and placed in service by the taxpayer during a taxable year ending on or after September 28, 2017;
(B) A specified plant for which the taxpayer properly made an election to apply section 168(k)(5) and that is planted, or grafted to a plant that was previously planted, after September 27, 2017, by the taxpayer during a taxable year ending on or after September 28, 2017; and
(C) Components acquired or self-constructed after September 27, 2017, of larger self-constructed property described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section and placed in service by the taxpayer during a taxable year ending on or after September 28, 2017.
(ii)
Early application to certain transactions.
In the case of property described in § 1.1502-68(e)(2)(i) that is acquired in a transaction that satisfies the requirements of § 1.1502-68(c)(1)(ii) or (c)(2)(ii), the taxpayer may apply the rules of this section and the rules of § 1.1502-68 (to the extent relevant), in their entirety and in a consistent manner, to such property only if those rules are applied, in their entirety and in a consistent manner, by all parties to the transaction, including the transferor member, the transferee member, and the target, as applicable, and the consolidated groups of which they are members, for the taxable year(s) in which the transaction occurs and the taxable year(s) that includes the day after the deconsolidation date, as defined in § 1.1502-68(a)(2)(iii).
(iii)
Bound by early application.
Once a taxpayer applies the rules of this section and the rules of § 1.1502-68 (to the extent relevant), in their entirety, for a taxable year, the taxpayer must continue to apply the rules of this section
and the rules of § 1.1502-68 (to the extent relevant), in their entirety, for the taxpayer's subsequent taxable years.
[T.D. 9874, 84 FR 50129, Sept. 24, 2019, as amended by T.D. 9916, 85 FR 71753, Nov. 10, 2020]
§ 1.168A-1
Amortization of emergency facilities; general rule.
(a) A person (including an estate or trust (see section 642(f) and § 1.642(f)-1) and a partnership (see section 703 and § 1.703-1)) is entitled, by election, to a deduction with respect to the amortization of the adjusted basis (for determining gain) of an emergency facility, such amortization to be based on a period of 60 months. As to the adjusted basis of an emergency facility, see § 1.168A-5. The taxpayer may elect to begin the 60-month amortization period with (1) the month following the month in which such facility was completed or acquired, or (2) the taxable year succeeding that in which such facility was completed or acquired (see § 1.168A-2). The date on which, or the month within which, an emergency facility is completed or acquired is to be determined upon the facts in the particular case. Ordinarily, the taxpayer is in possession of all the facts and, therefore, in a position to ascertain such date. A statement of the date ascertained by the taxpayer, together with a statement of the pertinent facts relied upon, should be filed with the taxpayer's election to take amortization deductions with respect to such facility.
(b) Generally, an amortization deduction will not be allowed with respect to an emergency facility for any taxable year unless such facility has been certified before the date of filing of the taxpayer's income tax return for such taxable year. However, this limitation does not apply in the case of a certificate made after August 22, 1957, for an emergency facility to provide primary processing for uranium ore or uranium concentrate under a program of the Atomic Energy Commission for the development of any sources of uranium ore or uranium concentrate, if application for such certificate was filed either (1) before September 2, 1958, and before the expiration of six months after the beginning of construction, reconstruction, erection, or installation or the date of acquisition of the facility, or (2) after September 1, 1958, and on or before December 2, 1958.
(c) In general, with respect to each month of the 60-month period which falls within the taxable year, the amortization deduction is an amount equal to the adjusted basis of the facility at the end of each month divided by the number of months (including the particular month for which the deduction is computed) remaining in the 60-month period. The adjusted basis at the end of any month shall be computed without regard to the amortization deduction for such month. The total amortization deduction with respect to an emergency facility for a particular taxable year is the sum of the amortization deductions allowable for each month of the 60-month period which falls within such taxable year. The amortization deduction taken for any month is in lieu of the deduction for depreciation which would otherwise be allowable under section 167. See, however, § 1.168A-6, relating to depreciation with respect to any portion of the emergency facility not subject to amortization.
(d) This section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
On July 1, 1954, the X Corporation, which makes its income tax returns on the calendar year basis, begins the construction of an emergency facility which is completed on September 30, 1954, at a cost of $240,000. The certificate covers the entire construction. The X Corporation elects to take amortization deductions with respect to the facility and to begin the 60-month amortization period with October, the month following its completion. The adjusted basis of the facility at the end of October is $240,000. The allowable amortization deduction with respect to such facility for the taxable year 1954 is $12,000, computed as follows:
Monthly amortization deductions:
October: $240,000 divided by 60
$4,000
November: $236,000 ($240,000 minus $4,000) divided by 59
4,000
December: $232,000 ($236,000 minus $4,000) divided by 58
4,000
Total amortization deduction for 1954
12,000

# Example 2.
The Y Corporation, which makes its income tax returns on the basis of a fiscal year ending November 30, purchases an emergency facility (No. 1) on July 29, 1955. On June 15, 1955, it begins the construction of an emergency facility (No. 2) which is
completed on August 2, 1955. The entire acquisition and construction of such facilities are covered by the certificate. The Y Corporation elects to take amortization deductions with respect to both facilities and to begin the 60-month amortization period in each case with the month following the month of acquisition or completion. At the end of the first month of the amortization period the adjusted basis of facility No. 1 is $300,000 and the adjusted basis of facility No. 2 is $54,000. In September 1955, facility No. 1 is damaged by fire, as a result of which its adjusted basis is properly reduced by $25,370. The allowable amortization deduction with respect to such facilities for the taxable year ending November 30, 1955, is $21,410, computed as follows:
Facility No. 1
Monthly amortization deductions:
August: $300,000 divided by 60
$5,000
September: $269,630 ($300,000 minus $5,000 and $25,370) divided by 59
4,570
October: $265,060 ($269,630 minus $4,570) divided by 58
4,570
November: $260,490 ($265,060 minus $4,570) divided by 57
4,570
Amortization deduction for 1955
18,710
Facility No. 2
Monthly amortization deductions:
September: $54,000 divided by 60
$900
October: $53,100 divided by 59
900
November: $52,200 divided by 58
900
Amortization deduction for 1955

Total amortization deduction for 1955
21,410

# Example 3.
On June 15, 1954, the Z Corporation, which makes its income tax returns on the calendar year basis, completes the construction of an emergency facility at a cost of $110,000. In its income tax return for 1954, filed on March 15, 1955, the Z Corporation elects to take amortization deductions with respect to such facility and to begin the 60-month amortization period with July 1954, the month following its completion. No certificate with respect to such facility is made until April 10, 1955, and therefore no amortization deduction with respect to such facility is allowable for any month in the taxable year 1954. The Z Corporation is entitled, however, to take a deduction for depreciation of such facility for the taxable year 1954, such deduction being assumed, for the purposes of this example, to be $2,000. Accordingly, the adjusted basis of such facility at the end of January 1955 (without regard to the amortization deduction for such month) is $108,000 ($110,000 minus $2,000). For the taxable year 1955, the Z Corporation is, with respect to such facility, entitled to an amortization deduction of $24,000, computed as follows:
Monthly amortization deductions:
January: $108,000 divided by 54
$2,000
February: $106,000 ($108,000 minus $2,000) divided by 53
2,000
March: $104,000 ($106,000 minus $2,000) divided by 52
2,000
For the remaining nine months (similarly computed)
18,000
Total amortization deduction for 1955
24,000
Since the Z Corporation elected in its return for 1954 to take amortization deductions with respect to such facility and to begin the 60-month amortization period with July 1954, it must compute its amortization deductions for the 12 months in the taxable year 1955 on the basis of the remaining months of the established 60-month amortization period, as indicated in the above computation.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11402, Nov. 26, 1960; 25 FR 14021, Dec. 21, 1960. Redesignated and amended by T.D. 8116, 51 FR 46618, Dec. 24, 1986]
§ 1.168A-2
Election of amortization.
(a)
General rule.
An election by the taxpayer to take amortization deductions with respect to an emergency facility and to begin the 60-month amortization period either with the month following the month in which such facility was completed or acquired, or with the taxable year succeeding the taxable year in which such facility was completed or acquired, shall be made by a statement to that effect in its return for the taxable year in which falls the first month of the 60-month amortization period so elected. However, if the facility is described in section 168(e)(2)(C) and an application for a certificate is filed within the period prescribed by section 9(c) of the Technical Amendments Act of 1958 (72 Stat. 1609) and paragraph (b) of § 1.168A-1, the election may be made by a statement in an amended income tax return for the taxable year in which falls the first month of the 60-month amortization period so elected. The statement and amended return in such case must be filed not later than 90 days after the date the certificate is made or not later than April 4, 1960, whichever is later. Amended income tax returns or claims for credit or refund should also be filed for other taxable years which are within such amortization period and which precede the taxable year in which the election is made. Nothing in this paragraph should be construed as extending the time specified in section 6511 within which a claim for credit or refund may be filed.
(b)
Election not made, in prescribed manner.
If the statement of election is not made by the taxpayer as prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section, it may, in the discretion of the Commissioner and for good cause shown, be made in such manner and form and within such time as may be approved by the Commissioner.
(c)
Other requirements and considerations.
No method of making such election other than those prescribed in this section and corresponding sections of prior regulations is permitted. Any statement of election should contain a description clearly identifying each emergency facility for which an amortization deduction is claimed. A taxpayer which does not elect, in the manner prescribed in this section or corresponding sections of prior regulations, to take amortization deductions with respect to an emergency facility shall not be entitled to such deductions.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11402, Nov. 26, 1960; 25 FR 14021, Dec. 21, 1960. Redesignated and amended by T.D. 8116, 51 FR 46618, Dec. 24, 1986]
§ 1.168A-3
Election to discontinue amortization.
(a) If a taxpayer has elected to take amortization deductions with respect to an emergency facility, it may, after such election and prior to the expiration of the 60-month amortization period, discontinue the amortization deductions for the remainder of the 60-month period. An election to discontinue the amortization deductions shall be made by a notice in writing filed with the district director for the internal revenue district in which the return of the taxpayer is required to be filed, specifying the month as of the beginning of which the taxpayer elects to discontinue such deductions. Such notice shall be filed before the beginning of the month specified therein, and shall contain a description clearly identifying the emergency facility with respect to which the taxpayer elects to discontinue the amortization deductions. If the taxpayer so elects to discontinue the amortization deductions, it shall not be entitled to any further amortization deductions with respect to such facility.
(b) A taxpayer which thus elects to discontinue amortization deductions with respect to an emergency facility is entitled, if such facility is depreciable property under section 167 and the regulations thereunder, to a deduction for depreciation with respect to such facility. The deduction for depreciation shall begin with the first month as to which the amortization deduction is not applicable, and shall be computed on the adjusted basis of the property as of the beginning of such month (see section 1011 and the regulations thereunder).
(c) This section may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
On July 1, 1954, the X Corporation, which makes its income tax returns on the calendar year basis, purchases an emergency facility, consisting of land with a building thereon, at a cost of $306,000 of which $60,000 is allocable to the land and $246,000 to the building. The certificate covers the entire acquisition. The corporation elects to take amortization deductions with respect to the facility and to begin the 60-month amortization period with the taxable year 1955. Depreciation of the building in the amount of $6,000 is deducted and allowed for the taxable year 1954. On March 25, 1956, the corporation files notice with the district director of its election to discontinue the amortization deductions beginning with the month of April 1956. The adjusted basis of the facility on January 31, 1955, is $300,000, or the cost of the facility ($306,000) less the depreciation allowed for 1954 ($6,000). The amortization deductions for the taxable year 1955 and the months of January, February, and March 1956, amount to $75,000, or $5,000 per month for 15 months. Since, at the beginning of the amortization period (January 1, 1955), the adjusted basis of the land ($60,000) is one-fifth of the adjusted basis of the entire facility ($300,000) and since there are no adjustments to basis other than on account of amortization during the period, the adjusted basis of the land should be reduced by $15,000, or one-fifth of the entire amortization deduction, and the adjusted basis of the building should be reduced by $60,000, or four-fifths of the entire amortization deduction. Accordingly, the adjusted basis of the facility as of April 1, 1956, is $225,000, of which $180,000 is allocable to the building for the purpose of depreciation deductions under section 167, and $45,000 is allocable to the land.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11402, Nov. 26, 1960; 25 FR 14021, Dec. 21, 1960. Redesignated by T.D. 8116, 51 FR 46619, Dec. 24, 1986]
§ 1.168A-4
Definitions.
As used in the regulations under section 168, the term—
(a) “Certifying authority” means the certifying authority designated by the President by Executive order.
(b) “Emergency facility” means any facility, land, building, machinery, or equipment, or any part thereof, the acquisition of which occurred after December 31, 1949, or the construction, reconstruction, erection, or installation of which was completed after such date, and with respect to which a certificate under section 168(e) has been made. In the case of an application for a certificate under section 168(e) which is filed after March 23, 1951, only the part of any such facility which is constructed, reconstructed, erected, or installed by any person not earlier than six months prior to the filing of such application, and which is certified in accordance with section 168(e), shall be deemed to be an emergency facility, notwithstanding that the other part of such facility was constructed, reconstructed, erected, or installed earlier than six months prior to the filing of such application. However, if the facility is one described in section 168(e)(2)(C) and the application was filed after September 1, 1958, and on or before December 2, 1958, the preceding sentence shall not apply. The term “emergency facility,” as so defined, may include, among other things, improvements of land, such as the construction of roads, bridges, and airstrips, and the dredging of channels.
(c) “Emergency period” means the period beginning on January 1, 1950, and ending on the date on which the President proclaims that the utilization of a substantial portion of the certified emergency facilities is no longer required in the interest of national defense.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11402, Nov. 26, 1960; 25 FR 14021, Dec. 21, 1960. Redesignated by T.D. 8116, 51 FR 46619, Dec. 24, 1986]
§ 1.168A-5
Adjusted basis of emergency facility.
(a)
In general.
(1) The adjusted basis of an emergency facility for the purpose of computing the amortization deduction may differ from what would otherwise constitute the adjusted basis of such emergency facility in that it shall be the adjusted basis for determining gain (see Part II (section 1011 and following), Subchapter 0, Chapter 1 of the Code) and in that it may be only a portion of what would otherwise constitute the adjusted basis. It will be only a portion of such other adjusted basis if only a portion of the basis (unadjusted) is attributable to certified construction, reconstruction, erection, installation, or acquisition taking place after December 31, 1949. Also, it will be only a portion of what would otherwise constitute the adjusted basis of the emergency facility if only a portion of the basis (unadjusted) is certified as attributable to defense purposes or, in the case of a certification after August 22, 1957, if only a portion of the basis (unadjusted) is certified as attributable to the national defense program. It is therefore necessary first to determine the unadjusted basis of the emergency facility from which the adjusted basis for amortization purposes is derived.
(2) The unadjusted basis for amortization purposes is the same as the unadjusted basis otherwise determined only when the entire construction, reconstruction, erection, installation, or acquisition takes place after December 31, 1949, and is certified in its entirety by the certifying authority.
(3) In cases in which only a portion of the construction, reconstruction, erection, installation, or acquisition takes place after December 31, 1949, and that portion is certified in its entirety by the certifying authority, the unadjusted basis for the purpose of amortization is so much of the entire unadjusted basis as is attributable to the certified construction, reconstruction, erection, installation, or acquisition which takes place after December 31, 1949. For example, the X Corporation begins the construction of a facility on November 15, 1949, and such facility is completed on April 1, 1952, at a cost of $5,000,000, of which $4,600,000 is attributable to construction after December 31, 1949. The entire construction after December 31, 1949, is certified by the certifying authority. The unadjusted basis of the emergency facility for amortization purposes is therefore $4,600,000. For depreciation of
the remaining portion ($400,000) of the cost see § 1.168A-6.
(4) If the certifying authority certifies only a portion of the construction, reconstruction, erection, installation, or acquisition of property which takes place after December 31, 1949, the unadjusted basis for amortization purposes is limited to such portion so certified. Assuming the same facts as in the example in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph, except that only 50 percent of the construction, reconstruction, erection, installation, or acquisition after December 31, 1949, is certified, the unadjusted basis for amortization purposes is 50 percent of $4,600,000, or $2,300,000.
(5) The adjusted basis of an emergency facility for amortization purposes is the unadjusted basis for amortization purposes less the adjustments properly applicable thereto. Such adjustments are those specified in sections 1016 and 1017, except that no adjustments are to be taken into account which increase the adjusted basis. (See paragraph (b) of this section.) If the taxpayer constructs, reconstructs, erects, installs, or acquires an emergency facility pursuant to a cost reimbursement contract with an obligation for reimbursement by the United States of all or a part of the cost of such facility, the unadjusted basis of such facility for amortization purposes shall not include that part of the cost for which the taxpayer is entitled to reimbursement, and the amount received as reimbursement shall be treated as a capital receipt. However, amounts received by a taxpayer which represent in fact compensation by reason of termination of a government contract or payment for articles under such a contract, though denominated reimbursements for all or a part of the cost of an emergency facility, are not to be treated as capital receipts but are to be taken into account in computing income, and are therefore not to be applied in reduction of the basis of such facility.
(6) The following examples will illustrate the computation of the adjusted basis of an emergency facility for amortization purposes:

# Example 1.
The X Corporation completes an emergency facility on July 1, 1954, the entire unadjusted basis of which is $500,000, and the unadjusted basis of which for the purpose of amortization is $300,000. The X Corporation elects to begin amortization as of January 1, 1955. The only adjustment to basis for the period July 1, 1954, to January 31, 1955, other than depreciation or amortization for January 1955, is $5,000 for depreciation for the last six months of 1954. The adjusted basis for the purpose of amortization is therefore $300,000 less $3,000 (300,000/500,000 × $5,000), or $297,000.

# Example 2.
On July 31, 1956, the Y Corporation has an emergency facility (a building) which was completed on July 1, 1952, the entire basis of which is $500,000 and the unadjusted basis of which for the purpose of amortization is $300,000. The corporation elected to begin amortization as of January 1, 1953, at which time it was entitled to $5,000 depreciation for the last six months of 1952. On July 1, 1956, the facility was damaged by fire, as the result of which its adjusted basis is properly reduced by $200,000. The adjusted basis of the emergency facility as of July 1956 for the purpose of amortization and depreciation, and the adjusted basis for other purposes, are $23,849.18, $49,250.82, and $73,100.00, respectively, computed as follows:
For amortization
For depreciation
For other purposes
Unadjusted basis
$300,000.00
$200,000.00
$500,000
Less depreciation to Jan. 1, 1953
3,000.00
2,000.00
5,000
Adjusted basis January 1953
297,000.00
198,000.00
495,000
Less amortization for 42 months
207,900.00
207,900
Less depreciation for 42 months
14,000.00
14,000
Adjusted basis at time of fire
89,100.00
184,000.00
273,100
Less fire loss (apportioned as explained below)
65,250.82
134,749.18
200,000
Adjusted basis after fire loss
23,849.18
49,250.82
73,100
The $200,000 fire loss is applied against the adjusted basis for the purpose of amortization and the adjusted basis for the purpose of depreciation in the proportion that each such adjusted basis at the time of the fire bears to their sum,
i.e.
, 89,100/273,100 × $200,000
or $65,250.82, against the amortization basis, and 184,000/273,100 × $200,000, or $134,749.18 against the depreciation basis.
(b)
Capital additions.
(1) If, after the completion or acquisition of an emergency facility which has been certified by the certifying authority, further expenditures are made for construction, reconstruction, erection, installation, or acquisition attributable to such facility but not covered by such certification, such expenditures shall not be added to the adjusted basis of the emergency facility for amortization purposes under such certification. If such further expenditures are separately certified in accordance with the provisions of section 168(e) (1) or (2) and this section, they are treated as certified expenditures in connection with a new and separate emergency facility and, if proper election is made, will be taken into account in computing the adjusted basis of such new and separate emergency facility for the purpose of amortization.
(2) The application of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
On March 1, 1954, the certifying authority certifies as an emergency facility a heating plant proposed to be constructed by the Z Corporation. Such facility is completed on July 1, 1954. The Z Corporation, on August 1, 1954, begins the installation in the plant of an additional boiler, which is not included in the certification for the plant but is certified as a new and separate emergency facility. For amortization purposes, the adjusted basis of the heating plant is determined without including the cost of the additional boiler. Such cost is taken into account in computing the adjusted basis of the new and separate emergency facility (the boiler), as to which the taxpayer has a separate election for amortization purposes and a separate amortization period.

§ 1.168A-6
Depreciation of portion of emergency facility not subject to amortization.
(a) The rule that an amortization deduction with respect to an emergency facility is in lieu of any deduction for depreciation which would otherwise be allowable under section 167 is subject to the exception provided in section 168(f). Under this exception, if the property constituting such facility is depreciable property under section 167 and the regulations thereunder and if the adjusted basis of such facility as computed under section 1011 for purposes other than the amortization deductions is in excess of the adjusted basis computed for the purpose of the amortization deductions, then the excess shall be charged off over the useful life of the facility and recovered through depreciation deductions. Thus, if the construction of an emergency facility is begun on or before December 31, 1949, and completed after such date, no amortization deductions are allowable with respect to the amount attributable to such construction on or before such date (see § 1.168A-5). However, if the property constituting such facility is depreciable property under section 167 and the regulations thereunder, then the depreciation deduction provided by such section and regulations is allowable with respect to the amount attributable to such construction on or before December 31, 1949.
(b) Similarly, if only a portion of the construction, reconstruction, erection, installation, or acquisition after December 31, 1949, of an emergency facility has been certified by the certifying authority, and if such facility is depreciable property under section 167 and the regulations thereunder, then the depreciation deduction provided by such section and regulations is allowable with respect to the portion which has not been so certified.
(c) For illustration of the treatment of a depreciable portion of an emergency facility, see example (2) in paragraph (a)(6) of § 1.168A-5.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11402, Nov. 26, 1960; 25 FR 14021, Dec. 21, 1960. Redesignated and amended by T.D. 8116, 51 FR 46619, Dec. 24, 1986]
§ 1.168A-7
Payment by United States of unamortized cost of facility.
(a) Section 168(g) contemplates that certain payments may be made by the United States to a taxpayer as compensation for the unamortized cost of an emergency facility. If any such payment is properly includible in gross income and has been certified, as provided in section 168(g), as having been paid under the circumstances described therein, a taxpayer which is recovering
the adjusted basis of an emergency facility through amortization rather than depreciation may elect to take an amount equal to such payment as an amortization deduction with respect to such facility for the month in which such payment is so includible. Such amortization deduction shall be in lieu of the amortization deduction otherwise allowable with respect to such facility for such month, but it shall not in any case exceed the adjusted basis of such facility (see § 1.168A-5) as of the end of such month (computed without regard to any amortization deduction for such month). The election referred to in this paragraph shall be made in the return for the taxable year in which the amount of such payment is includible in gross income.
(b) If a taxpayer is recovering the adjusted basis of an emergency facility through depreciation rather than amortization, the depreciation deduction allowable under section 167 for the month in which the amount of any such payment is includible in gross income shall, at the taxpayer's election, be increased by such amount; but the total deduction with respect to the certified portion of such facility shall not in any case exceed the adjusted basis of such facility (computed as provided in section 168(e) and § 1.168A-5 for amortization purposes) as of the end of such month (computed without regard to any amount allowable for such month under section 167 or 168(g)(2)). The election referred to in this paragraph shall be made in the return for the taxable year in which the amount of such payment is includible in gross income.
(c) This section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
On January 31, 1954, the X Corporation purchases an emergency facility at a cost of $600,000. The certificate covers the entire acquisition. The X Corporation elects to take amortization deductions with respect to such facility and to begin the 60-month amortization period with February 1954, the month following the month of acquisition. On July 15, 1955, as a result of the cancellation of certain contracts with the X Corporation, the United States makes a payment of $300,000 to the corporation as compensation for the unamortized cost of such facility. The $300,000 payment is includible in the X Corporation's gross income for July 1955. The adjusted basis of such facility for amortization purposes as of the end of July 1955, computed without regard to any amortization deduction for such month, is $430,000. Accordingly, the corporation is entitled to take an amortization deduction of $300,000 for such month, in lieu of the $10,000 amortization deduction which is otherwise allowable.

# Example 2.
On November 30, 1954, the Y Corporation purchases an emergency facility, consisting of land with a building thereon, at a cost of $500,000, of which $200,000 is allocable to the land and $300,000 to the building. The certificate covers the entire acquisition. The Y Corporation does not elect to take amortization deductions with respect to such facility, but is entitled to a depreciation deduction with respect to the building at the rate of 3 percent per annum, or $750 per month. On August 12, 1956, as a result of cancellation of certain contracts, the United States makes a payment of $400,000 to the corporation as compensation for the unrecovered cost of such facility. The $400,000 is includible in the Y Corporation's gross income for August 1956. The adjusted basis of the facility as of the end of August 1956, computed without regard to depreciation for such month, is $485,000, of which amount $200,000 is allocable to the land and $285,000 to the building. Accordingly, the corporation is entitled to increase the $750 depreciation deduction for August 1956 by the full amount of the $400,000 payment.

§ 1.169-1
Amortization of pollution control facilities.
(a)
Allowance of deduction
—(1)
In general.
Under section 169(a), every person, at his election, shall be entitled to a deduction with respect to the amortization of the amortizable basis (as defined in § 1.169-3) of any certified pollution control facility (as defined in § 1.169-2), based on a period of 60 months. Under section 169(b) and paragraph (a) of § 1.169-4, the taxpayer may further elect to begin such 60-month period either with the month following the month in which the facility is completed or acquired or with the first month of the taxable year succeeding the taxable year in which such facility is completed or acquired. Under section 169(c), a taxpayer who has elected under section 169(b) to take the amortization deduction provided by section 169(a) may, at any time after making such election and prior to the expiration of the 60-month amortization period, elect to discontinue the amortization deduction for the remainder of the
60-month period in the manner prescribed in paragraph (b)(1) of § 1.169-4. In addition, if on or before May 18, 1971, an election under section 169(a) has been made, consent is hereby given to revoke such election without the consent of the Commissioner in the manner prescribed in (b)(2) of § 1.169-4.
(2)
Amount of deduction.
With respect to each month of such 60-month period which falls within the taxable year, the amortization deduction shall be an amount equal to the amortizable basis of the certified pollution control facility at the end of such month divided by the number of months (including the month for which the deduction is computed) remaining in such 60-month period. The amortizable basis at the end of any month shall be computed without regard to the amortization deduction for such month. The total amortization deduction with respect to a certified pollution control facility for a taxable year is the sum of the amortization deductions allowable for each month of the 60-month period which falls within such taxable year. If a certified pollution control facility is sold or exchanged or otherwise disposed of during 1 month, the amortization deduction (if any) allowable to the original holder in respect of such month shall be that portion of the amount to which such person would be entitled for a full month which the number of days in such month during which the facility was held by such person bears to the total number of days in such month.
(3)
Effect on other deductions.
(i) The amortization deduction provided by section 169 with respect to any month shall be in lieu of the depreciation deduction which would otherwise be allowable under section 167 or a deduction in lieu of depreciation which would otherwise be allowable under paragraph (b) of § 1.162-11 for such month.
(ii) If the adjusted basis of such facility as computed under section 1011 for purposes other than the amortization deduction provided by section 169 is in excess of the amortizable basis, as computed under § 1.169-3, such excess shall be recovered through depreciation deductions under the rules of section 167. See section 169(g).
(iii) See section 179 and paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of § 1.179-1 and paragraph (b)(2) of § 1.169-3 for additional first-year depreciation in respect of a certified pollution control facility.
(4) [Reserved]
(5)
Special rules.
(i) In the case of a certified pollution control facility held by one person for life with the remainder to another person, the amortization deduction under section 169(a) shall be computed as if the life tenant were the absolute owner of the property and shall be allowable to the life tenant during his life.
(ii) If the assets of a corporation which has elected to take the amortization deduction under section 169(a) are acquired by another corporation in a transaction to which section 381 (relating to carryovers in certain corporate acquisitions) applies, the acquiring corporation is to be treated as if it were the distributor or transferor corporation for purposes of this section.
(iii) For the right of estates and trusts to amortize pollution control facilities see section 642(f) and § 1.642 (f)-1. For the allowance of the amortization deduction in the case of pollution control facilities of partnerships, see section 703 and § 1.703-1.
(6)
Depreciation subsequent to discontinuance or in the case of revocation of amortization.
A taxpayer which elects in the manner prescribed under paragraph (b) (1) of § 1.169-4 to discontinue amortization deductions or under paragraph (b) (2) of § 1.169-4 to revoke an election under section 169(a) with respect to a certified pollution control facility is entitled, if such facility is of a character subject to the allowance for depreciation provided in section 167, to a deduction for depreciation (to the extent allowable) with respect to such facility. In the case of an election to discontinue an amortization deduction, the deduction for depreciation shall begin with the first month as to which such amortization deduction is not applicable and shall be computed on the adjusted basis of the property as of the beginning of such month (see section 1011 and the regulations thereunder). Such depreciation deduction shall be based upon the remaining portion of the period authorized under section 167
for the facility as determined, as of the first day of the first month as of which the amortization deduction is not applicable. If the taxpayer so elects to discontinue the amortization deduction under section 169(a), such taxpayer shall not be entitled to any further amortization deduction under this section and section 169(a) with respect to such pollution control facility. In the case of a revocation of an election under section 169(a), the deduction for depreciation shall begin as of the time such depreciation deduction would have been taken but for the election under section 169(a). See paragraph (b)(2) of § 1.169-4 for rules as to filing amended returns for years for which amortization deductions have been taken.
(7)
Definitions.
Except as otherwise provided in § 1.169-2, all terms used in section 169 and the regulations thereunder shall have the meaning provided by this section and §§ 1.169-2 through 1.169-4.
(b)
Examples.
This section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
On September 30, 1970, the X Corporation, which uses the calendar year as its taxable year, completes the installation of a facility all of which qualifies as a certified pollution control facility within the meaning of paragraph (a) of § 1.169-2. The cost of the facility is $120,000 and the period referred to in paragraph (a)(6) of § 1.169-2 is 10 years in accordance with the rules set forth in paragraph (a) of § 1.169-4, on its income tax return filed for 1970, X elects to take amortization deductions under section 169(a) with respect to the facility and to begin the 60-month amortization period with October 1970, the month following the month in which it was completed. The amortizable basis at the end of October 1970 (determined without regard to the amortization deduction under section 169(a) for that month) is $120,000. The allowable amortization deduction with respect to such facility for the taxable year 1970 is $6,000, computed as follows:
Monthly amortization deductions:
October: $120,000 divided by 60
$2,000
November: $118,000 (that is, $120,000 minus $2,000) divided by 59
2,000
December: $116,000 (that is, $118,000 minus $2,000) divided by 58
2,000
Total amortization deduction for 1970
6,000

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in example (1). Assume further that on May 20, 1972, X properly files notice of its election to discontinue the amortization deductions with the month of June 1972. The adjusted basis of the facility as of June 1, 1972, is $80,000, computed as follows:
Yearly amortization deductions:
1970 (as computed in example (1))
$6,000
1971 (computed in accordance with example (1))
24,000
1972 (for the first 5 months of 1972 computed in accordance with example (1))
10,000
Total amortization deductions for 20 months
40,000
Adjusted basis as beginning of amortization period
120,000
Less: Amortization deductions
40,000
Adjusted basis as of June 1, 1972
80,000
Beginning as of June 1, 1972, the deduction for depreciation under section 167 is allowable with respect to the property on its adjusted basis of $80,000.

§ 1.169-2
Definitions.
(a)
Certified pollution control facility
—(1)
In general.
Under section 169 (d), the term “certified pollution control facility” means a facility which—
(i) The Federal certifying authority certifies, in accordance with the rules prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section, is a “treatment facility” described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, and
(ii) Is “a new identifiable facility” (as defined in paragraph (b) of this section).
For profitmaking abatement works limitation, see paragraph (d) of this section.
(2)
Treatment facility.
For purposes of subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph, a “treatment facility” is a facility which (i) is used to abate or control water or atmospheric pollution or contamination by removing, altering, disposing, or storing of pollutants, contaminants, wastes, or heat and (ii) is used in connection with a plant or other property in operation before January 1, 1969. Determinations under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph shall be made solely by the Federal certifying authority. See subparagraph (3) of this paragraph. For meaning of the phrases “plant or other property” and “in operation before January 1, 1969,” see subparagraphs (4) and (5), respectively, of this paragraph.
(3)
Facilities performing multiple functions or used in connection with several plants, etc.
(i) If a facility is designed to perform or does perform a function in addition to abating or controlling water or atmospheric pollution or contamination by removing, altering, disposing or storing pollutants, contaminants, wastes, or heat, such facility shall be a treatment facility only with respect to that part of the cost thereof which is certified by the Federal certifying authority as attributable to abating of controlling water or atmospheric pollution or contamination. For example, if a machine which performs a function in addition to abating water pollution is installed at a cost of $100,000 in, and is used only in connection with, a plant which was in operation before January 1, 1969, and if the Federal certifying authority certifies that $30,000 of the cost of such machine is allocable to its function of abating water pollution, such $30,000 will be deemed to be the adjusted basis for purposes of determining gain for purposes of paragraph (a) of § 1.169-3.
(ii) If a facility is used in connection with more than one plant or other property, and at least one such plant or other property was not in operation before January 1, 1969, such facility shall be a treatment facility only to the extent of that part of the cost thereof certified by the Federal certifying authority as attributable to abating or controlling water or atmospheric pollution in connection with plants or other property in operation before January 1, 1969. For example, if a machine is constructed after December 31, 1968, at a cost of $100,000 and is used in connection with a number of plants only some of which were in operation before January 1, 1969, and if the Federal certifying authority certifies that $20,000 of the cost of such machine is allocable to its function of abating or controlling water pollution in connection with the plants or other property in operation before January 1, 1969, such $20,000 will be deemed to be the adjusted basis for purposes of determining gain for purposes of paragraph (a) of § 1.169-3. In a case in which the Federal certifying authority certifies the percentage of a facility which is used in connection with plants or other property in operation before January 1, 1969, the adjusted basis for the purposes of determining gain for purposes of paragraph (a) of § 1.169-3 of the portion of the facility so used shall be the adjusted basis for determining gain of the entire facility multiplied by such percentage.
(4)
Plant or other property.
As used in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, the phrase “plant or other property” means any tangible property whether or not such property is used in the trade or business or held for the production of income. Such term includes, for example, a papermill, a motor vehicle, or a furnace in an apartment house.
(5)
In operation before January 1, 1969.
(i) For purposes of subparagraph (2) of this paragraph and section 169 (d), a plant or other property will be considered to be in operation before January 1, 1969, if prior to that date such plant or other property was actually performing the function for which it was constructed or acquired. For example, a papermill which is completed in July 1968, but which is not actually used to produce paper until 1969 would not be considered to be in operation before January 1, 1969. The fact that such plant or other property was only operating at partial capacity prior to January 1, 1969, or was being used as a standby facility prior to such date, shall not prevent its being considered to be in operation before such date.
(ii)(
a
) A piece of machinery which replaces one which was in operation prior to January 1, 1969, and which was a part of the manufacturing operation carried on by the plant but which does not substantially increase the capacity of the plant will be considered to be in operation prior to January 1, 1969. However, an additional machine that is added to a plant which was in operation before January 1, 1969, and which represents a substantial increase in the plant's capacity will not be considered to have been in operation before such date. There shall be deemed to be a substantial increase in the capacity of a plant or other property as of the time its capacity exceeds by more than 20 percent its capacity on December 31, 1968.
(
b
) In addition, if the total replacements of equipment in any single taxable year beginning after December 31, 1968, represents the replacement of a substantial portion of a manufacturing plant which had been in operation before such date, such replacement shall be considered to result in a new plant which was not in operation before such date. Thus, if a substantial portion of a plant which was in existence before January 1, 1969, is subsequently destroyed by fire and such substantial portion is replaced in a taxable year beginning after that date, such replacement property shall not be considered to have been in operation before January 1, 1969. The replacement of a substantial portion of a plant or other property shall be deemed to have occurred if, during a single taxable year, the taxpayer replaces manufacturing or production facilities or equipment which comprises such plant or other property and which has an adjusted basis (determined without regard to the adjustments provided in section 1016(a) (2) and (3)) in excess of 20 percent of the adjusted basis (so determined) of such plant or other property determined as of the first day of such taxable year.
(6)
Useful life.
For purposes of section 169 and the regulations thereunder, the terms “useful life” and “actual useful life” shall mean the shortest period authorized under section 167 and the regulations thereunder if an election were not made under section 169.
(b)
New identifiable facility
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, the term “new identifiable facility” includes only tangible property (not including a building and its structural components referred to in subparagraph (2)(i) of this paragraph, other than a building and its structural components which under subparagraph (2)(ii) of this paragraph is exclusively a treatment facility) which—
(i) Is of a character subject to the allowance for depreciation provided in section 167,
(ii)(
a
) Is property the construction, reconstruction, or erection (as defined in subparagraph (2)(iii) of this paragraph) of which is completed by the taxpayer after December 31, 1968, or
(
b
) Is property acquired by the taxpayer after December 31, 1968, if the original use of the property commences with the taxpayer and commences after such date (see subparagraph (2)(iii) of this paragraph), and
(iii) Is placed in service (as defined in subparagraph (2)(v) of this paragraph) prior to January 1, 1975.

Meaning of terms.
(i) For purposes of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, the terms “building” and “structural component” shall be construed in a manner consistent with the principles set forth in paragraph (e) of § 1.48-1. Thus, for example, the following rules are applicable:
(
a
) The term “building” generally means any structure or edifice enclosing a space within its walls, and usually covered by a roof, the purpose of which is, for example, to provide shelter or housing, or to provide working, office, parking, display, or sales space. The term includes, for example, structures such as apartment houses, factory and office buildings, warehouses, barns, garages, railway or bus stations, and stores. Such term includes any such structure constructed by, or for, a lessee even if such structure must be removed, or ownership of such structure reverts to the lessor, at the termination of the lease. Such term does not include (
1
) a structure which is essentially an item of machinery or equipment, or (
2
) an enclosure which is so closely combined with the machinery or equipment which it supports, houses, or serves that it must be replaced, retired, or abandoned contemporaneously with such machinery or equipment, and which is depreciated over the life of such machinery or equipment. Thus, the term “building” does not include such structures as oil and gas storage tanks, grain storage bins, silos, fractioning towers, blast furnaces, coke ovens, brick kilns, and coal tipples.
(
b
) The term “structural components” includes, for example, chimneys, and other components relating to the operating or maintenance of a building. However, the term “structural components” does not include machinery or a device which serves no function other than the abatement or
control of water or atmospheric pollution.
(ii) For purposes of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, a building and its structural components will be considered to be exclusively a treatment facility if its only function is the abatement or control of air or water pollution. However, the incidental recovery of profits from wastes or otherwise shall not be deemed to be a function other than the abatement or control of air or water pollution. A building and its structural components which serve no function other than the treatment of wastes will be considered to be exclusively a treatment facility even if it contains areas for employees to operate the treatment facility, rest rooms for such workers, and an office for the management of such treatment facility. However, for example, if a portion of a building is used for the treatment of sewage and another portion of the building is used for the manufacture of machinery, the building is not exclusively a treatment facility. The Federal certifying authority will not certify as to what is a building and its structural components within the meaning of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph.
(iii) For purposes of subparagraph (1)(ii) (
a
) and (
b
) of this paragraph (relating to construction, reconstruction, or erection after December 31, 1968, and original use after December 31, 1968) and paragraph (b)(1) of § 1.169-3 (relating to definition of amortizable basis), the principles set forth in paragraph (a) (1) and (2) of § 1.167(c)-1 and in paragraphs (b) and (c) of § 1.48-2 shall be applied. Thus, for example, the following rules are applicable:
(
a
) Property is considered as constructed, reconstructed, or erected by the taxpayer if the work is done for him in accordance with his specifications.
(
b
) The portion of the basis of property attributable to construction, reconstruction, or erection after December 31, 1968, consists of all costs of construction, reconstruction, or erection allocable to the period after December 31, 1968, including the cost or other basis of materials entering into such work (but not including, in the case of reconstruction of property, the adjusted basis of the property as of the time such reconstruction is commenced).
(
c
) It is not necessary that materials entering into construction, reconstruction or erection be acquired after December 31, 1968, or that they be new in use.
(
d
) If construction or erection by the taxpayer began after December 31, 1968, the entire cost or other basis of such construction or erection may be taken into account for purposes of determining the amortizable basis under section 169.
(
e
) Construction, reconstruction, or erection by the taxpayer begins when physical work is started on such construction, reconstruction, or erection.
(
f
) Property shall be deemed to be acquired when reduced to physical possession or control.
(
g
) The term “original use” means the first use to which the property is put, whether or not such use corresponds to the use of such property by the taxpayer. For example, a reconditioned or rebuilt machine acquired by the taxpayer after December 31, 1968, for pollution control purposes will not be treated as being put to original use by the taxpayer regardless of whether it was used for purposes other than pollution control by its previous owner. Whether property is reconditioned or rebuilt property is a question of fact. Property will not be treated as reconditioned or rebuilt merely because it contains some used parts.
(iv) For purposes of subparagraph (1)(iii) of this paragraph (relating to property placed in service prior to January 1, 1975), the principles set forth in paragraph (d) of § 1.46-3 are applicable. Thus, property shall be considered placed in service in the earlier of the following taxable years:
(
a
) The taxable year in which, under the taxpayer's depreciation practice, the period for depreciation with respect to such property begins or would have begun; or
(
b
) The taxable year in which the property is placed in a condition or state of readiness and availability for the abatement or control of water or atmospheric pollution.
Thus, if property meets the conditions of (
b
) of this subdivision in a taxable
year, it shall be considered placed in service in such year notwithstanding that the period for depreciation with respect to such property begins or would have begun in a succeeding taxable year because, for example, under the taxpayer's depreciation practice such property is or would have been accounted for in a multiple asset account and depreciation is or would have been computed under an “averaging convention” (§ 1.167(a)-10), or depreciation with respect to such property would have been computed under the completed contract method, the unit of production method, or the retirement method. In the case of property acquired by a taxpayer for use in his trade or business (or in the production of income), property shall be considered in a condition or state of readiness and availability for the abatement or control of water or atmospheric pollution if, for example, equipment is acquired for the abatement or control of water or atmospheric pollution and is operational but is undergoing testing to eliminate any defects. However, materials and parts acquired to be used in the construction of an item of equipment shall not be considered in a condition or state of readiness and availability for the abatement or control of water or atmospheric pollution.
(c)
Certification
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, a facility is certified in accordance with the rules prescribed in this paragraph if—
(i) The State certifying authority (as defined in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph) having jurisdiction with respect to such facility has certified to the Federal certifying authority (as defined in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph) that the facility was constructed, reconstructed, erected, or acquired in conformity with the State program or requirements for the abatement or control of water or atmospheric pollution or contamination applicable at the time of such certification, and
(ii) The Federal certifying authority has certified such facility to the Secretary or his delegate as (
a
) being in compliance with the applicable regulations of Federal agencies (such as, for example, the Atomic Energy Commission's regulations pertaining to radiological discharge (10 CFR Part 20)) and (
b
) being in furtherance of the general policy of the United States for cooperation with the States in the prevention and abatement of water pollution under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended (33 U.S.C. 1151-1175) or in the prevention and abatement of atmospheric pollution and contamination under the Clean Air Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. 1857
et seq.
).
(2)
State certifying authority.
The term “state certifying authority” means—
(i) In the case of water pollution, the State water pollution control agency as defined in section 23(a) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended (33 U.S.C. 1173(a)),
(ii) In the case of air pollution, the air pollution control agency designated pursuant to section 302(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. 1857h(b)), and
(iii) Any interstate agency authorized to act in place of a certifying authority of a State. See section 23(a) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended (33 U.S.C. 1173(b)) and section 302(c) of the Clean Air Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. 1857h(c)).
(3)
Federal certifying authority.
The term “Federal certifying authority” means the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (see Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1970, 35 FR 15623).
(d)
Profitmaking abatement works, etc.
—(1)
In general.
Section 169(e) provides that the Federal certifying authority shall not certify any property to the extent it appears that by reason of estimated profits to be derived through the recovery of wastes or otherwise in the operation of such property its costs will be recovered over the period referred to in paragraph (a) (6) of this section for such property. The Federal certifying authority need not certify the amount of estimated profits to be derived from such recovery of wastes or otherwise with respect to such facility. Such estimated profits shall be determined pursuant to subparagraph (2) of this paragraph. However, the Federal certifying authority shall certify—
(i) Whether, in connection with any treatment facility so certified, there is
potential cost recovery through the recovery of wastes or otherwise, and
(ii) A specific description of the wastes which will be recovered, or the nature of such cost recovery if otherwise than through the recovery of wastes.
For effect on computation of amortizable basis, see paragraph (c) of § 1.169-3.
(2)
Estimated profits.
For purpose of this paragraph, the term “estimated profits” means the estimated gross receipts from the sale of recovered wastes reduced by the sum of the (i) estimated average annual maintenance and operating expenses, including utilities and labor, allocable to that portion of the facility which is certified as a treatment facility pursuant to paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section which produces the recovered waste from which the gross receipts are derived, and (ii) estimated selling expenses. However, in determining expenses to be subtracted neither depreciation nor amortization of the facility is to be taken into account. Estimated profits shall not include any estimated savings to the taxpayer by reason of the taxpayer's reuse or recycling of wastes or other items recovered in connection with the operation of the plant or other property served by the treatment facility.
(3)
Special rules.
The estimates of cost recovery required by subparagraph (2) of this paragraph shall be based on the period referred to in paragraph (a)(6) of this section. Such estimates shall be made at the time the election provided for by section 169 is made and shall also be set out in the application for certification made to the Federal certifying authority. There shall be no redetermination of estimated profits due to unanticipated fluctuations in the market price for wastes or other items, to an unanticipated increase or decrease in the costs of extracting them from the gas or liquid released, or to other unanticipated factors or events occurring after certification.
[T.D. 7116, 36 FR 9013, May 18, 1971; 36 FR 9770, May 28, 1971]
§ 1.169-3
Amortizable basis.
(a)
In general.
The amortizable basis of a certified pollution control facility for the purpose of computing the amortization deduction under section 169 is the adjusted basis of the facility for purposes of determining gain (see part II (section 1011 and following), subchapter O, chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code), in conjunction with paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section. The adjusted basis for purposes of determining gain (computed without regard to paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section) of a facility that performs a function in addition to pollution control, or that is used in connection with more than one plant or other property, or both, is determined under § 1.169-2(a)(3). For rules as to additions and improvements to such a facility, see paragraph (f) of this section. Before computing the amortization deduction allowable under section 169, the adjusted basis for purposes of determining gain for a facility that is placed in service by a taxpayer after September 10, 2001, and that is qualified property under section 168(k)(2) or § 1.168(k)-1, 50-percent bonus depreciation property under section 168(k)(4) or § 1.168(k)-1, or qualified New York Liberty Zone property under section 1400L(b) or § 1.1400L(b)-1 must be reduced by the amount of the additional first year depreciation deduction allowed or allowable, whichever is greater, under section 168(k) or section 1400L(b), as applicable, for the facility. Further, before computing the amortization deduction allowable under section 169, the adjusted basis for purposes of determining gain for a facility that is acquired and placed in service after September 27, 2017, and that is qualified property under section 168(k), as amended by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Public Law 115-97 (131 Stat. 2054 (December 22, 2017)) (the “Act”), or § 1.168(k)-2, must be reduced by the amount of the additional first year depreciation deduction allowed or allowable, whichever is greater, under section 168(k), as amended by the Act.
(b)
Limitation to post-1968 construction, reconstruction, or erection.
(1) If the construction, reconstruction, or erection was begun before January 1, 1969, there shall be included in the amortizable basis only so much of the adjusted basis of such facility for purposes of determining gain (referred to in paragraph (a) of this section) as is properly attributable under the rules set forth
in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of § 1.169-2 to construction, reconstruction, or erection after December 31, 1968. See section 169 (d)(4). For example, assume a certified pollution control facility for which the shortest period authorized under section 167 is 10 years has a cost of $500,000, of which $450,000 is attributable to construction after December 31, 1968. Further, assume such facility does not perform a function in addition to pollution control and is used only in connection with a plant in operation before January 1, 1969. The facility would have an amortizable basis of $450,000 (computed without regard to paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section). For depreciation of the remaining portion ($50,000) of the cost, see section 169(g) and paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of § 1.169-1. For the definition of the term “certified pollution control facility” see paragraph (a) of § 1.169-2.
(2) If the taxpayer elects to begin the 60-month amortization period with the first month of the taxable year succeeding the taxable year in which the facility is completed or acquired and a depreciation deduction is allowable under section 167 (including an additional first-year depreciation allowance under former section 179; for a facility that is acquired by the taxpayer after September 10, 2001, and that is qualified property under section 168(k)(2) or § 1.168(k)-1 or qualified New York Liberty Zone property under section 1400L(b) or § 1.1400L(b)-1, the additional first year depreciation deduction under section 168(k)(1) or 1400L(b), as applicable; and for a facility that is acquired by the taxpayer after May 5, 2003, and that is 50-percent bonus depreciation property under section 168(k)(4) or § 1.168(k)-1, the additional first year depreciation deduction under section 168(k)(4)) with respect to the facility for the taxable year in which it is completed or acquired, the amount determined under paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall be reduced by an amount equal to the amount of the depreciation deduction allowed or allowable, whichever is greater, multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the amount determined under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and the denominator of which is the facility's total cost. The additional first-year allowance for depreciation under former section 179 will be allowable only for the taxable year in which the facility is completed or acquired and only if the taxpayer elects to begin the amortization deduction under section 169 with the taxable year succeeding the taxable year in which such facility is completed or acquired. For a facility that is acquired by a taxpayer after September 10, 2001, and that is qualified property under section 168(k)(2) or § 1.168(k)-1 or qualified New York Liberty Zone property under section 1400L(b) or § 1.1400L(b)-1, see § 1.168(k)-1(f)(4) or § 1.1400L(b)-1(f)(4), as applicable, with respect to when the additional first year depreciation deduction under section 168(k)(1) or 1400L(b) is allowable. For a facility that is acquired by a taxpayer after May 5, 2003, and that is 50-percent bonus depreciation property under section 168(k)(4) or § 1.168(k)-1, see § 1.168(k)-1(f)(4) with respect to when the additional first year depreciation deduction under section 168(k)(4) is allowable.
(c)
Modification for profitmaking abatement works, etc.
If it appears that by reason of estimated profits to be derived through the recovery of wastes or otherwise (as determined by applying the rules prescribed in paragraph (d) of § 1.169-2) a portion or all of the total costs of the certified pollution control facility will be recovered over the period referred to in paragraph (a)(b) of § 1.169-2, its amortizable basis (computed without regard to this paragraph and paragraph (d) of this section) shall be reduced by an amount equal to (1) its amortizable basis (so computed) multiplied by (2) a fraction the numerator of which is such estimated profits and the denominator of which is its adjusted basis for purposes of determining gain. See section 169(e).
(d)
Cases in which the period referred to in paragraph (a)(6) of § 1.169-2 exceeds 15 years.
If as to a certified pollution control facility the period referred to in paragraph (a)(6) of § 1.169-2 exceeds 15 years (determined as of the first day of the first month for which a deduction is allowable under the election made under the section 169(b) and paragraph (a) of § 1.169-4), the amortizable basis of such facility shall be an amount equal to (1) its amortizable basis (computed
without regard to this paragraph) multiplied by (2) a fraction the numerator of which is 15 years and the denominator of which is the number of years of such period. See section 169(f) (2)(A).
(e)
Examples.
This section may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example 1.
The X Corporation, which uses the calendar year as its taxable year, began the installation of a facility on November 1, 1968, and completed the installation on June 30, 1970, at a cost of $400,000. All of the facility qualifies as a certified pollution control facility within the meaning of paragraph (a) of § 1.169-2. $40,000 of such cost is attributable to construction prior to January 1, 1969. The X Corporation elects to take amortization deductions under section 169(a) with respect to the facility and to begin the 60-month amortization period with January 1, 1971. The corporation takes a depreciation deduction under sections 167 and 179 of $10,000 (the amount allowable, of which $2,000 is for additional first year depreciation under section 179) for the last 6 months of 1970. It is estimated that over the period referred to in paragraph (a) (6) of § 1.169-2 (20 years) as to such facility, $80,000 in profits will be realized from the sale of wastes recovered in its operation. The amortizable basis of the facility for purposes of computing the amortization deduction as of January 1, 1971, is $210,600, computed as follows:
(1) Portion of $400,000 cost attributable to post-1968 construction, reconstruction, or erection
$360,000
(2) Reduction for portion of depreciation deduction taken for the taxable year in which the facility was completed:
(a) $10,000 depreciation deduction taken for last 6 months of 1970 including $2,000 for additional first year depreciation under section 179
$10,000
(b) Multiplied by the amount in line (1) and divided by the total cost of the facility ($360,000/ $400,000)
0.9
$9,000
(3) Subtotal
$351,000
(4) Modification for profitmaking abatement works: Multiply line (3) by estimated profits through waste recovery ($80,000) and divide by the adjusted basis for determining gain of the facility ($400,000).
(5) Reduction
$70,200
(6) Subtotal
$280,800
(7) Modification for period referred to in paragraph (a)(6) of § 1.169-2 exceeding 15 years: Multiply by 15 years and divide by such period (determined in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section) (20 years)
0.75
(8) Amortizable basis
$210,600

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in example (1) except that the facility is used in connection with a number of separate plants some of which were in operation before January 1, 1969, that the Federal certifying authority certifies that 80 percent of the capacity of the facility is allocable to the plants which were in operation before such date, and that all of the waste recovery is allocable to the portion of the facility used in connection with the plants in operation before January 1, 1969. The amortizable basis of such facility, for purposes of computing the amortization deduction as of January 1, 1971, is $157,950 computed as follows:
(1) Adjusted basis for purposes of determining gain: Multiply percent certified as allocable to plants in operation before January 1, 1969 (80 percent) by cost of entire facility ($400,000)
$320,000
(2) Portion of adjusted basis for determining gain attributable to post-1968 construction, reconstruction, or rection: Multiply line (1) by portion of total cost of facility attributable to post-1968 construction, reconstruction, or erection ($360,000) and divide by the total cost of the facility ($400,000)
$288,000
(3) Reduction for portion of depreciation deduction taken for the taxable year in which the facility was completed:
(a) $10,000 depreciation deduction taken for last 6 months of 1970 including $2,000 for additional first year depreciation under section 170
$10,000
(b) Multiplied by the amount in line (2) and divided by the total cost of the facility ($288,000/$400,000)
0.72
$7,200
(4) Subtotal
$280,800
(5) Modification for profitmaking abatement works; Multiply line (4) by estimated profits through waste recovery ($80,000) and divide by the amount in line (1) ($320,000).
(6) Reduction
$70,200
(7) Subtotal
$210,600
(8) Modification for period referred to in paragraph (a)(6) of § 1.169-2 exceeding 15 years: Multiply by 15 years and divide by such period (determined in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section) (20 years)
0.75
(9) Amortizable basis
$157,950
(f)
Additions or improvements.
(1) If after the completion or acquisition of a certified pollution control facility further expenditures are made for additional construction, reconstruction, or improvements, the cost of such additions or improvements made prior to the beginning of the amortization period shall increase the amortizable basis of such facility, but the cost of additions or improvements made after the amortization period has begun, shall not increase the amortizable basis. See section 169(f)(2)(B).
(2) If expenditures for such additional construction, reconstruction, or improvements result in a facility which is
new and is separately certified as a certified pollution control facility as defined in section 169(d)(1) and paragraph (a) of § 1.169-2, and, if proper election is made, such expenditures shall be taken into account in computing under paragraph (a) of this section the amortizable basis of such new and separately certified pollution control facility.
(g)
Effective date for qualified property, 50-percent bonus depreciation property, and qualified New York Liberty Zone property.
This section applies to a certified pollution control facility. This section also applies to a certified pollution control facility that is qualified property under section 168(k)(2) or qualified New York Liberty Zone property under section 1400L(b) acquired by a taxpayer after September 10, 2001, and to a certified pollution control facility that is 50-percent bonus depreciation property under section 168(k)(4) acquired by a taxpayer after May 5, 2003. The last sentence of paragraph (a) of this section applies to a certified pollution control facility that is qualified property under section 168(k)(2) and placed in service by a taxpayer during or after the taxpayer's taxable year that includes September 24, 2019. However, a taxpayer may choose to apply the last sentence of paragraph (a) of this section to a certified pollution control facility that is qualified property under section 168(k)(2) and acquired and placed in service after September 27, 2017, by the taxpayer during taxable years ending on or after September 28, 2017. A taxpayer may rely on the last sentence in paragraph (a) of this section in regulation project REG-104397-18 (2018-41 IRB 558) (see § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(b) of this chapter) for a certified pollution control facility that is qualified property under section 168(k)(2) and acquired and placed in service after September 27, 2017, by the taxpayer during taxable years ending on or after September 28, 2017, and ending before the taxpayer's taxable year that includes September 24, 2019.

§ 1.169-4
Time and manner of making elections.
(a)
Election of amortization
—(1)
In general.
Under section 169(b), an election by the taxpayer to take an amortization deduction with respect to a certified pollution control facility and to begin the 60-month amortization period (either with the month following the month in which the facility is completed or acquired, or with the first month of the taxable year succeeding the taxable year in which such facility is completed or acquired) shall be made by a statement to that effect attached to its return for the taxable year in which falls the first month of the 60-month amortization period so elected. Such statement shall include the following information (if not otherwise included in the documents referred to in subdivision (ix) of this subparagraph):
(i) A description clearly identifying each certified pollution control facility for which an amortization deduction is claimed;
(ii) The date on which such facility was completed or acquired (see paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of § 1.169-2);
(iii) The period referred to in paragraph (a)(6) of § 1.169-2 for the facility as of the date the property is placed in service;
(iv) The date as of which the amortization period is to begin;
(v) The date the plant or other property to which the facility is connected began operating (see paragraph (a)(5) of § 1.169-2);
(vi) The total costs and expenditures paid or incurred in the acquisition, construction, and installation of such facility;
(vii) A description of any wastes which the facility will recover during the course of its operation, and a reasonable estimate of the profits which will be realized by the sale of such wastes whether pollutants or otherwise, over the period referred to in paragraph (a)(6) of § 1.169-2 as to the facility. Such estimate shall include a schedule setting forth a detailed computation illustrating how the estimate was arrived at including every element prescribed in the definition of estimated profits in paragraph (d)(2) of § 1.169-2;
(viii) A computation showing the amortizable basis (as defined in § 1.169-3) of the facility as of the first month for which the amortization deduction provided for by section 169(a) is elected; and
(ix)(
a
) A statement that the facility has been certified by the Federal certifying authority, together with a copy of such certification, and a copy of the application for certification which was filed with and approved by the Federal certifying authority or (
b),
if the facility has not been certified by the Federal certifying authority, a statement that application has been made to the proper State certifying authority (see paragraph (c)(2) of § 1.169-2) together with a copy of such application and (except in the case of an election to which subparagraph (4) of this paragraph applies) a copy of the application filed or to be filed with the Federal certifying authority.
If subdivision (ix)(
b
) of this subparagraph applies, within 90 days after receipt by the taxpayer, the certification from the Federal certifying authority shall be filed by the taxpayer with the district director, or with the director of the internal revenue service center, with whom the return referred to in this subparagraph was filed.
(2)
Special rule.
If the return for the taxable year in which falls the first month of the 60-month amortization period to be elected is filed before November 16, 1971, without making the election for such year, then on or before December 31, 1971 (or if there is no State certifying authority in existence on November 16, 1971, on or before the 90th day after such authority is established), the election may be made by a statement attached to an amended income tax return for the taxable year in which falls the first month of the 60-month amortization period so elected. Amended income tax returns or claims for credit or refund must also be filed at this time for other taxable years which are within the amortization period and which are subsequent to the taxable year for which the election is made. Nothing in this paragraph should be construed as extending the time specified in section 6511 within which a claim for credit or refund may be filed.
(3)
Other requirements and considerations.
No method of making the election provided for in section 169(a) other than that prescribed in this section shall be permitted on or after May 18, 1971. A taxpayer which does not elect in the manner prescribed in this section to take amortization deductions with respect to a certified pollution control facility shall not be entitled to such deductions. In the case of a taxpayer which elects prior to May 18, 1971, the statement required by subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall be attached to its income tax return for either its taxable year in which December 31, 1971, occurs or its taxable year preceding such year.

If a statement of election required by subparagraph (1) of this paragraph is attached to a return (including an amended return referred to in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph) filed before February 29, 1972, such statement of election need not include a copy of the Federal application to be filed with the Federal certifying authority but a copy of such application must be filed no later than February 29, 1972, by the taxpayer with the district director, or with the director of the internal revenue service center, with whom the return or amended return referred to in this subparagraph was filed.

Election to discontinue or revoke amortization
—(1)
Election to discontinue.
An election to discontinue the amortization deduction provided by section 169(c) and paragraph (a)(1) of § 1.169-1 shall be made by a statement in writing filed with the district director, or with the director of the internal revenue service center, with whom the return of the taxpayer is required to be filed for its taxable year in which falls the first month for which the election terminates. Such statement shall specify the month as of the beginning of which the taxpayer elects to discontinue such deductions. Unless the election to discontinue amortization is one to which subparagraph (2) of this paragraph applies, such statement shall be filed before the beginning of the month specified therein. In addition, such statement shall contain a description clearly identifying the certified pollution control facility with
respect to which the taxpayer elects to discontinue the amortization deduction, and, if a certification has previously been issued, a copy of the certification by the Federal certifying authority. If at the time of such election a certification has not been issued (or if one has been issued it has not been filed as provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section), the taxpayer shall file, with respect to any taxable year or years for which a deduction under section 169 has been taken, a copy of such certification within 90 days after receipt thereof. For purposes of this paragraph, notification to the Secretary or his delegate from the Federal certifying authority that the facility no longer meets the requirements under which certification was originally granted by the State or Federal certifying authority shall have the same effect as a notice from the taxpayer electing to terminate amortization as of the month following the month such facility ceased functioning in accordance with such requirements.
(2)
Revocation of elections made prior to May 18, 1971.
If on or before May 18, 1971, an election under section 169(a) has been made, such election may be revoked (see paragraph (a)(1) of § 1.169-1) by filing on or before August 16, 1971, a statement of revocation of an election under section 169(a) in accordance with the requirements in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph for filing a notice to discontinue an election. If such election to revoke is for a period which falls within one or more taxable years for which an income tax return has been filed, amended income tax returns shall be filed for any such taxable years in which deductions were taken under section 169 on or before August 16, 1971.
