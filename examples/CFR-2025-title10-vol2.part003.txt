§ 110.120
Purpose and scope.
(a) This subpart contains special procedures concerning access to, and introduction of, classified information into hearings under this part.
(b) These procedures do not in any way apply to classified information exchanged between the Executive Branch and the Commission not introduced into a hearing. Such information will be declassified to the maximum extent feasible. The public statements of the Commission staff and Executive Branch will, to the extent consistent with classification requirements, reflect consideration of any such classified information.
§ 110.121
Security clearances and access to classified information.
(a) No person without a security clearance will have access to classified information.
(b) Only the Commission will act upon an application for access to classified information.
(c) To the extent practicable, applications for access to classified information shall describe the information to which access is desired and its level of classification (confidential, secret or other); the reasons for requesting access; the names of individuals for whom access is requested; and the reasons why access is requested for those individuals.
(d) The Commission will consider requests for appropriate security clearances in reasonable numbers; conduct its review and grant or deny these in accordance with part 10 of this chapter; and make a reasonable charge to cover costs.
(e) The Commission will not grant security clearances for access to classified information, unless it determines that the available unclassified information is inadequate on the subject matter involved.
(f) When an application demonstrates that access to classified information not introduced into a hearing may be needed to prepare a participant's position on the hearing issues, the Commission may issue an order granting access to this information to the participant, his authorized representative or other persons. Access will be subject to the conditions in paragraphs (e) and (j) and will not be granted unless required security clearances have been obtained.
(g) Once classified information has been introduced into a hearing, the Commission will grant access to a participant, his authorized representative or such other persons as the Commission determines may be needed by the participant to prepare his position on the hearing issues. Access will be subject to the conditions in paragraphs (e) and (j) of this section and will not be granted unless required security clearances have been obtained.
(h) For good cause, the Commission may postpone action upon an application for access to classified information.
(i) The Commission will grant access to classified information only up to the level for which the persons described in paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section are cleared and only upon an adequate commitment by them not to disclose such information subject to penalties as provided by law.
(j) The Commission will not in any circumstances grant access to classified information:
(1) Unless it determines that the grant is not inimical to the common defense and security; and
(2) Which it has received from another Government agency, without the prior consent of the originating agency.
(k) Upon completion of a hearing, the Commission will terminate all security clearances granted pursuant to the hearing and may require the disposal of classified information to which access has been granted or the observance of other procedures to safeguard this information.
§ 110.122
Classification assistance.
On the request of any hearing participant or the presiding officer (if other than the Commission), the Commission will designate a representative to advise and assist the presiding officer or the participants with respect to security classification of information and the protective requirements to be observed.
§ 110.123
Notice of intent to introduce classified information.
(a) A participant shall seek the required security clearances, where necessary, and file with the Secretary a notice of intent to introduce classified information into a hearing at the earliest possible time after the notice of hearing.
(b) If a participant has not filed a notice of intent in accordance with this section, he may introduce classified information only if he gives to the other participants and the Commission prompt written notice of intent and only as permitted by the Commission when it determines that the public interest will not be prejudiced.
(c) The notice of intent shall be unclassified and, to the extent consistent with classification requirements, state:
(1) The subject matter of the classified information, which it is anticipated will be involved;
(2) The highest level of classification of the information (confidential, secret or other);
(3) When it is anticipated that the information would be introduced; and
(4) The relevance and materiality of the information to the hearing issues.
§ 110.124
Rearrangement or suspension of a hearing.
When a participant gives notice of intent to introduce classified information and other participants do not have the required security clearances, subject to § 110.121, the Commission may:
(a) Suspend or rearrange the normal order of the hearing to give other participants an opportunity to obtain the required security clearances with minimum delay in the conduct of the hearing; or
(b) Take such other action as it determines to be in the public interest.
§ 110.125

# Appendix B to Part 110—Illustrative List of Gas Centrifuge Enrichment Plant Components Under NRC's Export Licensing Authority
1.
Assemblies and components especially designed or prepared for use in gas centrifuges.

# Note:
The gas centrifuge normally consists of a thin-walled cylinder(s) of between 75 mm and 650 mm diameter contained in a vacuum environment and spun at high peripheral speed (of the order of 300 m/per second and more) with the central axis vertical. In order to achieve high speed, the materials of construction for the rotating rotor assembly, and hence its individual components, have to be manufactured to very close tolerances in order to minimize the unbalance. In contrast to other centrifuges, the gas centrifuge for uranium enrichment is characterized by having within the rotor chamber a rotating disc-shaped baffle(s) and a stationary tube arrangement for feeding and extracting uranium hexafluoride (UF
6
) gas and featuring at least three separate channels of which two are connected to scoops extending from the rotor axis towards the periphery of the rotor chamber. Also contained within the vacuum environment are a number of critical items which do not rotate and which, although they are especially designed, are not difficult
to fabricate nor are they fabricated out of unique materials. A centrifuge facility, however, requires a large number of these components so that quantities can provide an important indication of end use.

# 1.1 Rotating Components
(a) Complete Rotor Assemblies: Thin-walled cylinders, or a number of interconnected thin-walled cylinders, manufactured from one of the high strength-to-density ratio materials described in the footnote to this section.
If interconnected, the cylinders are joined together by flexible bellows or rings as described in § 1.1(c) of this appendix. The rotor is fitted with an internal baffle(s) and end caps, as described in § 1.1(d) and (e) of this appendix, if in final form. However, the complete assembly may be delivered only partly assembled.
(b) Rotor Tubes: Especially designed or prepared thin-walled cylinders with thickness of 12 mm or less, a diameter of between 75 mm and 650 mm, and manufactured from one of the high strength-to-density ratio materials described in the footnote to this section.
(c) Rings or Bellows: Components especially designed or prepared to give localized support to the rotor tube or to join together a number of rotor tubes. The bellows in a short cylinder of wall thickness 3 mm or less, a diameter of between 75 mm and 650 mm, having a convolute, and manufactured from one of the high strength-to-density ratio materials described in the footnote to this section.
(d) Baffles: Disc shaped components of between 75 mm and 650 mm diameter especially designed or prepared to be mounted inside the centrifuge rotor tube, in order to isolate the take-off chamber from the main separation chamber and, in some cases, to assist the UF
6
gas circulation within the main separation chamber of the rotor tube, and manufactured from one of the high strength-to-density ratio materials described in the footnote to this section.
(e) Top Caps/Bottom Caps: Disc shaped components of between 75 mm and 650 mm diameter especially designed or prepared to fit to the ends of the rotor tube, and so contain the UF
6
within the rotor tube, and in some cases to support, retain or contain as an integrated part, an element of the upper bearing (top cap) or to carry the rotating elements of the motor and lower bearing (bottom cap), and manufactured from one of the high strength-to-density ratio materials described in the footnote to this section.

# Footnote
The materials used for centrifuge rotating components include the following:
(a) Maraging steel capable of an ultimate tensile strength of 1.95 GPa or more.

(“Specific Modulus” is the Young's modulus in N/m
2
divided by the specific weight inN/m
3
when measured at a temperature of 23 ±20 °C and a relative humidity of 50 ±5 percent. “Specific tensile strength” is the ultimate tensile strength in N/m
2
divided by the specific weight in N/m
3
when measured at a temperature of 23 ±20 °C and a relative humidity of 50 ±5 percent.)

# 1.2 Static Components
(a) Magnetic Suspension Bearings: 1. Especially designed or prepared bearing assemblies consisting of an annular magnet suspended within a housing containing a damping medium. The housing will be manufactured from a UF
6
resistant material (see footnote to § 2 of this appendix). The magnet couples with a pole piece or a second magnet fitted to the top cap described in § 1.1(e) of this appendix. The magnet may be ring-shaped with a relation between outer and inner diameter smaller or equal to 1.6:1. The magnet may be in a form having an initial permeability of 0.15 Henry/meter or more, or a remanence of 98.5 percent or more, or an energy product of greater than 80,000 joules/m
3
. In addition to the usual material properties, it is a prerequisite that the deviation of the magnetic axes from the geometrical axes is limited to very small tolerances (lower than 0.1 mm) or that homogeneity of the material of the magnet is specially called for.
2. Active magnetic bearings especially designed or prepared for use with gas centrifuges. These bearings usually have the following characteristics:
(i) Designed to keep centred a rotor spinning at 600 Hz or more; and
(ii) Associated to a reliable electrical power supply and/or to an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) unit in order to function for more than 1 hour.
(b) Bearings/Dampers: Especially designed or prepared bearings comprising a pivot/cup assembly mounted on a damper. The pivot is normally a hardened steel shaft polished into a hemisphere at one end with a means of attachment to the bottom cap described in § 1.1(e) of this appendix at the other.

The housing may also be a honeycomb type structure to accommodate several rotor tubes.
(f) Scoops: Especially designed or prepared tubes for the extraction of UF
6
gas from within the rotor tube by a Pitot tube action (that is, with an aperture facing into the circumferential gas flow within the rotor tube, for example by bending the end of a radially disposed tube) and capable of being fixed to the central gas extraction system.
2.
Especially designed or prepared auxiliary systems, equipment, and components for gas centrifuge enrichment plants.

# Note:
The auxiliary systems, equipment, and components for a gas centrifuge enrichment plant are the systems of the plant needed to feed UF
6
to the centrifuges to link the individual centrifuges to each other to form cascades (or stages) to allow for progressively higher enrichments and to extract the product and tails of UF
6
from the centrifuges, together with the equipment required to drive the centrifuges or to control the plant.
Normally UF
6
is evaporated from the solid using heated autoclaves and is distributed in gaseous form to the centrifuges by way of cascade header pipework. The “product” and “tails” of UF
6
gaseous streams flowing from the centrifuges are also passed by way of cascade header pipework to cold traps (operating at about 203 K (−70 °C)) where they are condensed prior to onward transfer into suitable containers for transportation or storage. Because an enrichment plant consists of many thousands of centrifuges arranged in cascades, there are many kilometers of cascade header pipework incorporating thousands of welds with a substantial amount of repetition of layout. The equipment, component and piping systems are fabricated to very high vacuum and cleanliness standards.
Some of the items listed below either come into direct contact with the UF
6
process gas or directly control the centrifuges and the passage of the gas from centrifuge to centrifuge and cascade to cascade. Materials resistant to corrosion by UF
6
include copper, copper alloys, stainless steel, aluminum, aluminum oxide, aluminum alloys, nickel or alloys containing 60 percent or more nickel, and fluorinated hydrocarbon polymers.
(a) Feed Systems/Product and Tails Withdrawal Systems: Especially designed or prepared process systems or equipment for enrichment plants made of or protected by materials resistant to corrosion by UF

6
from the enrichment process for subsequent transfer upon heating.
3. Solidification or liquefaction stations used to remove UF
6
from the enrichment process by compressing and converting UF
6
to a liquid or solid form.
4. “Product” and “tails” stations used for transferring UF
6
into containers.
(b) Machine Header Piping Systems: Especially designed or prepared piping systems and header systems for handling UF
6
within the centrifuge cascades.
This piping network is normally of the “triple” header system with each centrifuge connected to each of the headers. There is therefore a substantial amount of repetition in its form. It is wholly made of or protected by UF
6
resistant materials (see Note to this section) and is fabricated to very high vacuum and cleanliness standards.

1. Shut-off valves especially designed or prepared to act on the feed, “product” or “tails” UF

1. A multiphase output of 600 Hz or greater; and
2. High stability (with frequency control better than 0.2 percent).
(f) Any other components especially designed or prepared for use in a gas centrifuge enrichment plant or in any of the components described in this appendix.

# Appendix C to Part 110—Illustrative List of Gaseous Diffusion Enrichment Plant Assemblies and Components Under NRC Export Licensing Authority

# Note:
In the gaseous diffusion method of uranium isotope separation, the main technological assembly is a special porous gaseous diffusion barrier, heat exchanger for cooling the gas (which is heated by the process of compression), seal valves and control valves, and pipelines. Inasmuch as gaseous diffusion technology uses uranium hexafluoride (UF
6
), all equipment, pipeline and instrumentation surfaces (that come in contact with the gas) must be made of materials that remain stable in contact with UF
6
. A gaseous diffusion facility requires a number of these assemblies, so that quantities can provide an important indication of end use.
The auxiliary systems, equipment, and components for gaseous diffusion enrichment plants are the systems of plant needed to feed UF
6
to the gaseous diffusion assembly to link the individual assemblies to each other to form cascades (or stages) to allow for progressively higher enrichments and to extract the “product” and “tails” UF
6
from the diffusion cascades. Because of the high inertial properties of diffusion cascades, any interruption in their operation, and especially their shut-down, leads to serious consequences. Therefore, a strict and constant maintenance of vacuum in all technological systems, automatic protection for accidents, and precise automated regulation of the gas flow is of importance in a gaseous diffusion plant. All this leads to a need to equip the plant with a large number of special measuring, regulating, and controlling systems.
Normally UF
6
is evaporated from cylinders placed within autoclaves and is distributed in gaseous form to the entry point by way of cascade header pipework. The “product” and “tails” UF
6
gaseous streams flowing from exit points are passed by way of cascade header pipework to either cold traps or to compression stations where the UF
6
gas is liquified prior to onward transfer into suitable containers for transportation or storage. Because a gaseous diffusion enrichment plant consists of a large number of gaseous diffusion assemblies arranged in cascades, there are many kilometers of cascade header pipework, incorporating thousands of welds with substantial amounts of repetition of layout. The equipment, components, and piping systems are fabricated to very high vacuum and cleanliness standards.
The items listed below either come into direct contact with the UF
6
process gas or directly control the flow within the cascade. All surfaces which come into contact with the process gas are wholly made of, or lined with, UF
6
-resistant materials. For the purposes of this appendix, the materials resistant to corrosion by UF

# Appendix D to Part 110—Illustrative List of Aerodynamic Enrichment Plant Equipment and Components Under NRC Export Licensing Authority

# Note:
In aerodynamic enrichment processes, a mixture of gaseous UF
6
and light gas (hydrogen or helium) is compressed and then passed through separating elements wherein isotopic separation is accomplished by the generation of high centrifugal forces over a curved-wall geometry. Two processes of this type have been successfully developed: The
separation nozzle process and the vortex tube process. For both processes, the main components of a separation stage included cylindrical vessels housing the special separation elements (nozzles or vortex tubes), gas compressors, and heat exchangers to remove the heat of compression. An aerodynamic plant requires a number of these stages, so that quantities can provide an important indication of end use. Because aerodynamic processes use UF
6
, all equipment, pipeline and instrumentation surfaces (that come in contact with the gas) must be made of, or protected by, materials that remain stable in contact with UF
6
. All surfaces which come into contact with the process gas are made of, or protected by, UF
6

# Appendix E to Part 110—Illustrative List of Chemical Exchange or Ion Exchange Enrichment Plant Equipment and Components Under NRC Export Licensing Authority

# Note:
The slight difference in mass between the isotopes of uranium causes small changes in chemical reaction equilibria that can be used as a basis for separation of the isotopes. Two processes have been successfully developed: Liquid-liquid chemical exchange and solid-liquid ion exchange.
A. In the liquid-liquid chemical exchange process, immiscible liquid phases (aqueous and organic) are countercurrently contacted to give the cascading effect of thousands of separation stages. The aqueous phase consists of uranium chloride in hydrochloric acid solution; the organic phase consists of an extractant containing uranium chloride in an organic solvent. The contactors employed in the separation cascade can be liquid-liquid exchange columns (such as pulsed columns with sieve plates) or liquid centrifugal contactors. Chemical conversions (oxidation and reduction) are required at both ends of the separation cascade in order to provide for the reflux requirements at each end. A major design concern is to avoid contamination of the process streams with certain metal ions. Plastic, plastic-lined (including use of fluorocarbon polymers) and/or glass-lined columns and piping are therefore used.
(1) Liquid-liquid exchange columns.
Countercurrent liquid-liquid exchange columns having mechanical power input especially designed or prepared for uranium enrichment using the chemical exchange process. For corrosion resistance to concentrated hydrochloric acid solutions, these columns and their internals are normally made of, or protected by, suitable plastic materials (such as fluorinated hydrocarbon polymers) or glass. The stage residence time of the columns is normally designed to be 30 seconds or less.
(2) Liquid-liquid centrifugal contactors.
Especially designed or prepared for uranium enrichment using the chemical exchange process. These contactors use rotation to achieve dispersion of the organic and aqueous streams and then centrifugal force to separate the phases. For corrosion resistance to concentrated hydrochloric acid solutions, the contactors are normally made of, or protected by, suitable plastic materials (such as fluorinated hydrocarbon polymers) or glass. The stage residence time of the centrifugal contactors is designed to be short (30 seconds or less).
(3) Uranium reduction systems and equipment.
(i) Especially designed or prepared electrochemical reduction cells to reduce uranium from one valence state to another for uranium enrichment using the chemical exchange process. The cell materials in contact with process solutions must be corrosion resistant to concentrated hydrochloric acid solutions.
The cell cathodic compartment must be designed to prevent re-oxidation of uranium to its higher valence state. To keep the uranium in the cathodic compartment, the cell may have an impervious diaphragm membrane constructed of special cation exchange material. The cathode consists of a suitable solid conductor such as graphite.
These systems consist of solvent extraction equipment for stripping the U
+4
from the organic stream into an aqueous solution, evaporation and/or other equipment to accomplish solution pH adjustment and control, and pumps or other transfer devices for feeding to the electrochemical reduction cells. A major design concern is to avoid contamination of the aqueous stream with certain metal ions. For those parts in contact with the process stream, the system is constructed of equipment made of, or protected by, materials such as glass, fluorocarbon polymers, polyphenyl sulfate, polyether sulfone, and resin-impregnated graphite.
(ii) Especially designed or prepared systems at the product end of the cascade for taking the U
+4
out of the organic stream, adjusting the acid concentration, and feeding to the electrochemical reduction cells.
These systems consist of solvent extraction equipment for stripping the U
+4
from the organic stream into an aqueous solution, evaporation and/or other equipment to accomplish solution pH adjustment and control, and pumps or other transfer devices for feeding to the electrochemical reduction cells. A major design concern is to avoid contamination of the aqueous stream with certain metal ions. For those parts in contact with the process stream, the system is constructed of equipment made of, or protected
by, materials such as glass, fluorocarbon polymers, polyphenyl sulfate, polyether sulfone, and resin-impregnated graphite.
(4) Feed preparation systems.
Especially designed or prepared systems for producing high-purity uranium chloride feed solutions for chemical exchange uranium isotope separation plants.
These systems consist of dissolution, solvent extraction and/or ion exchange equipment for purification and electrolytic cells for reducing the uranium U
+6
or U
+4
to U
+3
. These systems produce uranium chloride solutions having only a few parts per million of metallic impurities such as chromium, iron, vanadium, molybdenum, and other bivalent or higher multi-valent cations. Materials of construction for portions of the system processing high-purity U
+3
include glass, fluorinated hydrocarbon polymers, polyphenyl sulfate or polyether sulfone plastic-lined and resin-impregnated graphite.
(5) Uranium oxidation systems.
Especially designed or prepared systems for oxidation of U
+3
to U
+4
for return to the uranium isotope separation cascade in the chemical exchange enrichment process.
These systems may incorporate equipment such as:
(i) Equipment for contacting chlorine and oxygen with the aqueous effluent from the isotope separation equipment and extracting the resultant U
+4
into the stripped organic stream returning from the product end of the cascade; and
(ii) Equipment that separates water from hydrochloric acid so that the water and the concentrated hydrochloric acid may be reintroduced to the process at the proper locations.
B. In the solid-liquid ion-exchange process, enrichment is accomplished by uranium adsorption/desorption on a special, fast-acting, ion-exchange resin or adsorbent. A solution of uranium in hydrochloric acid and other chemical agents is passed through cylindrical enrichment columns containing packed beds of the adsorbent. For a continuous process, a reflux system is necessary to release the uranium from the adsorbent back in the liquid flow so that “product” and “tails” can be collected. This is accomplished with the use of suitable reduction/oxidation chemical agents that are fully regenerated in separate external circuits and that may be partially regenerated within the isotopic separation columns themselves. The presence of hot concentrated hydrochloric acid solutions in the process requires that the equipment be made of, or protected by, special corrosion-resistant materials.
(1) Fast reacting ion exchange resins/adsorbents.
Especially designed or prepared for uranium enrichment using the ion exchange process, including porous macroreticular resins, and/or pellicular structures in which the active chemical exchange groups are limited to a coating on the surface of an inactive porous support structure, and other composite structures in any suitable form including particles or fibers. These ion exchange resins/adsorbents have diameters of 0.2 mm or less and must be chemically resistant to concentrated hydrochloric acid solutions as well as physically strong enough so as not to degrade in the exchange columns. The resins/adsorbents are especially designed to achieve very fast uranium isotope exchange kinetics (exchange rate half-time of less than 10 seconds) and are capable of operating at a temperature in the range of 373 K (100 °C) to 473 K (200 °C).
(2) Ion exchange columns.
Cylindrical columns greater than 1000 mm in diameter for containing and supporting packed beds of ion exchange resin/adsorbent, especially designed or prepared for uranium enrichment using the ion exchange process. These columns are made of, or protected by, materials (such as titanium or fluorocarbon plastics) resistant to corrosion by concentrated hydrochloric acid solutions and are capable of operating at a temperature in the range of 373 K (100 °C) to 473 K (200 °C) and pressures above 0.7 MPa.
(3) Ion exchange reflux systems.
(i) Especially designed or prepared chemical or electrochemical reduction systems for regeneration of the chemical reducing agent(s) used in ion exchange uranium enrichment cascades.
The ion exchange enrichment process may use, for example, trivalent titanium (Ti
+3
) as a reducing cation in which case the reduction system would regenerate Ti
+3
by reducing Ti
+4
.
(ii) Especially designed or prepared chemical or electrochemical oxidation systems for regeneration of the chemical oxidizing agent(s) used in ion exchange uranium enrichment cascades.
The ion exchange enrichment process may use, for example, trivalent iron (Fe
+3
) as an oxidant in which case the oxidation system would regenerate Fe
+3
by oxidizing Fe
+2
.
C. Any other components especially designed or prepared for use in a chemical exchange or ion exchange enrichment plant or in any of the components described in this appendix.

# Appendix G to Part 110—Illustrative List of Plasma Separation Enrichment Plant Equipment and Components Under NRC Export Licensing Authority

# Note:
In the plasma separation process, a plasma of uranium ions passes through an electric field tuned to the
235
U ion resonance frequency so that they preferentially absorb energy and increase the diameter of their corkscrew-like orbits. Ions with a large-diameter path are trapped to produce a product enriched in
235
U. The plasma, made by ionizing uranium vapor, is contained in a vacuum chamber with a high-strength magnetic field produced by a superconducting magnet.

# Appendix H to Part 110—Illustrative List of Electromagnetic Enrichment Plant Equipment and Components Under NRC Export Licensing Authority

# Note:
In the electromagnetic process, uranium metal ions produced by ionization of a salt feed material (typically UCL4) are accelerated and passed through a magnetic field that has the effect of causing the ions of different isotopes to follow different paths.

# Appendix I to Part 110—Illustrative List of Reprocessing Plant Components Under NRC Export Licensing Authority

# Note:
Reprocessing irradiated nuclear fuel separates plutonium and uranium from intensely radioactive fission products and other transuranic elements. Different technical processes can accomplish this separation. However, over the years Purex has become the most commonly used and accepted process. Purex involves the dissolution of irradiated nuclear fuel in nitric acid, followed
by separation of the uranium, plutonium, and fission products by solvent extraction using a mixture of tributyl phosphate in an organic diluent.
Purex facilities have process functions similar to each other, including: Irradiated fuel element chopping, fuel dissolution, solvent extraction, and process liquor storage. There may also be equipment for thermal denitration of uranium nitrate, conversion of plutonium nitrate to oxide metal, and treatment of fission product waste liquor to a form suitable for long term storage or disposal. However, the specific type and configuration of the equipment performing these functions may differ between Purex facilities for several reasons, including the type and quantity of irradiated nuclear fuel to be reprocessed and the intended disposition of the recovered materials, and the safety and maintenance philosophy incorporated into the design of the facility. A plant for the reprocessing of irradiated fuel elements includes the equipment and components which normally come in direct contact with and directly control the irradiated fuel and the major nuclear material and fission product processing streams.
(1) Irradiated fuel element decladding equipment and chopping machines.
Remotely operated equipment especially designed or prepared for use in a reprocessing plant and intended to expose or prepare the irradiated nuclear fuel assemblies, bundles, or rods for processing. This equipment cuts, chops, shears, or otherwise breaches the cladding of the fuel to expose the irradiated nuclear material for processing or prepares the fuel for processing. Especially designed cutting shears are most commonly employed, although advanced equipment, such as lasers, peeling machines, or other techniques, may be used. Decladding involves removing the cladding of the irradiated nuclear fuel prior to its dissolution.
(2) Dissolvers.
Dissolver vessels or dissolvers employing mechanical devices especially designed or prepared for use in a reprocessing plant, intended for dissolution of irradiated nuclear fuel and which are capable of withstanding hot, highly corrosive liquid, and which can be remotely loaded, operated and maintained.
Dissolvers normally receive the solid, irradiated nuclear fuel. Nuclear fuels with cladding made of material including zirconium, stainless steel, or alloys of such materials must be decladded and/or sheared or chopped prior to being charged to the dissolver to allow the acid to reach the fuel matrix. The irradiated nuclear fuel is typically dissolved in strong mineral acids, such as nitric acid, and any undissolved cladding removed. While certain design features, such as small diameter, annular, or slab tanks may be used to ensure criticality safety, they are not a necessity. Administrative controls, such as small batch size or low fissile material content, may be used instead. Dissolver vessels and dissolvers employing mechanical devices are normally fabricated of material such as low carbon stainless steel, titanium or zirconium, or other high-quality materials. Dissolvers may include systems for the removal of cladding or cladding waste and systems for the control and treatment of radioactive off-gases. These dissolvers may have features for remote placement since they are normally loaded, operated, and maintained behind thick shielding.
(3) Solvent extractors and solvent extraction equipment.
Especially designed or prepared solvent extractors such as packed or pulse columns, mixer settlers, or centrifugal contactors for use in a plant for the reprocessing of irradiated fuel. Solvent extractors must be resistant to the corrosive effect of nitric acid. Solvent extractors are normally fabricated to extremely high standards (including special welding and inspection and quality assurance and quality control techniques) out of low carbon stainless steels, titanium, zirconium, or other high quality materials.
Solvent extractors both receive the solution of irradiated fuel from the dissolvers and the organic solution which separates the uranium, plutonium, and fission products. Solvent extraction equipment is normally designed to meet strict operating parameters, such as long operating lifetimes with no maintenance requirements or adaptability to easy replacement, simplicity of operation and control, and flexibility for variations in process conditions.
(4) Chemical holding or storage vessels.
Especially designed or prepared holding or storage vessels for use in a plant for the reprocessing of irradiated fuel. The holding or storage vessels must be resistant to the corrosive effect of nitric acid. The holding or storage vessels are normally fabricated of materials such as low carbon stainless steels, titanium or zirconium, or other high quality materials. Holding or storage vessels may be designed for remote operation and maintenance and may have the following features for control of nuclear criticality:
(i) Walls or internal structures with a boron equivalent of at least 2 percent, or
(ii) A maximum diameter of 175 mm (7 in) for cylindrical vessels, or
(iii) A maximum width of 75 mm (3 in) for either a slab or annular vessel.
(5) Neutron measurement systems for process control.
Neutron measurement systems especially designed or prepared for integration and use with automated process control systems in a plant for the reprocessing of irradiated fuel
elements. These systems involve the capability of active and passive neutron measurement and discrimination in order to determine the fissile material quantity and composition. The complete system is composed of a neutron generator, a neutron detector, amplifiers, and signal processing electronics.
The scope of this entry does not include neutron detection and measurement instruments that are designed for nuclear material accountancy and safeguarding or any other application not related to integration and use with automated process control systems in a plant for the reprocessing of irradiated fuel elements.
(6) Plutonium nitrate to plutonium oxide conversion systems. Complete systems especially designed or prepared for the conversion of plutonium nitrate to plutonium oxide, in particular adapted so as to avoid criticality and radiation effects and to minimize toxicity hazards.
(7) Plutonium metal production systems. Complete systems especially designed or prepared for the production of plutonium metal, in particular adapted so as to avoid criticality and radiation effects and to minimize toxicity hazards.
(8) Process control instrumentation specially designed or prepared for monitoring or controlling the processing of material in a reprocessing plant.

# Appendix J to Part 110—Illustrative List of Uranium Conversion Plant Equipment and Plutonium Conversion Plant Equipment Under NRC Export Licensing Authority

# Note:
Uranium conversion plants and systems may perform one or more transformations from one uranium chemical species to another, including: conversion of uranium ore concentrates to UO3, conversion of UO3 to UO2, conversion of uranium oxides to UF4 or UF6, conversion of UF4 to UF6, conversion of UF6 to UF4, conversion of UF4 to uranium metal, and conversion of uranium fluorides to UO2. Many key equipment items for uranium conversion plants are common to several segments of the chemical process industry, including furnaces, rotary kilns, fluidized bed reactors, flame tower reactors, liquid centrifuges, distillation columns and liquid-liquid extraction columns. However, few of the items are available “off-the-shelf”; most would be prepared according to customer requirements and specifications. Some require special design and construction considerations to address the corrosive properties of the chemicals handled (HF, F2, CLF3, and uranium fluorides). In all of the uranium conversion processes, equipment which individually is not especially designed or prepared for uranium conversion can be assembled into systems which are especially designed or prepared for uranium conversion.
(a) Uranium Conversion Plant Equipment.
(1) Especially designed or prepared systems for the conversion of uranium ore concentrates to UO3.
Conversion of uranium ore concentrates to UO3 can be performed by first dissolving the ore in nitric acid and extracting purified uranyl nitrate using a solvent such as tributyl phosphate. Next, the uranyl nitrate is converted to UO3 either by concentration and denitration or by neutralization with gaseous ammonia to produce ammonium diuranate with subsequent filtering, drying, and calcining.
(2) Especially designed or prepared systems for the conversion of UO3 to UF6.
Conversion of UO3 to UF6 can be performed directly by fluorination. The process requires a source of fluorine gas or chlorine trifluoride.
(3) Especially Designed or Prepared Systems for the conversion of UO3 to UO2.
Conversion of UO3 to UO2 can be performed through reduction of UO3 with cracked ammonia gas or hydrogen.
(4) Especially Designed or Prepared Systems for the conversion of UO2 to UF4.
Conversion of UO2 to UF4 can be performed by reacting UO2 with hydrogen fluoride gas (HF) at 300-500 °C.
(5) Especially Designed or Prepared Systems for the conversion of UF4 to UF6.
Conversion of UF4 to UF6 is performed by exothermic reaction with fluorine in a tower reactor. UF6 is condensed from the hot effluent gases by passing the effluent stream through a cold trap cooled to −10 °C. The process requires a source of fluorine gas.
(6) Especially Designed or Prepared Systems for the conversion of UF4 to U metal.
Conversion of UF4 to U metal is performed by reduction with magnesium (large batches) or calcium (small batches). The reaction is carried out at temperatures above the melting point of uranium (1130 °C).
(7) Especially designed or prepared systems for the conversion of UF6 to UO2.
Conversion of UF6 to UO2 can be performed by one of three processes. In the first, UF6 is reduced and hydrolyzed to UO2 using hydrogen and steam. In the second, UF6 is hydrolyzed by solution in water, ammonia is added to precipitate ammonium diuranate, and the diuranate is reduced to UO2 with hydrogen at 820 °C. In the third process, gaseous UF6, CO2, and NH3 are combined in water, precipitating ammonium uranyl carbonate. The ammonium uranyl carbonate is combined with steam and hydrogen at 500-
600 °C to yield UO2. UF6 to UO2 conversion is often performed as the first stage of a fuel fabrication plant.
(8) Especially Designed or Prepared Systems for the conversion of UF6 to UF4. Conversion of UF6 to UF4 is performed by reduction with hydrogen.
(9) Especially designed or prepared systems for the conversion of UO

to UCl
4
as feed for electromagnetic enrichment.

# Note:
Plutonium conversion plants and systems may perform one or more transformations from one plutonium chemical species to another, including: conversion of plutonium nitrate to PuO
2
, conversion of PuO
2
to PuF
4
and conversion of PuF
4
to plutonium metal. Plutonium conversion plants are usually associated with reprocessing facilities, but may also be associated with plutonium fuel fabrication facilities. Many of the key equipment items for plutonium conversion plants are common to several segments of the chemical process industry. For example, the types of equipment employed in these processes may include the following items: furnaces, rotary kilns, fluidized bed reactors, flame tower reactors, liquid centrifuges, distillation columns and liquid-liquid extraction columns. Hot cells, glove boxes and remote manipulators may also be required. However, few of the items are available off-the-shelf; most would be prepared according to the requirements and specifications of the customer. Particular care is essential in designing for the special radiological, toxicity and criticality hazards associated with plutonium. In some circumstances, special design and construction considerations are required to address the corrosive properties of some of the chemicals handled (e.g., HF). Finally, it should be noted that, for all plutonium conversion processes, items of equipment which individually are not especially designed or prepared for plutonium conversion can be assembled into systems that are especially designed or prepared for use in plutonium conversion.
(b) Plutonium Conversion Plant Equipment
(1) Especially designed or prepared systems for the conversion of plutonium nitrate to oxide.
The main functions involved in this process are: process feed storage and adjustment, precipitation and solid/liquor separation, calcination, product handling, ventilation, waste management, and process control. The process systems are particularly adapted so as to avoid criticality and radiation effects and to minimize toxicity hazards. In most reprocessing facilities, this process involves the conversion of plutonium nitrate to plutonium dioxide. Other processes can involve the precipitation of plutonium oxalate or plutonium peroxide.
(2) Especially designed or prepared systems for plutonium metal production.
This process usually involves the fluorination of plutonium dioxide, normally with highly corrosive hydrogen fluoride, to produce plutonium fluoride, which is subsequently reduced using high purity calcium metal to produce metallic plutonium and a calcium fluoride slag. The main functions involved in this process are the following: fluorination (e.g., involving equipment fabricated or lined with a precious metal), metal reduction (e.g., employing ceramic crucibles), slag recovery, product handling, ventilation, waste management and process control. The process systems are particularly adapted so as to avoid criticality and radiation effects and to minimize toxicity hazards. Other processes include the fluorination of plutonium oxalate or plutonium peroxide followed by reduction to metal.
(c) Any other components especially designed or prepared for use in a uranium conversion plant or plutonium conversion plant or in any of the components described in this appendix.

# Appendix K to Part 110—Illustrative List of Equipment and Components Under NRC Export Licensing Authority for Use in a Plant for the Production of Heavy Water, Deuterium and Deuterium Compounds

# Note:
Heavy water can be produced by a variety of processes. However, two processes have proven to be commercially viable: The water-hydrogen sulphide exchange process (GS process) and the ammonia-hydrogen exchange process.
A. The GS process is based upon the exchange of hydrogen and deuterium between water and hydrogen sulphide within a series of towers which are operated with the top section cold and the bottom section hot. Water flows down the towers while the hydrogen sulphide gas circulates from the bottom to the top of the towers. A series of perforated trays are used to promote mixing between the gas and the water. Deuterium migrates to the water at low temperatures and to the hydrogen sulphide at high temperatures. Gas or water, enriched in deuterium, is removed from the first stage towers at the junction of the hot and cold sections and the process is repeated in subsequent stage towers. The product of the last stage, water enriched up to 30 percent in deuterium, is sent to a distillation unit to produce reactor
grade heavy water;
i.e.
, 99.75 percent deuterium oxide.
B. The ammonia-hydrogen exchange process can extract deuterium from synthesis gas through contact with liquid ammonia in the presence of a catalyst. The synthesis gas is fed into exchange towers and then to an ammonia converter. Inside the towers the gas flows from the bottom to the top while the liquid ammonia flows from the top to the bottom. The deuterium is stripped from the hydrogen in the synthesis gas and concentrated in the ammonia. The ammonia then flows into an ammonia cracker at the bottom of the tower while the gas flows into an ammonia converter at the top. Further enrichment takes place in subsequent stages and reactor-grade heavy water is produced through final distillation. The synthesis gas feed can be provided by an ammonia plant that can be constructed in association with a heavy water ammonia-hydrogen exchange plant. The ammonia-hydrogen exchange process can also use ordinary water as a feed source of deuterium.
C.1. Much of the key equipment for heavy water production plants using either the GS process or the ammonia-hydrogen exchange process are common to several segments of the chemical and petroleum industries; particularly in small plants using the GS process. However, few items are available “off-the-shelf.” Both processes require the handling of large quantities of flammable, corrosive, and toxic fluids at elevated pressures. Therefore, in establishing the design and operating standards for plants and equipment using these processes, careful attention to materials selection and specifications is required to ensure long service life with high safety and reliability factors. The choice is primarily a function of economics and need. Most equipment, therefore, is prepared to customer requirements.
In both processes, equipment which individually is not especially designed or prepared for heavy water production can be assembled into especially designed or prepared systems for producing heavy water. Examples of such systems are the catalyst production system used in the ammonia-hydrogen exchange process and the water distillation systems used for the final concentration of heavy water to reactor-grade in either process.
C.2. Equipment especially designed or prepared for the production of heavy water utilizing either the water-hydrogen sulphide exchange process or the ammonia-hydrogen exchange process:
(i) Water-hydrogen Sulphide Exchange Towers.
Exchange towers with diameters of 1.5 m or greater and capable of operating at pressures greater than or equal to 2 MPa (300 psi) especially designed or prepared for heavy water production utilizing the water-hydrogen sulphide exchange process.
(ii) Blowers and Compressors.
Single stage, low head (
i.e.
, 0.2 MPa or 30 psi) centrifugal blowers or compressors for hydrogen-sulphide gas circulation (
i.e.
, gas containing more than 70 percent H2S). The blowers or compressors have a throughput capacity greater than or equal to 56 m
3
/second (120,000 standard cubic feet per minute) while operating at pressures greater than or equal to 1.8 MPa (260 psi) suction and have seals designed for wet H2S service.
(iii) Ammonia-Hydrogen Exchange Towers.
Ammonia-hydrogen exchange towers greater than or equal to 35 m (114.3 ft) in height with diameters of 1.5 m (4.9 ft) to 2.5 m (8.2 ft) capable of operating at pressures greater than 15 MPa (2225 psi). The towers have at least one flanged, axial opening of the same diameter as the cylindrical part through which the tower internals can be inserted or withdrawn.
(iv) Tower Internals and Stage Pumps Used in the Ammonia-hydrogen Exchange Process.
Tower internals include especially designed stage contactors which promote intimate gas/liquid contact. Stage pumps include especially designed submersible pumps for circulation of liquid ammonia within a contacting stage internal to the stage towers.
(v) Ammonia Crackers Utilizing the Ammonia-hydrogen Exchange Process.
Ammonia crackers with operating pressures greater than or equal to 3 MPa (450 psi) especially designed or prepared for heavy water production utilizing the ammonia-hydrogen exchange process.
(vi) Ammonia Synthesis Converters or Synthesis Units.
Ammonia synthesis converters or synthesis units especially designed or prepared for heavy water production utilizing the ammonia-hydrogen exchange process.
These converters or units take synthesis gas (nitrogen and hydrogen) from an ammonia/hydrogen high-pressure exchange column (or columns), and the synthesized ammonia is returned to the exchange column (or columns).
(vii) Infrared Absorption Analyzers.
Infrared absorption analyzers capable of “on-line” hydrogen/deuterium ratio analysis where deuterium concentrations are equal to or greater than 90 percent.
(viii) Catalytic Burners Used in the Ammonia-hydrogen Exchange Process.
Catalytic burners for the conversion of enriched deuterium gas into heavy water especially designed or prepared for heavy water production utilizing the ammonia-hydrogen exchange process.
(ix) Complete Heavy Water Upgrade Systems or Columns.
Complete heavy water upgrade systems or columns especially designed or prepared for
the upgrade of heavy water to reactor-grade deuterium concentration. These systems, which usually employ water distillation to separate heavy water from light water, are especially designed or prepared to produce reactor-grade heavy water (
i.e.
, typically 99.75 percent deuterium oxide) from heavy water feedstock of lesser concentration.
D. Any other components especially designed or prepared for use in a plant for the production of heavy water, deuterium, and deuterium compounds or in any of the components described in this appendix.

# Appendix O to Part 110—Illustrative List of Fuel Element Fabrication Plant Equipment and Components Under NRC's Export Licensing Authority

# Note:
Nuclear fuel elements are manufactured from source or special nuclear material. For oxide fuels, the most common type of fuel equipment for pressing pellets, sintering, grinding and grading will be present. Mixed oxide fuels are handled in glove boxes (or equivalent containment) until they are sealed in the cladding. In all cases, the fuel is hermetically sealed inside a suitable cladding which is designed to be the primary envelope encasing the fuel so as to provide suitable performance and safety during reactor operation. Also, in all cases, precise control of processes, procedures and equipment to extremely high standards is necessary in order to ensure predictable and safe fuel performance.
(a) Items that are considered especially designed or prepared for the fabrication of fuel elements include equipment that:
(1) Normally comes in direct contact with, or directly processes or controls, the production flow of nuclear material;
(2) Seals the nuclear material within the cladding;
(3) Checks the integrity of the cladding or the seal;
(4) Checks the finished treatment of the sealed fuel; or
(5) Is used for assembling reactor fuel elements.
(b) This equipment or systems of equipment may include, for example:
(1) Fully automatic pellet inspection stations especially designed or prepared for checking final dimensions and surface defects of fuel pellets;
(2) Automatic welding machines especially designed or prepared for welding end caps onto the fuel pins (or rods);
(3) Automatic test and inspection stations especially designed or prepared for checking the integrity of completed fuel pins (or rods). This item typically includes equipment for:

# Calculation of Shipments Containing Multiple Sources or Radionuclides
The “sum of fractions” methodology for evaluating combinations of radionuclides being transported, is to be used when import or export shipments contain multiple sources or multiple radionuclides. The threshold limit values used in a sum of the fractions calculation must be the metric values (
i.e.
, TBq).
I. If multiple sources and/or multiple radionuclides are present in an import or export shipment, the sum of the fractions of the activity of each radionuclides must be determined to verify the shipment is less than the Category 1 or 2 limits of Table 1, as appropriate. If the calculated sum of the fractions ratio, using the following equation, is greater than or equal to 1.0, then the import or export shipment exceeds the threshold limits of Table 1 and the applicable security provisions of this part apply.
II.

§ 140.7
Fees.
(a)(1) Each reactor licensee shall pay a fee to the Commission based on the following schedule:
(i) For indemnification from $500 million to $400 million inclusive, a fee of $30 per year per thousand kilowatts of thermal capacity authorized in the license;
(ii) For indemnification from $399 million to $300 million inclusive, a fee of $24 per year per thousand kilowatts of thermal capacity authorized in the license;
(iii) For indemnification from $299 million to $200 million inclusive, a fee of $18 per year per thousand kilowatts of thermal capacity authorized in the license;
(iv) For indemnification from $199 million to $100 million inclusive, a fee of $12 per year per thousand kilowatts of thermal capacity authorized in the license; and
(v) For indemnification from $99 million to $1 million inclusive, a fee of $6 per year per thousand kilowatts of thermal capacity authorized in the license.
(2) No fee will be less than $100 per annum for any nuclear reactor. This fee is for the period beginning with the date on which the applicable indemnity agreement is effective. The various levels of indemnity fees are set forth in the schedule in this paragraph. The amount of indemnification for determining indemnity fees will be computed by subtracting from the statutory limit of liability the amount of financial protection required of the licensee. In the case of licensees subject to the provision of § 140.11(a)(4), this total amount will be the amount, as determined by the Commission, of the financial protection available to licensees at the close of the calendar year preceding the one in which the fee becomes due. For those instances in which a certified financial statement is provided as a guarantee of payment of deferred premiums in accordance with § 140.21(e), a fee of $1,000 or the indemnity fee, whichever is greater, is required.
(b) Where a licensee manufactures a number of nuclear reactors each having a power level not exceeding 3
1/3
megawatts, for sale to others and operates them at the licensee's location temporarily prior to delivery, the licensee shall report to the Commission the maximum number of such reactors to be operated at that location at any one time. In such cases, the fee shall equal $100 multiplied by the number of reactors reported by the licensee. In the event the number of reactors operated at any one time exceed the estimate so reported, the licensee shall report the additional number of reactors to the Commission and additional charges will be made. If experience shows that less than the estimated number of reactors have been operated, appropriate adjustment in subsequent bills will be made by the Commission.
(c) Each person licensed to possess and use plutonium in a plutonium processing and fuel fabrication plant shall pay to the Commission a fee of $5,000 per year for indemnification. This fee is for the period beginning with the date on which the applicable indemnity agreement is effective.
(d) Indemnity fee payments are to made payable to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The payments are to be made in U.S. funds using the electronic payment methods accepted at
www.Pay.gov.
Federal agencies may also make payments by Intra-Governmental Payment and Collection (IPAC). Specific instructions for making payments may be obtained by contacting the Office of the Chief Financial Officer at 301-415-7554.

# Effective Date Note:
At 89 FR 106253, Dec. 30, 2024, in § 140.11, paragraph (a)(3) was amended by removing the phrase “testing reactor” and adding in its place the phrase “testing facility”, effective Jan. 29, 2025.
§ 140.12
Amount of financial protection required for other reactors.
(a) Each licensee is required to have and maintain financial protection for each nuclear reactor for which the
amount of financial protection is not determined in § 140.11, in an amount determined pursuant to the formula and other provisions of this section:
Provided,
That in no event shall the amount of financial protection required for any nuclear reactor under this section be less than $4,500,000 or more than $74,000,000.
(b)(1) The formula is:
x = B times P
(2) In the formula:
x = Amount of financial protection in dollars.
B = Base amount of financial protection.
P = Population factor.
(3) The base amount of financial protection is equal to $185 times the maximum power level, expressed in thermal kilowatts, as authorized by the applicable license.
(4) The population factor (P) shall be determined as follows:
(i)
Step 1.
The area to be considered includes all minor civil divisions (as shown in the 1950 Census of Population, Bureau of the Census, or later data available from the Bureau) which are wholly or partly within a circle with the facility at its center and having a radius in miles equal to the square root of the maximum authorized power level in thermal megawatts.
(ii)
Step 2.
Identify all minor civil divisions according to the same census which are in whole or in part within the circle determined in Step 1. Determine the population of each such minor civil division (according to the same census or later data available from the Bureau of the Census). For each minor civil division, divide its population by the square of the estimated distance to the nearest mile from the reactor to the geographic center of the minor civil division:
Provided,
That no such distance shall be deemed to be less than one mile. If the sum of the quotients thus obtained for all minor civil divisions wholly or partly within the circle is 1,000 or less, the population factor is 1. If the sum of these quotients is more than 1,000 but not more than 3,000, the population factor is 1.2. If the sum of these quotients is more than 3,000 but not more than 5,000, the population factor is 1.4. If the sum of these quotients is more than 5,000 but not more than 7,000, the population factor is 1.6. If the sum of these quotients is more than 7,000 but not more than 9,000, the population factor is 1.8. If the sum of these quotients is more than 9,000 the population factor is 2.0.
(c) In any case where a person is authorized under parts 50, 52, or 54 of this chapter to operate two or more nuclear reactors at the same location, the total financial protection required of the licensee for all such reactors is the highest amount which would otherwise be required for any one of those reactors; provided, that such financial protection covers all reactors at the location.
(d) Except in cases where the amount of financial protection calculated under this section is a multiple of $100,000, amounts determined pursuant to this section shall be adjusted to the next highest multiple of $100,000.

§ 140.13
Amount of financial protection required of certain holders of construction permits and combined licenses under 10 CFR part 52.
Each holder of a part 50 construction permit, or a holder of a combined license under part 52 of this chapter before the date that the Commission had made the finding under 10 CFR 52.103(g), who also holds a license under part 70 of this chapter authorizing ownership, possession and storage only of special nuclear material at the site of the nuclear reactor for use as fuel in operation of the nuclear reactor after issuance of either an operating license under 10 CFR part 50 or combined license under 10 CFR part 52, shall, during the period before issuance of a license authorizing operation under 10 CFR part 50, or the period before the Commission makes the finding under § 52.103(g) of this chapter, as applicable, have and maintain financial protection in the amount of $1,000,000. Proof of financial protection shall be filed with the Commission in the manner specified in § 140.15 of this chapter before issuance of the license under part 70 of this chapter.

(b) If the licensee fails to pay assessed deferred premiums, the Commission reserves the right to pay those premiums on behalf of the licensee and to recover the amount of such premiums from the licensee.
(c) The Commission shall require the immediate submission of financial statements by those licensees who indicate, after an assessment of the retrospective premium by the insurance pools, that they will not pay the assessment. Such financial statements shall include, as a minimum, exhibits indicating internally generated funds from operations and accumulated retained earnings. Subsequent submission of financial statements by such licensees may be requested by the Commission, as required.
(d) If premiums are paid by the Commission as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, payment by the Commission shall create a lien in the amount paid in favor of the United States upon all property and rights to property, whether real or personal, belonging to such licensee. The lien shall arise at the time payment is made by the Commission and shall continue until the liability for the amount (or a judgment against the licensee arising out of such liability) is satisfied or becomes unenforceable. The Commission will issue a certificate of release of any such lien if it finds that the liability for the amount has been fully satisfied or has become legally unenforceable.
(e) If the Commission determines that the licensee is financially able to reimburse the Commission for a deferred premium payment made in its behalf, and the licensee, after notice of such determination by the Commission fails to make such reimbursement within 120 days, the Commission will take appropriate steps to suspend the license for 30 days. The Commission may take such further action as is necessary if reimbursement is not made within the 30-day suspension period including but not limited to termination of the operating license.

[27 FR 2885, Mar. 29, 1962, as amended at 33 FR 15999, Oct. 31, 1968]

# Subpart E—Extraordinary Nuclear Occurrences
§ 140.81
Scope and purpose.
(a)
Scope.
This subpart applies to applicants for and holders of licenses authorizing operation of production facilities and utilization facilities, including combined licenses under part 52 of this chapter, and to other persons indemnified with respect to such facilities.
(b)
Purpose.
One purpose of this subpart is to set forth the criteria which the Commission proposes to follow in order to determine whether there has been an “extraordinary nuclear occurrence.” The other purpose is to establish the conditions of the waivers of defenses proposed for incorporation in indemnity agreements and insurance policies or contracts furnished as proof of financial protection.
(1) The system is to come into effect only where the discharge or dispersal constitutes a substantial amount of
source, special nuclear or byproduct material, or has caused substantial radiation levels offsite. The various limits in present NRC regulations are not appropriate for direct application in the determination of an “extraordinary nuclear occurrence,” for they were arrived at with other purposes in mind, and those limits have been set at a level which is conservatively arrived at by incorporating a significant safety factor. Thus, a discharge or dispersal which exceeds the limits in NRC regulations, or in license conditions, although possible cause for concern, is not one which would be expected to cause substantial injury or damage unless it exceeds by some significant multiple the appropriate regulatory limit. Accordingly, in arriving at the values in the criteria to be deemed “substantial” it is more appropriate to adopt values separate from NRC health and safety regulations, and, of course, the selection of these values will not in any way affect such regulations. A substantial discharge, for purposes of the criteria, represents a perturbation of the environment which is clearly above that which could be anticipated from the conduct of normal activities. The criteria are intended solely for the purposes of administration of the Commission's statutory responsibilities under Pub. L. 89-645, and are not intended to indicate a level of discharge or dispersal at which damage to persons or property necessarily will occur, or a level at which damage is likely to occur, or even a level at which some type of protective action is indicated. It should be clearly understood that the criteria in no way establish or indicate that there is a specific threshold of exposure at which biological damage from radiation will take place. It cannot be emphasized too frequently that the levels set to be used as criteria for the first part of the determination, that is, the criteria for amounts offsite or radiation levels offsite which are substantial, are not meant to indicate that, because such amounts or levels are determined to be substantial for purposes of administration, they are “substantial” in terms of their propensity for causing injury or damage.
(2) It is the purpose of the second part of the determination that the Commission decide whether there have in fact been or will probably be substantial damages to persons offsite or property offsite. The criteria for substantial damages were formulated, and the numerical values selected, on a wholly different basis from that on which the criteria used for the first part of the determination with respect to substantial discharge were derived. The only interrelation between the values selected for the discharge criteria and the damage criteria is that the discharge values are set so low that it is extremely unlikely the damage criteria could be satisfied unless the discharge values have been exceeded.
(3) The first part of the test is designed so that the Commission can assure itself that something exceptional has occurred; that something untoward and unexpected has in fact taken place and that this event is of sufficient significance to raise the possibility that some damage to persons or property offsite has resulted or may result. If there appears to be no damage, the waivers will not apply because the Commission will be unable, under the second part of the test, to make a determination that “substantial damages” have resulted or will probably result. If damages have resulted or will probably result, they could vary from de minimis to serious, and the waivers will not apply until the damages, both actual and probable, are determined to be “substantial” within the second part of the test.
(4) The presence or absence of an extraordinary nuclear occurrence determination does not concomitantly determine whether or not a particular claimant will recover on his claim. In effect, it is intended primarily to determine whether certain potential obstacles to recovery are to be removed from the route the claimant would ordinarily follow to seek compensation for his injury or damage. If there has not been an extraordinary nuclear occurrence determination, the claimant must proceed (in the absence of settlement) with a tort action subject to whatever issues must be met, and whatever defenses are available to the defendant, under the law applicable in the relevant jurisdiction. If there has
been an extraordinary nuclear occurrence determination, the claimant must still proceed (in the absence of settlement) with a tort action, but the claimant's burden is substantially eased by the elimination of certain issues which may be involved and certain defenses which may be available to the defendant. In either case the defendant may defend with respect to such of the following matters as are in issue in any given claim: The nature of the claimant's alleged damages, the causal relationship between the event and the alleged damages, and the amount of the alleged damages.
[33 FR 15999, Oct. 31, 1968, as amended at 40 FR 8793, Mar. 3, 1975; 72 FR 49565, Aug. 28, 2007]
§ 140.82
Procedures.
(a) The Commission may initiate, on its own motion, the making of a determination as to whether or not there has been an extraordinary nuclear occurrence. In the event the Commission does not so initiate the making of a determination, any affected person, or any licensee or person with whom an indemnity agreement is executed or a person providing financial protection may petition the Commission for a determination of whether or not there has been an extraordinary nuclear occurrence. If the Commission does not have, or does not expect to have, within 7 days after it has received notification of an alleged event, enough information available to make a determination that there has been an extraordinary nuclear occurrence, the Commission will publish a notice in the
Federal Register
setting forth the date and place of the alleged event and requesting any persons having knowledge thereof to submit their information to the Commission.
(b) When a procedure is initiated under paragraph (a) of this section, the Commission will designate members of the principal staff to begin immediately to assemble the relevant information and prepare a report on which the Commission can make its determination.
[33 FR 15999, Oct. 31, 1968, as amended at 40 FR 8794, Mar. 3, 1975]
§ 140.83
Determination of extraordinary nuclear occurrence.
If the Commission determines that both of the criteria set forth in §§ 140.84 and 140.85 have been met, it will make the determination that there has been an extraordinary nuclear occurrence. If the Commission publishes a notice in the
Federal Register
in accordance with § 140.82(a) and does not make a determination within 90 days thereafter that there has been an extraordinary nuclear occurrence, the alleged event will be deemed not to be an extraordinary nuclear occurrence. The time for the making of a determination may be extended by the Commission by notice published in the
Federal Register.
[33 FR 15999, Oct. 31, 1968]
§ 140.84
Criterion I—Substantial discharge of radioactive material or substantial radiation levels offsite.
The Commission will determine that there has been a substantial discharge or dispersal of radioactive material offsite, or that there have been substantial levels of radiation offsite, when, as a result of an event comprised of one or more related happenings, radioactive material is released from its intended place of confinement or radiation levels occur offsite and either of the following findings are also made:
(a) The Commission finds that one or more persons offsite were, could have been, or might be exposed to radiation or to radioactive material, resulting in a dose or in a projected dose in excess of one of the levels in the following table:

(1) Radiation from sources external to the body;
(2) Radioactive material that may be taken into the body from its occurrence in air or water; and
(3) Radioactive material that may be taken into the body from its occurrence in food or on terrestrial surfaces.
(b) The Commission finds that:
(1) Surface contamination of at least a total of any 100 square meters of offsite property has occurred as the result of a release of radioactive material from a production or utilization facility and such contamination is characterized by levels of radiation in excess of one of the values listed in Column 1 or Column 2 of the following table, or
(2) Surface contamination of any offsite property has occurred as the result of a release of radioactive material in the course of transportation and such contamination is characterized by levels of radiation in excess of one of the values listed in column 2 of the following table:

§ 140.85
Criterion II—Substantial damages to persons offsite or property offsite.
(a) After the Commission has determined that an event has satisfied Criterion I, the Commission will determine that the event has resulted or will probably result in substantial damages to persons offsite or property offsite if any of the following findings are made:
(1) The Commission finds that such event has resulted in the death or hospitalization, within 30 days of the event, of five or more people located offsite showing objective clinical evidence of physical injury from exposure to the radioactive, toxic, explosive, or other hazardous properties of source, special nuclear, or byproduct material; or
(2) The Commission finds that $2,500,000 or more of damage offsite has been or will probably be sustained by any one person, or $5 million or more of such damage in the aggregate has been or will probably be sustained, as the result of such event; or
(3) The Commission finds that $5,000 or more of damage offsite has been or will probably be sustained by each of 50 or more persons, provided that $1 million or more of such damage in the aggregate has been or will probably be sustained, as the result of such event.
(b) As used in paragraphs (a) (2) and (3) of this section, “damage” shall be that arising out of or resulting from the radioactive, toxic, explosive, or other hazardous properties of source, special nuclear, or byproduct material, and shall be based upon estimates of one or more of the following:
(1) Total cost necessary to put affected property back into use,
(2) Loss of use of affected property,
(3) Value of affected property where not practical to restore to use,
(4) Financial loss resulting from protective actions appropriate to reduce or avoid exposure to radiation or to radioactive materials.

1
For policies issued by Nuclear Energy Liability-Property Insurance Association the amount will be “$124,000,000,” for policies issued by Mutual Atomic Energy Liability Underwriters, the amount will be “$36,000,000.”
The provisions of this condition shall not operate to increase the limit of the companies' liability under this policy.

The insured shall not, except at his own cost, make any payment, assume any obligation or incur any expense.
7.
Action against companies—Coverages A and C.
No action shall lie against the companies or any of them unless, as a condition precedent thereto, the insured shall have
fully complied with all the terms of this policy, nor until the amount of the insured's obligation to pay shall have been finally determined either by judgment against the insured after actual trial or by written agreement of the insured, the claimant and the companies.
Any person or organization or the legal representative thereof who has secured such judgment or written agreement shall thereafter be entitled to recover under this policy to the extent of the insurance afforded by this policy. No person or organization shall have any right under this policy to join the companies or any of them as parties to any action against the insured to determine the insured's liability, nor shall the companies or any of them be impleaded by the insured or his legal representative.

In case the insured and the companies shall fail to agree as to the amount of property damage, then, on the written demand of either, each shall select a competent and disinterested appraiser and notify the other of the appraiser selected within twenty days of such demand. The appraisers shall first select a competent and disinterested umpire and, failing for fifteen days to agree upon such umpire, then, on request of the insured or the companies, such umpire shall be selected by a judge of a court of record in the state in which the property is located. The appraisers shall then appraise each item of property damage and, failing to agree, shall submit their differences only to the umpire. An award in writing, so itemized, of any two when filed with the companies shall determine the amount of property damage. Each appraiser shall be paid by the party selecting him and the expenses of the appraisal and umpire shall be paid by the parties equally. The companies shall not be held to have waived any of their rights by any act relating to appraisal.
11.
Subrogation.
In the event of any payment under this policy, the companies shall be subrogated to all the insured's rights of recovery therefor against any person or organization, and the insured shall execute and deliver instruments and papers and do whatever else is necessary to secure such rights. Prior to knowledge of bodily injury or property damage caused by the nuclear energy hazard the insured may waive in writing any right or recovery against any person or organization, but after such knowledge the insured shall not waive or otherwise prejudice any such right of recovery.
The companies hereby waive any rights of subrogation acquired against the United States of America or any of its agencies by reason of any payment under this policy.

12.
Other insurance.
If the insurance afforded by this policy for loss or expense is concurrent with insurance afforded for such loss or expense by a Nuclear Energy Liability Policy (Facility Form) issued to the named insured by __________ hereinafter called “concurrent insurance,” the companies shall not be liable under this policy for a greater proportion of such loss or expense than the limit of liability stated in the declarations of this policy bears to the sum of such limit and the limit of liability stated in the declarations of such concurrent policy.
If the insured has other valid and collectible insurance (other than such concurrent insurance or any other nuclear energy liability insurance issued by the companies or __________ to any person or organization) applicable to loss or expense covered by this policy, the insurance afforded by this policy shall be excess insurance over such other insurance; provided, with respect to any person who is not employed at and in connection with the facility, such insurance as is afforded by this policy for bodily injury to an employee of the insured arising out of and in the course of his employment shall be primary insurance under such other insurance.
13.
Changes.
Notice to any agent or knowledge possessed by any agent or by any other person shall not effect a waiver or a change in any part of this policy or stop the companies from asserting any right under the terms of this policy; nor shall the terms of this policy be waived or changed except by endorsement issued to form a part of this policy executed by __________ on behalf of the companies.

# Preamble
1. The insurance and rating plan presently used by Nuclear Energy Liability Insurance Association (
NELIA
) and Mutual Atomic Energy Liability Underwriters (
MAELU
) do not make a distinction between workers claims arising from catastrophic events and those arising from lesser events;
2. NELIA and MAELU believe that the lack of such a distinction will adversely affect their ability to continue to attract from world markets very large amounts of nuclear energy liability insurance for the nuclear industry;
3. NELIA and MAELU want to avoid this potential loss of capacity and to continue to provide nuclear energy liability insurance for workers claims. Accordingly NELIA and MAELU desire to restructure their present insurance programs, including this policy, effective January 1, 1988.
Now, Therefore, the Named Insured and the companies do hereby agree as follows:

# B. Discovery Period
The discovery period for claims made under this policy begins at 12:01 a.m. on January 1, 1988 and ends at the close of December 31, 1997, Eastern Standard Time.

# C. Application of Policy
This policy applies only to bodily injury to a new worker (1) which is caused during the policy period by the nuclear energy hazard and (2) which is discovered and for which written claim is first made against the insured within the discovery period.

# VII—Other Insurance
A. This insurance is primary insurance under any insurance afforded by a Master Policy-Nuclear Energy Liability Insurance (Secondary Financial Protection) issued by NELIA or MAELU.
B. If an insured has other valid and collectible insurance, except under a MAELU Policy, for loss or expense covered by this policy, this shall be excess insurance over such other insurance. If the insured has insurance under a MAELU Policy, whether the insurance is collectible or not, the companies shall then be liable under this policy only for such proportion of loss or expense as the amount stated as the Policy Aggregate Limit in Section VIII of this policy bears to the sum of such amount and the corresponding amount stated in the MAELU Policy.

# VIII—Amount of Insurance Available

# A. Policy Aggregate Limit
1. The Policy Aggregate Limit is $124 million. This limit is not cumulative from year to year. The limit applies to all new worker's claims that qualify for coverage under this policy (herein called
qualified claims
).
2. The Policy Aggregate Limit applies collectively to all new worker's claims. Such claims may be paid by NELIA on behalf of the companies as the claims, in NELIA's discretion, become ready for disposition, and claims costs may be paid as they become due, all without regard to the order in which such claims were made and without any obligation to maintain, reserve or use any portion of the Policy Aggregate Limit for claims reported under any particular Certificate.

# B. Limitation of the Companies' Liability
1. Regardless of the number of (a) Certificates issued to form a part of this policy, (b) persons and organizations who are insureds under such Certificates, (c) qualified claims, or (d) years this policy or any such Certificates shall continue in force, the Policy Aggregate Limit is the total liability of the companies for all of their obligations under this policy, including the defense of suits and the payment of damages and claims costs.
2. This policy provides for certain automatic reinstatements of the Policy Aggregate Limit. Regardless of such provision, if, during the policy period or thereafter, the total payments of the companies for
(a) Non-ratable incurred losses, and
(b) Those ratable incurred losses for which the companies have not been reimbursed
under the Industry Retrospective Rating Plan Premium Endorsement described in Attachment 1 to this policy,
equal $124 million, the Policy Aggregate Limit shall be deemed to be exhausted, and shall not be further reinstated except by an endorsement issued to form a part of this policy for additional premium as determined by the companies.
C. Reduction and Reinstatement of the Policy Aggregate Limit
1. Each payment made by the companies in discharge of their obligations under this policy shall reduce the Policy Aggregate Limit by the amount of such payment.
2. The companies shall, however, automatically reinstate the policy aggregate limit until the total amount of such reinstatements equals $124 million, but in no event shall there be any automatic reinstatements after the Policy Aggregate Limit is exhausted pursuant to the provisions of subsection B.2. above. Thereafter, there shall be no further reinstatement of the Policy Aggregate Limit except by an endorsement issued to form a part of this policy for additional premium as determined by the companies.
3. It is a condition of this insurance that the companies shall have the right to reimburse themselves, as a matter of first priority, from funds held by NELIA in the Special Reserve Account described in Attachment 1 to this policy or from retrospective premiums received by NELIA for this insurance. The amount of reimbursement shall be equal to 95% of each payment made by the companies with respect to their obligations under this policy.

# IX—Insured's Duties in Case of Claims or Suits
A. Notice of Claims or Suits
In the event of any claim or suit involving bodily injury to which a Certificate issued to form a part of this policy applies, written notice containing particulars sufficient to identify the insured and also reasonably obtainable information with respect to the time, place and circumstances thereof shall be given by or for the insured to the companies as soon as practicable. The insured shall immediately forward to the companies every demand, notice, summons or other process received relating to claims or suits against the insured.
B. Assistance and Cooperation
The insured shall cooperate with the companies and, upon their request, shall:
(1) Attend hearings and trials; and
(2) Assist in making settlements, securing and giving evidence, obtaining the attendance of witnesses and in the conduct of any legal proceedings in connection with the subject matter of this insurance.
The insured shall not, except at the insured's own cost, make any payment, assume any obligation or incur any expense.

# X—Subrogation
In the event of any payment through a Certificate to form a part of this policy, the companies shall be subrogated to all the insured's rights of recovery therefor against any person or organization, and the insured shall execute and deliver instruments and papers, and so whatever else is necessary to secure such rights. Prior to knowledge of bodily injury caused by the nuclear energy hazard the insured may waive in writing any or all right of recovery against any person or organization, but after such knowledge the insured shall not waive or otherwise prejudice any such right of recovery.
The companies hereby waive any right of subrogation against (1) any other insured of (2) the United States of America or any of its agencies acquired by reason of any payment under this policy.
It is a condition of this policy that if an insured makes a recovery on account of any such injury, the insured shall repay to the companies the amount to which the companies would have been entitled had the foregoing provisions, or any of them, not been included in the policy.

# XI—Inspection and Suspension
The companies shall be permitted, but not obligated, to inspect at any time the facility as described in any Certificate and all books, records and operation relating thereto, both with respect to this insurance, and any other nuclear energy liability insurance and property insurance also afford with respect thereto by members of NELIA, American Nuclear Insurers, MAELU or MAERP Reinsurance Association.
If a representative of the companies discovers a condition which he or she believes to be unduly dangerous with respect to the risks insured under the Certificate, a representative of the companies may request such condition to be corrected without delay. In the event of noncompliance with the request, an officer of NELIA may, by written notice mailed or delivered to the first Named Insured, with similar notice to the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission, suspend the insurance afforded by a Certificate issued by NELIA effective 12:00 midnight of the next business day of such Commission following the date that such Commission receives such notice. The period of such suspension shall terminate as of the time stated in a written notice from NELIA to the first Named Insured that such condition has been corrected.
Neither the right to make such inspections or suspensions nor the making thereof nor any advice or report resulting therefrom
shall constitute an undertaking, on behalf of or for the benefit of the Named Insureds or others to determine or warrant that the facility or operations relating thereto are safe or healthful, or are in compliance with any law, rule or regulation.
In consideration of the issuance or continuation of a Certificate, the Named Insureds agree that neither the companies nor any persons or organizations making such inspections on their behalf shall be liable for damage to the facility or any consequential damage or cost resulting therefrom, including but not limited to any such damage or cost relating to interruption of business or manufacture, arising out of the making of or failure to make any such inspection of the facility, any report thereon, or any such suspension of insurance, but this provision does not limit the companies' contractual obligations under a Certificate issued by NELIA or any policy issued by NELIA or American Nuclear Insurers affording the insured nuclear energy liability or property insurance.

# XII—Cancellation of Certificates
The first Named Insured designated in a Certificate issued to from a part of this policy any cancel such Certificate by mailing to the companies and the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission written notice stating when, not less than 30 days thereafter, such cancellation shall be effective.
The companies may cancel any such Certificate by mailing to the first Named Insured designated therein at the address shown in such Certificate and to the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission written notice, stating when, not less than 90 days thereafter, such cancellation shall be effective; provided in the event of non-payment of premium, or if the operator of the facility, as designated in the Declarations of the Certificate, is replaced by another person or organization, such Certificate may be cancelled by the companies by mailing to the first Named Insured at the address shown therein and to the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission written notice, stating when, not less than 30 days thereafter, such cancellation shall be effective.
The mailing of notice as aforesaid shall be sufficient proof of notice. The effective date and hour of cancellation stated in the notice shall become the end of the Certificate period. Delivery of such written notice either by the first Named Insured or the companies shall be equivalent to mailing.
Upon cancellation of a Certificate, other than as of the end of December 31 in any year, the earned standard premium for the period such Certificate has been in force since the preceding December 31 shall be computed in accordance with the following provisions:
(1) If the first Named Insured cancels, the earned standard premium for such period shall be computed in accordance with the customary annual short rate table and procedure; provided, however, that if the first Named Insured cancels after knowledge of bodily injury caused by the nuclear energy hazard, all premiums theretofore paid or payable shall be fully earned;
(2) If the companies cancel, the earned standard premium for such period shall be computed pro rata.
Premium adjustment, if any, may be made either at the time of cancellation or as soon as practicable after cancellation becomes effective, but payment of tender of unearned premium is not a condition of cancellation.
Cancellation of a Certificate shall not affect the rights and obligations of the Named Insureds under the Insureds under the Industry Retrospective Rating Plan Premium Endorsement forming a part of the Certificate.

# XIII—General Conditions

# A. Premium
The Named Insureds designated in a Certificate issued by NELIA shall pay the companies the premiums for the Certificate in accordance with the provisions of the
Industry Retrospective Rating Plan Premium Endorsement

Any person or organization or the legal representative thereof who has secured such judgment of written agreement shall thereafter be entitled to recover under the Certificate to the extent of the insurance afforded by this policy through the Certificate. No person or organization shall have any right under the Certificate to join the companies or any of them as parties to any action against the insured to determine the insured's liability, nor shall the companies or any of them be impleaded by the insured or the insured's legal representative.
Bankruptcy or insolvency of the insured or the insured's estate shall not relieve the companies of any of their obligations under this policy.

Subrogation and
Suit,

# 2. Payment of Advance and Standard Premiums
The Named Insureds shall pay the companies the advance premium stated in the declarations, for the period from the effective date of this Certificate through December 31 following. Thereafter, at the beginning of each calendar year while this Certificate is in force, the Named Insureds shall pay the advance premium for such year to the companies.
The advance premium for each calendar year shall be stated in the Advance and Standard Premium Endorsement for the year issued by the companies as soon as practicable prior to or after the beginning of the year.
As soon as practicable after the end of a calendar year or the Certificate Coverage Period, the standard premium for the preceding year shall be finally determined and stated in the Advance and Standard Premium Endorsement for that year. If the Standard Premium exceeds the Advance Premium paid for that year, the Named Insureds shall pay the excess to the companies; if less, the companies shall return to the Named Insureds the excess portion paid.
The Named Insureds shall maintain records of the information necessary for premium computation and shall send copies of such records to the companies as directed, at the end of each calendar year, at the end of the Certificate Coverage Period and at such other times as the companies may direct.

# 3. Special Reserve Account; Use of Reserve Premiums
NELIA shall maintain on behalf of its members a Special Reserve Account for holding collectively all reserve premiums paid for all Certificates issued to form a part of the Master Worker Policy. Such premiums, together with any undistributed net income realized thereon after taxes and investment expenses, shall be used for the following purposes only:
(1) To pay ratable incurred losses or, in the event ratable incurred losses are paid under the Master Worker Policy from funds advanced by the members of NELIA subscribing the policy, to reimburse such members as a matter of first priority for the funds advanced;
(2) To refund any amounts so held to the Named Insureds, as provided in Section 4.
No members of NELIA and no Named Insureds shall have any individual interest in or claim upon amounts held in the special Reserve Account, except to participate proportionally in any refund or reimbursement provided for above.
All reserve premiums paid or payable for this certificate may be used by NELIA to discharge the obligations of its members under the Master Worker Policy with respect to the above purposes and arising out of claims made under any Certificate issued to form a part of the Master Worker Policy.

# 4. Payment of Reserve Premium Charges and Refunds
As soon as practicable after each December 31 the companies will review the status of the reserve for refunds and report their findings to all Certificate Holders.
If, at any time, the companies find that there is negative balance in the reserve for refunds and that such condition is likely to prevail, they shall determine an appropriate industry reserve premium charge. Similarly, if the companies find that there is a surplus positive balance, they shall determine an appropriate industry reserve premium refund.
The portion of an industry reserve premium charge or an industry reserve premium refund that is:
(1) Payable by the Named Insureds as a reserve premium charge, or
(2) Due such insureds as reserve premium refund, shall be determined by multiplying the industry reserve premium charge or the industry reserve premium refund by the retrospective adjustment ratio applicable to this Certificate.
The amount of any reserve premium charge shall be stated in a Retrospective Reserve Premium Charge Endorsement. The charge shall be paid promptly after receipt of the endorsement.
When all claims covered by the Master Worker Policy are closed the companies shall make a final review and report, and shall determine a final industry reserve premium charge or industry reserve premium refund equal to the amount of the balance.

# 5. Final Premium
The final premium for this Certificate shall be (a) the sum of the standard premiums for each calendar year, or portion thereof, during which the Certificate remains in force plus (b) the sum of all reserve premiums, including all reserve premium charges, minus (c) the sum of all reserve premium refunds.

# 6. Reserve Premium Charge Agreement
In consideration of (a) the participation of Named Insureds in other Certificates subject to the Industry Retrospective Rating Plan, (b) the undertaking of such Named Insureds to pay their appropriate share of any industry reserve premium charge and (c) the obligations assumed by the members of NELIA under the Master Worker Policy, the Named Insureds, by acceptance of the Master Worker Policy, agree:
(1) That the insurance provided by the Master Policy applies collectively to all claims covered by the policy through any and all Certificates issued to form a part of the policy.
(2) That the right of each Named Insured under a Certificate to receive reserve premium refunds and the obligation of each such insured to pay reserve premiums charges applies to all claims covered by the Master Worker Policy and continues until all such claims are closed, whether or not such claims were before the inception of the Certificate or after its termination.
(3) To pay all reserve premium charges due promptly after receipt of the Retrospective Reserve Premium Charge Endorsement, whether or not the Certificate is terminated. Any reserve premium charge shall be overdue if not paid within 60 days of the date of the invoice for the charge.
Overdue reserve premium charges shall bear interest from the due date until paid at an annual rate equal to the sum of (a) 3% plus (b) a rate of interest equal to Moody's Average Public Utility Bond Yield described in the issue of Moody's Bond Survey current on the due date. Any reserve premium refund due to Named Insureds under a Certificate shall be used to pay any overdue reserve premium charges to such Named Insureds.

# 7. Reserve Premium Refund Agreement
Each member of NELIA subscribing the Master Worker Policy for any calendar year, or portion thereof, with respect to which an industry reserve premium refund is determined to be payable thereby agrees for itself, severally and not jointly, and in the respective proportion of its liability assumed under the Master Worker Policy for that calendar year, to return promptly to the Named Insureds that portion of such refund due such Insureds, as determined in accordance with the provisions of this endorsement.

1. At all times during the term of the license or licenses designated in Item 3 of the Attachment hereto, the licensee will maintain financial protection in the amount specified in Item 2 of the Attachment and in the form of the nuclear energy liability insurance policy designated in the Attachment. If more than one license is designated in Item 3 of the Attachment, the licensee agrees to maintain such financial protection until the end of the term of that license which will be the last to expire. The licensee shall, notwithstanding the expiration, termination, modification, amendment, suspension or revocation of any license or licenses designated in Item 3 of the Attachment, maintain such financial protection in effect until all the radioactive material has been removed from the location and transportation of the radioactive material from the location has ended as defined in paragraph 5(b), Article I of this section, or until the Commission authorizes the termination or the modification of such financial protection. The Commission will not unreasonably withhold such authorization.
2. In the event of any payment by the insurer or insurers under a policy or policies specified in Item 5 of the Attachment hereto which reduces the aggregate limit of such policy or policies below the amount of financial protection, the licensee will promptly apply to his insurers for reinstatement of the amount specified in Item 2a of the Attachment (without reference to paragraph b of Item 2) and will make all reasonable efforts to obtain such reinstatement. In the event that the licensee has not obtained reinstatement of such amount within ninety days after the date of such reduction, and in the absence of good cause shown to the contrary, the Commission may issue an order requiring the licensee to furnish financial protection for such amount in another form.
3. Any obligations of the licensee under subsection 53e(8) of the Act to indemnify the United States and the Commission from public liability, together with any public liability satisfied by the insurers under the policy or policies designated in the Attachment hereto, shall not in the aggregate exceed the amount of financial protection with respect to any nuclear incident, including the reasonable costs of investigating and settling claims and defending suits for damage.
4. With respect to any extraordinary nuclear occurrence to which this agreement applies, the Commission, and the licensee on behalf of itself and other persons indemnified, insofar as their interests appear, each agree to waive:
(a) Any issue or defense as to the conduct of the claimant or fault of persons indemnified, including, but not limited to:
(1) Negligence;
(2) Contributory negligence;
(3) Assumption of the risk;
(4) Unforeseeable intervening causes, whether involving the conduct of a third person or an act of God.
As used herein,
conduct of the claimant
includes conduct of persons through whom the claimant derives his cause of action;
(b) Any issue or defense as to charitable or governmental immunity;
(c) Any issue or defense based on any statute of limitations if suit is instituted within 3 years from the date on which the claimant first knew, or reasonably could have known, of his injury or damage and the cause thereof.
The waiver of any such issue or defense shall be effective regardless of whether such issue or defense may otherwise be deemed jurisdictional or relating to an element in the cause of action. The waivers shall be judicially enforceable in accordance with their terms by the claimant against the person indemnified.
5. The waivers set forth in paragraph 4 of this article:
(a) Shall not preclude a defense based upon a failure to take reasonable steps to mitigate damages;
(b) Shall not apply to injury or damage to a claimant or to a claimant's property which is intentionally sustained by the claimant or which results from a nuclear incident intentionally and wrongfully caused by the claimant;
(c) Shall not apply to injury to a claimant who is employed at the site of and in connection with the activity where the extraordinary nuclear occurrence takes place if benefits therefore are either payable or required to be provided under any workmen's compensation or occupational disease law:
Provided, however,
That with respect to an extraordinary nuclear occurrence occurring at the facility, a claimant who is employed at the facility in connection with the construction of a nuclear reactor with respect to which no operating license has been issued by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission shall not be considered as employed in connection with the activity where the extraordinary nuclear occurrence takes place if:
(1) The claimant is employed exclusively in connection with the construction of a nuclear reactor, including all related equipment and installations at the facility, and
(2) No operating license has been issued by the NRC with respect to the nuclear reactor, and
(3) The claimant is not employed in connection with the possession, storage, use or transfer of nuclear material at the facility;
(d) Shall not apply to any claim for punitive or exemplary damages, provided, with respect to any claim for wrongful death under any State law which provides for damages only punitive in nature, this exclusion does not apply to the extent that the claimant has sustained actual damages, measured by the pecuniary injuries resulting from such death but not to exceed the maximum amount otherwise recoverable under such law;
(e) Shall be effective only with respect to those obligations set forth in this agreement;
(f) Shall not apply to, or prejudice the prosecution or defense of, any claim or portion of claim which is not within the protection afforded under (1) the limit of liability provisions under subsection 170(e) of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and (2) the terms of this agreement and the terms of the nuclear energy liability insurance policy or policies designated in the attachment hereto.
6. The obligations of the licensee under this agreement shall apply only with respect to nuclear incidents occurring during the term of this agreement.
7. Upon the expiration or revocation of any license designated in Item 3 of the Attachment, the Commission will enter into an appropriate amendment of this agreement with the licensee reducing the amount of financial protection required under this Article; provided, that the licensee is then entitled to a reduction in the amount of financial protection under applicable Commission regulations and orders.
8. With respect to any common occurrence,
(a) If the sum of limit of liability of any Nuclear Energy Liability Insurance Association policy designated in Item 5 of the Attachment and the limits of liability of all other nuclear energy liability insurance policies (facility form) applicable to such common occurrence and issued by Nuclear Energy Liability Insurance Association exceeds $155,000,000 the amount of financial protection specified in Item 2 a and b of the Attachment shall be deemed to be reduced by that proportion of the difference between said sum and $155,000,000 as the limit of liability of the Nuclear Energy Liability Insurance Association policy designated in Item 5 of the Attachment bears to the sum of the limits of liability of all nuclear energy liability insurance policies (facility form) applicable to such common occurrence and issued by Nuclear Energy Liability Insurance Association;
(b) If the sum of the limit of liability of any Mutual Atomic Energy Liability Underwriters policy designated in Item 5 of the Attachment and the limits of liability of all other nuclear energy liability insurance policies (facility form) applicable to such common occurrence and issued by Mutual Atomic Energy Liability Underwriters exceeds $45,000,000, the amount of financial protection specified in Item 2 a and b of the Attachment shall be deemed to be reduced by that proportion of the difference between said sum and $45,000,000 as the limit of liability of the Mutual Atomic Energy Liability Underwriters policy designated in Item 5 of the Attachment bears to the sum of the limits of liability of all nuclear energy liability insurance policies (facility form) applicable to such common occurrence and issued by Mutual Atomic Energy Liability Underwriters;
(c) If any of the other applicable agreements is with a person who has furnished financial protection in a form other than a nuclear energy liability insurance policy (facility form) issued by Nuclear Energy Liability Insurance Association or Mutual Atomic Energy Liability Underwriters, and if also the sum of the amount of financial protection established under this agreement and the amounts of financial protection established under all other applicable agreements exceeds an amount equal to the sum of $200,000,000 and the amount available as secondary financial protection, the obligations of the licensee shall not exceed a greater proportion of an amount equal to the sum of $200,000,000 and the amount available as secondary financial protection, than the amount of financial protection established under this agreement bears to the sum of such amount and the amounts of financial protection established under all other applicable agreements.
(d) As used in this paragraph 8., Article II, and in Article III,
other applicable agreements
means each other agreement entered into by the Commission pursuant to subsection 170(c) of the Act in which agreement the nuclear incident is defined as a
common occurrence.
As used in this paragraph 8., Article II,
the obligations of the licensee
means the obligations of the licensee under subsection 53e(8) of the Act to indemnify the United States and the Commission from public liability, together with any public liability satisfied by the insurers under the policy or policies designated in the Attachment, and the reasonable costs incurred by the insurers in investigating and settling claims and defending suits for damage.
9. The obligations of the licensee under this Article shall not be affected by any failure or default on the part of the Commission or the Government of the United States to fulfill any or all of its obligations under this agreement. Bankruptcy or insolvency of any person indemnified other than the licensee, or the estate of any person indemnified other than the licensee, shall not relieve the licensee of any of his obligations hereunder.

# Article III
1. The Commission undertakes and agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the licensee and other persons indemnified, as their interest may appear from public liability.
2. With respect to damage caused by a nuclear incident to property of any person legally liable for the nuclear incident, the Commission agrees to pay to such person those sums which such person would have been obligated to pay if such property had belonged to another; provided, that the obligation of the Commission under this paragraph 2 does not apply with respect to:

# Article IV
1. When the Commission determines that the United States will probably be required to make indemnity payments under the provisions of this agreement, the Commission shall have the right to collaborate with the licensee and other persons indemnified in the settlement and defense of any claim (provided that no government indemnity that would otherwise be available to pay public liability claims is used for these purposes) and shall have the right (a) to require the prior approval of the Commission for the settlement or payment of any claim or action asserted against the licensee or other person indemnified for public liability or damage to property of persons legally liable for the nuclear incident which claim or action the licensee or the Commission may be required to indemnify under this agreement; and (b) to appear through the Attorney General of the United States on behalf of the licensee or other person indemnified, take charge of such action and settle or defend any such action. If the settlement or defense of any such action or claim is undertaken by the Commission, the licensee shall furnish all reasonable assistance in effecting a settlement or asserting a defense.

# Article VIII
The following provisions are applicable to each licensee operating a facility designed for producing substantial amounts of electricity and having a rated capacity of 100,000 electrical kilowatts or more;
1. Each licensee is required to have and maintain financial protection in an amount specified in Item 2 a and b of the Attachment annexed hereto, and the amount available as secondary financial protection (in the form of private liability insurance available under an industry retrospective rating plan providing for deferred premium charges); Provided, however, That under such a plan for deferred premium charges, such charges for each nuclear reactor which is licensed to operate shall not exceed $63,000,000 with respect to any single nuclear incident (plus any surcharge assessed under subsection 170o.(1)(E) of the Act) nor exceed $10,000,000 per incident within one calendar year. If the licensee fails to pay assessed deferred premiums, the Commission reserves the right to pay those premiums on behalf of the licensee and to recover the amount of such premiums from the licensee.
2. The Commission shall require the immediate submission of financial statements by those licensees who indicate, after an assessment of the retrospective premium by the insurance pools, that they will not pay the assessment. Such financial statements shall include, as a minimum, exhibits indicating internally generated funds from operations and accumulated retained earnings. Subsequent submission of financial statements by such licensees may be requested by the Commission, as required.
3. If premiums are paid by the Commission as provided in paragraph 1, payment by the Commission shall create a lien in the amount paid in favor of the United States upon all property and rights to property, whether real or personal, belonging to such licensee. The lien shall arise at the time payment is made by the Commission and shall continue until the liability for the amount (or a judgment against the licensee arising out of such liability) is satisfied or becomes unenforceable. The Commission will issue a certificate of release of any such lien if it finds that the liability for the amount has been fully satisfied or has become legally unenforceable.
4. If the Commission determines that the licensee is financially able to reimburse the Commission for a deferred premium payment made in its behalf, and the licensee, after notice of such determination by the Commission fails to make such reimbursement within 120 days, the Commission will take appropriate steps to suspend the license for 30 days. The Commission may take any further action as necessary if reimbursement is not made within the 30-day suspension period including, but not limited to termination of the operating license.

4. If the Commission determines that the licensee is financially able to reimburse the Commission for a deferred premium payment made in its behalf, and the licensee, after notice of such determination by the Commission fails to make such reimbursement within 120 days, the Commission will take appropriate steps to suspend the license for 30 days. The Commission may take any further action as necessary if reimbursement is not made within the 30-day suspension period including, but not limited to, termination of the operating license or combined license.

# Conditions

# 1. annual premium
The named insureds designated in a
certificate
shall pay to the companies the annual premium for each calendar year or part thereof.
Such annual premium shall be determined by the companies and stated in a written notice mailed to the first named insured shown in Item 1 of a
certificate,
and shall be due and payable as stated in such notice.

# 2. retrospective premium
The named insureds designated in a
certificate
shall pay to the companies retrospective premium in the event of
excess losses
due to
bodily injury
or
property damage
caused during their
certificate
period by a
nuclear incident
arising out of or in connection with a nuclear reactor described in Item 3 of the
certificate
or in Item 3 of any other
certificate.
The amount of retrospective premium-due under each
certificate
shall be determined by multiplying such
excess losses
by the ratio of the maximum retrospective premium payable with respect to the
nuclear incident
under the
certificate
to the total of the maximum retrospective premiums payable with respect to the
nuclear incident
under all such
certificates.
If any portion of the
bodily injury
or
property damage
to which this Master Policy applies is caused during any portion of a
certificate
period by a
nuclear incident,
the retrospective premium the named insureds designated in such
certificate
are obligated to pay shall be determined as if all
bodily injury
or
property damage
to which this Master Policy applies caused by the
nuclear incident
had been caused during the
certificate
period of such
certificate.
The maximum retrospective premium that the named insureds designated in a
certificate
shall pay to the companies for all
excess losses
arising out of any one
nuclear incident
is the amount stated in Item 7 of their
certificate.
In the event of two more
nuclear incidents,
the maximum amount of retrospective premium that shall be due from and payable by the named insureds in one calendar year shall not exceed twice the amount stated in Item 7 of their
certificate.
Any amount in excess thereof shall be paid in subsequent calendar years as billed by the companies.
In addition, an allowance for applicable premium taxes shall be determined by the companies and paid to them by the named insureds at the time retrospective premiums are due and payable.
After a
nuclear incident
resulting in
excess losses,
the companies shall mail to the first named insured designated in Item 1 of a
certificate
written notice of the retrospective premium and allowance for premium taxes then due under such
certificate.
Such notice shall also constitute notice to all other named insureds designated in such
certificate.
The named insureds shall pay directly to the Nuclear Energy Liability Insurance Association the retrospective premium and allowance for premium taxes stated in the notice. The notice shall specify a date no earlier than 60 days after mailing by which time payment is to be received by the Nuclear Energy Liability Insurance Association.
The companies shall at least annually review their estimate of
excess losses
arising out of the
nuclear incident
and shall adjust the retrospective premium and allowance for premium taxes accordingly. If the amount due from the named insureds is increased, written notice shall be mailed to the first named insured in accordance with the foregoing paragraph; if deceased the companies shall return the excess to the first named insured.
The obligation of the named insureds to pay retrospective premium and the allowance for premium taxes for
excess losses
arising out of a
nuclear incident
shall continue until the named insureds have paid the maximum retrospective premium stated in Item 7 of their
certificate
plus allowance for premium taxes.
The companies shall send to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission summaries of their estimates of
excess losses
arising out of the
nuclear incident
and their computations of retrospective premium and the allowance for premium taxes due.
All retrospective premium (but not the allowance for premium taxes) received by the companies is to be held by the companies separate from the companies' other assets and is to be used by the companies only for the purpose of paying
excess losses.
Any investment income received by the companies from such retrospective premium shall accrue to the benefit of the named insureds.
This paragraph shall not apply to any retrospective premium received by the companies as reimbursement for any funds expended pursuant to Condition 4.

# 3. limit of liability
Regardless of the number of
(a) Persons or organizations who are
insureds
under this Master Policy, or
(b) Claims made and suits brought against any and all
insureds,
or
(c) Policies or contracts of
primary financial protection
or
certificates
which apply to the
nuclear incident,
or
(d) Years this Master Policy and any
certificate
shall continue in force,
The total liability of the companies under this Master Policy for all
excess losses
arising out of any
nuclear incident
shall not exceed the amount of retrospective premium actually received by the companies pursuant to Condition 2 with respect to such
nuclear incident
plus the companies' contingent liability, if any, as determined by Condition 4. Reimbursement of the companies for funds expended pursuant to Condition 4 shall not operate to increase the total liability of the companies.

# 4. contingent liability of the companies
The companies have a contingent liability under this Master Policy for payment of
excess losses
but only if, and to the extent that, the retrospective premium due under one or more
certificates
is not paid. In the event of any such failure to pay retrospective premiums, the companies' obligations under this Condition 4 are limited as follows:
Regardless of the number of
nuclear incidents
which cause
bodily injury
or
property damage
to which this Master Policy applies, the number of years this Master Policy is in force, the number of
certificates
issued or in effect, or the number of annual premiums paid or payable.
(a) The total contingent liability of the companies for all
excess losses
arising out of two or more
nuclear incidents
shall not exceed $46,500,000;
(b) Subject to the above provision (a), the total contingent liability of the companies for all
excess losses
arising out of any one
nuclear incident
shall not exceed $23,250,000;
(c) Subject to the above provisions (a) and (b), the maximum amount to be paid by the companies in any one calendar year because of contingent liability for
excess losses
shall not exceed $23,250,000.
If a named insured designated in a
certificate
shall become insolvent or be adjudged bankrupt, the companies' obligation under this Condition 4 shall not apply to the failure of any named insured designated in such
certificate
to pay retrospective premium with respect to
excess losses
because of
bodily injury
or
property damage
caused after the date of such insolvency or bankruptcy.

# 5. investigation, defense or settlement of claims or suits
Subject to the provisions of any written agreement between the companies and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the companies shall defend any claim or suit alleging
bodily injury
or
property damage
caused by a
nuclear incident
and seeking damages which are payable under this Master Policy, and may make such investigation and settlement of any claim or suit as they deem expedient. In no event shall the companies be obligated to pay any claim or judgment or to defend any claim or suit after the companies have paid the amount of retrospective premium actually received for
excess losses
arising out of the
nuclear incident
plus the amount of their contingent liability, if any.

# 6. primary financial protection
Regardless of the number of policies or contracts of
primary financial protection
applicable to a
nuclear incident,
the limit of liability of all such policies or contracts shall be deemed to be exhausted when the sums paid under all such policies or contracts are equal to the lesser of (1) the sum of the limits of liability available under all such primary financial protection or (2) one hundred forty million dollars.
The named insured designated in a
certificate
shall maintain in full effect during the currency of such
certificate
the
primary financial protection
described therein, except for any reduction of the limit of liability of such
primary financial protection
solely as the result of sums paid thereunder. Failure of the named insureds to comply with the foregoing shall not invalidate this Master Policy, but in the event of such failure the companies shall be liable only to the extent that they would have been liable and the named insureds complied therewith.
In the event that the limit of liability of the
primary financial protection
is reduced, such names insureds shall immediately inform the companies thereof and make all reasonable efforts to reinstate such limit.
Upon the companies' request the named insureds shall provide the companies with a certified copy of any policy or other contract of
primary financial protection.
No amendment of the
primary financial protection
shall increase, extend or broaden the insurance provided by this Master Policy unless the companies agree to the amendment by an endorsement issued to form a part of this Master Policy.

# 7. interest to be paid by named insured on retrospective premium and allowance for premium taxes in default
If retrospective premium or allowance for premium taxes is not paid when due by the named insureds designated in Item 1 of a
certificate,
such named insureds shall be obligated to pay, in addition to the amount in default, interest thereon during the period of default. Such interest shall be computed at an annual rate equal to the sum of (a) three percent plus (b) a rate of interest equal to Moody's Average Public Utility Bond Yield described in the issue of Moody's Bond Survey current on the date that the retrospective premium and allowance for premium taxes were due. The annual rate of interest shall be adjusted monthly during the period of default to reflect any revisions of Moody's Average Public Utility Bond Yield described in the issue of Moody's Bond Survey current on the first business day of each such month.
The interest so received shall be used to pay to the companies interest at the annual rate described above for any funds the companies have paid pursuant to Condition 4. Any balance remaining shall accrue to the benefit of named insureds not in default as if it were investment income on retrospective premium.

# 8. notice of nuclear incident, claim or suit
In the event of
bodily injury
or
property damage
to which this Master Policy applies or of a
nuclear incident
which may give rise to claims therefor, written notice containing particulars sufficient to identify the
insured
and also reasonably obtainable information with respect to the time, place and circumstances thereof, and the names and addresses of the injured and of available witnesses, shall be given by or for the
insured
to Nuclear Energy Liability Insurance Association or the companies as soon as practicable. If claim is made or suit is brought against the
insured,
the
insured
shall immediately forward to Nuclear Energy Liability Insurance Association or the companies every demand, notice, summons or other process received by or on behalf of the
insured.

# 9. assistance and cooperation of the insured
The
insured
shall cooperate with the companies and, upon the companies' request, attend hearings and trials and assist in making settlements, in securing and giving evidence, in obtaining the attendance of witnesses and in the conduct of any legal proceedings in connection with the subject matter of this insurance. The
insured
shall not, except at the
insured's
own cost, make any payment, assume any obligation or incur any expense.

# 10. action against companies
No action shall lie against the companies or any of them unless, as a condition precedent thereto, the
insured
shall have fully complied with all the terms of this Master Policy, nor until the amount of the
insured's
obligation to pay shall have been finally determined either by judgment against the
insured
after actual trial or by written agreement of the
insured,
the claimant and the companies.
Any person or organization or the legal representative thereof who has secured such judgment or written agreement shall thereafter be entitled to recover under this Master Policy to the extent of the insurance afforded by this Master Policy. No person or organization shall have any right under this Master Policy to join the companies or any of them as parties to any action against the
insured
to determine the
insured's
liability, nor shall the companies or any of them be impleaded by the
insured
or the
insured's
legal representative. Except as provided in Condition 4, bankruptcy or insolvency of the
insured
or of the
insured's
estate shall not relieve the companies of any of their obligations hereunder.

# 11. subrogation
In the event of any payment under this Master Policy, the companies may participate with the
insured
and any underlying insurer in the exercise of all the
insured's
rights of recovery against any person or organization liable therefor. Prior to knowledge of
bodiliy injury
or
property damage
to which this Master Policy applies or of a
nuclear incident
which may give rise to claims therefor, the
insured
may waive in writing any right of recovery against any person or organization. After such knowledge, the
insured
shall not waive or otherwise prejudice any such right of recovery but shall do everything necessary to secure such rights. Recoveries shall be applied first to reimburse any person or organization (including the
insured)
that may have paid any amount with respect to liability in excess of the limit of the companies' liability hereunder; then to reimburse the companies up to the amount paid hereunder; and lastly to reimburse anyone entitiled to claim the residue, if any. A different apportionment maybe made by agreement signed by all parties affected.
Reasonable expenses incurred in the exercise of rights of recovery shall be apportioned in the ratio of the respective losses for which recovery is sought. The companies shall, after deducting all of their expenses in securing recovery, apply the net amount of recoveries made by the companies as a credit in determining the amount of
excess
losses.

# 12. other insurance
This insurance shall be excess insurance over
primary financial protection.
This insurance is concurrent with insurance afforded by a Master Policy—Nuclear Energy Liability Insurance (Secondary Financial Protection) issued to the named insured by Mutual Atomic Energy Liability Underwriters, hereinafter called
concurrent insurance.
The companies shall not be liable under this Master Policy for a greater proportion of
excess losses
than the applicable limit of liability described in Condition 3 bears to the sum of (a) such limit plus (b) the applicable limit of liability of such concurrent insurance.
If the
insured
has other valid and collectible insurance (other than
primary financial protection
or concurrent insurance) applicable to
excess losses
covered by this Master Policy, the insurance afforded by this Master Policy shall be primary insurance under such other insurance.

# 13. changes
Notice to any agent or knowledge possessed by any agent or by any other person shall not effect a waiver or a change in any part of this Master Policy or estop the companies from asserting any right under the terms of this Master Policy; nor shall the terms of this Master Policy be waived or changed, except by endorsement executed by Nuclear Energy Liability Insurance Association on behalf of the companies and issued to form a part of this Master Policy.

# 14. assignment
Assignment of interest by the named insured shall not bind the companies until their consent is endorsed hereon; if, however, the named insured shall die or be declared bankrupt or insolvent, this Master Policy shall cover such named insured's legal representative, receiver or trustee as an
insured
under this Master Policy, but only with respect to such legal representative's, receiver's or trustee's liability as such, and then only provided written notice of the legal representative's, receiver's or trustee's appointment as such is given to the companies within ten days after such appointment.

# 15. custodian of the policy—nuclear regulatory commission
The named insureds have designated the Nuclear Regulatory Commission as the custodian of this Master Policy and any endorsements thereto.

by mailing to the companies and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission written notice stating when, not less than thirty days thereafter, such cancellation shall be effective.
The companies may cancel any
certificate
by mailing to the first named insured designated in Item 1 of such
certificate
written notice stating when, not less than ninety days thereafter, such cancellation shall be effective; provided that in the event of non-payment of any annual premium, retrospective premium or allowance for premium taxes due under a
certificate,
such
certificate
may be canceled by the companies by mailing to the first named insured designated therein written notice stating when, not less than thirty days thereafter, such cancellation shall be effective.
The mailing of notice as aforesaid shall be sufficient proof of notice. The effective date and time of cancellation stated in the notice shall become the end of the
certificate
period. Delivery of such written notice, either by the first named insured designated in Item 1 of a
certificate
or by the companies, shall be equivalent to mailing.
A copy of the companies' cancellation notice shall be mailed to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, but mailing such copy is not a condition of cancellation.
If a
certificate
is canceled, the earned portion of the annual premium shall be computed pro-rata. Adjustment of the annual premium, if any, may be made either at the time cancellation is effective or as soon as practicable after cancellation becomes effective, but payment or tender of unearned premium is not a condition of cancellation.
Cancellation or termination of any
certificate
shall not terminate the obligation of a named insured to pay retrospective premium and the allowance for premium taxes as provided in such named insured's
certificate
and Condition 2 of this Master Policy.
This Master Policy shall terminate automatically on the effective date and time of cancellation or termination of the last
certificate
in effect.

# 17. company representation

Except with respect to compliance with the obligations imposed on the
insured
by Conditions 8, 9, 10 and 11 of this Master Policy, the first named insured designated in Item 1 of a
certificate
is authorized to act for every other person and organization insured under such
certificate
in all matters pertaining to this insurance.

# 19. changes in subscribing companies and in their proportionate liability
The members of Nuclear Energy Liability Insurance Association subscribing this Master Policy, and the proportionate liability of each, may change from time to time.
Each company subscribing this Master Policy upon its issuance shall be liable only for its stated proportion of any obligation assumed or expense incurred under this Master Policy because of
bodily injury
or
property damage
caused during the period from the effective date of this Master Policy to the close of December 31 next following. For each subsequent calendar year, beginning January 1 next following the effective date of this Master Policy, the subscribing companies and the proportionate liability of each such company shall be stated in an endorsement issued to form a part of this Master Policy, duly executed by the President of Nuclear Energy Liability Insurance Association on behalf of each such company, and mailed or delivered to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

# 20. declarations

# Exemptions in Agreement States
§ 150.10
Persons exempt.
Except as provided in §§ 150.15, 150.16, 150.17, 150.17a, and 150.19, any person in an Agreement State who manufactures, produces, receives, possesses, uses, or transfers byproduct material, source material, or special nuclear material in quantities not sufficient to form a critical mass is exempt from the requirements for a license contained in Chapters 6, 7, and 8 of the Act, regulations of the Commission imposing licensing requirements upon persons who manufacture, produce, receive, possess, use, or transfer such materials, and from regulations of the Commission applicable to licensees. The exemptions in this section do not apply to agencies of the Federal government as defined in § 150.3.
[37 FR 9208, May 6, 1972, as amended at 45 FR 50718, July 31, 1980; 75 FR 73946, Nov. 30, 2010]
§ 150.11
Critical mass.
(a) For the purposes of this part, special nuclear material in quantities not sufficient to form a critical mass means uranium enriched in the isotope U-235 in quantities not exceeding 350 grams of contained U-235; uranium-233 in quantities not exceeding 200 grams; plutonium in quantities not exceeding
200 grams; or any combination of them in accordance with the following formula: For each kind of special nuclear material, determine the ratio between the quantity of that special nuclear material and the quantity specified above for the same kind of special nuclear material. The sum of such ratios for all kinds of special nuclear materials in combination shall not exceed unity. For example, the following quantities in combination would not exceed the limitation and are within the formula, as follows:

§ 170.12
Payment of fees.
(a)
Application and registration fees.
Each application or registration for which a fee is prescribed must be accompanied by a remittance for the full amount of the fee. The NRC will not issue a new license or an amendment increasing the scope of an existing license to a higher fee category before receiving the prescribed application fee. The application or registration fee(s) is charged whether the Commission approves the application or not. The application or registration fee(s) is also charged if the applicant withdraws the application or registration.
(b)
Licensing fees.
(1) Licensing fees will be assessed to recover full costs for—
(i) The review of applications for new licenses and approvals;
(ii) The review of applications for amendments to and renewal of existing licenses or approvals;
(iii) Preapplication consultations and reviews; and
(iv) The full cost for project managers assigned to a specific plant or facility, excluding leave time and time spent on generic activities (such as rulemaking).
(2) Full cost fees will be determined based on the professional staff time and appropriate contractual support services expended. The full cost fees for professional staff time will be determined at the professional hourly rates in effect the time the service was provided. The full cost fees are payable upon notification by the Commission.
(3) The NRC intends to bill each applicant or licensee at quarterly intervals for all accumulated costs for each application the applicant or licensee has on file for NRC review, until the review has been brought to an end, whether by issuance of a permit, license, approval, certificate, exemption, or other form of permission; by denial, withdrawal, or suspension of review of the application; or by postponement of action on the application by the applicant.
(4) The NRC intends to bill each applicant or licensee for costs related to project manager time on a quarterly basis. Each bill will identify the costs related to project manager time.
(c)
Inspection fees.
(1) Inspection fees will be assessed to recover full cost for each resident inspector (including the senior resident inspector), assigned to a specific plant or facility. The fees assessed will be based on the number of hours that each inspector assigned to the plant or facility is in an official duty status (
i.e.,
all time in a non-leave status), excluding time spent by a resident inspector in support of activities at another site. The hours will be billed at the appropriate hourly rate established in 10 CFR 170.20. Resident inspectors' time related to a specific inspection will be included in the fee assessed for the specific inspection in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
(2) Inspection fees will be assessed to recover the full cost for each specific inspection, including plant- or licensee-specific performance reviews and assessments, evaluations, and incident investigations. For inspections that result in the issuance of an inspection report, fees will be assessed for costs incurred up to approximately 30 days after the inspection report is issued. The costs for these inspections include preparation time, time on site, documentation time, and follow-up activities and any associated contractual service costs, but exclude the time involved in the processing and issuance of a notice of violation or civil penalty.
(3) The NRC intends to bill for resident inspectors' time and for specific inspections subject to full cost recovery on a quarterly basis. The fees are payable upon notification by the Commission.
(d)
Special project fees.
(1) All special projects performed by the Commission, unless otherwise exempt from fees or for which fees are otherwise specified in this part, will be assessed fees to recover the full cost of the service provided. Special projects means specific services provided by the Commission, including but not limited to—
(i) Topical reports;
(ii) Financial assurance submittals that do not require a license amendment;
(iii) Responses to Confirmatory Action Letters;
(iv) Uranium recovery licensees' land-use survey reports;

Minor amendment of any active export or import license, for example, to extend the expiration date, change domestic information, or make other revisions which do not involve any substantive changes to license terms or conditions or to the type of facility or component authorized for export and, therefore, do not require in-depth analysis or review or consultation with the Executive Branch, U.S. host state, or foreign government authorities
Minor amendment to license
N/A
1
Fees will be charged for approvals issued under a specific exemption provision of the Commission's regulations under title 10 of the
Code of Federal Regulations
(e.g., 10 CFR 50.12, 10 CFR 73.5) and any other sections in effect now or in the future, regardless of whether the approval is in the form of a license amendment, letter of approval, safety evaluation report, or other form.
2
Full cost fees will be determined based on the professional staff time and appropriate contractual support services expended. For applications currently on file and for which fees are determined based on the full cost expended for the review, the professional staff hours expended for the review of the application up to the effective date of the final rule will be determined at the professional rates in effect when the service was provided.
3
Inspections covered by this schedule are both routine and non-routine safety and safeguards inspections performed by the NRC for the purpose of review or follow-up of a licensed program. Inspections are performed through the full term of the license to ensure that the authorized activities are being conducted in accordance with the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, other legislation, Commission regulations or orders, and the terms and conditions of the license. Non-routine inspections that result from third-party allegations will not be subject to fees.
4
Imports only of major components for end-use at NRC-licensed reactors are authorized under NRC general import license in 10 CFR 110.27.
5
Full cost fees will be assessed once NRC work on a Touhy request exceeds 50 hours, in accordance with § 170.12(d).
6
Because the resources for import and export licensing activities are identified as a fee-relief activity to be excluded from the fee-recoverable budget, import and export licensing actions will not incur fees.

Types of fees
—Separate charges, as shown in the schedule, will be assessed for pre-application consultations and reviews; applications for new licenses, approvals, or license terminations; possession-only licenses; issuances of new licenses and approvals; certain amendments and renewals to existing licenses and approvals; safety evaluations of sealed sources and devices; generally licensed device registrations; and certain inspections. The following guidelines apply to these charges:
(1)
Application and registration fees.
Applications for new materials licenses and export and import licenses; applications to reinstate expired, terminated, or inactive licenses, except those subject to fees assessed at full costs; applications filed by Agreement State licensees to register under the general license provisions of 10 CFR 150.20; and applications for amendments to materials licenses that would place the license in a higher fee category or add a new fee category must be accompanied by the prescribed application fee for each category.
(i) Applications for licenses covering more than one fee category of special nuclear material or source material must be accompanied by the prescribed application fee for the highest fee category.
(ii) Applications for new licenses that cover both byproduct material and special nuclear material in sealed sources for use in gauging devices will pay the appropriate application fee for fee category 1.C. only.
(2)
Licensing fees.
Fees for reviews of applications for new licenses, renewals, and amendments to existing licenses, pre-application consultations and other documents submitted to the NRC for review, and project manager time for fee categories subject to full cost fees are due upon notification by the Commission in accordance with § 170.12(b).
(3)
Amendment fees.
Applications for amendments to export and import licenses must be accompanied by the prescribed amendment fee for each license affected. An application for an amendment to an export or import license or approval classified in more than one fee category must be accompanied by the prescribed amendment fee for the category affected by the amendment, unless the amendment is applicable to two or more fee categories, in which case the amendment fee for the highest fee category would apply.
(4)
Inspection fees.
Inspections resulting from investigations conducted by the Office of Investigations and nonroutine inspections that result from third-party allegations are not subject to fees. Inspection fees are due upon notification by the Commission in accordance with § 170.12(c).
(5)
Generally licensed device registrations under 10 CFR 31.5.
Submittals of registration information must be accompanied by the prescribed fee.
2
Fees will be charged for approvals issued under a specific exemption provision of the Commission's regulations under title 10 of the
Code of Federal Regulations
(e.g., 10 CFR 30.11, 40.14, 70.14, 73.5, and any other sections in effect now or in the future), regardless of whether the approval is in the form of a license amendment, letter of approval, safety evaluation report, or other form. In addition to the fee shown, an applicant may be assessed an additional fee for sealed source and device evaluations as shown in fee categories 9.A. through 9.D.
3
Full cost fees will be determined based on the professional staff time multiplied by the appropriate professional hourly rate established in § 170.20 in effect when the service is provided, and the appropriate contractual support services expended.
4
Licensees paying fees under categories 1.A., 1.B., and 1.E. are not subject to fees under categories 1.C., 1.D. and 1.F. for sealed sources authorized in the same license, except for an application that deals only with the sealed sources authorized by the license.
5
Persons who possess radium sources that are used for operational purposes in another fee category are not also subject to the fees in this category. (This exception does not apply if the radium sources are possessed for storage only.)
6
Licensees subject to fees under fee categories 1.A., 1.B., 1.E., or 2.A. must pay the largest applicable fee and are not subject to additional fees listed in this table.
7
Licensees paying fees under 3.C., 3.C.1, or 3.C.2 are not subject to fees under 2.B. for possession and shielding authorized on the same license.
8
Licensees paying fees under 7.C. are not subject to fees under 2.B. for possession and shielding authorized on the same license.
9
Licensees paying fees under 3.N. are not subject to paying fees under 3.P., 3.P.1, or 3.P.2 for calibration or leak testing services authorized on the same license.
10
Licensees paying fees under 7.B., 7.B.1, or 7.B.2 are not subject to paying fees under 7.C., 7.C.1, or 7.C.2. for broad scope licenses issued under parts 30, 35, 40, and 70 of this chapter for human use of byproduct material, source material, and/or special nuclear material, except licenses for byproduct material, source material, or special nuclear material in sealed sources contained in teletherapy devices authorized on the same license.
11
A materials license (or part of a materials license) that transitions to fee category 14.A is assessed full-cost fees under 10 CFR part 170, but is not assessed an annual fee under 10 CFR part 171. If only part of a materials license is transitioned to fee category 14.A, the licensee may be charged annual fees (and any applicable 10 CFR part 170 fees) for other activities authorized under the license that are not in decommissioning status.
12
Because the resources for import and export licensing activities are identified as a fee-relief activity to be excluded from the fee-recoverable budget, import and export licensing actions will not incur fees.
13
Licensees paying fees under 4.A., 4.B. or 4.C. are not subject to paying fees under 3.N. licenses that authorize services for other licensees authorized on the same license.

§ 171.5
Definitions.
Link to an amendment published at 89 FR 106253, Dec. 30, 2024.
Budget
means the funds appropriated by Congress for the NRC for each fiscal year, and if that appropriation is not passed on or before September 1 for that fiscal year, the funds most recently appropriated by Congress for the most recent fiscal year.
Budget authority
means the authority, in the form of an appropriation, provided by law and becoming available during the year, to enter into obligations that will result in immediate or future outlays involving Federal Government funds. The appropriation is an authorization by an Act of Congress that permits the NRC to incur obligations and to make payments out of the Treasury for specified purposes. Fees assessed pursuant to Public Law 115-439 are based on the NRC's budget authority.
Bundled unit
means multiple SMRs on a single site that are considered a single unit for the purpose of assessing an annual fee. A bundled unit is assessed an annual fee based on the cumulative licensed thermal power rating of all licensed SMRs on the same site. The maximum capacity of a bundled unit is a cumulative licensed thermal power rating of 4,500 MWt. A single SMR can be part of two bundled units if it completes the capacity of one unit and begins the capacity of an additional unit. For a given site, the use of the bundled unit concept is independent of the number of SMR plants, the number of SMR licenses issued, or the sequencing of the SMR licenses that have been issued. Bundled units with capacities greater than 2,000 MWt and less than or equal to 4,500 MWt are assessed a maximum fee that is equivalent to the annual fee paid by the current reactor fleet. Above 4,500 MWt establishes an additional bundled unit.
Byproduct material
means—
(1) Any radioactive material (except special nuclear material) yielded in, or made radioactive by, exposure to the radiation incident to the process of producing or using special nuclear material;
(2)(i) Any discrete source of radium-226 that is produced, extracted, or converted after extraction, before, on, or after August 8, 2005, for use for a commercial, medical, or research activity; or
(ii) Any material that—
(A) Has been made radioactive by use of a particle accelerator; and
(B) Is produced, extracted, or converted after extraction, before, on, or after August 8, 2005, for use for a commercial, medical, or research activity; and
(3) Any discrete source of naturally occurring radioactive material, other than source material, that—
(i) The Commission, in consultation with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Secretary of Energy, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the head of any other appropriate Federal agency, determines would pose a threat similar to the threat posed by a discrete source of radium-226 to the public health and safety or the common defense and security; and
(ii) Before, on, or after August 8, 2005, is extracted or converted after extraction for use in a commercial, medical, or research activity.
Certificate holder
means a person who holds a certificate of compliance, or other package approval issued by the Commission.
Commission
means the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission or its duly authorized representatives.
Federal fiscal year
means a year that begins on October 1 of each calendar year and ends on September 30 of the following calendar year. Federal fiscal years are identified by the year in which they end (e.g., fiscal year 1987 begins in 1986 and ends in 1987).
Government agency
means any executive department, commission, independent establishment, corporation, wholly or partly owned by the United States of America which is an instrumentality of the United States, or any board, bureau, division, service, office, officer, authority, administration, or other establishment in the executive branch of the government.
Greater Than Class C Waste
or
GTCC Waste
means low-level radioactive waste that exceeds the concentration
limits of radionuclides established for Class C waste in 10 CFR 61.55.

Maximum fee
is the highest fee paid by a single bundled unit. It is applied to all bundled units on an SMR site with a licensed thermal power rating greater than 2,000 MWt and less than or equal to 4,500 MWt and is equal to the flat annual fee paid by existing fleet power reactors.
Minimum fee
means the lowest annual fee assessed for an SMR or a bundled unit in a thermal power rating fee assessment tier.
Non-power production or utilization facility
means a production or utilization facility licensed under 10 CFR 50.21(a) or (c), or 10 CFR 50.22, as applicable, that is not a nuclear power reactor or production facility as defined under paragraphs (1) and (2) of the definition of “production facility” in 10 CFR 50.2.
Nonprofit educational institution
means a public or nonprofit educational institution whose primary function is education, whose programs are accredited by a nationally recognized accrediting agency or association, who is legally authorized to provide a program of organized instruction or study, who provides an educational program for which it awards academic degrees, and whose educational programs are available to the public.

Quality assurance program approval
is the document issued by the NRC to approve the quality assurance program submitted to the NRC as meeting the requirements of § 71.101 of this chapter. Activities covered by the quality assurance program may be divided into two major groups: those activities including design, fabrication and use of packaging and those activities for use only of packaging.
Registration holder
as used in this part means any manufacturer or initial distributor of a sealed source or device containing a sealed source that holds a certificate of registration issued by the NRC or a holder of a registration for a sealed source or device manufactured in accordance with the unique specifications of, and for use by, a single applicant.
Research reactor
means a nuclear reactor licensed by the Commission under the authority of subsection 104c of the Act and pursuant to the provisions of § 50.21(c) of this chapter for operation at a thermal power level of 10 megawatts or less, and which is not a testing facility as defined in this section.
Small modular reactor (SMR)
for the purposes of calculating fees means the class of power reactors having a licensed thermal power rating less than or equal to 1,000 MWt per module. This rating is based on the thermal power
equivalent of an SMR with an electrical power generating capacity of 300 MWe or less per module.
Small modular reactor site (SMR site)
is the geographically bounded location of one or more SMRs and a basis on which SMR fees are calculated.
Source material
means:
(1) Uranium or thorium, or any combination thereof, in any physical or chemical form; or
(2) Ores which contain by weight one-twentieth of one percent (0.05%) or more of
(i) Uranium,
(ii) Thorium, or
(iii) Any combination thereof.
Source material does not include special nuclear material.
Special nuclear material
means:
(1) Plutonium, uranium-233, uranium enriched in the isotope 233 or in the isotope 235, and any other material which the Commission, pursuant to the provisions of section 51 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, determines to be special nuclear material, but does not include source material; or
(2) Any material artificially enriched by any of the foregoing, but does not include source material.
Testing facility
means a nuclear reactor licensed by the Commission under the authority of subsection 104c of the Act and pursuant to the provisions of § 50.21(c) of this chapter for operation at:
(1) A thermal power level in excess of 10 megawatts; or
(2) A thermal power level in excess of 1 megawatt, if the reactor is to contain:
(i) A circulating loop through the core in which the applicant proposes to conduct fuel experiments; or
(ii) A liquid fuel loading; or
(iii) An experimental facility in the core in excess of 16 square inches in cross-section.
Variable fee
means an annual fee component that is added to the minimum fee. The variable fee is designed to gradually increase as licensed thermal power capacity is added within the bundled unit fee assessment tier. The variable fee is calculated as the product of the incremental increase in the thermal power rating multiplied by the variable rate.
Variable rate
means the factor used to calculate the variable fee component of the annual fee. To determine the total annual fee, the incremental increase in the licensed thermal power rating within the fee assessment tier is multiplied by the variable rate resulting in a variable fee that is added to the minimum fee. There is a different factor for each SMR or bundled unit fee assessment tier. Each factor represents the difference between the lower licensed thermal power rating within each tier and the actual thermal power rating for the unit or site.

§ 171.11
Exemptions.
(a) All requests for exemptions must be filed with the NRC within 90 days from the effective date of the final rule establishing the annual fees for which the exemption is sought in order to be considered. Absent extraordinary circumstances, any exemption requests filed beyond that date will not be considered. The filing of an exemption request does not extend the date on which the bill is payable. Only timely payment in full ensures avoidance of interest and penalty charges. If a partial or full exemption is granted, any overpayment will be refunded. Requests for clarification of or questions relating to an annual fee bill must also be filed within 90 days from the date of the initial invoice to be considered.
(b) An annual fee is not required for:
(1) A construction permit or license applied for by, or issued to, a nonprofit educational institution for a production or utilization facility, other than a power reactor, or for the possession and use of byproduct material, source material, or special nuclear material. This exemption does not apply to those byproduct, source, or special nuclear material licenses which authorize:
(i) Human use;
(ii) Remunerated services to other persons;
(iii) Distribution of byproduct material, source material, or special nuclear material or products containing byproduct material, source material, or special nuclear material; or
(iv) Activities performed under a Government contract.
(2) Federally-owned and State-owned research reactors used primarily for educational training and academic research purposes. For purposes of this exemption, the term research reactor means a nuclear reactor that—
(i) Is licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission under section 104c. of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2134(c)) for operation at a thermal power level of 10 megawatts or less; and
(ii) If so licensed for operation at a thermal power level of more than 1 megawatt, does not contain—
(A) A circulating loop through the core in which the licensee conducts fuel experiments;
(B) A liquid fuel loading; or
(C) An experimental facility in the core in excess of 16 square inches in cross-section.
(c) The Commission may, upon application by an interested person or on its own initiative, grant an exemption from the requirements of this part that it determines is authorized by law and otherwise in the public interest.
(d) An exemption for reactors licensed to operate may be granted by the Commission taking into consideration each of the following factors:
(1) Age of the reactor;
(2) Number of customers in rate base;
(3) Net increase in KWh cost for each customer directly related to the annual fee assessed under this part; and
(4) Any other relevant matter which the licensee believes justifies the reduction of the annual fee.
(e) The Commission may grant a materials licensee an exemption from the annual fee if it determines that the annual fee is not based on a fair and equitable allocation of the NRC costs. The following factors must be fulfilled as determined by the Commission for an exemption to be granted:
(1) There are data specifically indicating that the assessment of the annual fee will result in a significantly disproportionate allocation of costs to the licensee, or class of licensees; or
(2) There is clear and convincing evidence that the budgeted generic costs attributable to the class of licensees are neither directly or indirectly related to the specific class of licensee nor explicitly allocated to the licensee by Commission policy decisions; or
(3) Any other relevant matter that the licensee believes shows that the annual fee was not based on a fair and equitable allocation of NRC costs.

§ 171.13
Notice.
The annual fees applicable to any NRC licensee subject to this part and calculated in accordance with §§ 171.15 and 171.16, will be published as a notice in the
Federal Register
as soon as possible but no later than the third quarter of the fiscal year. The annual fees will become due and payable to the NRC as indicated in § 171.19. Quarterly payments of the annual fee of $100,000 or more will continue during the fiscal year and be based on the applicable annual fees as shown in §§ 171.15 and 171.16 until a notice concerning the revised amount of the fees for the fiscal year is published by the NRC. If the NRC is unable to publish a final fee rule that becomes effective during the current fiscal year, fees would be assessed based on the rates in effect for the previous fiscal year.
[64 FR 31475, June 10, 1999]
§ 171.15
Annual fees: Non-power production or utilization licenses, reactor licenses, and independent spent fuel storage licenses.

This paragraph (a) does not apply to test or research reactors exempted under § 171.11(b).
(b)(1) The FY 2024 annual fee for each operating power reactor that must be collected by September 30, 2024, is $5,336,000.
(2) The FY 2024 annual fees are comprised of a base annual fee for power reactors licensed to operate, a base spent fuel storage/reactor decommissioning annual fee and associated additional charges. The activities comprising the spent fuel storage/reactor decommissioning base annual fee are shown in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section. The activities comprising the FY 2024 base annual fee for operating power reactors are as follows:
(i) Power reactor safety and safeguards regulation except licensing and inspection activities recovered under part 170 of this chapter and generic reactor decommissioning activities.
(ii) Research activities directly related to the regulation of power reactors, except those activities specifically related to reactor decommissioning.
(iii) Generic activities required largely for NRC to regulate power reactors (e.g., updating part 50 or 52 of this
chapter, operating the Incident Response Center, new reactor regulatory infrastructure). The base annual fee for operating power reactors does not include generic activities specifically related to reactor decommissioning.
(c)(1) The FY 2024 annual fee for each power reactor holding a 10 CFR part 50 license or combined license issued under 10 CFR part 52 that is in a decommissioning or possession-only status and has spent fuel onsite, and for each independent spent fuel storage 10 CFR part 72 licensee who does not hold a 10 CFR part 50 license or a 10 CFR part 52 combined license, is $326,000.
(2) The FY 2024 annual fee is comprised of a base spent fuel storage/reactor decommissioning annual fee (which is also included in the operating power reactor annual fee shown in paragraph (b) of this section). The activities comprising the FY 2024 spent fuel storage/reactor decommissioning rebaselined annual fee are:
(i) Generic and other research activities directly related to reactor decommissioning and spent fuel storage; and
(ii) Other safety, environmental, and safeguards activities related to reactor decommissioning and spent fuel storage, except costs for licensing and inspection activities that are recovered under part 170 of this chapter.
(d)(1) Each person holding an operating license for an SMR issued under 10 CFR part 50 or a combined license issued under 10 CFR part 52 that has provided notification to the NRC of the successful completion startup testing, shall pay the annual fee for all licenses held for an SMR site. The annual fee will be determined using the cumulative licensed thermal power rating of all SMR units and the bundled unit concept, during the fiscal year in which the fee is due. For a given site, the use of the bundled unit concept is independent of the number of SMR plants, the number of SMR licenses issued, or the sequencing of the SMR licenses that have been issued.
(2) The annual fees for a small modular reactor(s) located on a single site to be collected by September 30 of each year, are as follows:

§ 171.16
Annual fees: Materials licensees, holders of certificates of compliance, holders of sealed source and device registrations, holders of quality assurance program approvals, and government agencies licensed by the NRC.
(a)(1) The provisions of this section apply to person(s) who are authorized to conduct activities under—
(i) 10 CFR part 30 for byproduct material;
(ii) 10 CFR part 40 for source material;
(iii) 10 CFR part 70 for special nuclear material;
(iv) 10 CFR part 71 for packaging and transportation of radioactive material; and
(v) 10 CFR part 76 for uranium enrichment.
(2) Notwithstanding the other provisions in this section, the regulations in this part do not apply to uranium recovery and fuel facility licensees until after the Commission verifies through inspection that the facility has been constructed in accordance with the requirements of the license.
(3) In accordance with § 171.17, each person identified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall pay the applicable annual fee for each license the person holds during the FY. Annual fees will be prorated for new licenses issued and for licenses for which termination is requested and activities permanently ceased during the FY as provided in § 171.17. If a single license authorizes more than one activity (e.g., human use and irradiator activities), annual fees will be assessed for each fee category applicable to the license. If a person holds more than one license, the total annual fee assessed will be the cumulative total of the annual fees applicable to each license held.
(b) The FY 2024 annual fee is comprised of a base annual fee and associated additional charges. The base FY 2024 annual fee is the sum of budgeted costs for the following activities:
(1) Generic and other research activities directly related to the regulation of materials licenses as defined in this part; and
(2) Other safety, environmental, and safeguards activities for materials licenses, except costs for licensing and inspection activities that are recovered under Part 170 of this chapter.
(c) A licensee who is required to pay an annual fee under this section, in addition to 10 CFR part 72 licenses, may qualify as a small entity. If a licensee qualifies as a small entity and provides the Commission with the proper certification along with its annual fee payment, the licensee may pay reduced annual fees as shown in table 1 to this paragraph (c). Failure to file a small entity certification in a timely manner could result in the receipt of a delinquent invoice requesting the outstanding balance due and/or denial of any refund that might otherwise be due.

Annual fees will be assessed based on whether a licensee held a valid license with the NRC authorizing possession and use of radioactive material during the current FY. The annual fee is waived for those materials licenses and holders of certificates, registrations, and approvals who either filed for termination of their licenses or approvals or filed for possession only/storage licenses before October 1 of the current FY, and permanently ceased licensed activities entirely before this date. Annual fees for licensees who filed for termination of a license, downgrade of a license, or for a possession-only license during the FY and for new licenses issued during the FY will be prorated in accordance with the provisions of § 171.17. If a person holds more than one license, certificate, registration, or approval, the annual fee(s) will be assessed for each license, certificate, registration, or approval held by that person. For licenses that authorize more than one activity on a single license (e.g., human use and irradiator activities), annual fees will be assessed for each category applicable to the license.
2
Payment of the prescribed annual fee does not automatically renew the license, certificate, registration, or approval for which the fee is paid. Renewal applications must be filed in accordance with the requirements of parts 30, 40, 70, 71, 72, or 76 of this chapter.
3
Each FY, fees for these materials licenses will be calculated and assessed in accordance with § 171.13 and will be published in the
Federal Register
for notice and comment.
4
Other facilities include licenses for extraction of metals, heavy metals, and rare earths.
5
There are no existing NRC licenses in these fee categories. If NRC issues a license for these categories, the Commission will consider establishing an annual fee for this type of license.
6
Standardized spent fuel facilities, 10 CFR parts 71 and 72 Certificates of Compliance and related Quality Assurance program approvals, and special reviews, such as topical reports, are not assessed an annual fee because the generic costs of regulating these activities are primarily attributable to users of the designs, certificates, and topical reports.

Licensees in this category are not assessed an annual fee because they are charged an annual fee in other categories while they are licensed to operate.
8
No annual fee is charged because it is not practical to administer due to the relatively short life or temporary nature of the license.
9
Separate annual fees will not be assessed for pacemaker licenses issued to medical institutions that also hold nuclear medicine licenses under fee categories 7.A, 7.A.1, 7.A.2, 7.B., 7.B.1, 7.B.2, 7.C, 7.C.1, or 7.C.2.
10
This includes Certificates of Compliance issued to the DOE that are not funded from the Nuclear Waste Fund.
11
See § 171.15(c).
12
See § 171.15(c).
13
No annual fee is charged for this category because the cost of the general license registration program applicable to licenses in this category will be recovered through 10 CFR part 170 fees.
14
Persons who possess radium sources that are used for operational purposes in another fee category are not also subject to the fees in this category. (This exception does not apply if the radium sources are possessed for storage only.)
15
Licensees subject to fees under categories 1.A., 1.B., 1.E., 2.A., and licensees paying fees under fee category 17 must pay the largest applicable fee and are not subject to additional fees listed in this table.
16
Licensees paying fees under 3.C. are not subject to fees under 2.B. for possession and shielding authorized on the same license.
17
Licensees paying fees under 7.A, 7.A.1, 7.A.2, 7.B, 7.B.1, 7.B.2, 7.C, 7.C.1, or 7.C.2 are not subject to fees under 2.B. for possession and shielding authorized on the same license.
18
Licensees paying fees under 3.N. are not subject to paying fees under 3.P., 3.P.1, or 3.P.2 for calibration or leak testing services authorized on the same license.
19
Licensees paying fees under 7.B., 7.B.1, or 7.B.2 are not subject to paying fees under 7.C., 7.C.1, or 7.C.2 for broad scope license licenses issued under parts 30, 35, 40, and 70 of this chapter for human use of byproduct material, source material, and/or special nuclear material, except licenses for byproduct material, source material, or special nuclear material in sealed sources contained in teletherapy devices authorized on the same license.
20
No annual fee is charged for a materials license (or part of a materials license) that has transitioned to this fee category because the decommissioning costs will be recovered through 10 CFR part 170 fees, but annual fees may be charged for other activities authorized under the license that are not in decommissioning status.
21
Licensees paying fees under 4.A., 4.B. or 4.C. are not subject to paying fees under 3.N. licenses that authorize services for other licensees authorized on the same license.

§ 171.17
Proration.
Annual fees will be prorated for NRC licensees as follows:
(a) Reactors, 10 CFR part 72 licensees who do not hold 10 CFR part 50 or 10 CFR part 52 licenses, and materials licenses with annual fees of $100,000 or greater for a single fee category. The NRC will base the proration of annual fees for terminated and downgraded licenses on the fee rule in effect at the time the action is official. The NRC will base the determinations on the proration requirements under paragraphs (a)(2) and (3) of this section.
(1)
New licenses.
(i) The annual fees for new licenses for power reactors and small modular reactors that are subject to fees under this part, for which the licensee has notified the NRC on or after October 1 of a fiscal year (FY) that the licensee has successfully completed power ascension testing, are prorated on the basis of the number of days remaining in the FY. Thereafter, the full annual fee is due and payable each subsequent FY.
(ii) The annual fees for new licenses for non-power production or utilization facilities, 10 CFR part 72 licensees who do not hold 10 CFR part 50 or 52 licenses, and materials licenses with annual fees of $100,000 or greater for a single fee category for the current FY, that are subject to fees under this part and are granted a license to operate on or after October 1 of a FY, are prorated on the basis of the number of days remaining in the FY. Thereafter, the full annual fee is due and payable each subsequent FY.
(2)
Terminations.
The base operating power reactor annual fee for operating reactor licensees or the annual fee for small modular reactor licensees, who have requested amendment to withdraw operating authority permanently during the FY will be prorated based on the number of days during the FY the license was in effect before docketing of the certifications for permanent cessation of operations and permanent removal of fuel from the reactor vessel or when a final legally effective order to permanently cease operations has come into effect. The spent fuel storage/reactor decommissioning annual fee for reactor licensees who permanently cease operations and have permanently removed fuel from the site during the FY will be prorated on the basis of the number of days remaining in the FY after docketing of both the certifications of permanent cessation of operations and permanent removal of fuel from the site. The spent fuel storage/reactor decommissioning annual fee will be prorated for those 10 CFR part 72 licensees who do not hold a 10 CFR part 50 or 52 license who request termination of the 10 CFR part 72 license and permanently cease activities authorized by the license during the FY based on the number of days the license was in effect before receipt of the termination request. The annual fee for materials licenses with annual fees of $100,000 or greater for a single fee category for the current FY will be prorated based on the number of days remaining in the FY when a termination request or a request for a possession-only license is received by the NRC, provided the licensee permanently ceased licensed activities during the specified period. The annual fee for non-power production or utilization facilities will be prorated based on the number of days remaining in the FY when the authorization to operate the facility has been permanently removed from the license during the FY.
(3)
Downgraded licenses.
The annual fee for a materials license with an annual fee of $100,000 or greater for a single fee category for the current FY, that is subject to fees under this part and downgraded on or after October 1 of a FY, is automatically prorated by the agency on the basis of the number of days remaining in the FY when the application for downgrade is received and approved by the NRC, provided the licensee permanently ceased the stated activities during the specified period.
(b) Materials licenses (excluding 10 CFR part 72 licenses and materials license with annual fees of $100,000 or greater for a single fee category, included in § 171.17(a)).
(1)
New licenses.
The annual fee for a materials license that is subject to fees under this part and issued on or after October 1 of the FY is prorated on the basis of when the NRC issues the new license. New licenses issued during the period October 1 through March 31 of the FY will be assessed one-half the annual fee for that FY. New licenses issued on or after April 1 of the FY will not be assessed an annual fee for that FY. Thereafter, the full fee is due and payable each subsequent FY.
(2)
Terminations.
The annual fee will be prorated for licenses for which a termination request or a request for a POL has been received on or after October 1 of a FY on the basis of when the application for termination or POL is received by the NRC provided the licensee permanently ceased licensed activities during the specified period. Licenses for which applications for termination or POL are filed during the period October 1 through March 31 of the FY are assessed one-half the annual fee for the applicable category(ies) for that FY. Licenses for which applications for termination or POL are filed on or after April 1 of the FY are assessed the full annual fee for that FY. Materials licenses transferred to a new Agreement State during the FY are considered terminated by the NRC, for annual fee purposes, on the
date that the Agreement with the State becomes effective; therefore, the same proration provisions will apply as if the licenses were terminated.
(3)
Downgraded licenses.
(i) The annual fee for a materials license that is subject to fees under this part and downgraded on or after October 1 of a FY is automatically prorated on the basis of the date when the application for downgrade is received and approved by the NRC, provided the licensee permanently ceased the stated activities during the specified period.
(ii) Annual fees for licenses for which applications to downgrade are filed during the period October 1 through March 31 of the FY will be prorated as follows:
(A) Licenses for which applications have been filed to reduce the scope of the license from a higher fee category(ies) to a lower fee category(ies) will be assessed one-half the annual fee for the higher fee category and one-half the annual fee for the lower fee category(ies), and, if applicable, the full annual fee for fee categories not affected by the downgrade; and
(B) Licenses with multiple fee categories for which applications have been filed to downgrade by deleting a fee category will be assessed one-half the annual fee for the fee category being deleted and the full annual fee for the remaining categories.
(iii) Licenses for which applications to downgrade are filed on or after April 1 of the FY are assessed the full fee for that FY.
[72 FR 31431, June 6, 2007, as amended at 77 FR 35835, June 15, 2012; 83 FR 29657, June 25, 2018; 85 FR 37277, June 19, 2020; 86 FR 32183, June 16, 2021]
§ 171.19
Payment.
(a)
Method of payment.
All annual fee payments under this part are to be made payable to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The payments are to be made in U.S. funds using the electronic payment methods accepted at
www.Pay.gov.
Federal agencies may also make payment by IntraGovernmental Payment and Collection (IPAC). Specific instructions for making payments may be obtained by contacting the Office of the Chief Financial Officer at 301-415-7554. In accordance with Department of the Treasury requirements, refunds will only be made upon receipt of information on the payee's financial institution and bank accounts.
(b) Annual fees in the amount of $100,000 or more and described in the
Federal Register
document issued under § 171.13, must be paid in quarterly installments of 25 percent as billed by the NRC. The quarters begin on October 1, January 1, April 1, and July 1 of each fiscal year. The NRC will adjust the fourth quarterly invoice to recover the full amount of the revised annual fee. If the amounts collected in the first three quarters exceed the amount of the revised annual fee, the overpayment will be refunded. Licensees whose annual fee for the previous fiscal year was less than $100,000 (billed on the anniversary date of the license), and whose revised annual fee for the current fiscal year is $100,000 or greater (subject to quarterly billing), will be issued a bill upon publication of the final rule for the full amount of the revised annual fee for the current fiscal year, less any payments received for the current fiscal year based on the anniversary date billing process.
(c) Annual fees that are less than $100,000 are billed on the anniversary date of the license. For annual fee purposes, the anniversary date of the license is considered to be the first day of the month in which the original license was issued by the NRC. Licensees that are billed on the license anniversary date will be assessed the annual fee in effect on the anniversary date of the license. Materials licenses subject to the annual fee that are terminated during the fiscal year but before the anniversary month of the license will be billed upon termination for the fee in effect at the time of the billing. New materials licenses subject to the annual fee will be billed in the month the license is issued or in the next available monthly billing for the fee in effect on the anniversary date of the license. Thereafter, annual fees for new licenses will be assessed in the anniversary month of the license.
(d) Annual fees of less than $100,000 must be paid as billed by the NRC. Materials license annual fees that are less
than $100,000 are billed on the anniversary date of the license. The materials licensees that are billed on the anniversary date of the license are those covered by fee categories 1.C., 1.D., 1.F., and 2.A.(2) through 9.D.
(e) Payment is due on the invoice date and interest accrues from the date of the invoice. However, interest will be waived if payment is received within 30 days from the invoice date.
(f) The NRC is entitled to collect any underpayment of fees as a result of an error by the NRC.
[65 FR 36968, June 12, 2000, as amended at 66 FR 32478, June 14, 2001; 71 FR 30755, May 30, 2006; 71 FR 33190, June 8, 2006; 72 FR 31432, June 6, 2007; 78 FR 39491, July 1, 2013; 79 FR 37154, June 30, 2014; 82 FR 30708, June 30, 2017; 89 FR 51822, June 20, 2024]
§ 171.21
[Reserved]
§ 171.23
Enforcement.
If any person required to pay the annual fee fails to pay when the fee is due, or files a false certification with respect to qualifying as a small entity under the Regulatory Flexibility Criteria, the Commission may refuse to process any application submitted by or on behalf of the person with respect to any license issued to the person and may suspend or revoke any licenses held by the person. The filing of a false certification to qualify as a small entity under § 171.16(c) of this part may also result in punitive action pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 1001.
[56 FR 31510, July 10, 1991]
§ 171.25
Collection, interest, penalties, and administrative costs.
All annual fees in §§ 171.15 and 171.16 will be collected pursuant to the procedures of 10 CFR part 15. Interest, penalties and administrative costs for late payments will be assessed in accordance with 10 CFR part 15, of this chapter, 4 CFR part 102, and other relevant regulations of the United States Government, as appropriate. In the event a quarterly installment is not made by the appropriate due date specified in § 171.19, the full fee becomes due and payable, with interest, penalties, and administrative costs of collection calculated from the date that quarterly installment was due.
[56 FR 31511, July 10, 1991]
§ 171.26
Right to dispute assessed fees.
All debtors' disputes of fees assessed must be submitted in accordance with 10 CFR 15.31.
