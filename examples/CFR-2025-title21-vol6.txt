# Explanation
The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
Title 1 through Title 16
as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27
as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41
as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50
as of October 1
The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.

# LEGAL STATUS
The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

# HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, April 1, 2025), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

# EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.

# OMB CONTROL NUMBERS
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request.
Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.

# PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.

# “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.

# INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
What is incorporation by reference?
Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
What is a proper incorporation by reference?
The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
(b) The matter incorporated is adequately summarized in the preamble of the final rule and is available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?
If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or email fr.inspection@nara.gov.

# CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES
A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR
Index and Finding Aids.
This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.
An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

# REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

§ 500.23
Thermally processed low-acid foods packaged in hermetically sealed containers.
Except as provided in § 507.5(b) of this chapter, the provisions of parts 507 and 113 of this chapter apply to the manufacturing, processing, or packing of low-acid foods in hermetically sealed containers, and intended for use as food for animals.
[80 FR 56337, Sept. 17, 2015]
§ 500.24
Emergency permit control.
The provisions of part 108 of this chapter shall apply to the issuance of emergency control permits for the manufacturer or packer of thermally processed low-acid foods packaged in hermetically sealed containers, and intended for use as food for animals.
[61 FR 37681, July 19, 1996]
§ 500.25
Anthelmintic drugs for use in animals.
(a) The Commissioner of Food and Drugs has determined that, in order to assure that anthelmintic drugs, including animal feeds bearing or containing such drugs, which do not carry the prescription statement are labeled to provide adequate directions for their effective use, labeling of these anthelmintic drugs shall bear, in addition to other required information, a statement that a veterinarian should be consulted for
assistance in the diagnosis, treatment, and control of parasitism.
(b) The label and any labeling furnishing or purporting to furnish directions for use, shall bear conspicuously the following statement: “Consult your veterinarian for assistance in the diagnosis, treatment, and control of parasitism.”
(c) For drugs covered by approved new animal drug applications, the labeling revisions required for compliance with this section may be placed into effect without prior approval, as provided for in § 514.8(c)(3) of this chapter. For drugs listed in the index, the labeling revisions required for compliance with this section may be placed into effect without prior granting of a request for a modification, as provided for in § 516.161(b)(1) of this chapter.
(d) Labeling revisions required for compliance with this section shall be placed into effect by February 25, 1975, following which, any such drugs that are introduced into interstate commerce and not in compliance with this section will be subject to regulatory proceedings.
[40 FR 13802, Mar. 27, 1975, as amended at 71 FR 74782, Dec. 13, 2006; 72 FR 69120, Dec. 6, 2007]
§ 500.26
Timed-release dosage form drugs.
(a) Drugs are being offered in dosage forms that are designed to release the active ingredients over a prolonged period of time. There is a possibility of unsafe overdosage or ineffective dosage if such products are improperly made and the active ingredients are released at one time, over too short or too long a period of time, or not released at all. Drugs marketed in this form, which are referred to by such terms as timed-release, controlled-release, prolonged-release, sustained-release, or delayed-release drugs, are regarded as new animal drugs within the meaning of section 201(v) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
(b) Timed-release dosage form animal drugs that are introduced into interstate commerce are deemed to be adulterated within the meaning of section 501(a)(5) of the act and subject to regulatory action, unless such animal drug is the subject of an approved new animal drug application, or listed in the index, as required by paragraph (a) of this section.
(c) The fact that the labeling of this kind of drug may claim delayed, prolonged, controlled, or sustained-release of all or only some of the active ingredients does not affect the new animal drug status of such articles. A new animal drug application or index listing is required in any such case.
(d) New animal drug applications for timed-release dosage form animal drugs must contain, among other things, data to demonstrate safety and effectiveness by establishing that the article is manufactured using procedures and controls to ensure release of the total dosage at a safe and effective rate. Data submitted in the new animal drug application must demonstrate that the formulation of the drug and the procedures used in its manufacture will ensure release of the active ingredient(s) of the drug at a safe and effective rate and that these release characteristics will be maintained until the expiration date of the drug. When the drug is intended for use in food-producing animals, data submitted must also demonstrate that, with respect to possible residues of the drug, food derived from treated animals is safe for consumption.
[42 FR 8635, Feb. 11, 1977, as amended at 60 FR 38480, July 27, 1995; 72 FR 69120, Dec. 6, 2007]
§ 500.27
Methylene blue-containing drugs for use in animals.
(a) New information requires a re- evaluation of the status of drugs containing methylene blue (tetramethylthionine chloride) for oral use in cats or dogs.
(1)(i) It has been demonstrated that two orally administered urinary antiseptic-antispasmodic preparations that contained methylene blue cause Heinz body hemolytic anemia in cats when used according to label directions. The specific cause of the reaction was determined to be the methylene blue contained in the preparations. The reaction can be severe enough to cause death of treated animals.
(ii) The Heinz body hemolytic anemia reaction to methylene blue has also
been demonstrated in dogs under laboratory conditions. The precise mechanism by which methylene blue produces the characteristic erythrocytic inclusion bodies (Heinz bodies) and associated hemolytic anemia is unclear.
(2) The effectiveness of orally administered methylene blue as a urinary antiseptic is open to question. It appears that following oral administration, methylene blue is poorly and erratically absorbed and also slowly and erratically excreted in the urine. Studies in the dog indicate it is excreted in the urine essentially as leukomethylene blue stabilized in some manner. Methylene blue itself is stepwise demethylated in alkaline solutions (alkaline urine being a frequent consequence of urinary infection) to Azure B, Azure A, and Azure C. The antiseptic efficacy of all of these excretion products is unsubstantiated.
(3) In view of the foregoing, the Commissioner has concluded that animal drugs containing methylene blue for oral use in cats or dogs are neither safe nor generally recognized as effective within the meaning of section 201(v) of the act and are therefore considered new animal drugs. Accordingly, all prior formal and informal opinions expressed by the Food and Drug Administration that such drugs are “not new drugs” or “no longer new drugs” are hereby revoked.
(b) Animal drugs that contain methylene blue for oral use in cats or dogs and not the subject of an approved new animal drug application (NADA) are deemed to be adulterated under the provisions of section 501(a) (5) and/or (6) and/or misbranded under section 502(a) of the act and subject to regulatory action as of April 10, 1978.
(c) Sponsors of animal drugs that contain methylene blue for oral use in cats or dogs and not the subject of an approved new animal drug application (NADA) may submit an application in conformity with § 514.1 of this chapter. Such applications will be processed in accordance with section 512 of the act. Submission of an NADA will not constitute grounds for continued marketing of this drug substance until such application is approved.
(d) New animal drug applications required by this regulation pursuant to section 512 of the act shall be submitted to the Food and Drug Administration. Center for Veterinary Medicine, Office of New Animal Drug Evaluation (HFV-100), 7500 Standish Pl., Rockville, MD 20855.
[43 FR 9803, Mar. 10, 1978; 43 FR 12310, Mar. 24, 1978, as amended at 54 FR 18279, Apr. 28, 1989; 57 FR 6475, Feb. 25, 1992; 60 FR 38480, July 27, 1995]
§ 500.29
Gentian violet for use in animal feed.
The Food and Drug Administration has determined that gentian violet is not generally recognized as safe for use in animal feed and is a food additive subject to section 409 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act), unless it is intended for use as a new animal drug, in which case it is subject to section 512 of the act. The Food and Drug Administration has determined that gentian violet is not prior sanctioned for any use in animal feed.
[56 FR 40506, Aug. 15, 1991]
§ 500.30
Gentian violet for animal drug use.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has determined that gentian violet is not generally recognized as safe and effective for any veterinary drug use in food animals and is a new animal drug subject to section 512 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. FDA has determined that gentian violet is not exempted from new animal drug status under the “grandfather” provisions of the Drug Amendments of 1962 (21 U.S.C. 342).
[56 FR 40507, Aug. 15, 1991]
§ 500.45
Use of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB's) in the production, handling, and storage of animal feed.
(a) Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB's) represent a class of toxic industrial chemicals manufactured and sold under a variety of trade names, including: Aroclor (United States); Phenoclor (France); Colphen (Germany); and Kanaclor (Japan). PCB's are highly stable, heat resistant, and nonflammable chemicals. Industrial uses of PCB's include, or did include in the past, their
use as electrical transformer and capacitor fluids, heat transfer fluids, hydraulic fluids, plasticizers, and in formulations of lubricants, coatings, and inks. Their unique physical and chemical properties and widespread, uncontrolled industrial applications have caused PCB's to be a persistent and ubiquitous contaminant in the environment, causing the contamination of certain foods. In addition, incidents have occurred in which PCB's have directly contaminated animal feeds as a result of industrial accidents (leakage or spillage of PCB fluids from plant equipment). These accidents in turn cause the contamination of food intended for human consumption (meat, milk, and eggs). Investigations by the Food and Drug Administration have revealed that heat exchange fluids for certain pasteurization equipment used in processing animal feed contain PCB's. Although heat exchange fluids in such equipment are considered to be in
closed systems,
leakage has occurred that resulted in direct contamination of animal feed with PCB's and subsequently resulted in the transfer of PCB's to human food produced by animals consuming the contaminated feed. The use of PCB-containing coatings on the inner walls of silos has resulted in the contamination of silage which has in turn caused PCB residues in the milk of dairy cows consuming the contaminated silage. Since PCB's are toxic chemicals, the PCB contamination of food as a result of these and other incidents represent a hazard to public health. It is therefore necessary to place certain restrictions on the industrial uses of PCB's in the production, handling, and storage of animal feed.
(b) The following special provisions are necessary to preclude accidental PCB contamination of animal feed:
(1) Coatings or paints for use on the contact surfaces of feed storage areas may not contain PCB's or any other harmful or deleterious substances likely to contaminate feed.
(2) New equipment or machinery for handling or processing feed in or around an establishment producing animal feed shall not contain PCB's.
(3) On or before Sept. 4, 1973, the management of establishments producing animal feed shall:
(i) Have the heat exchange fluid used in existing equipment or machinery for handling and processing feed sampled and tested to determine whether it contains PCB's, or verify the absence of PCB's in such formulations by other appropriate means. On or before Sept. 4, 1973, any such fluid formulated with PCB's must to the fullest extent possible commensurate with current good manufacturing practices, be replaced with a heat exchange fluid that does not contain PCB's.
(ii) Eliminate to the fullest extent possible commensurate with current good manufacturing practices from the animal feed producing establishment any PCB-containing lubricants for equipment or machinery used for handling or processing animal feed.
(iii) Eliminate to the fullest extent possible commensurate with current good manufacturing practices from the animal feed producing establishment any other PCB-containing materials, whenever there is a reasonable expectation that such materials could cause animal feed to become contaminated with PCB's either as a result of normal use or as a result of accident, breakage, or other mishap.
(iv) The toxicity and other characteristics of fluids selected as PCB replacements must be adequately determined so that the least potentially hazardous replacement should be used. In making this determination with respect to a given fluid, consideration should be given to (
a
) its toxicity; (
b
) the maximum quantity that could be spilled onto a given quantity of food before it would be noticed, taking into account its color and odor; (
c
) possible signaling devices in the equipment to indicate a loss of fluid, etc.; (
d
) and its environmental stability and tendency to survive and be concentrated through the food chain. The judgment as to whether a replacement fluid is sufficiently non-hazardous is to be made on an individual installation and operation basis.
(c) For the purpose of this section, the provisions do not apply to electrical transformers and condensers containing PCB's in sealed containers.
(d) For the purpose of this section, the term
animal feed
includes all articles used for food or drink for animals other than man.
§ 500.46
Hexachlorophene in animal drugs.
(a) The Commissioner of Food and Drugs has determined that there are no adequate data to establish that animal drugs containing hexachlorophene are safe and effective for any animal use other than in topical products for use on non-food-producing animals as part of a product preservative system at a level not to exceed 0.1 percent; that there is no information on the potential risk to humans from exposure to hexachlorophene by persons who apply animal products containing the drug at levels higher than 0.1 percent; and that there is likewise no information on human exposure to animals on which these animal drugs have been used and no information on possible residues of hexachlorophene in edible products of food-producing animals treated with new animal drugs that contain any quantity of hexachlorophene.
(b) Animal drugs containing hexachlorophene for other than preservative use on non-food-producing animals at levels not exceeding 0.1 percent are considered new animal drugs and shall be the subject of new animal drug applications (NADA's).
(c) Any person currently marketing animal drugs that contain hexachlorophene other than as part of a product preservative system for products used on non-food-producing animals at a level not exceeding 0.1 percent shall submit a new animal drug application, supplement an existing application, or reformulate the product by September 29, 1977. Each application or supplemental application shall include adequate data to establish that the animal drug is safe and effective. If the animal drug is currently subject to an approved new animal drug application, each reformulation shall require an approved supplemental application. The interim marketing of these animal drugs may continue until the application has been approved, until it has been determined that the application is not approvable under the provisions of § 514.111 of this chapter, or until an existing approved application has been withdrawn.
(d) After September 29, 1977, animal drugs that contain hexachlorophene other than for preservative use on non-food-producing animals at a level not exceeding 0.1 percent that are introduced into interstate commerce shall be deemed to be adulterated within the meaning of section 501(a)(5) of the act (21 U.S.C. 351(a)(5)) unless such animal drug is the subject of a new animal drug application submitted pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section. Action to withdraw approval of new animal drug applications will be initiated if supplemental new animal drug applications have not been submitted in accordance with this section.
(e) New animal drug applications submitted for animal drugs containing hexachlorophene for use in or on food-producing animals shall include adequate data to assure that edible products from treated animals are safe for human consumption under the labeled conditions of use.

§ 500.50
Propylene glycol in or on cat food.
The Food and Drug Administration has determined that propylene glycol in or on cat food is not generally recognized as safe and is a food additive subject to section 409 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act). The Food and Drug Administration also has determined that this use of propylene glycol is not prior sanctioned.

# Subpart C—Animal Drug Labeling Requirements
§ 500.51
Labeling of animal drugs; misbranding.
(a) Among the representations on the label or labeling of an animal drug which will render the drug misbranded are any broad statements suggesting or implying that the drug is not safe and effective for use when used in accordance with labeling direction, or suggesting or implying that the labeling does not contain adequate warnings or
adequate directions for use. Such statements include, but are not limited to:
(1) Any statement that disclaims liability when the drug is used in accordance with directions for use contained on the label or labeling.
(2) Any statement that disclaims liability when the drug is used under “abnormal” or “unforeseeable” conditions.
(3) Any statement limiting the warranty for the products to a warranty that the drug in the package contains the ingredients listed on the label.
(b) This regulation is not intended to prohibit any liability disclaimer that purports to limit the amount of damages or that sets forth the legal theory under which damages are to be recovered.
(c) Any person wishing to obtain an evaluation of an animal drug liability disclaimer under this regulation may submit it to Division of Compliance, (HFV-230), Center for Veterinary Medicine, Food and Drug Administration, 7500 Standish Pl., Rockville, MD 20855. A supplemental NADA providing appropriately revised labeling shall be submitted for any approved new animal drug the labeling of which is not in compliance with this regulation.
[41 FR 8473, Feb. 27, 1976, as amended at 54 FR 18279, Apr. 28, 1989; 57 FR 6475, Feb. 25, 1992]
§ 500.52
Use of terms such as “tonic”, “tone”, “toner”, or “conditioner” in the labeling of preparations intended for use in or on animals.
(a) The use of terms such as
tonic, tone, toner,
and similar terms in the labeling of a product intended for use in or on animals implies that such product is capable of a therapeutic effect(s) and causes such a product to be a drug within the meaning of section 201(g) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The unqualified use of such terms in a product's labeling fails to provide adequate directions and indications for use of such product and causes it to be misbranded within the meaning of section 502(a) and (f)(1) of the act. The terms
tonic, tone, toner,
and similar terms may be used in labeling only when appropriately qualified so as to fully inform the user regarding the intended use(s) of the product.
(b) The unqualified use of the term
conditioner
and similar terms in the labeling of a product intended for use in or on animals implies that such product is capable of a therapeutic effect(s) and causes such a product to be a drug within the meaning of section 201(g) of the act. The unqualified use of such terms in a product's labeling fails to provide adequate directions and indications for use of such product and causes it to be misbranded within the meaning of section 502(a) and (f)(1) of the act. The term
conditioner
and similar terms may be used in labeling only when appropriately qualified so as to fully inform the user regarding the intended use(s) of the product. A product labeled as a “conditioner” or with a similar term can be either a food or drug depending upon the manner in which the term is qualified in the labeling to reflect the product's intended use.
(c) An article so qualified as to be represented as a drug must be the subject of an approved new animal drug application unless the use of the article under the conditions set forth in its labeling is generally recognized as safe and effective among experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of animal drugs.
§ 500.55
Exemption from certain drug-labeling requirements.
(a) Section 201.105(c) of this chapter provides that in the case of certain drugs for which directions, hazards, warnings, and use information are commonly known to practitioners licensed by law, such information may be omitted from the dispensing package. Under this proviso, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs will offer an opinion, upon written request, stating reasonable grounds therefore on a proposal to omit such information from the dispensing package.
(b) The Commissioner of Food and Drugs has considered submitted material covering a number of drug products and has offered the opinion that the following drugs when intended for those veterinary uses for which they are now generally employed by the veterinary medical profession, should be exempt from the requirements of
§ 201.105(c) of this chapter, provided that they meet the conditions prescribed in this paragraph. Preparations that are not in dosage unit form (for example, solutions) will be regarded as meeting the conditions with respect to the maximum quantity of drug per dosage unit if they are prepared in a manner that enables accurate and ready administration of a quantity of drug not in excess of the stated maximum per dosage unit:
Atropine sulfate.
As an injectable for cattle, goats, horses, pigs, and sheep, not in excess of 15 milligrams per dosage unit; as an injectable for cats and dogs, not in excess of 0.6 milligram per dosage unit.
Barbital sodium.
For oral use in cats and dogs, not in excess of 300 milligrams per dosage unit.
Epinephrine injection. 1:1,000.
For cats, dogs, cattle, goats, horses, pigs, and sheep (except as provided in § 500.65).
Morphine sulfate.
As an injectable for dogs, not in excess of 15 milligrams per dosage unit.
Pentobarbital sodium.
For oral use in cats and dogs, not in excess of 100 milligrams per dosage unit.
Phenobarbital sodium.
For oral use in cats and dogs, not in excess of 100 milligrams per dosage unit.
Procaine hydrochloride injection.
Containing not in excess of 2 percent procaine hydrochloride, with or without epinephrine up to a concentration of 1:50,000. For use in cats, dogs, cattle, goats, horses, pigs, and sheep.
Thyroid.
For oral use in dogs, not in excess of 60 milligrams per dosage unit.

# Subpart D—Requirements for Specific Animal Drugs
§ 500.65
Epinephrine injection 1:1,000 in 10-milliliter containers for emergency treatment of anaphylactoid shock in cattle, horses, sheep, and swine.
(a) Anaphylactoid reactions in cattle, horses, sheep, and swine occur occasionally from the injection of antibiotics, bacterins, and vaccines. Adequate directions for use of these antibiotics, bacterins, and vaccines can generally be written for use by the laity and thus are available to livestock producers. Epinephrine injection is effective for the treatment of anaphylactoid reactions in animals and would be of value in saving lives of animals if it were readily available at the time of administration of the causative agents. In connection with this problem the Food and Drug Administration has obtained the views of the Advisory Committee on Veterinary Medicine, and other experts, and has concluded that adequate directions for over-the-counter sale of epinephrine injection 1:1,000 can be prepared.
(b) In view of the above, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs has concluded that it is in the public interest to make epinephrine injection 1:1,000 available for sale without a prescription provided that it is packaged in vials not exceeding 10 milliliters and its label bears, in addition to other required information, the following statements in a prominent and conspicuous manner: “For emergency use only in treating anaphylactoid shock. Usual Dosage: Cattle, horses, sheep, and swine—1 cubic centimeter per 100 pounds of body weight. Inject subcutaneously”.
(c) The labeling must also bear a description of the symptoms of anaphylactoid shock including glassy eyes, increased salivation, grinding of the teeth, rapid breathing, muscular tremors, staggering gait, and collapse with death following. These symptoms may appear shortly after injection of a bacterin, vaccine, or antibiotic.

# Subpart E—Regulation of Carcinogenic Compounds Used in Food-Producing Animals

# Source:
52 FR 49586, Dec. 31, 1987, unless otherwise noted.
§ 500.80
Scope of this subpart.
(a) The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act requires that sponsored compounds intended for use in food-producing animals be shown to be safe and that food produced from animals exposed to these compounds be shown to be safe for consumption by people. The statute prohibits the use in food-producing animals of any compound found to induce cancer when ingested by people or animals unless it can be determined by methods of examination prescribed or approved by the Secretary (a function delegated to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs) that no residue of that compound will be found in the food produced from those animals
under conditions of use reasonably certain to be followed in practice. This subpart identifies the steps a sponsor of a compound shall follow to secure the approval of the compound. The requirements of this subpart shall also apply to a request for an import tolerance under § 510.205 of this chapter. FDA guidance documents contain the procedures and protocols FDA recommends for the implementation of this subpart. These guidance documents are available from the Dockets Management Staff (HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration, 5630 Fishers Lane, rm. 1061, Rockville, MD 20852. Requests for these guidance documents should be identified with Docket No. 1983D-0288.
(b) If FDA concludes on the basis of the threshold assessment that a sponsor shall conduct carcinogenicity testing on the sponsored compound, FDA will also determine whether and to what extent the sponsor shall conduct carcinogenicity testing on metabolites of the sponsored compound. The bioassays that a sponsor conducts must be designed to assess carcinogenicity and to determine the quantitative aspects of any carcinogenic response.
(c) If FDA concludes on the basis of the threshold assessment or at a later time during the approval process or during the review of a request for an import tolerance that the data show that the sponsored compound and its metabolites should not be subject to this subpart, FDA will continue to consider the compound for approval under the general safety provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for risks other than cancer or continue its review of the import tolerance request under the provisions of §§ 510.201 through 510.213 of this chapter (Subpart C—Import Tolerances for Residues of Unapproved New Animal Drugs in Food).
(d) This subpart does not apply to essential nutrients.
[52 FR 49586, Dec. 31, 1987, as amended at 59 FR 14365, Mar. 28, 1994; 62 FR 66983, Dec. 23, 1997; 65 FR 56480, Sept. 19, 2000; 67 FR 78174, Dec. 23, 2002; 68 FR 24879, May 9, 2003; 69 FR 17292, Apr. 2, 2004; 86 FR 52410, Sept. 21, 2021; 88 FR 45066, July 14, 2023]
§ 500.82
Definitions.
(a) The definitions and interpretations contained in section 201 of the act apply to those terms when used in this subpart.
(b) The following definitions apply to this subpart:
Act
means the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (sections 201-901, 52 Stat. 1040
et seq.
as amended (21 U.S.C. 301-392)).
Essential nutrients
means compounds that are found in the tissues of untreated, healthy target animals and not produced in sufficient quantity to support the animal's growth, development, function, or reproduction, e.g., vitamins,
essential
minerals,
essential
amino acids, and
essential
fatty acids. These compounds must be supplied from external sources.
FDA
means the Food and Drug Administration.
Limit of detection (LOD)
means the lowest concentration of analyte that can be confirmed by the approved regulatory method.
Marker residue
means the residue selected for assay whose concentration is in a known relationship to the concentration of the residue of carcinogenic concern in the last tissue to deplete to its S
m
.
No residue
means the marker residue is below the limit of detection using the approved regulatory method. The “no residue” designation applies only to compounds of carcinogenic concern.
Preslaughter withdrawal period
or
milk discard time
means the time after cessation of administration of the sponsored compound at which no residue is detectable in the edible product using the approved regulatory method (i.e., the marker residue is below the LOD).
Regulatory method
means the aggregate of all experimental procedures for measuring and confirming the presence of the marker residue of the sponsored compound in the target tissue of the target animal.
R
m
means the concentration of the marker residue in the target tissue when the residue of carcinogenic concern is equal to S
m
.
Residue
means any compound present in edible tissues of the target animal
which results from the use of the sponsored compound, including the sponsored compound, its metabolites, and any other substances formed in or on food because of the sponsored compound's use.
Residue of carcinogenic concern
means all compounds in the total residue of a demonstrated carcinogen excluding any compounds judged by FDA not to present a carcinogenic risk.
S
m
means the concentration of a residue of carcinogenic concern in a specific edible tissue corresponding to no significant increase in the risk of cancer to the human consumer. For the purpose of § 500.84(c)(1), FDA will assume that this S
m
will correspond to the concentration of residue in a specific edible tissue that corresponds to a maximum lifetime risk of cancer in the test animals of 1 in 1 million.
S
o
means the concentration of a residue of carcinogenic concern in the total human diet that represents no significant increase in the risk of cancer to the human consumer. For the purpose of § 500.84(c)(1), FDA will assume that this S
o
will correspond to the concentration of test compound in the total diet of test animals that corresponds to a maximum lifetime risk of cancer in the test animals of 1 in 1 million.
Sponsor
means the person or organization proposing or holding an approval by FDA for the use of a sponsored compound or the person initiating a request for an import tolerance under § 510.205 of this chapter.
Sponsored compound
means any drug or food additive or color additive proposed for use, or used, in food-producing animals or in their feed.
Target animals
means the production class of animals in which a sponsored compound is proposed or intended for use.
Target tissue
means the edible tissue selected to monitor for residues in the target animals, including, where appropriate, milk or eggs.
Test animals
means the species selected for use in the toxicity tests.
Threshold assessment
means FDA's review of data and information about a sponsored compound to determine whether chronic bioassays in test animals are necessary to resolve questions concerning the carcinogenicity of the compound.
[52 FR 49586, Dec. 31, 1987, as amended at 67 FR 78174, Dec. 23, 2002; 77 FR 50593, Aug. 22, 2012; 84 FR 32992, July 11, 2019; 86 FR 52410, Sept. 21, 2021]
§ 500.84
Conditions for approval of the sponsored compound.
(a) On the basis of the results of the chronic bioassays and other information, FDA will determine whether any of the substances tested are carcinogenic.
(b) If FDA concludes that the results of the bioassays do not establish carcinogenicity, then FDA will not subject the sponsored compound to the remainder of the requirements of this subpart.
(c) For each sponsored compound that FDA decides should be regulated as a carcinogen, FDA will either analyze the data from the bioassays using a statistical extrapolation procedure as outlined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section or evaluate an alternate procedure proposed by the sponsor as provided in § 500.90. In either case, paragraphs (c)(2) and (3) of this section apply.
(1) For each substance tested in separate bioassays, FDA will calculate the concentration of the residue of carcinogenic concern that corresponds to a maximum lifetime risk to the test animal of 1 in 1 million. FDA will designate the lowest value obtained as S
o
. Because the total diet is not derived from food-producing animals, FDA will make corrections for food intake. FDA will designate as S
m
the concentration of residue in a specific edible tissue corresponding to a maximum lifetime risk of cancer in test animals of 1 in 1 million.
(2) From the appropriate residue chemistry data FDA will calculate the R
m
as described in § 500.86(c). The sponsor must provide a regulatory method in accordance with § 500.88(b). FDA will calculate the LOD of the method from data submitted by the sponsor under § 500.88. The LOD must be less than or equal to R
m
.
(3) FDA will conclude that the provisions of this subpart are satisfied when no residue of the compound is detectable (that is, the marker residue is
below the LOD) using the approved regulatory method under the conditions of use of the sponsored compound, including any required preslaughter withdrawal period or milk discard time.
[52 FR 49586, Dec. 31, 1987, as amended at 67 FR 78174, Dec. 23, 2002; 77 FR 50593, Aug. 22, 2012]
§ 500.86
Marker residue and target tissue.
(a) For each edible tissue, the sponsor shall measure the depletion of the residue of carcinogenic concern until its concentration is at or below S
m
.
(b) In one or more edible tissues, the sponsor shall also measure the depletion of one or more potential marker residues until the concentration of the residue of carcinogenic concern is at or below S
m
.
(c) From these data, FDA will select a target tissue and a marker residue and designate the concentration of marker residue (R
m
) that the regulatory method must be capable of measuring in the target tissue. FDA will select R
m
such that the absence of the marker residue in the target tissue above R
m
can be taken as confirmation that the residue of carcinogenic concern does not exceed S
m
in each of the edible tissues and, therefore, that the residue of carcinogenic concern in the diet of people does not exceed S
o
.
(d) When a compound is to be used in milk- or egg-producing animals, milk or eggs must be the target tissue in addition to the tissue selected to monitor for residues in the edible carcass.
(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 0910-0228)
§ 500.88
Regulatory method.
(a) The sponsor shall submit for evaluation and validation a regulatory method developed to monitor compliance with FDA's operational definition of no residue.
(b) The regulatory method must be able to confirm the identity of the marker residue in the target tissue at a minimum concentration corresponding to the R
m
. FDA will determine the LOD from the submitted analytical method validation data.
(c) FDA will publish in the
Federal Register
the complete regulatory method for ascertaining the marker residue in the target tissue in accordance with the provisions of sections 409(c)(3)(A), 512(d)(1)(I), and 721(b)(5)(B) of the act.
(d) If the sponsor initially submitted a request for an import tolerance under § 510.205 of this chapter, FDA will make the complete regulatory method for ascertaining the marker residue in the target tissue publicly available pursuant to § 510.207(b) of this chapter.
(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 0910-0228)
[52 FR 49586, Dec. 31, 1987, as amended at 67 FR 78174, Dec. 23, 2002; 86 FR 52410, Sept. 21, 2021]
§ 500.90
Waiver of requirements.
In response to a petition or on the Commissioner's own initiative, the Commissioner may waive, in whole or in part, the requirements of this subpart except those provided under § 500.88. A petition for this waiver may be filed by any person who would be adversely affected by the application of the requirements to a particular compound. The petition shall explain and document why the requirements from which a waiver is requested are not reasonably applicable to the compound, and set forth clearly the reasons why the alternative procedures will provide the basis for concluding that approval of the compound satisfies the requirements of the anticancer provisions of the act. If the Commissioner determines that waiver of any of the requirements of this subpart is appropriate, the Commissioner will state the basis for that determination in the regulation approving marketing of the sponsored compound.
(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 0910-0228)
§ 500.92
Implementation.
(a) This subpart E applies to all new animal drug applications, food additive petitions, color additive petitions, and requests for import tolerances concerning any compound intended for use in food-producing animals (including supplemental applications and amendments to petitions).
(b) This subpart E also applies in the following manner to compounds already approved:
(1) For those compounds that FDA determines may induce cancer when ingested by man or animals, i.e., suspect carcinogens, §§ 500.80(b), 500.82, and 500.90 apply.
(2) For those compounds that FDA determines have been shown to induce cancer when ingested by man or animals, §§ 500.82 through 500.90 apply.

# Subpart A—General Provisions
§ 501.1
Principal display panel of package form animal food.
The term
principal display panel
as it applies to food in package form and as used in this part, means the part of a label that is most likely to be displayed, presented, shown, or examined under customary conditions of display for retail sale. The principal display panel shall be large enough to accommodate all the mandatory label information required to be placed thereon by this part with clarity and conspicuousness and without obscuring design, vignettes, or crowding. Where packages bear alternate principal display panels, information required to be placed on the principal display panel shall be duplicated on each principal display panel. For the purpose of obtaining uniform type size in declaring the quantity of contents for all packages of substantially the same size, the term
area of the principal display panel
means the area of the side or surface that bears the principal display panel, which area shall be:
(a) In the case of a rectangular package where one entire side properly can be considered to be the principal display panel side, the product of the height times the width of that side;
(b) In the case of a cylindrical or nearly cylindrical container, 40 percent of the product of the height of the container times the circumference;
(c) In the case of any otherwise shaped container, 40 percent of the total surface of the container:
Provided, however,
That where such container presents an obvious
principal display panel
such as the top of a triangular or circular package, the area shall consist of the entire top surface. In determining the area of the principal display panel, exclude tops, bottoms, flanges at tops and bottoms of cans, and shoulders and necks of bottles or jars. In the case of cylindrical or nearly cylindrical containers, information required by this part to appear on the principal display panel shall appear within that 40 percent of the circumference which is most likely to be displayed, presented, shown, or examined under customary conditions of display for retail sale.
§ 501.2
Information panel of package for animal food.
(a) The term
information panel
as it applies to packaged food means that part of the label immediately contiguous and to the right of the principal display panel as observed by an individual facing the principal display panel with the following exceptions:
(1) If the part of the label immediately contiguous and to the right of the principal display panel is too small to accommodate the necessary information or is otherwise unusable label space, e.g., folded flaps or can ends, the panel immediately contiguous and to the right of this part of the label may be used.
(2) If the package has one or more alternate principal display panels, the information panel is immediately contiguous and to the right of any principal display panel.
(3) If the top of the container is the principal display panel and the package has no alternate principal display panel, the information panel is any panel adjacent to the principal display panel.
(b) All information required to appear on the label of any package of food pursuant to §§ 501.4, 501.5, 501.8 and 501.17 shall appear either on the principal display panel or on the information panel, unless otherwise specified by regulations in this chapter.
(c) All information appearing on the principal display panel or the information panel pursuant to this section shall appear prominently and conspicuously, but in no case may the letters and/or numbers be less than
1/16
inch in height unless an exemption pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section is established. The requirements for conspicuousness and legibility shall include the specifications of §§ 501.15 and 501.105(h) (1) and (2).
(1) Packaged foods are exempt from the type size requirements of this paragraph:
Provided,
That:
(i) The package is designed such that it has a surface area that can bear an information panel and/or an alternate principal display panel.
(ii) The area of surface available for labeling on the principal display panel of the package as this term is defined in § 501.1 is less than 10 square inches.
(iii) The label information includes a full list of ingredients in accordance with regulations in this part.
(iv) The information required by paragraph (b) of this section appears on the principal display panel or information panel label in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph (c) except that the type size is not less than
3/64
inch in height.
(2) Packaged foods are exempt from the type size requirements of this paragraph:
Provided,
That:
(i) The package is designed such that it has a single
obvious principal display panel
as this term is defined in § 501.1 and has no other available surface area for an information panel or alternate principal display panel.
(ii) The area of surface available for labeling on the principal display panel of the package as this term is defined in § 501.1 is less than 12 square inches and bears all labeling appearing on the package.
(iii) The label information includes a full list of ingredients in accordance with regulations in this part.
(iv) The information required by paragraph (b) of this section appears on the single, obvious principal display panel in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph (c) except that the type size is not less than
1/32
inch in height.
(3) Packaged foods are exempt from the type size requirements of this paragraph:
Provided,
That:
(i) The package is designed such that it has a total surface area available to bear labeling of less than 12 square inches.
(ii) The label information includes a full list of ingredients in accordance with regulations in this part.
(iii) The information required by paragraph (b) of this section appears on the principal display panel or information panel label in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph (c) except that the type size is not less than
1/32
inch in height.
(d) All information required to appear on the principal display panel or on the information panel pursuant to this section shall appear on the same panel unless there is insufficient space. In determining the sufficiency of the available space, any vignettes, design, and other nonmandatory label information shall not be considered. If there is insufficient space for all of this information to appear on a single panel, it may be divided between these two panels except that the information required pursuant to any given section or part shall all appear on the same panel. A food whose label is required to bear the ingredient statement on the principal display panel may bear all other information specified in paragraph (b) of this section on the information panel.
(e) All information appearing on the information panel pursuant to this section shall appear in one place without other intervening material.
(f) If the label of any package of food is too small to accommodate all of the information required by §§ 501.4, 501.5, 501.8, and 501.17, the Commissioner may establish by regulation an acceptable alternative method of disseminating such information to the public, e.g., a type size smaller than one-sixteenth inch in height, or labeling attached to or inserted in the package or available at the point of purchase. A petition requesting such a regulation, as an amendment to this paragraph shall be submitted pursuant to part 10 of this chapter.

§ 501.3
Identity labeling of animal food in package form.
(a) The principal display panel of a food in package form shall bear as one of its principal features a statement of the identity of the commodity.
(b) Such statement of identity shall be in terms of:
(1) The name now or hereafter specified in or required by any applicable Federal law or regulation; or, in the absence thereof,
(2) The common or usual name of the food; or, in the absence thereof,
(3) An appropriately descriptive term, or when the nature of the food is obvious, a fanciful name commonly used by the public for such food.
(c) Where a food is marketed in various optional forms (whole, slices, diced, etc.), the particular form shall be considered to be a necessary part of the statement of identity and shall be declared in letters of a type size bearing a reasonable relation to the size of the letters forming the other components of the statement of identity; except that if the optional form is visible through the container or is depicted by an appropriate vignette, the particular form need not be included in the statement. This specification does not affect the required declarations of identity under definitions and standards for foods promulgated pursuant to section 401 of the act.
(d) This statement of identity shall be presented in bold type on the principal display panel, shall be in a size reasonably related to the most prominent printed matter on such panel, and shall be in lines generally parallel to the base on which the package rests as it is designed to be displayed.
(e) Under the provisions of section 403(c) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, a food shall be deemed to be misbranded if it is an imitation of another food unless its label bears, in type of uniform size and prominence, the word
imitation
and, immediately thereafter, the name of the food imitated.
(1) A food shall be deemed to be an imitation and thus subject to the requirements of section 403(c) of the act if it is a substitute for and resembles another food but is nutritionally inferior to that food.
(2) A food that is a substitute for and resembles another food shall not be deemed to be an imitation provided it meets each of the following requirements:
(i) It is not nutritionally inferior to the food for which it substitutes and which it resembles.
(ii) Its label bears a common or usual name that complies with the provisions of § 502.5 of this chapter and that is not false or misleading, or in the absence of an existing common or usual name, an appropriately descriptive term that is not false or misleading. The label may, in addition, bear a fanciful name which is not false or misleading.
(3) A food for which a common or usual name is established by regulation (e.g., in a standard of identity pursuant to section 401 of the act, in a common or usual name regulation and may, in addition, bear a fanciful name which is not false or misleading, and established pursuant to part 502 of this chapter), and which complies with all of the applicable requirements of such regulation(s), shall not be deemed to be an imitation.
(4) Nutritional inferiority includes:
(i) Any reduction in the content of an essential nutrient that is present in a measurable amount.
(ii) If the Commissioner concludes that a food is a substitute for and resembles another food but is inferior to the food imitated for reasons other than those set forth in this paragraph, he may propose appropriate revisions to this regulation or he may propose a separate regulation governing the particular food.
(f) A label may be required to bear the percentage(s) of a characterizing ingredient(s) or information concerning the presence or absence of an ingredient(s) or the need to add an ingredient(s) as part of the common or usual name of the food pursuant to part 502 of this chapter.

Animal food; designation of ingredients.
(a) Ingredients required to be declared on the label of a food, including foods that comply with standards of identity that require labeling in compliance with this part 501, except those exempted by § 501.100, shall be listed by common or usual name in descending order of predominance by weight on either the principal display panel or the information panel in accordance with the provisions of § 501.2.
(b) The name of an ingredient shall be a specific name and not a collective (generic) name, except that:
(1) Spices, flavorings, colorings and chemical preservatives shall be declared according to the provisions of § 501.22.
(2) An ingredient which itself contains two or more ingredients and which has an established common or usual name, conforms to a standard established pursuant to the Meat Inspection or Poultry Products Inspection Acts by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, or conforms to a definition and standard of identity established pursuant to section 401 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, shall be designated in the statement of ingredients on the label of such food by either of the following alternatives:
(i) By declaring the established common or usual name of the ingredient followed by a parenthetical listing of all ingredients contained therein in descending order of predominance except that, if the ingredient is a food subject to a definition and standard of identity established in this subchapter E, only the ingredients required to be declared by the definition and standard of identity need be listed; or
(ii) By incorporating into the statement of ingredients in descending order of predominance in the finished food, the common or usual name of every component of the ingredient without listing the ingredient itself.
(3) Skim milk, concentrated skim milk, reconstituted skim milk, and nonfat dry milk may be declared as
skim milk
or
nonfat milk.

(c) When water is added to reconstitute, completely or partially, an ingredient permitted by paragraph (b) of this section to be declared by a class name, the position of the ingredient class name in the ingredient statement shall be determined by the weight of the unreconstituted ingredient plus the weight of the quantity of water added to reconstitute that ingredient, up to the amount of water needed to reconstitute the ingredient to single strength. Any water added in excess of the amount of water needed to reconstitute the ingredient to single
strength shall be declared as
water
in the ingredient statement.

§ 501.5
Animal food; name and place of business of manufacturer, packer, or distributor.
(a) The label of a food in packaged form shall specify conspicuously the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor.
(b) The requirement for declaration of the name of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor shall be deemed to be satisfied, in the case of a corporation, only by the actual corporate name, which may be preceded or followed by the name of the particular division of the corporation. In the case of an individual, partnership, or association, the name under which the business is conducted shall be used.
(c) Where the food is not manufactured by the person whose name appears on the label, the name shall be qualified by a phrase that reveals the connection such person has with such food; such as “Manufactured for ______,” “Distributed by ______,” or any other wording that expresses the facts.
(d) The statement of the place of business shall include the street address, city, state, and ZIP Code; however, the street address may be omitted if it is shown in a current city directory or telephone directory. The requirement for inclusion of the ZIP Code shall apply only to consumer commodity labels developed or revised after the effective date of this section. In the case of nonconsumer packages, the ZIP Code shall appear either on the label or the labeling (including invoice).
(e) If a person manufactures, packs, or distributes a food at a place other than his principal place of business, the label may state the principal place of business in lieu of the actual place where such food was manufactured or packed or is to be distributed, unless such statement would be misleading.
§ 501.8
Labeling of animal food with number of servings.
(a) The label of any package of a food which bears a representation as to the number of servings contained in such package shall bear in immediate conjunction with such statement, and in the same size type as is used for such statement, a statement of the net quantity (in terms of weight, measure, or numerical count) of each such serving; however, such statement may be expressed in terms that differ from the terms used in the required statement of net quantity of contents (for example, cupfuls, tablespoonfuls, etc.) when such differing term is common to cookery and describes a constant quantity. Such statement may not be misleading in any particular. A statement of the number of units in a package is not in itself a statement of the number of servings.
(b) If there exists a voluntary product standard promulgated pursuant to the procedures found in 15 CFR part 10 by the Department of Commerce, quantitatively defining the meaning of the term
serving
with respect to a particular food, then any label representation as to the number of servings in such packaged food shall correspond with such quantitative definition. (Copies of published standards are available upon request from the National Bureau of Standards, Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20234.)
§ 501.15
Animal food; prominence of required statements.
(a) A word, statement, or other information required by or under authority of the act to appear on the label may lack that prominence and conspicuousness required by section 403(f) of the act by reason (among other reasons) of:
(1) The failure of such word, statement, or information to appear on the part or panel of the label which is presented or displayed under customary conditions of purchase;
(2) The failure of such word, statement, or information to appear on two or more parts or panels of the label, each of which has sufficient space therefor, and each of which is so designed as to render it likely to be, under customary conditions of purchase, the part or panel displayed;
(3) The failure of the label to extend over the area of the container or package available for such extension, so as
to provide sufficient label space for the prominent placing of such word, statement, or information;
(4) Insufficiency of label space (for the prominent placing of such word, statement, or information) resulting from the use of label space for any word, statement, design, or device which is not required by or under authority of the act to appear on the label;
(5) Insufficiency of label space (for the prominent placing of such word, statement, or information) resulting from the use of label space to give materially greater conspicuousness to any other word, statement, or information, or to any design or device; or
(6) Smallness or style of type in which such word, statement, or information appears, insufficient background contrast, obscuring designs or vignettes, or crowding with other written, printed, or graphic matter.
(b) No exemption depending on insufficiency of label space, as prescribed in regulations promulgated under section 403(e) or (i) of the act, shall apply if such insufficiency is caused by:
(1) The use of label space for any word, statement, design, or device which is not required by or under authority of the act to appear on the label;
(2) The use of label space to give greater conspicuousness to any word, statement, or other information that is required by section 403(f) of the act; or
(3) The use of label space for any representation in a foreign language.
(c)(1) All words, statements, and other information required by or under authority of the act to appear on the label or labeling shall appear thereon in the English language:
Provided, however,
That in the case of articles distributed solely in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico or in a territory where the predominant language is one other than English, the predominant language may be substituted for English.
(2) If the label contains any representation in a foreign language, all words, statements, and other information required by or under authority of the act to appear on the label shall appear thereon in the foreign language.
(3) If any article of labeling (other than a label) contains any representation in a foreign language, all words, statements, and other information required by or under authority of the act to appear on the label or labeling shall appear on such article of labeling.
§ 501.17
Animal food labeling warning statements.
(a)
Self-pressurized containers.
(1) The label of a food packaged in a self-pressurized container and intended to be expelled from the package under pressure shall bear the following warning:
Warning
Avoid spraying in eyes. Contents under pressure. Do not puncture or incinerate. Do not store at temperature above 120 °F. Keep out of reach of children.
(2) In the case of products intended for use by children, the phrase “except under adult supervision” may be added at the end of the last sentence in the warning required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
(3) In the case of products packaged in glass containers, the word “break” may be substituted for the word “puncture” in the warning required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
(4) The words “Avoid spraying in eyes” may be deleted from the warning required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section in the case of a product not expelled as a spray.
(b)
Self-pressurized containers with halocarbon or hydrocarbon propellants.
(1) In addition to the warning required by paragraph (a) of this section, the label of a food packaged in a self-pressurized container in which the propellant consists in whole or in part of a halocarbon or a hydrocarbon shall bear the following warning:
Warning
Use only as directed. Intentional misuse by deliberately concentrating and inhaling the contents can be harmful or fatal.
(2) The warning required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section is not required for the following products:
(i) Products expelled in the form of a foam or cream, which contain less than 10 percent propellant in the container.
(ii) Products in a container with a physical barrier that prevents escape of the propellant at the time of use.
(iii) Products of a net quantity of contents of less than 2 ozs that are designed to release a measured amount of product with each valve actuation.
(iv) Products of a net quantity of contents of less than
1/2
oz.
(c)
Animal food containing or manufactured with a chlorofluorocarbon or other ozone-depleting substance.
Labeling requirements for animal foods that contain or are manufactured with a chlorofluorocarbon or other ozone-depleting substance designated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are set forth in 40 CFR part 82.
[41 FR 38619, Sept. 10, 1976, as amended at 42 FR 22033, Apr. 29, 1977; 61 FR 20101, May 3, 1996]
§ 501.18
Misbranding of animal food.
(a) Among representations in the labeling of a food which render such food misbranded is a false or misleading representation with respect to another food or a drug, device, or cosmetic.
(b) The labeling of a food which contains two or more ingredients may be misleading by reason (among other reasons) of the designation of such food in such labeling by a name which includes or suggests the name of one or more but not all such ingredients, even though the names of all such ingredients are stated elsewhere in the labeling.
(c) Among representations in the labeling of a food which render such food misbranded is any representation that expresses or implies a geographical origin of the food or any ingredient of the food except when such representation is either:
(1) A truthful representation of geographical origin.
(2) A trademark or trade name provided that as applied to the article in question its use is not deceptively misdescriptive. A trademark or trade name comprised in whole or in part of geographical words shall not be considered deceptively misdescriptive if it:
(i) Has been so long and exclusively used by a manufacturer or distributor that it is generally understood by the consumer to mean the product of a particular manufacturer or distributor; or
(ii) Is so arbitrary or fanciful that it is not generally understood by the consumer to suggest geographic origin.
(3) A part of the name required by applicable Federal law or regulation.
(4) A name whose market significance is generally understood by the consumer to connote a particular class, kind, type, or style of food rather than to indicate geographical origin.

which contains the flavoring constituents derived from a spice, fruit or fruit juice, vegetable or vegetable juice, edible yeast, herb, bark, bud, root, leaf or similar plant material, meat, seafood, poultry, eggs, dairy products, or fermentation products thereof, whose significant function in food is flavoring rather than nutritional. Natural flavors, include the natural essence or extractives obtained from plants listed in subpart A of part 582 of this chapter, and the substances listed in § 172.510 of this chapter.
(4) The term
artificial color
or
artificial coloring
means any
color additive
as defined in § 70.3(f) of this chapter.
(5) The term
chemical preservative
means any chemical that, when added to food, tends to prevent or retard deterioration thereof, but does not include common salt, sugars, vinegars, spices, or oils extracted from spices, substances added to food by direct exposure thereof to wood smoke, or chemicals applied for their insecticidal or herbicidal properties.
(b) A food which is subject to the requirements of section 403(k) of the act shall bear labeling, even though such food is not in package form.
(c) A statement of artificial flavoring, artificial coloring, or chemical preservative shall be placed on the food, or on its container or wrapper, or on any two or all of these, as may be necessary to render such statement likely to be read by the ordinary individual under customary conditions of purchase and use of such food.
(d) A food shall be exempt from compliance with the requirements of section 403(k) of the act if it is not in package form and the units thereof are so small that a statement of artificial flavoring, artificial coloring, or chemical preservative, as the case may be, cannot be placed on such units with such conspicuousness as to render it likely to be read by the ordinary individual under customary conditions of purchase and use.
(e) A food shall be exempt while held for sale from the requirements of section 403(k) of the act (requiring label statement of any artificial flavoring, artificial coloring, or chemical preservatives) if said food, having been received in bulk containers at a retail establishment, is displayed to the purchaser with either (1) the labeling of the bulk container plainly in view or (2) a counter card, sign, or other appropriate device bearing prominently and conspicuously the information required to be stated on the label pursuant to section 403(k) of the act.
(f) A fruit or vegetable shall be exempt from compliance with the requirements of section 403(k) of the act with respect to a chemical preservative applied to the fruit or vegetable as a pesticide chemical prior to harvest.
(g) A flavor shall be labeled in the following way when shipped to a food manufacturer or processor (but not a consumer) for use in the manufacture of a fabricated food, unless it is a flavor for which a standard of identity has been promulgated, in which case it shall be labeled as provided in the standard:
(1) If the flavor consists of one ingredient, it shall be declared by its common or usual name.
(2) If the flavor consists of two or more ingredients, the label either may declare each ingredient by its common or usual name or may state “All flavor ingredients contained in this product are approved for use in a regulation of the Food and Drug Administration.” Any flavor ingredient not contained in one of these regulations, and any nonflavor ingredient, shall be separately listed on the label.
(3) In cases where the flavor contains a solely natural flavor(s), the flavor shall be so labeled, e.g.,
strawberry flavor, banana flavor,
or
natural strawberry flavor.
In cases where the flavor contains both a natural flavor and an artificial flavor, the flavor shall be so labeled, e.g.,
natural and artificial strawberry flavor.
In cases where the flavor contains a solely artificial flavor(s), the flavor shall be so labeled, e.g.,
artificial strawberry flavor.
(h) The label of a food to which flavor is added shall declare the flavor in the statement of ingredients in the following way:
(1) Spice, natural flavor, and artificial flavor may be declared as
spice, natural flavor,
or
artificial flavor,
or any combination thereof, as the case may be.
(2) An incidental additive in a food, originating in a spice or flavor used in the manufacture of the food, need not be declared in the statement of ingredients if it meets the requirements of § 501.100(a)(3).
(3) Substances obtained by cutting, grinding, drying, pulping, or similar processing of tissues derived from fruit, vegetable, meat, fish, or poultry, e.g., powdered or granulated onions, garlic powder, and celery powder, are commonly understood by consumers to be food rather than flavor and shall be declared by their common or usual name.
(4) Any salt (sodium chloride) used as an ingredient in food shall be declared by its common or usual name
salt.
(5) Any monosodium glutamate used as an ingredient in food shall be declared by its common or usual name
monosodium glutamate.
(6) Any pyroligneous acid or other artificial smoke flavors used as an ingredient in a food may be declared as
artificial flavor
or
artificial smoke flavor.
No representation may be made, either directly or implied, that a food flavored with pyroligneous acid or other artificial smoke flavor has been smoked or has a true smoked flavor, or that a seasoning sauce or similar product containing pyroligneous acid or other artificial smoke flavor and used to season or flavor other foods will result in a smoked product or one having a true smoked flavor.
(i) If the label, labeling, or advertising of a food makes any direct or indirect representations with respect to the primary recognizable flavor(s), by word,
vignette,
e.g., depiction of a fruit, or other means, or if for any other reason the manufacturer or distributor of a food wishes to designate the type of flavor in the food other than through the statement of ingredients, such flavor shall be considered the characterizing flavor and shall be declared in the following way:
(1) If the food contains no artificial flavor which simulates, resembles or reinforces the characterizing flavor, the name of the food on the principal display panel or panels of the label shall be accompanied by the common or usual name of the characterizing flavor in letters not less than one-half the height of the letters used in the name of the food, except that:
(i) If the food is one that is commonly expected to contain a characterizing food ingredient, and the food contains natural flavor derived from such ingredient and an amount of characterizing ingredient insufficient to independently characterize the food, or the food contains no such ingredient, the name of the characterizing flavor may be immediately preceded by the word
natural
and shall be immediately followed by the word
flavored
in letters not less than one-half the height of the letters in the name of the characterizing flavor.
(ii) If none of the natural flavor used in the food is derived from the product whose flavor is simulated, the food in which the flavor is used shall be labeled either with the flavor of the product from which the flavor is derived or as
artificially flavored.
(iii) If the food contains both a characterizing flavor from the product whose flavor is simulated and other natural flavor which simulates, resembles or reinforces the characterizing flavor, the food shall be labeled in accordance with the introductory text and paragraph (i)(1)(i) of this section and the name of the food shall be immediately followed by the words
with other natural flavor
in letters not less than one-half the height of the letters used in the name of the characterizing flavor.
(2) If the food contains any artificial flavor which simulates, resembles or reinforces the characterizing flavor, the name of the food on the principal display panel or panels of the label shall be accompanied by the common or usual name(s) of the characterizing flavor, in letters not less than one-half the height of the letters used in the name of the food and the name of the characterizing flavor shall be accompanied by the word(s)
artificial
or
artificially flavored,
in letters not less than one-half the height of the letters in the name of the characterizing flavor.
(3) Wherever the name of the characterizing flavor appears on the label (other than in the statement of ingredients) so conspicuously as to be easily seen under customary conditions of purchase, the words prescribed by this
paragraph shall immediately and conspicuously precede or follow such name, without any intervening written, printed, or graphic matter, except:
(i) Where the characterizing flavor and a trademark or brand are presented together, other written, printed, or graphic matter that is a part of or is associated with the trademark or brand may intervene if the required words are in such relationship with the trademark or brand as to be clearly related to the characterizing flavor; and
(ii) If the finished product contains more than one flavor subject to the requirements of this paragraph, the statements required by this paragraph need appear only once in each statement of characterizing flavors present in such food.
(iii) If the finished product contains three or more distinguishable characterizing flavors, or a blend of flavors with no primary recognizable flavor, the flavor may be declared by an appropriately descriptive generic term in lieu of naming each flavor.
(4) A flavor supplier shall certify, in writing, that any flavor he supplies which is designated as containing no artificial flavor does not, to the best of his knowledge and belief, contain any artificial flavor, and that he has added no artificial flavor to it. The requirement for such certification may be satisfied by a guarantee under section 303(c)(2) of the act which contains such a specific statement. A flavor used shall be required to make such a written certification only where he adds to or combines another flavor with a flavor which has been certified by a flavor supplier as containing no artificial flavor, but otherwise such user may rely upon the supplier's certification and need make no separate certification. All such certifications shall be retained by the certifying party throughout the period in which the flavor is supplied and for a minimum of 3 years thereafter, and shall be subject to the following conditions:
(i) The certifying party shall make such certifications available upon request at all reasonable hours to any duly authorized officer, or employee of the Food and Drug Administration or any other employee acting on behalf of the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Such certifications are regarded by the Food and Drug Administration as reports to the government and as guarantees or other undertakings within the meaning of section 301(h) of the act and subject the certifying party to the penalties for making any false report to the government under 18 U.S.C. 1001 and any false guarantee or undertaking under section 303(a) of the act. The defenses provided under section 303(c)(2) of the act shall be applicable to the certifications provided for in this section.
(ii) Wherever possible, the Food and Drug Administration shall verify the accuracy of a reasonable number of certifications made pursuant to this section, constituting a representative sample of such certifications, and shall not request all such certifications.
(iii) Where no person authorized to provide such information is reasonably available at the time of inspection, the certifying party shall arrange to have such person and the relevant materials and records ready for verification as soon as practicable; provided that, whenever the Food and Drug Administration has reason to believe that the supplier or user may utilize this period to alter inventories or records, such additional time shall not be permitted. Where such additional time is provided, the Food and Drug Administration may require the certifying party to certify that relevant inventories have not been materially disturbed and relevant records have not been altered or concealed during such period.
(iv) The certifying party shall provide, to an officer or representative duly designated by the Secretary, such qualitative statement of the composition of the flavor or product covered by the certification as may be reasonably expected to enable the Secretary's representatives to determine which relevant raw and finished materials and flavor ingredient records are reasonably necessary to verify the certifications. The examination conducted by the Secretary's representative shall be limited to inspection and review of inventories and ingredient records for those certifications which are to be verified.
(v) Review of flavor ingredient records shall be limited to the qualitative formula and shall not include the quantitative formula. The person verifying the certifications may make only such notes as are necessary to enable him to verify such certification. Only such notes or such flavor ingredient records as are necessary to verify such certification or to show a potential or actual violation may be removed or transmitted from the certifying party's place of business:
Provided,
That, where such removal or transmittal is necessary for such purposes the relevant records and notes shall be retained as separate documents in Food and Drug Administration files, shall not be copied in other reports, and shall not be disclosed publicly other than in a judicial proceeding brought pursuant to the act or 18 U.S.C. 1001.
(j) A food to which a chemical preservative(s) is added shall, except when exempt pursuant to § 501.100, bear a label declaration stating both the common or usual name of the ingredient(s) and a separate description of its function, e.g.,
preservative, to retard spoilage, a mold inhibitor, to help protect flavor
or
to promote color retention.
(k) The label of an animal food to which any coloring has been added shall declare the coloring in the statement of ingredients in the manner specified in paragraphs (k)(1) and (k)(2) of this section.
(1) A color additive or the lake of a color additive subject to certification under section 721(c) of the act shall be declared by the name of the color additive listed in the applicable regulation in part 74 or part 82 of this chapter, except that it is not necessary to include the “FD
C” prefix or the term “No.” in the declaration, but the term “Lake” shall be included in the declaration of the lake of the certified color additive (e.g., Blue 1 Lake). Manufacturers may parenthetically declare an appropriate alternative name of the certified color additive following its common or usual name as specified in part 74 or part 82 of this chapter.
(2) Color additives not subject to certification may be declared as “Artificial Color,” “Artificial Color Added,” or “Color Added” (or by an equally informative term that makes clear that a color additive has been used in the food). Alternatively, such color additives may be declared as “Colored with ____” or “____ color,” the blank to be filled with the name of the color additive listed in the applicable regulation in part 73 of this chapter.

# Subpart F—Exemptions From Animal Food Labeling Requirements
§ 501.100
Animal food; exemptions from labeling.
(a) The following foods are exempt from compliance with the requirements of section 403(i)(2) of the act (requiring a declaration on the label of the common or usual name of each ingredient when the food is fabricated from two or more ingredients).
(1) An assortment of different items of food, when variations in the items that make up different packages packed from such assortment normally occur in good packing practice and when such variations result in variations in the ingredients in different packages, with respect to any ingredient that is not common to all packages. Such exemption, however, shall be on the condition that the label shall bear, in conjunction with the names of such ingredients as are common to all packages, a statement (in terms that are as informative as practicable and that are not misleading) indicating by name other ingredients which may be present.
(2) A food having been received in bulk containers at a retail establishment, if displayed to the purchaser with either (i) the labeling of the bulk container plainly in view or (ii) a counter card, sign, or other appropriate device bearing prominently and conspicuously the information required to be stated on the label pursuant to section 403(i)(2) of the act.
(3) Incidental additives that are present in a food at insignificant levels
and do not have any technical or functional effect in that food. For the purposes of this paragraph (a)(3), incidental additives are:
(i) Substances that have no technical or functional effect but are present in a food by reason of having been incorporated into the food as an ingredient of another food, in which the substance did have a functional or technical effect.
(ii) Processing aids, which are as follows:
(
a
) Substances that are added to a food during the processing of such food but are removed in some manner from the food before it is packaged in its finished form.
(
b
) Substances that are added to a food during processing, are converted into constituents normally present in the food, and do not significantly increase the amount of the constituents naturally found in the food.
(
c
) Substances that are added to a food for their technical or functional effect in the processing but are present in the finished food at insignificant levels and do not have any technical or functional effect in that food.
(iii) Substances migrating to food from equipment or packaging or otherwise affecting food that are not food additives as defined in section 201(s) of the act; or if they are food additives as so defined, they are used in conformity with regulations established pursuant to section 409 of the act.
(b) A food repackaged in a retail establishment is exempt from the following provisions of the act if the conditions specified are met.
(1) Section 403(e)(1) of the act (requiring a statement on the label of the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor).
(2) Section 403(g)(2) of the act (requiring the label of a food which purports to be or is represented as one for which a definition and standard of identity has been prescribed to bear the name of the food specified in the definition and standard and, insofar as may be required by the regulation establishing the standard the common names of the optional ingredients present in the food), if the food is displayed to the purchaser with its interstate labeling clearly in view, or with a counter card, sign, or other appropriate device bearing prominently and conspicuously the information required by these provisions.
(3) Section 403(i)(1) of the act (requiring the label to bear the common or usual name of the food), if the food is displayed to the purchaser with its interstate labeling clearly in view, or with a counter card, sign, or other appropriate device bearing prominently and conspicuously the common or usual name of the food, or if the common or usual name of the food is clearly revealed by its appearance.
(c) [Reserved]
(d) Except as provided by paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section, a shipment or other delivery of a food which is, in accordance with the practice of the trade, to be processed, labeled, or repacked in substantial quantity at an establishment other than that where originally processed or packed, shall be exempt, during the time of introduction into and movement in interstate commerce and the time of holding in such establishment, from compliance with the labeling requirements of section 403 (c), (e), (g), (h), (i), (j) and (k) of the act if:
(1) The person who introduced such shipment or delivery into interstate commerce is the operator of the establishment where such food is to be processed, labeled, or repacked; or
(2) In case such person is not such operator, such shipment or delivery is made to such establishment under a written agreement, signed by and containing the post office addresses of such person and such operator, and containing such specifications for the processing, labeling, or repacking, as the case may be, of such food in such establishment as will ensure, if such specifications are followed, that such food will not be adulterated or misbranded within the meaning of the act upon completion of such processing, labeling, or repacking. Such person and such operator shall each keep a copy of such agreement until 2 years after the final shipment or delivery of such food from such establishment, and shall make such copies available for inspection at any reasonable hour to any officer or employee of the Department who requests them.
(e) Conditions affecting expiration of exemptions.
(1) An exemption of a shipment or other delivery of a food under paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall, at the beginning of the act of removing such shipment or delivery, or any part thereof, from such establishment become void ab initio if the food comprising such shipment, delivery, or part is adulterated or misbranded within the meaning of the act when so removed.
(2) An exemption of a shipment or other delivery of a food under paragraph (d)(2) of this section shall become void ab initio with respect to the person who introduced such shipment or delivery into interstate commerce upon refusal by such person to make available for inspection a copy of the agreement, as required by paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
(3) An exemption of a shipment or other delivery of a food under paragraph (d)(2) of this section shall expire:
(i) At the beginning of the act of removing such shipment or delivery, or any part thereof, from such establishment if the food comprising such shipment, delivery, or part is adulterated or misbranded within the meaning of the act when so removed; or
(ii) Upon refusal by the operator of the establishment where such food is to be processed, labeled, or repacked, to make available for inspection a copy of the agreement as required by such paragraph.
(f) [Reserved]
(g) The label declaration of a harmless marker used to identify a particular manufacturer's product may result in unfair competition through revealing a trade secret. Exemption from the label declaration of such a marker is granted, therefore, provided that the following conditions are met:
(1) The person desiring to use the marker without label declaration of its presence has submitted to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs full information concerning the proposed usage and the reasons why he believes label declaration of the marker should be subject to this exemption; and
(2) The person requesting the exemption has received from the Commissioner of Food and Drugs a finding that the marker is harmless and that the exemption has been granted.
§ 501.103
Petitions requesting exemptions from or special requirements for label declaration of ingredients.
The Commissioner of Food and Drugs, either on his own initiative or on behalf of any interested person who has submitted a petition pursuant to part 10 of this chapter may issue a proposal to amend § 501.4 to specify the manner in which an ingredient(s) shall be declared, i.e., by specific or class name, or § 501.100 to exempt an ingredient(s) from the requirements for label declaration.
[41 FR 38619, Sept. 10, 1976, as amended at 42 FR 15675, Mar. 22, 1977]
§ 501.105
Declaration of net quantity of contents when exempt.
(a) The principal display panel of a food in package form shall bear a declaration of the net quantity of contents. This shall be expressed in the terms of weight, measure, numerical count, or a combination of numerical count and weight or measure. The statement shall be in terms of fluid measure if the food is liquid, or in terms of weight if the food is solid, semisolid, or viscous, or a mixture of solid and liquid; except that such statement may be in terms of dry measure if the food is a fresh fruit, fresh vegetable, or other dry commodity that is customarily sold by dry measure. If there is a firmly established general consumer usage and trade custom of declaring the contents of a liquid by weight, or a solid, semisolid, or viscous product by fluid measure, it may be used. Whenever the Commissioner determines that an existing practice of declaring net quantity of contents by weight, measure, numerical count, or a combination in the case of a specific packaged food does not facilitate value comparisons by consumers and offers opportunity for consumer confusion, he will by regulation designate the appropriate term or terms to be used for such commodity.
(b)(1) Statements of weight shall be in terms of avoirdupois pound and ounce.
(2) Statements of fluid measure shall be in terms of the U.S. gallon of 231
cubic inches and quart, pint, and fluid ounce subdivisions thereof, and shall:
(i) In the case of frozen food that is sold and consumed in a frozen state, express the volume at the frozen temperature.
(ii) In the case of refrigerated food that is sold in the refrigerated state, express the volume at 40 °F (4 °C).
(iii) In the case of other foods, express the volume at 68 °F (20 °C).
(3) Statements of dry measure shall be in terms of the U.S. bushel of 2,150.42 cubic inches and peck, dry quart, and dry pint subdivisions thereof.
(c) When the declaration of quantity of contents by numerical count does not give adequate information as to the quantity of food in the package, it shall be combined with such statement of weight, measure, or size of the individual units of the foods as will provide such information.
(d) The declaration may contain common or decimal fractions. A common fraction shall be in terms of halves, quarters, eighths, sixteenths, or thirty-seconds; except that if there exists a firmly established general consumer usage and trade custom of employing different common fractions in the net quantity declaration of a particular commodity, they may be employed. A common fraction shall be reduced to its lowest terms; a decimal fraction shall not be carried out to more than two places. A statement that includes small fractions of an ounce shall be deemed to permit smaller variations than one which does not include such fractions.
(e) The declaration shall be located on the principal display panel of the label, and with respect to packages bearing alternate principal panels it shall be duplicated on each principal display panel.
(f) The declaration shall appear as a distinct item on the principal display panel, shall be separated (by at least a space equal to the height of the lettering used in the declaration) from other printed label information appearing above or below the declaration and (by at least a space equal to twice the width of the letter “N” of the style of type used in the quantity of contents statement) from other printed label information appearing to the left or right of the declaration. It shall not include any term qualifying a unit of weight, measure, or count (such as
jumbo quart
and
full gallon
) that tends to exaggerate the amount of the food in the container. It shall be placed on the principal display panel within the bottom 30 percent of the area of the label panel in lines generally parallel to the base on which the package rests as it is designed to be displayed:
Provided,
That on packages having a principal display panel of 5 square inches or less, the requirement for placement within the bottom 30 percent of the area of the label panel shall not apply when the declaration of net quantity of contents meets the other requirements of this part.
(g) The declaration shall accurately reveal the quantity of food in the package exclusive of wrappers and other material packed therewith; provided that in the case of foods packed in containers designed to deliver the food under pressure, the declaration shall state the net quantity of the contents that will be expelled when the instructions for use as shown on the container are followed. The propellant is included in the net quantity declaration.
(h) The declaration shall appear in conspicuous and easily legible boldface print or type in distinct contrast (by typography, layout, color, embossing, or molding) to other matter on the package; except that a declaration of net quantity blown, embossed, or molded on a glass or plastic surface is permissible when all label information is so formed on the surface. Requirements of conspicuousness and legibility shall include the specifications that:
(1) The ratio of height to width (of the letter) shall not exceed a differential of 3 units to 1 unit (no more than 3 times as high as it is wide).
(2) Letter heights pertain to upper case or capital letters. When upper and lower case or all lower case letters are used, it is the lower case letter “o” or its equivalent that shall meet the minimum standards.
(3) When fractions are used, each component numeral shall meet one-half the minimum height standards.
(i) The declaration shall be in letters and numerals in a type size established
in relationship to the area of the principal display panel of the package and shall be uniform for all packages of substantially the same size by complying with the following type specifications:
(1) Not less than
1/16
inch in height on packages the principal display panel of which has an area of 5 square inches or less.
(2) Not less than
1/8
inch in height on packages the principal display panel of which has an area of more than 5 but not more than 25 square inches.
(3) Not less than
3/16
inch in height on packages the principal display panel of which has an area of more than 25 but not more than 100 square inches.
(4) Not less than
1/4
inch in height on packages the principal display panel of which has an area of more than 100 square inches, except not less than
1/2
inch in height if the area is more than 400 square inches.
Where the declaration is blown, embossed, or molded on a glass or plastic surface rather than by printing, typing, or coloring, the lettering sizes specified in paragraphs (i) (1) through (4) of this section shall be increased by
1/16
of an inch.
(j) On packages containing less than 4 pounds or 1 gallon and labeled in terms of weight or fluid measure:
(1) The declaration shall be expressed both in ounces, with identification by weight or by liquid measure and, if applicable (1 pound or 1 pint or more) followed in parentheses by a declaration in pounds for weight units, with any remainder in terms of ounces or common or decimal fractions of the pound (see examples set forth in paragraphs (m) (1) and (2) of this section), or in the case of liquid measure, in the largest whole units (quarts, quarts and pints, or pints, as appropriate) with any remainder in terms of fluid ounces or common or decimal fractions of the pint or quart (see examples in paragraphs (m) (3) and (4) of this section).
(2) If the net quantity of contents declaration appears on a random package, that is a package which is one of a lot, shipment, or delivery of packages of the same consumer commodity with varying weights and with no fixed weight pattern, it may, when the net weight exceeds 1 pound, be expressed in terms of pounds and decimal fractions of the pound carried out to not more than two decimal places. When the net weight does not exceed 1 pound, the declaration on the random package may be in decimal fractions of the pound in lieu of ounces (see example in paragraph (m)(5) of this section).
(3) The declaration may appear in more than one line. The term
net weight
shall be used when stating the net quantity of contents in terms of weight. Use of the terms
net
or
net contents
in terms of fluid measure or numerical count is optional. It is sufficient to distinguish avoirdupois ounce from fluid ounce through association of terms; for example,
Net wt. 6 oz.
or
6 oz. net wt.
and
6 fl. oz.
or
net contents 6 fl. oz.
(k) On packages containing 4 pounds or 1 gallon or more and labeled in terms of weight or fluid measure, the declaration shall be expressed in pounds for weight units with any remainder in terms of ounces or common or decimal fraction of the pound, or in the case of fluid measure, it shall be expressed in the largest whole unit (gallons followed by common or decimal fraction of a gallon or by the next smaller whole unit or units (quarts, or quarts and pints)) with any remainder in terms of fluid ounces or common or decimal fractions of the pint or quart (see paragraph (m)(6) of this section).
(l) [Reserved]
(m)
Examples:
(1) A declaration of 1
1/2
pounds weight shall be expressed as
Net Wt. 24 oz. (1 lb. 8 oz.), Net Wt. 24 oz. (1
1/2
lb.),
or
Net Wt. 24 oz. (1.5 lb.).
(2) A declaration of
3/4
pound avoirdupois weight shall be expressed as
Net Wt. 12 oz.
(3) A declaration of 1 quart liquid measure shall be expressed as
Net 32 fl. oz. (1 qt.).
(4) A declaration of 1
3/4
quarts liquid measure shall be expressed as
Net contents 56 fluid ounces (1 quart 1
1/2
pints)
or as
Net 56 fluid oz. (1 qt. 1 pt. 8 oz.),
but not in terms of quart and ounce such as
Net 56 fluid oz. (1 quart 24 ounces).
(5) On a random package, declaration of
3/4
pound avoirdupois may be expressed as
Net Wt. .75 lb.
(6) A declaration of 2
1/2
gallons liquid measure shall be expressed as
Net contents 2
1/2
gallons, Net contents 2.5 gallons,
or
Net contents 2 gallons 2 quarts
and not as
2 gallons 4 pints.
(n) For quantities, the following abbreviations and none other may be employed (periods and plural forms are optional):
weight wt.
ounce oz.
pound lb.
gallon gal.
pint pt.
quart qt.
fluid fl.
(o) Nothing in this section shall prohibit supplemental statements at locations other than the principal display panel(s) describing in nondeceptive terms the net quantity of contents; provided, that such supplemental statements of net quantity of contents shall not include any term qualifying a unit of weight, measure, or count that tends to exaggerate the amount of the food contained in the package; for example,
jumbo quart
and
full gallon.
Dual or combination declarations of net quantity of contents as provided for in paragraphs (a), (c), and (j) of this section (for example, a combination of net weight plus numerical count, net contents plus dilution directions of a concentrate, etc.) are not regarded as supplemental net quantity statements and may be located on the principal display panel.
(p) A separate statement of the net quantity of contents in terms of the metric system is not regarded as a supplemental statement and an accurate statement of the net quantity of contents in terms of the metric system of weight or measure may also appear on the principal display panel or on other panels.
(q) The declaration of net quantity of contents shall express an accurate statement of the quantity of contents of the package. Reasonable variations caused by loss or gain of moisture during the course of good distribution practice or by unavoidable deviations in good manufacturing practice will be recognized. Variations from stated quantity of contents shall not be unreasonably large.
(r) [Reserved]
(s) On a multiunit retail package, a statement of the quantity of contents shall appear on the outside of the package and shall include the number of individual units, the quantity of each individual unit, and, in parentheses, the total quantity of contents of the multiunit package in terms of avoirdupois or fluid ounces, except that such declaration of total quantity need not be followed by an additional parenthetical declaration in terms of the largest whole units and subdivisions thereof, as required by paragraph (j)(1) of this section. A multiunit retail package may thus be properly labeled:
6-16 oz. bottles—(96 fl. oz.)
or
3-16 oz. cans—(net wt. 48 oz).
For the purposes of this section,
multiunit retail package
means a package containing two or more individually packaged units of the identical commodity and in the same quantity, intended to be sold as part of the multiunit retail package but capable of being individually sold in full compliance with all requirements of the regulations in this part. Open multiunit retail packages that do not obscure the number of units nor prevent examination of the labeling on each of the individual units are not subject to this paragraph if the labeling of each individual unit complies with the requirements of paragraphs (f) and (i) of this section.
(t) Where the declaration of net quantity of contents is in terms of net weight and/or drained weight or volume and does not accurately reflect the actual quantity of the contents or the product falls below the applicable standard of fill of container because of equipment malfunction or otherwise unintentional product variation, and the label conforms in all other respects to the requirements of this chapter, the mislabeled food product may be sold by the manufacturer or processor directly to institutions operated by Federal, State or local governments:
Provided,
That:
(1) The purchaser shall sign a statement at the time of sale stating that he is aware that the product is mislabeled to include acknowledgement of the nature and extent of the mislabeling, e.g., “Actual net weight may be as low as __% below labeled quantity” and that any subsequent distribution by him of said product except for his own institutional use is unlawful. This statement shall be kept on file at the principal place of business of the manufacturer or processor for 2
years subsequent to the date of shipment of the product and shall be available to the Food and Drug Administration upon request.
(2) The product shall be labeled on the outside of its shipping container with the statement(s):
(i) When the variation concerns net weight and/or drained weight of volume—“Product Mislabeled. Actual net weight (drained weight or volume where appropriate) may be as low as __% below labeled quantity. This Product Not for Retail Distribution,” the blank to be filled in with the maximum percentage variance between the labeled and actual weight or volume of contents of the individual packages in the shipping container, and
(ii) When the variation is in regard to a fill of container standard—“Product Mislabeled. Actual fill may be as low as __% below standard of fill. This Product Not for Retail Distribution.”
(3) The statements required by paragraphs (t)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section, which may be consolidated where appropriate, shall appear prominently and conspicuously as compared to other printed matter on the shipping container and in boldface print or type on a clear, contrasting background in order to render them likely to be read and understood by the purchaser under ordinary conditions of purchase.

§ 502.5
General principles.
(a) The common or usual name of a food, which may be a coined term, shall accurately identify or describe, in as simple and direct terms as possible, the basic nature of the food or its characterizing properties or ingredients. The name shall be uniform among all identical or similar products and may not be confusingly similar to the name of any other food that is not reasonably encompassed within the same name. Each class or subclass of food shall be given its own common or usual name that states, in clear terms, what it is in a way that distinguishes it from different foods.
(b) The common or usual name of a food shall include the percentage(s) of any characterizing ingredient(s) or component(s) when the proportion of such ingredient(s) or component(s) in the food has a material bearing on price or consumer acceptance or when the labeling or the appearance of the food may otherwise create an erroneous impression that such ingredient(s) or component(s) is present in an amount greater than is actually the case. The following requirements shall apply unless modified by a specific regulation in this part.
(1) The percentage of a characterizing ingredient or component shall be declared on the basis of its quantity in the finished product (i.e., weight/weight in the case of solids, or volume/volume in the case of liquids).
(2) The percentage of a characterizing ingredient or component shall be declared by the words “containing (or contains) __ percent (or %) __” or “__ percent (or %) __” with the first blank filled in with the percentage expressed as a whole number not greater than the actual percentage of the ingredient or component named and the second blank filled in with the common or usual name of the ingredient or component. The word “containing” (or “contains”), when used, shall appear on a line immediately below the part of the common or usual name of the food required by paragraph (a) of this section. For each characterizing ingredient or component, the words “__ percent (or %) __”shall appear following or directly below the word “containing” (or “contains”), or directly below the part of the common or usual name of the food required by paragraph (a) of this section when the word “containing” (or “contains”) is not used, in easily legible boldface print or type in distinct contrast to other printed or graphic matter, and in a height not less than the larger of the following alternatives:
(i) Not less than one-sixteenth inch in height on packages having a principal display panel with an area of 5 square inches or less and not less than one-eighth inch in height if the area of the principal display panel is greater than 5 square inches; or
(ii) Not less than one-half the height of the largest type appearing in the part of the common or usual name of the food required by paragraph (a) of this section.
(c) The common or usual name of a food shall include a statement of the presence or absence of any characterizing ingredient(s) or component(s) and/or the need for the user to add any characterizing ingredient(s) or component(s) when the presence or absence of such ingredient(s) or component(s) in the food has a material bearing on price or consumer acceptance or when the labeling or the appearance of the food may otherwise create an erroneous impression that such ingredient(s) or component(s) is present when it is not, and consumers may otherwise be misled about the presence or absence of the ingredient(s) or component(s) in the food. The following requirements shall apply unless modified by a specific regulation in this part.
(1) The presence or absence of a characterizing ingredient or component shall be declared by the words “containing (or contains) ____” or “containing (or contains) _____” or “no _____” or “does not contain _____”, with the blank being filled in with the common or usual name of the ingredient or component.
(2) The need for the user of a food to add any characterizing ingredient(s) or component(s) shall be declared by an appropriate informative statement.
(3) The statement(s) required under paragraph (c) (1) and/or (2) of this section shall appear following or directly below the part of the common or usual
name of the food required by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, in easily legible boldface print or type in distinct contrast to other printed or graphic matter, and in a height not less than the larger of the alternatives established under paragraph (b)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section.
(d) A common or usual name of a food may be established by common usage or by establishment of a regulation in this part, in a standard of identity, or in other regulations in this chapter.

§ 502.19
Petitions.
(a) The Commissioner of Food and Drugs, either on his own initiative or on behalf of any interested person who has submitted a petition, may publish a proposal to issue, amend, or revoke, under this part, a regulation prescribing a common or usual name for a food, pursuant to part 10 of this chapter.
(b) If the principal display panel of a food for which a common or usual name regulation is established is too small to accommodate all mandatory requirements, the Commissioner may establish by regulation an acceptable alternative, e.g., a smaller type size.

# Subpart A—General Provisions
§ 507.1
Applicability and status.
(a) The criteria and definitions in this part apply in determining whether an animal food is:
(1) Adulterated within the meaning of:
(i) Section 402(a)(3) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act in that the food has been manufactured under such conditions that it is unfit for food; or
(ii) Section 402(a)(4) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act in that the food has been prepared, packed, or held under insanitary conditions whereby it may have become contaminated with filth, or whereby it may have been rendered injurious to health; and
(2) In violation of section 361 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 264).
(b) The operation of a facility that manufactures, processes, packs, or holds animal food for sale in the United States if the owner, operator, or agent in charge of such facility is required to comply with, and is not in compliance with, section 418 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act or subparts C, D, E, or F of this part and § 507.7 is a prohibited act under section 301(uu) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
(c) Animal food covered by specific current good manufacturing practice regulations also is subject to the requirements of those regulations.
(d) Except as provided by § 507.12, if a facility is required to comply with subpart B of part 507 and is also required to comply with subpart B of part 117 of this chapter because the facility manufactures, processes, packs, or holds human food and animal food, then the facility may choose to comply with the requirements in subpart B of part 117, instead of subpart B of part 507, as to the manufacturing, processing, packing, and holding of animal food at that facility. If a facility is required to comply with subpart C of part 507 and is also required to comply with subpart C of part 117 of this chapter, then the facility may choose to comply with the requirements in subpart C of part 117 as to the manufacturing, processing, packing, and holding of animal food at the facility, instead of subpart C of part 507, provided the food safety plan also addresses hazards for the animal food, if applicable, that require a preventive control. When applying the requirements of part 117 of this chapter to animal food, the term “food” in part 117 includes animal food.
§ 507.3
Definitions.
The definitions and interpretations contained in section 201 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act apply to such terms when used in this part. The following definitions also apply:
Adequate
means that which is needed to accomplish the intended purpose in keeping with good public (human and animal) health practice.
Affiliate
means any facility that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with another facility.
Animal food
means food for animals other than man and includes pet food, animal feed, and raw materials and ingredients.
Audit
means the systematic, independent, and documented examination (through observation, investigation, records review, discussions with employees of the audited entity, and, as appropriate, sampling and laboratory analysis) to assess an audited entity's food safety processes and procedures.
Calendar day
means every day shown on the calendar.
Correction
means an action to identify and correct a problem that occurred during the production of animal food, without other actions associated with a corrective action procedure (such as actions to reduce the likelihood that the problem will recur, evaluate all affected animal food for safety, and prevent affected animal food from entering commerce).
Critical control point
means a point, step, or procedure in a food process at which control can be applied and is essential to prevent or eliminate a food safety hazard or reduce such hazard to an acceptable level.
Environmental pathogen
means a pathogen capable of surviving and persisting within the manufacturing, processing, packing, or holding environment such that food for animals may be contaminated and may result in foodborne illness if that animal food is not treated to significantly minimize or prevent the environmental pathogen. Examples of environmental pathogens for the purposes of this part include
Listeria monocytogenes
and
Salmonella
spp. but do not include the spores of pathogenic sporeforming bacteria.
Facility
means a domestic facility or a foreign facility that is required to register under section 415 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, in accordance with the requirements of part 1, subpart H of this chapter.
Farm
means farm as defined in § 1.227 of this chapter.
FDA
means the Food and Drug Administration.
Food
means food as defined in section 201(f) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and includes raw materials and ingredients.
Food-contact surfaces
are those surfaces that contact animal food and those surfaces from which drainage, or other transfer, onto the animal food or onto surfaces that contact the animal food ordinarily occurs during the normal course of operations. “Food-contact surfaces” includes utensils and animal food-contact surfaces of equipment.
Full-time equivalent employee
is a term used to represent the number of employees of a business entity for the purpose of determining whether the business qualifies for the small business exemption. The number of full-time equivalent employees is determined by dividing the total number of hours of salary or wages paid directly to employees of the business entity and of all of its affiliates and subsidiaries by the number of hours of work in 1 year, 2,080 hours (
i.e.,
40 hours × 52 weeks). If the result is not a whole number, round down to the next lowest whole number.
Harvesting
applies to farms and farm mixed-type facilities and means activities that are traditionally performed on farms for the purpose of removing raw agricultural commodities from the place they were grown or raised and preparing them for use as animal food. Harvesting is limited to activities performed on raw agricultural commodities, or on processed foods created by drying/dehydrating a raw agricultural commodity without additional manufacturing/processing, on a farm. Harvesting does not include activities that transform a raw agricultural commodity into a processed food as defined in section 201(gg) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Examples of harvesting include cutting (or otherwise separating) the edible portion of
the raw agricultural commodity from the crop plant and removing or trimming part of the raw agricultural commodity (
e.g.,
foliage, husks, roots, or stems). Examples of harvesting also include cooling, field coring, filtering, gathering, hulling, shelling, sifting, threshing, trimming of outer leaves of, and washing raw agricultural commodities grown on a farm.
Hazard
means any biological, chemical (including radiological), or physical agent that has the potential to cause illness or injury in humans or animals.
Hazard requiring a preventive control
means a known or reasonably foreseeable hazard for which a person knowledgeable about the safe manufacturing, processing, packing, or holding of animal food would, based on the outcome of a hazard analysis (which includes an assessment of the severity of the illness or injury to humans or animals if the hazard were to occur and the probability that the hazard will occur in the absence of preventive controls), establish one or more preventive controls to significantly minimize or prevent the hazard in an animal food and components to manage those controls (such as monitoring, corrections or corrective actions, verification, and records) as appropriate to the animal food, the facility, and the nature of the preventive control and its role in the facility's food safety system.
Holding
means storage of animal food and also includes activities performed incidental to storage of an animal food (
e.g.,
activities performed for the safe or effective storage of that animal food, such as fumigating animal food during storage, and drying/dehydrating raw agricultural commodities when the drying/dehydrating does not create a distinct commodity (such as drying/dehydrating hay or alfalfa)). Holding also includes activities performed as a practical necessity for the distribution of that animal food (such as blending of the same raw agricultural commodity and breaking down pallets), but does not include activities that transform a raw agricultural commodity into a processed food as defined in section 201(gg) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Holding facilities could include warehouses, cold storage facilities, storage silos, grain elevators, and liquid-storage tanks.
Known or reasonably foreseeable hazard
means a biological, chemical (including radiological), or physical hazard that is known to be, or has the potential to be, associated with the facility or the animal food.
Lot
means the animal food produced during a period of time and identified by an establishment's specific code.
Manufacturing/processing
means making animal food from one or more ingredients, or synthesizing, preparing, treating, modifying, or manipulating animal food, including food crops or ingredients. Examples of manufacturing/processing activities include: Baking, boiling, bottling, canning, cooking, cooling, cutting, distilling, drying/dehydrating raw agricultural commodities to create a distinct commodity (such as drying/dehydrating grapes to produce raisins), evaporating, eviscerating, extracting juice, extruding, formulating, freezing, grinding, homogenizing, irradiating, labeling, milling, mixing, packaging (including modified atmosphere packaging), pasteurizing, peeling, pelleting, rendering, treating to manipulate ripening, trimming, washing, or waxing. For farms and farm mixed-type facilities, manufacturing/processing does not include activities that are part of harvesting, packing, or holding.
Microorganisms
means yeasts, molds, bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and microscopic parasites and includes species that are pathogens. The term “undesirable microorganisms” includes those microorganisms that are pathogens, that subject animal food to decomposition, that indicate that animal food is contaminated with filth, or that otherwise may cause animal food to be adulterated.
Mixed-type facility
means an establishment that engages in both activities that are exempt from registration under section 415 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and activities that require the establishment to be registered. An example of such a facility is a “farm mixed-type facility,” which is an establishment that is a farm, but also conducts activities outside the farm definition that require the establishment to be registered.
Monitor
means to conduct a planned sequence of observations or measurements to assess whether control measures are operating as intended.
Packing
means placing animal food into a container other than packaging the animal food and also includes repacking and activities performed incidental to packing or repacking an animal food (
e.g.,
activities performed for the safe or effective packing or repacking of that animal food (such as sorting, culling, grading, and weighing or conveying incidental to packing or repacking)), but does not include activities that transform a raw agricultural commodity into a processed food as defined in section 201(gg) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
Pathogen
means a microorganism of public (human or animal) health significance.
Pest
refers to any objectionable animals or insects including birds, rodents, flies, and larvae.
Plant
means the building or structure, or parts thereof, used for or in connection with the manufacturing, processing, packing, or holding of animal food.
Preventive controls
means those risk-based, reasonably appropriate procedures, practices, and processes that a person knowledgeable about the safe manufacturing, processing, packing, or holding of animal food would employ to significantly minimize or prevent the hazards identified under the hazard analysis that are consistent with the current scientific understanding of safe food manufacturing, processing, packing, or holding at the time of the analysis.
Preventive controls qualified individual
means a qualified individual who has successfully completed training in the development and application of risk-based preventive controls at least equivalent to that received under a standardized curriculum recognized as adequate by FDA, or is otherwise qualified through job experience to develop and apply a food safety system.

(a)(1) Except as provided by paragraphs (a)(2) and (3) of this section, the receiving facility must establish and implement a risk-based supply-chain program for those raw materials and other ingredients for which the receiving facility has identified a hazard requiring a supply-chain-applied control.
(2) A receiving facility that is an importer, is in compliance with the foreign supplier verification requirements under part 1, subpart L of this chapter, and has documentation of verification activities conducted under § 1.506(e) of this chapter (which provides assurance that the hazards requiring a supply-chain-applied control for the raw material or other ingredient have been significantly minimized or prevented) need not conduct supplier verification activities for that raw material or other ingredient.
(3) The requirements in this subpart do not apply to animal food that is supplied for research or evaluation use, provided that such animal food:
(i) Is not intended for retail sale and is not sold or distributed to the public;
(ii) Is labeled with the statement “Animal food for research or evaluation use”;
(iii) Is supplied in a small quantity that is consistent with a research, analysis, or quality assurance purpose, the animal food is used only for this purpose, and any unused quantity is properly disposed of; and
(iv) Is accompanied with documents, in accordance with the practice of the trade, stating that the animal food will be used for research or evaluation purposes and cannot be sold or distributed to the public.
(b) The supply-chain program must be written.
(c) When a supply-chain-applied control is applied by an entity other than the receiving facility's supplier (
e.g.,
when a non-supplier applies controls to certain produce (
i.e.,
produce covered by part 112 of this chapter), because growing, harvesting, and packing activities are under different management), the receiving facility must:
(1) Verify the supply-chain-applied control; or
(2) Obtain documentation of an appropriate verification activity from another entity, review and assess the entity's applicable documentation, and document that review and assessment.

§ 509.6
Added poisonous or deleterious substances.
(a) Use of an added poisonous or deleterious substance, other than a pesticide chemical, that is also a food additive will be controlled by a regulation issued under section 409 of the act when possible. When such a use cannot be approved under the criteria of section 409 of the act, or when the added poisonous or deleterious substance is not a food additive, a tolerance, regulatory limit, or action level may be established pursuant to the criteria in paragraphs (b), (c), or (d) of this section. Residues resulting from the use of an added poisonous or deleterious substance that is also a pesticide chemical will ordinarily be controlled by a tolerance established in a regulation issued under sections 406, 408, or 409 of the act by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). When such a regulation has not been issued, an action level for an added poisonous or deleterious substance that is also a pesticide chemical may be established by the Food and Drug Administration. The Food and Drug Administration will request EPA to recommend such an action level pursuant to the criteria established in paragraph (d) of this section.
(b) A tolerance for an added poisonous or deleterious substance in any food may be established when the following criteria are met:
(1) The substance cannot be avoided by good manufacturing practice.
(2) The tolerance established is sufficient for the protection of the public health, taking into account the extent of which the presence of the substance cannot be avoided and the other ways in which the consumer may be affected by the same or related poisonous or deleterious substances.
(3) No technological or other changes are foreseeable in the near future that might affect the appropriateness of the tolerance established. Examples of changes that might affect the appropriateness of the tolerance include anticipated improvements in good manufacturing practice that would change the extent to which use of the substance is unavoidable and anticipated studies expected to provide significant new toxicological or use data.
(c) A regulatory limit for an added poisonous or deleterious substance in any food may be established when each of the following criteria is met:
(1) The substance cannot be avoided by current good manufacturing practices.
(2) There is no tolerance established for the substance in the particular food under sections 406, 408, or 409 of the act.
(3) There is insufficient information by which a tolerance may be established for the substance under section 406 of the act or technological changes appear reasonably possible that may
affect the appropriateness of a tolerance. The regulatory limit established represents the level at which food is adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(1) of the act.
(d) An action level for an added poisonous or deleterious substance in any food may be established when the criteria in paragraph (b) of this section are met, except that technological or other changes that might affect the appropriateness of the tolerance are foreseeable in the near future. An action level for an added poisonous or deleterious substance in any food may be established at a level at which the Food and Drug Administration may regard the food as adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(1) of the act, without regard to the criteria in paragraph (b) of this section or in section 406 of the act. An action level will be withdrawn when a tolerance or regulatory limit for the same substance and use has been established.
(e) Tolerances will be established under authority appropriate for action levels (sections 306, 402(a), and 701(a) of the act, together with section 408 or 409 of the act, if appropriate) as well as under authority appropriate for tolerances (sections 406 and 701 of the act). In the event the effectiveness of a tolerance is stayed pursuant to section 701(e)(2) of the act by the filing of an objection, the order establishing the tolerance shall be deemed to be an order establishing an action level until final action is taken upon such objection.
[42 FR 52821, Sept. 30, 1977, as amended at 55 FR 20786, May 21, 1990]
§ 509.7
Unavoidability.
(a) Tolerances and action levels in this part are established at levels based on the unavoidability of the poisonous or deleterious substance concerned and do not establish a permissible level of contamination where it is avoidable.
(b) Compliance with tolerances, regulatory limits, and action levels does not excuse failure to observe either the requirement in section 402(a)(4) of the act that food may not be prepared, packed, or held under insanitary conditions or the other requirements in this chapter that food manufacturers must observe current good manufacturing practices. Evidence obtained through factory inspection or otherwise indicating such a violation renders the food unlawful, even though the amounts of poisonous or deleterious substances are lower than the currently established tolerances, regulatory limits, or action levels. The manufacturer of food must at all times utilize quality control procedures which will reduce contamination to the lowest level currently feasible.
[42 FR 52821, Sept. 30, 1977, as amended at 55 FR 20786, May 21, 1990]
§ 509.15
Use of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB's) in establishments manufacturing food-packaging materials.
(a) Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB's) represent a class of toxic industrial chemicals manufactured and sold under a variety of trade names, including: Aroclor (United States); Phenoclor (France); Colphen (Germany); and Kanaclor (Japan). PCB's are highly stable, heat resistant, and nonflammable chemicals. Industrial uses of PCB's include, or did include in the past, their use as electrical transformer and capacitor fluids, heat transfer fluids, hydraulic fluids, and plasticizers, and in formulations of lubricants, coatings, and inks. Their unique physical and chemical properties and widespread, uncontrolled industrial applications have caused PCB's to be a persistent and ubiquitous contaminant in the environment, causing the contamination of certain foods. In addition, incidents have occurred in which PCB's have directly contaminated animal feeds as a result of industrial accidents (leakage or spillage of PCB fluids from plant equipment). These accidents in turn caused the contamination of food products intended for human consumption (meat, milk and eggs). Investigations by the Food and Drug Administration have revealed that a significant percentage of paper food-packaging material contains PCB's which can migrate to the packaged food. The origin of PCB's in such material is not fully understood. Reclaimed fibers containing carbonless copy paper (contains 3 to 5 percent PCB's) have been identified as a primary source of PCB's in paper products. Some virgin paper products
have also been found to contain PCB's, the source of which is generally attributed to direct contamination from industrial accidents from the use of PCB-containing equipment and machinery in food-packaging manufacturing establishments. Since PCB's are toxic chemicals, the PCB contamination of food-packaging materials as a result of industrial accidents, which can cause the PCB contamination of food, represents a hazard to public health. It is therefore necessary to place certain restrictions on the industrial uses of PCB's in establishments manufacturing food-packaging materials.
(b) The following special provisions are necessary to preclude the accidental PCB contamination of food-packaging materials:
(1) New equipment or machinery for manufacturing food-packaging materials shall not contain or use PCB's.
(2) On or before September 4, 1973, the management of establishments manufacturing food-packaging materials shall:
(i) Have the heat exchange fluid used in existing equipment for manufacturing food-packaging materials sampled and tested to determine whether it contains PCB's or verify the absence of PCB's in such formulations by other appropriate means. On or before Sept. 4, 1973, any such fluid formulated with PCB's must to the fullest extent possible commensurate with current good manufacturing practices be replaced with a heat exchange fluid that does not contain PCB's.
(ii) Eliminate to the fullest extent possible commensurate with current good manufacturing practices from the establishment any other PCB-containing equipment, machinery and materials wherever there is a reasonable expectation that such articles could cause food-packaging materials to become contaminated with PCB's either as a result of normal use or as a result of accident, breakage, or other mishap.
(iii) The toxicity and other characteristics of fluids selected as PCB replacements must be adequately determined so that the least potentially hazardous replacement is used. In making this determination with respect to a given fluid, consideration should be given to (
a
) its toxicity; (
b
) the maximum quantity that could be spilled onto a given quantity of food before it would be noticed, taking into account its color and odor; (
c
) possible signaling devices in the equipment to indicate a loss of fluid, etc.; and (
d
) its environmental stability and tendency to survive and be concentrated through the food chain. The judgment as to whether a replacement fluid is sufficiently non-hazardous is to be made on an individual installation and operation basis.
(c) The provisions of this section do not apply to electrical transformers and condensers containing PCB's in sealed containers.

# Subpart B—Tolerances for Unavoidable Poisonous or Deleterious Substances
§ 509.30
Temporary tolerances for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB's).
(a) Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB's) are toxic, industrial chemicals. Because of their widespread, uncontrolled industrial applications, PCB's have become a persistent and ubiquitous contaminant in the environment. As a result, certain foods and animal feeds, principally those of animal and marine origin, contain PCB's as unavoidable, environmental contaminants. PCB's are transmitted to the food portion (meat, milk, and eggs) of food producing animals ingesting PCB contaminated animal feed. In addition, a significant percentage of paper food-packaging materials contain PCB's which may migrate to the packaged food. The source of PCB's in paper food-packaging materials is primarily of certain types of carbonless copy paper (containing 3 to 5 percent PCB's) in waste paper stocks used for manufacturing recycled paper. Therefore, temporary tolerances for residues of PCB's as unavoidable environmental or industrial contaminants are established for a sufficient period of time following the effective date of this paragraph to permit the elimination of such contaminants at the earliest practicable time. For the purposes of this paragraph, the term
polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB's)
is applicable to mixtures of chlorinated biphenyl compounds, irrespective of which mixture of PCB's is present as the residue. The
temporary tolerances for residues of PCB's are as follows:
(1) 0.2 part per million in finished animal feed for food-producing animals (except the following finished animal feeds: feed concentrates, feed supplements, and feed premixes).
(2) 2 parts per million in animal feed components of animal origin, including fishmeal and other by-products of marine origin and in finished animal feed concentrates, supplements, and premixes intended for food-producing animals.
(3) 10 parts per million in paper food-packaging material intended for or used with finished animal feed and any components intended for animal feeds. The tolerance shall not apply to paper food-packaging material separated from the food therein by a functional barrier which is impermeable to migration of PCB's.
(b) A compilation entitled “Analytical Methodology for Polychlorinated Biphenyls, February 1973” for determining compliance with the tolerances established in this section is available from the Dockets Management Staff, Food and Drug Administration, 5630 Fishers Lane, rm. 1061, Rockville, MD 20852.

# Subpart B—Specific Administrative Rulings and Decisions
§ 510.105
Labeling of drugs for use in milk-producing animals.
(a) Part 526 of this chapter provides for new animal drugs intended for intramammary use in animals and includes conditions of use intended to prevent the contamination of milk from the use of such drugs.
(b) Preparations containing antibiotics and other potent drugs labeled with directions for use in milk-producing animals will be misbranded under section 502(f)(2) of the act unless their labeling bears appropriate warnings and directions for use to avoid adulteration of milk under section 402(a)(2)(c)(ii) of the act.
(c) It is the position of the Food and Drug Administration that the labeling for such preparations should bear a clear warning that either:
(1) The article should not be administered to animals producing milk, since to do so would result in contamination of the milk; or
(2) The label should bear the following statement: “Warning: Milk that has been taken from animals during treatment and for __ hours after the latest treatment must not be used for food”, the blank being filled in with the figure that the manufacturer has determined by appropriate investigation is needed to insure that the milk will not carry violative residues resulting from use of the preparation. If the use of the preparation as recommended does not result in contamination of the milk, neither of the above warning statements is required.
[40 FR 13807, Mar. 27, 1975, as amended at 63 FR 32980, June 17, 1998; 64 FR 51241, Sept. 22, 1999]
§ 510.106
Labeling of antibiotic and antibiotic-containing drugs intended for use in milk-producing animals.
Whenever the labeling of an antibiotic drug included in the regulations in this chapter suggests or recommends its use in milk-producing animals, the label of such drugs shall bear either the statement “Warning: Not for use in animals producing milk, since this use will result in contamination of the milk” or the statement “Warning: Milk that has been taken from animals during treatment and for __hours after the latest treatment must not be used for food”, the blank being filled in with the figure that the Commissioner has authorized the manufacturer of the drug to use. The Commissioner shall determine what such figures shall be from information submitted by the manufacturer and which the Commissioner considers is adequate to prove that period of time after the latest treatment that the milk from treated animals will contain no violative residues from use of the preparation. If the Commissioner determines from the information submitted that the use of the antibiotic drug as recommended does not result in its appearance in the milk, the Commissioner may exempt the drug from bearing either of the above warning statements.
[63 FR 32980, June 17, 1998]
§ 510.110
Antibiotics used in food-producing animals.
(a) The Food and Drug Administration in the interest of fulfilling its responsibilities with regard to protection of the public health has requested an evaluation of the public health aspects of the use of antibiotics in veterinary medical and nonmedical uses. There is particular concern with regard to the potential hazards associated with the extensive use of antibiotics administered to food-producing animals. Accordingly, an ad hoc committee on the Veterinary Medical and Nonmedical Uses of Antibiotics was established by the Food and Drug Administration to study and advise the Commissioner of Food and Drugs on the uses of antibiotics in veterinary medicine and for various nonmedical purposes as such uses may affect the enforcement of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act with respect to their safety and effectiveness.
(b) Based upon an evaluation of the conclusions of said Committee and other relevant material, § 510.112 was published in the
Federal Register
of August 23, 1966 (31 FR 11141), asking sponsors of drugs containing any antibiotic intended for use in food-producing animals to submit data to establish whether such antibiotic and its metabolites are present as residues in edible tissues, milk, and eggs from treated animals. The data on the residues of antibiotics in milk from intramammary infusion preparations were requested within 60 days and the data on all other products were requested within 180 days following the date of publication of § 510.112 in the
Federal Register.
(c) An evaluation of the data now available shows that use of many antibiotic preparations cause residues in edible products of treated animals for varying and, in some cases, for long periods of time following the last administration. Because of the accumulation of new information with regard to the development of resistance of bacteria to antibiotics, the ability of bacteria to transfer this resistance, and the development of sensitivity to antibiotics in humans, unauthorized and unsafe residues of antibiotics cannot be permitted in food obtained from treated animals.
(d) Based on evaluation of information available, including the conclusions of the aforementioned ad hoc Committee, the Commissioner concludes that antibiotic preparations intended for use in food-producing animals, other than topical and ophthalmic preparations, are not generally recognized among qualified experts as having been shown to be safe for their intended use(s) within the meaning of section 201(s) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
(e) Therefore, all exemptions from the provisions of section 409 of the act for use of antibiotics in food-producing animals based on sanctions or approvals granted prior to enactment of the Food Additives Amendment of 1958 (Pub. L. 85-929; 72 Stat. 1784) will be revoked and the uses which are concluded to be safe will be covered by food additive regulations. On those
products for which there are inadequate residue data, actions will be initiated to withdraw approval of new-drug applications under the provisions of section 505 of the act. Antibiotic preparations, other than those for topical and ophthalmic application in food-producing animals, which are not covered by food additive regulations will be subject to regulatory action within 180 days after publication of the forthcoming revocation order.
(f) Because of the variation in the period of time that antibiotic residues may remain in edible products from treated animals, all injectable, intramammary infusion, intrauterine, and oral preparations, including medicated premixes intended for use in food-producing animals, are deemed to be new drugs as well as food additives.
[40 FR 13807, Mar. 27, 1975, as amended at 54 FR 18280, Apr. 28, 1989; 64 FR 403, Jan. 5, 1999]
§ 510.112
Antibiotics used in veterinary medicine and for nonmedical purposes; required data.
(a) An ad hoc committee, Committee on the Veterinary Medical and Nonmedical Uses of Antibiotics, was formed by the Food and Drug Administration to study, and advise the Commissioner on, the use of antibiotics in veterinary medicine and for various nonmedical purposes as such uses may affect the enforcement of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act with respect to the safety and effectiveness of such substances. A copy of the report may be obtained from the Food and Drug Administration, Office of Public Affairs, Room 15-05, Parklawn Building, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857.
(b) On the basis of the report of the Committee and other information, sponsors of drugs containing any antibiotic intended for use in food-producing animals shall submit data for determining whether or not such antibiotics and their metabolites are present as residues in edible tissues, milk, and eggs from treated animals; however, in the case of a drug for which such data have already been submitted and for which a regulation has been promulgated under section 409 of the act, only such data as has been accumulated since the issuance of the regulation need be submitted.
(c) The required data shall be submitted within 180 days of the date of publication of this section in the
Federal Register
; except that in the case of data on intramammary infusion preparations the data shall be submitted within 60 days of such publication. Data demonstrating the absence in milk of residues of intramammary infusion preparations when used as directed in their labeling are needed within the 60-day period because of the importance of milk in the human diet.
(d) Regulatory proceedings including revocation of prior sanctions, or actions to suspend or amend new drug or antibiotic approvals granted prior to passage of the Food Additives Amendment of 1958 (72 Stat. 1784), may be initiated with regard to the continued marketing of any antibiotic preparation on which the required information is not submitted within the period of time prescribed by paragraph (c) of this section.
(e) Questions relating to the acceptability of proposed research protocols and assay methods for determining the amount of antibiotic residues in food should be directed to the Director, Center for Veterinary Medicine, Food and Drug Administration, 7500 Standish Pl., Rockville, MD 20855.

(g) The requester may withdraw the request at any time before the notification provided for in § 510.207(a) of this chapter has been made publicly available.
§ 510.206
Review of information supporting actions to establish or amend an import tolerance.
In establishing or amending an import tolerance, the Commissioner shall rely on data sufficient to demonstrate that a proposed tolerance is safe based on similar food safety criteria used by the Commissioner to establish tolerances for applications for new animal drugs filed under section 512(b)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. In establishing or amending an import tolerance, the Commissioner will give appropriate consideration to the anticipated residue concentrations and conditions of use of the new animal drug specified.
§ 510.207
Disclosure of information submitted in a request.
(a) When a request is determined to be complete for FDA's consideration, the Commissioner will provide public notification of the request containing the name of the requester and a brief description of the request in general terms. A copy of the notification will be sent to the requester at the time the information is made available to the public.
(b) Any notification establishing, amending, or revoking an import tolerance will be made publicly available. A summary of the basis for the decision will be publicly released in accordance with the provisions of part 20 of this chapter. If FDA determines that the new animal drug referred to in the request is a new animal drug that induces cancer when ingested by people or animals, and the requester complies with the requirements of §§ 500.80 through 500.92 of this chapter (Subpart E, Regulation of Carcinogenic Compounds Used in Food-Producing Animals), the regulatory method for ascertaining the marker residue in the target tissue will be made publicly available. All information and safety data submitted with the request, or
previously submitted information incorporated in, and considered as part of, a request on the basis of specific reference to such information, shall be available for public disclosure, also in accordance with the provisions of part 20 of this chapter. Trade secrets and confidential commercial or financial information are exempted from release under § 20.61 of this chapter.
§ 510.209
Establishment, denial, or amendment of an import tolerance.
(a) If an import tolerance is established or amended, the Commissioner will provide public notification of the action, which will be effective from the date of public notification. A copy of the notification will be sent to any requestor at the time the information is made available to the public.
(b) If a request to establish or amend an import tolerance is denied, a notification of the denial will be made publicly available, and a copy of the denial letter, including the reasons for such action, will be sent to the requester.
(c) A tolerance established in an approved NADA or conditionally approved CNADA will supersede an existing import tolerance. In the event the conditionally approved CNADA is not renewed or is withdrawn, or such drug does not achieve approval under section 512 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act within 5 years following the date of the conditional approval, the Agency will reinstate the import tolerance unless § 510.210(a)(1) or (a)(2) is applicable at that time.

[64 FR 63203, Nov. 19, 1999, as amended at 72 FR 69121, Dec. 6, 2007]

# Subpart E—Requirements for Specific New Animal Drugs
§ 510.410
Corticosteroids for oral, injectable, and ophthalmic use in animals; warnings and labeling requirements.
(a) The Food and Drug Administration has received reports of side effects associated with the oral, injectable, and ophthalmic use of corticosteroid animal drugs. The use of these drugs administered orally or by injection has resulted in premature parturition when administered during the last trimester of pregnancy. Premature parturition may be followed by dystocia, fetal death, retained placenta, and metritis. Additionally, corticosteroids used in dogs, rabbits, and rodents during pregnancy have produced cleft palate in offspring. Use in dogs has resulted in other congenital anomalies, including deformed forelegs, phocomelia, and anasarca. Drugs subject to this section are required to carry the veterinary
prescription legend and are subject to the labeling requirements of § 201.105 of this chapter.
(b) In view of these potentially serious side effects, the Food and Drug Administration has concluded that the labeling on or within packaged corticosteroid-containing preparations intended for animal use shall bear conspicuously the following warning statement:
Warning:
Clinical and experimental data have demonstrated that corticosteroids administered orally or by injection to animals may induce the first stage of parturition if used during the last trimester of pregnancy and may precipitate premature parturition followed by dystocia, fetal death, retained placenta, and metritis.
Additionally, corticosteroids administered to dogs, rabbits, and rodents during pregnancy have resulted in cleft palate in offspring. Corticosteroids administered to dogs during pregnancy have also resulted in other congenital anomalies, including deformed forelegs, phocomelia, and anasarca.
[49 FR 48535, Dec. 13, 1984]
§ 510.440
Injectable iron preparations.
There has been an increasing interest in the use of injectable iron compounds for the prevention or treatment of iron-deficiency anemia in animals. Although some such preparations have been shown to be safe, such articles are regarded as new animal drugs within the meaning of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Accordingly, an approved new animal drug application is required prior to the marketing of such preparations within the jurisdiction of the act. In addition to the need for demonstrating the safety of such articles, the labeling of such preparations should not only recommend appropriate dosages of iron but also declare the amount (in milligrams) of available iron (Fe) per milliliter of the subject product.
§ 510.455
Requirements for free-choice medicated feeds.
(a)
What is free-choice medicated feed?
For the purpose of this part, free-choice medicated feed is medicated feed that is placed in feeding or grazing areas and is not intended to be consumed fully at a single feeding or to constitute the entire diet of the animal. Free-choice feeds include, but are not limited to, medicated blocks (agglomerated feed compressed or rendered into a solid mass and cohesive enough to hold its form), mineral mixes, and liquid feed tank supplements (“lick tank” supplements) containing one or more new animal drugs. The manufacture of medicated free-choice feeds is subject to the current good manufacturing practice regulations in part 225 of this chapter for medicated feeds.
(b)
What is required for new animal drugs intended for use in free-choice feed?
Any new animal drug intended for use in free-choice feed must be approved for such use under section 512 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 360(b)) or listed in the index under section 572 of the act (21 U.S.C. 360ccc-1). Such approvals under section 512 of the act must be:
(1) An original new animal drug application (NADA),
(2) A supplemental NADA, or
(3) An abbreviated NADA.
(c)
What are the approval requirements under section 512 of the act for new animal drugs intended for use in free-choice feed?
An approval under section 512 of the act for a Type A medicated article intended for use in free-choice feed must contain the following information:
(1) Data, or reference to data in a master file (MF), showing that the target animal consumes the new animal drug in the Type C free-choice feed in an amount that is safe and effective (consumption/effectiveness data); and
(2) Data, or reference to data in an MF, showing the relevant ranges of conditions under which the drug will be chemically and physically stable in the Type C free-choice feed under field conditions.
(d)
How are consumption/effectiveness and/or stability data to be submitted?
The data must be submitted as follows:
(1) Directly in the NADA, by a sponsor; and/or
(2) To an MF that a sponsor may then reference in its NADA with written consent of the MF holder.
(e)
What will be stated in the published approval for a new animal drug intended for use in free-choice feed?
The approval of a new animal drug intended for use
in free-choice feed, as published in this subchapter, will include:
(1) The formula and/or specifications of the free-choice medicated feed, where the owner of this information requests such publication, or
(2) A statement that the approval has been granted for a proprietary formula and/or specifications.
(f)
When is a medicated feed mill license required for the manufacture of a free-choice medicated feed?

# PART 511—NEW ANIMAL DRUGS FOR INVESTIGATIONAL USE
Sec.
511.1
New animal drugs for investigational use exempt from section 512(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
511.3
Definitions.

# Authority:
21 U.S.C. 321, 351, 352, 353, 360b, 371.
§ 511.1
New animal drugs for investigational use exempt from section 512(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
(a)
New animal drugs for tests in vitro and in laboratory research animals.
(1) A shipment or other delivery of a new animal drug or animal feed bearing or containing a new animal drug intended solely for tests in vitro or in animals used only for laboratory research purposes shall be exempt from section 512 (a) and (m) of the act if it is labeled as follows:
Caution.
Contains a new animal drug for investigational use only in laboratory research animals or for tests in vitro. Not for use in humans.
(2) The person distributing or causing the distribution of new animal drugs for tests in vitro or in animals used only for laboratory research purposes under this exemption shall use due diligence to assure that the consignee is regularly engaged in conducting such tests and that the shipment of the new animal drug will actually be used for tests in vitro or in animals used only for laboratory research.
(3) The person who introduced such shipment or who delivered the new animal drug for introduction into interstate commerce shall maintain adequate records showing the name and post office address of the expert or expert organization to whom the new animal drug is shipped and the date, quantity, and batch or code mark of each shipment and delivery for a period of 2 years after such shipment and delivery. Upon the request of a properly authorized employee of the Department at reasonable times, he shall make such records available for inspection and copying.
(4) The exemption allowed in this paragraph shall not apply to any new animal drug intended for in vitro use in the regular course of diagnosing or treating disease, including antibacterial sensitivity discs impregnated with any new animal drug or drugs, which discs are intended for use in determining susceptibility of microorganisms to the new animal drug or drugs.
(b)
New animal drugs for clinical investigation in animals.
A shipment or other delivery of a new animal drug or an animal feed containing a new animal drug intended for clinical investigational use in animals shall be exempt
from section 512(a) and (m) of the act if all the following conditions are met:
(1) The label shall bear the statements:
Caution.
Contains a new animal drug for use only in investigational animals in clinical trials. Not for use in humans. Edible products of investigational animals are not to be used for food unless authorization has been granted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
In the case of containers too small or otherwise unable to accommodate a label with sufficient space to bear the caution statements required by paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, the statements may be included on the carton label and other labeling on or within the package from which the new animal drug is to be dispensed.
(2) The person or firm distributing or causing the distribution of the new animal drug or animal feed containing a new animal drug shall use due diligence to assure that the new animal drug or animal feed containing a new animal drug will actually be used for tests in animals and is not used in humans.
(3) The person who introduced such shipment or who delivered the new animal drug or animal feed containing a new animal drug for introduction into interstate commerce shall maintain adequate records showing the name and post office address of the investigator to whom the new animal drug or animal feed containing a new animal drug is shipped and the date, quantity, and batch or code mark of each shipment and delivery for a period of 2 years after such shipment and delivery. Upon the request of a properly authorized employee of the Department at reasonable times, such records shall be made available for inspection and copying.
(4) Prior to shipment of the new animal drug for clinical tests in animals, the sponsor of the investigation shall submit in triplicate to FDA a “Notice of Claimed Investigational Exemption for a New Animal Drug” including a signed statement containing the following information:
(i) The identity of the new animal drug.
(ii) All labeling and other pertinent information to be supplied to the investigators. When such pertinent information includes nonclinical laboratory studies, the information shall include, with respect to each nonclinical study, either a statement that the study was conducted in compliance with the requirements set forth in part 58 of this chapter, or, if the study was not conducted in compliance with such regulations, a brief statement of the reason for the noncompliance.
(iii) The name and address of each clinical investigator.
(iv) The approximate number of animals to be treated (or if not available, the amount of new animal drug to be shipped).
(v) If the new animal drug is given to food-producing animals, the statement shall contain the following additional information:
(
a
) A commitment that the edible products from such animals shall not be used for food without prior authorization in accordance with the provisions prescribed in this section.
(
b
) Approximate dates of the beginning and end of the experiment or series of experiments.
(
c
) The maximum daily dose(s) to be administered to a given species, the size of animal, maximum duration of administration, method(s) of administration, and proposed withdrawal time, if any.
(vi) If a sponsor has transferred any obligations for the conduct of any clinical study to a contract research organization, a statement containing the name and address of the contract research organization, identification of the clinical study, and a listing of the obligations transferred. If all obligations governing the conduct of the study have been transferred, a general statement of this transfer—in lieu of a listing of the specific obligations transferred—may be submitted.
(5) Authorization for use of edible products derived from a treated food-producing animal may be granted under the provisions of this section and when the following specified conditions are met, except that in the case of an animal administered any unlicensed experimental veterinary biological product regulated under the viruses,
serums, toxins statute (21 U.S.C., chapter V, sec. 151
et seq.
) the product shall be exempt from the requirements of this section when U.S. Department of Agriculture approval has been obtained as provided in 9 CFR 103.2. Conditional authorization may be granted in advance of identification of the name(s) and address(es) of the clinical investigator(s) as required by paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section. Information required for authorization shall include, in addition to all other requirements of this section, the following:
(i) Data to show that consumption of food derived from animals treated at the maximum levels with the minimum withdrawal periods, if any, specified in accordance with paragraph (b)(4)(v)(
c
) of this section, will not be inconsistent with the public health; or
(ii) Data to show that food derived from animals treated at the maximum levels and with the minimum withdrawal periods, if any, specified in accordance with paragraph (b)(4)(v)(
c
) of this section, does not contain drug residues or metabolites.
(iii) The name and location of the packing plant where the animals will be processed, except that this requirement may be waived, on request, by the terms of the authorization.
Authorizations granted under this paragraph do not exempt investigational animals and their products from compliance with other applicable inspection requirements. Any person who contests a refusal to grant such authorization shall have an opportunity for a regulatory hearing before FDA pursuant to part 16 of this chapter.
(6) On written request of FDA, the sponsor shall submit any additional information reported to or otherwise received by him with respect to the investigation deemed necessary to facilitate a determination whether there are grounds in the interest of public health for terminating the exemption.
(7) The sponsor shall assure himself that the new animal drug is shipped only to investigators who:
(i) Are qualified by scientific training and/experience to evaluate the safety and/or effectiveness of the new animal drug.
(ii) Shall maintain complete records of the investigations, including complete records of the receipt and disposition of each shipment or delivery of the new animal drug under investigation. Copies of all records of the investigation shall be retained by the investigator for 2 years after the termination of the investigation or approval of a new animal drug application.
(iii) Shall furnish adequate and timely reports of the investigation to the sponsor.
(8) The sponsor:
(i) Shall retain all reports received from investigators for 2 years after the termination of the investigation or approval of a new animal drug application and make such reports available to a duly authorized employee of the Department for inspection at all reasonable times.
(ii) Shall provide for current monitoring of the investigation by a person qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate information obtained from the investigation, and shall promptly investigate and report to FDA and to all investigators any findings associated with use of the new animal drug that may suggest significant hazards pertinent to the safety of the new animal drug.
(iii) Shall not unduly prolong distribution of the new animal drug for investigational use.
(iv) Shall not, nor shall any person acting for or on behalf of the sponsor, represent that the new animal drug is safe or effective for the purposes for which it is under investigation. This requirement is not intended to restrict the full exchange of scientific information.
(v) Shall not commercially distribute nor test-market the new animal drug until a new animal drug application is approved pursuant to section 512(c) of the act.
(9) If the shipment or other delivery of the new animal drug is imported or offered for importation into the United States for clinical investigational use in animals, it shall also meet the following conditions:
(i) The importer of all such shipments or deliveries is an agent of the foreign exporter residing in the United States or the ultimate consignee, which person has, prior to such shipments and deliveries, informed FDA of
his intention to import the new animal drug as sponsor in compliance with the conditions prescribed in this subdivision; or
(ii) The new animal drug is shipped directly to a scientific institution with adequate facilities and qualified personnel to conduct laboratory or clinical investigations and is intended solely for use in such institutions and which institution has submitted a statement as sponsor of the investigation.
(10) The sponsor shall submit either a claim for categorical exclusion under § 25.30 or § 25.33 of this chapter or an environmental assessment under § 25.40 of this chapter.
(c)
Disqualification of a clinical investigator.
(1) If FDA has information indicating that an investigator (including a sponsor-investigator) has repeatedly or deliberately failed to comply with the conditions of these exempting regulations or has repeatedly or deliberately submitted to FDA or to the sponsor false information in any required report, the Center for Veterinary Medicine will furnish the investigator written notice of the matter complained of and offer the investigator an opportunity to explain the matter in writing, or, at the option of the investigator, in an informal conference. If an explanation is offered and accepted by the Center for Veterinary Medicine, the Center will discontinue the disqualification proceeding. If an explanation is offered but not accepted by the Center for Veterinary Medicine, the investigator will be given an opportunity for a regulatory hearing under part 16 of this chapter on the question of whether the investigator is eligible to receive test articles under this part and eligible to conduct:
(i) Any clinical investigation that supports an application for a research or marketing permit for products regulated by FDA; and
(ii) Any nonclinical laboratory study intended to support an application for a research or marketing permit for a new animal drug.
(2) After evaluating all available information, including any explanation presented by the investigator, if the Commissioner determines that the investigator has repeatedly or deliberately failed to comply with the conditions of the exempting regulations in this subchapter, or has repeatedly or deliberately submitted to FDA or to the sponsor false information in any required report, the Commissioner will notify the investigator and the sponsor of any investigation in which the investigator has been named as a participant that the investigator is not eligible to receive test articles under this part. The notification to the investigator and sponsor will provide a statement of the basis for such determination. The notification also will explain that an investigator determined to be ineligible to receive test articles under this part will be ineligible to conduct:
(i) Any clinical investigation that supports an application for a research or marketing permit for products regulated by FDA, including drugs, biologics, devices, new animal drugs, foods, including dietary supplements, that bear a nutrient content claim or a health claim, infant formulas, food and color additives, and tobacco products; and
(ii) Any nonclinical laboratory study intended to support an application for a research or marketing permit for a new animal drug.
(3) Each application or submission to FDA under the provisions of this chapter containing data reported by an investigator who has been determined to be ineligible to receive FDA-regulated test articles is subject to examination to determine whether the investigator has submitted unreliable data that are essential to the continuation of an investigation or essential to the approval of a marketing application, or essential to the continued marketing of an FDA-regulated product.
(4) If the Commissioner determines, after the unreliable data submitted by the investigator are eliminated from consideration, that the data remaining are inadequate to support a conclusion that it is reasonably safe to continue the investigation, the Commissioner will notify the sponsor, who shall have an opportunity for a regulatory hearing under part 16 of this chapter. If a danger to the public health exists, however, the Commissioner shall terminate the exemption immediately and notify the sponsor of the termination.
In such case, the sponsor shall have an opportunity for a regulatory hearing before FDA under part 16 on the question of whether the exemption should be reinstated. The determination that an investigation may not be considered in support of a research or marketing application or a notification or petition submission does not, however, relieve the sponsor of any obligation under any other applicable regulation to submit to FDA the results of the investigation.
(5) If the Commissioner determines, after the unreliable data submitted by the investigator are eliminated from consideration, that the continued approval of the product for which the data were submitted cannot be justified, the Commissioner will proceed to withdraw approval of the product in accordance with the applicable provisions of the relevant statutes.
(6) An investigator who has been determined to be ineligible under paragraph (c)(2) of this section may be reinstated as eligible when the Commissioner determines that the investigator has presented adequate assurances that the investigator will employ all test articles, and will conduct any clinical investigation that supports an application for a research or marketing permit for products regulated by FDA and any nonclinical laboratory study intended to support an application for a research or marketing permit for a new animal drug, solely in compliance with the applicable provisions of this chapter.
(d)
Termination of exemption.
If the Commissioner finds that:
(1) The sponsor of the investigation has failed to comply with any of the conditions for the exemption established under this section, or
(2) The continuance of the investigation is unsafe or otherwise contrary to the public interest or the drug is being or has been used for purposes other than bona fide scientific investigation, he shall first notify the sponsor and invite his immediate correction. If the conditions of the exemption are not immediately met, the sponsor shall have an opportunity for a regulatory hearing before FDA pursuant of part 16 of this chapter on whether the exemption should be terminated. If the exemption is terminated the sponsor shall recall or have destroyed the unused supplies of the new animal drug.
(e)
Statements and requests.
“Notice(s) of Claimed Investigational Exemption for a New Animal Drug” and requests for authorization to use investigational animals and their products for food should be addressed to the Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration, Center for Veterinary Medicine, 7500 Standish Pl., Rockville, MD 20855.
(f)
Contract research organizations.
(1) For purposes of this part and part 514,
contract research organization
means a person that assumes, as an independent contractor with the sponsor, one or more of the obligations of a sponsor, e.g., design of a protocol, selection or monitoring of investigations, evaluation of reports, and preparation of materials to be submitted to FDA.
(2) A sponsor may transfer responsibility for any or all of the obligations set forth in this part to a contract research organization. Any such transfer shall be in writing and, if not all obligations are transferred, shall describe each of the obligations being assumed by the contract research organization. If all obligations are transferred, a general statement that all obligations have been transferred is acceptable. Any obligation not covered by the written description shall be deemed not to have been transferred.
(3) A contract research organization that assumes any obligation of a sponsor shall comply with the specific regulations in this chapter applicable to this obligation and shall be subject to the same regulatory action as a sponsor for failure to comply with any obligation assumed under these regulations. Thus, all references to
sponsor
in this part apply to a contract research organization to the extent that it assumes one or more obligations of the sponsor.
(g)
Index of legally marketed unapproved new animal drugs for minor species.
All provisions of part 511 apply to new animal drugs for investigational use in support of indexing, as described
in section 572 of the act, subject to the provisions of § 516.125 of this chapter.
[40 FR 13823, Mar. 27, 1975, as amended at 41 FR 48268, Nov. 2, 1976; 42 FR 15675, Mar. 22, 1977; 50 FR 7517, Feb. 22, 1985; 50 FR 16668, Apr. 26, 1985; 52 FR 8847, Mar. 19, 1987; 54 FR 18280, Apr. 28, 1989; 57 FR 6475, Feb. 25, 1992; 62 FR 40599, July 29, 1997; 72 FR 69121, Dec. 6, 2007; 77 FR 25359, Apr. 30, 2012; 82 FR 61446, Dec. 28, 2017]
§ 511.3
Definitions.
As used in this part:
Contract research organization
means a person that assumes, as an independent contractor with the sponsor, one or more of the obligations of a sponsor, e.g., design of a protocol, selection or monitoring of investigations, evaluation of reports, and preparation of materials to be submitted to the Food and Drug Administration.
Investigator
means an individual who actually conducts a clinical investigation (i.e., under whose immediate direction the drug is administered or dispensed to a subject). In the event an investigation is conducted by a team of individuals, the investigator is the responsible leader of the team. “Subinvestigator” includes any other individual member of that team.
Sponsor
means a person who takes responsibility for and initiates a clinical investigation. The sponsor may be an individual or pharmaceutical company, governmental agency, academic institution, private organization, or other organization. The sponsor does not actually conduct the investigation unless the sponsor is a sponsor-investigator. A person other than an individual that uses one or more of its own employees to conduct an investigation that it has initiated is a sponsor, not a sponsor-investigator, and the employees are investigators.
Sponsor-Investigator
means an individual who both initiates and conducts an investigation, and under whose immediate direction the investigational drug is administered or dispensed. The term does not include any person other than an individual. The requirements applicable to a sponsor-investigator under this part include both those applicable to an investigator and a sponsor.

§ 514.4
Substantial evidence.
(a)
Definition of substantial evidence.
Substantial evidence means evidence consisting of one or more adequate and well-controlled studies, such as a study in a target species, study in laboratory animals, field study, bioequivalence study, or an in vitro study, on the basis of which it could fairly and reasonably be concluded by experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the effectiveness of the new animal drug involved that the new animal drug will have the effect it purports or is represented to have under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling or proposed labeling thereof. Substantial evidence shall include such adequate and well-controlled studies that are, as a matter of sound scientific judgment, necessary to establish that a new animal drug will have its intended effect.
(b)
Characteristics of substantial evidence
—(1)
Qualifications of experts.
Any study that is intended to be part of substantial evidence of the effectiveness of a new animal drug shall be conducted by experts qualified by scientific training and experience.
(2)
Intended uses and conditions of use.
Substantial evidence of effectiveness of a new animal drug shall demonstrate that the new animal drug is effective for each intended use and associated conditions of use for and under which approval is sought.
(i)
Dose range labeling.
Sponsors should, to the extent possible, provide for a dose range because it increases the utility of the new animal drug by providing the user flexibility in the selection of a safe and effective dose. In general, substantial evidence to support dose range labeling for a new animal drug intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease must consist of at least one adequate and well-controlled study on the basis of which qualified experts could fairly and reasonably conclude that the new animal drug will be effective for the intended use at the lowest dose of the dose range suggested in the proposed labeling for that intended use. Substantial evidence to support dose range labeling for a new animal drug intended to affect the structure or function of the body of an animal generally must consist of at least one adequate and well-controlled study on the basis of which qualified experts could fairly and reasonably conclude that the new animal drug will be effective for the intended use at all doses within the range suggested in the proposed labeling for the intended use.
(ii) [Reserved]
(3)
Studies
—(i)
Number.
Substantial evidence of the effectiveness of a new animal drug for each intended use and associated conditions of use shall consist of a sufficient number of current adequate and well-controlled studies of sufficient quality and persuasiveness to permit qualified experts:
(A) To determine that the parameters selected for measurement and the measured responses reliably reflect the effectiveness of the new animal drug;
(B) To determine that the results obtained are likely to be repeatable, and that valid inferences can be drawn to the target animal population; and
(C) To conclude that the new animal drug is effective for the intended use at the dose or dose range and associated conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling.
(ii)
Types.
Adequate and well-controlled studies that are intended to provide substantial evidence of the effectiveness of a new animal drug may include, but are not limited to, published studies, foreign studies, studies using models, and studies conducted by or on behalf of the sponsor. Studies using models shall be validated to establish an adequate relationship of parameters measured and effects observed in the model with one or more significant effects of treatment.
(c)
Substantial evidence for combination new animal drugs
—(1)
Definitions.
The following definitions of terms apply to this section:
(i)

§ 514.5
Presubmission conferences.
(a)
General principle underlying the conduct of a presubmission conference.
The general principle underlying the conduct of any presubmission conference is that there should be candid, full, and open communication.
(b)
Requesting a presubmission conference.
A potential applicant is entitled to one or more conferences prior to the submission of an NADA, supplemental NADA, or an ANADA to reach an agreement establishing part or all of a submission or investigational requirement. A potential applicant's request for a presubmission conference must be submitted to FDA in a signed letter. The letter must include a proposed agenda that clearly outlines the scope, purpose, and objectives of the presubmission conference and must list the names and positions of the representatives who are expected to attend the presubmission conference on behalf of the applicant.
(c)
Timing.
A potential applicant may request one or more presubmission conferences at any time prior to the filing of a NADA, supplemental NADA, or an ANADA. A request for a presubmission conference must be received by FDA at least 30 calendar days in advance of the requested conference date. FDA will schedule the presubmission conference at a time agreeable to both FDA and the potential applicant.
(d)
Advance information.
The potential applicant must provide to FDA, at least 30 calendar days before a scheduled presubmission conference, a detailed agenda, a copy of any materials to be presented at the conference, a list of proposed indications and, if available, a copy of the proposed labeling for the product under consideration, and copies of materials evaluated or referenced relative to issues listed in the agenda for the conference. If the materials are not provided or are not sufficient to provide the basis for meaningful discussion, FDA may elect to postpone part or all of the meeting until sufficient materials are provided to FDA.
(e)
Conduct of a presubmission conference.
The potential applicant and FDA may each bring consultants to the presubmission conference. The presubmission conference(s) will be directed primarily at establishing agreement between FDA and the potential applicant regarding a submission or investigational requirement. The submission or investigational requirement may include, among other things, the number, types, and general design of studies that are necessary to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of a new animal drug for the intended uses and conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling for the new animal drug.
(f)
Documentation of a presubmission conference
—(1)
Memorandum of conference
—(i)
Preparation.
FDA will prepare a memorandum for each presubmission conference that will include, among other things, any background pertinent to the request for meeting; a summary of the key points of discussion; agreements; and action items and assignments of responsibility. That portion of the memorandum of conference that documents any agreements reached regarding all or part of a submission or investigational requirement will be included under the heading “Presubmission Conference Agreement.” If the presubmission conference agreement section of the memorandum is silent on an issue, including one that was discussed in the conference or addressed by materials provided for the conference, such silence does not constitute agreement between FDA and the potential applicant on the issue.
(ii)
Sending a copy to the potential applicant.
FDA will send a copy of the memorandum to the potential applicant for review no later than 45 calendar days after the date of the conference
(iii)
Requests for changes or clarification.
If a potential applicant requests changes to, or clarification of, the substance of the memorandum, the request must be sent to FDA within 30 calendar days from the date a copy of the memorandum is sent to the applicant. If the potential applicant requests changes or clarification, FDA will send the potential applicant a response to their request no later than 45 calendar days after the date of receipt of the request.
(iv)
Administrative record.
A copy of FDA's original memorandum of conference and, as appropriate, a copy of an amended memorandum to correct or clarify the content of the original memorandum will be made part of the administrative file.
(2)
Field studies.
If FDA requires more than one field study to establish by substantial evidence that the new animal drug is effective for its intended uses under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling, FDA will provide written scientific justification for requiring more than one field study. Such justification must be provided no later than 25 calendar days after the date of the conference at which the requirement for more than one field study is established. If FDA does not believe more than one field study is required but the potential applicant voluntarily proposes to conduct more than one field study, FDA will not provide such written justification. If FDA requires one field study to be conducted at multiple locations, FDA will provide justification for requiring multiple locations verbally during the presubmission conference and in writing as part of the memorandum of conference.
(g)
Modification of presubmission conference agreements.
An agreement made under a presubmission conference requested under section 512(b)(3) of the act and documented in a memorandum of conference is binding on the potential applicant and FDA and may only be modified if:
(1) FDA and the potential applicant mutually agree to modify, in part or in whole, the agreement and such modification is documented and provided to the potential applicant as described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section; or
(2) FDA by written order determines that a substantiated scientific requirement essential to the determination of safety or effectiveness of the new animal drug appeared after the conference.
(h)
When the terms of a presubmission conference agreement are not valid.
(1) A presubmission conference agreement will no longer be valid if:
(i) The potential applicant makes to FDA, before, during, or after the presubmission conference, any untrue statement of material fact; or
(ii) The potential applicant fails to follow any material term of the agreement; and
(2) A presubmission conference may no longer be valid if the potential applicant submits false or misleading data relating to a new animal drug to FDA.
(i)
Dispute resolution.
FDA is committed to resolving differences between a potential applicant and FDA reviewing divisions with respect to requirements for the investigation of new animal drugs and for NADAs, supplemental NADAs, and ANADAs as quickly and amicably as possible through a cooperative exchange of information and views. When administrative or procedural disputes arise, a potential applicant should first attempt to resolve the matter within the appropriate review division beginning with the individual(s) most directly assigned to the review of the application or investigational exemption. If the dispute cannot be resolved after such attempts, the dispute shall be evaluated and administered in accordance with applicable regulations (21 CFR 10.75). Dispute resolution procedures may be further explained by guidance available from the Center for Veterinary Medicine.
[69 FR 51170, Aug. 18, 2004]
§ 514.6
Amended applications.
The applicant may submit an amendment to an application that is pending, including changes that may alter the conditions of use, the labeling, safety, effectiveness, identity, strength, quality, or purity of the drug or the adequacy of the manufacturing methods, facilities, and controls to preserve them, in which case the unamended application may be considered as withdrawn and the amended application may be considered resubmitted on the date on which the amendment is received by the Food and Drug Administration. The applicant will be notified of such date.
§ 514.7
Withdrawal of applications without prejudice.
The sponsor may withdraw his pending application from consideration as a
new animal drug application upon written notification to the Food and Drug Administration. Such withdrawal may be made without prejudice to a future filing. Upon resubmission, the time limitation will begin to run from the date the resubmission is received by the Food and Drug Administration. The original application will be retained by the Food and Drug Administration although it is considered withdrawn. The applicant shall be furnished a copy at cost on request.

At 89 FR 51782, June 18, 2024, § 514.80 was amended, effective Dec. 18, 2025.
§ 514.87
Annual reports for antimicrobial animal drug sales and distribution.
(a) The applicant for each new animal drug product approved under section 512 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or conditionally approved under section 571 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and containing an antimicrobial active ingredient, must submit an annual report to FDA on the amount of each such antimicrobial active ingredient in the drug that is sold or distributed in the reporting year for use in food-producing animal species, including information on any distributor-labeled product.
(b) This report must identify the approved or conditionally approved application and must include the following information for each new animal drug product described in paragraph (a) of this section:
(1) A listing of each antimicrobial active ingredient contained in the product;
(2) A description of each product sold or distributed by unit, including the container size, strength, and dosage form of such product units;
(3) For each such product, a listing of the target animal species, indications, and production classes that are specified on the approved label;
(4) For each such product, the number of units sold or distributed in the United States (
i.e.,
domestic sales) for each month of the reporting year; and
(5) For each such product, the number of units sold or distributed outside the United States (
i.e.,
quantities exported) for each month of the reporting year.
(c) Each report must also provide a species-specific estimate of the percentage of each product described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section that was sold or distributed domestically in the reporting year for use in any of the following animal species categories, but only for such species that appear on the approved label: Cattle, swine, chickens, turkeys. The total of the species-specific percentages reported for each product must account for 100 percent of its sales and distribution; therefore, a fifth category of “other species/unknown” must also be reported.
(d) Each report must:
(1) Be submitted not later than March 31 each year;
(2) Cover the period of the preceding calendar year; and
(3) Be submitted using Form FDA 3744, “Antimicrobial Animal Drug Distribution Report.”
(e) Sales and distribution data and information reported under this section will be considered to fall within the exemption for confidential commercial information established in § 20.61 of this chapter and will not be publicly disclosed, except that summary reports of such information aggregated in such a way that does not reveal information that is not available for public disclosure under this provision will be prepared by FDA and made available to the public as provided in paragraph (f) of this section.
(f) FDA will publish an annual summary report of the data and information it receives under this section for each calendar year by December 31 of the following year. Such annual reports must include a summary of sales and distribution data and information by antimicrobial drug class and may include additional summary data and information as determined by FDA. In order to protect confidential commercial information, each individual datum appearing in the summary report must:
(1) Reflect combined product sales and distribution data and information obtained from three or more distinct sponsors of approved products that were actively sold or distributed that reporting year, and
(2) Be reported in a manner consistent with protecting both national security and confidential commercial information.
[81 FR 29141, May 11, 2016]
§ 514.100
Evaluation and comment on applications.
(a) After the filed application has been evaluated, the applicant will be furnished written comment on any apparent deficiencies in the application.
(b) When the description of the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture, processing, and packing of such new animal drug appears adequate on its face, but it is not feasible to reach a conclusion as to the safety and effectiveness of the new animal drug solely from consideration of this description, the applicant may be notified that an establishment inspection is required to verify their adequacy.
(c) A request for samples of a new animal drug or any edible tissues and byproducts of animals treated with such a drug, shall specify the quantity deemed adequate to permit tests of analytical methods to determine their adequacy for regulatory purposes. The request should be made as early in the 180-day period as possible to assure timely completion. The date used for computing the 180-day limit for the purposes of section 512(c) of the act shall be moved forward 1 day for each day after the mailing date of the request until all of the requested samples are received. If the samples are not received within 90 days after the request, the application will be considered withdrawn without prejudice.
(d) The information contained in an application may be insufficient to determine whether a new animal drug is safe or effective in use if it fails to include (among other things) a statement showing whether such drug is to be limited to prescription sale and exempt under section 502(f) of the act from the requirement that its labeling bear adequate directions for lay use. If such drug is to be exempt, the information may also be insufficient if:
(1) The specimen labeling proposed fails to bear adequate information for professional use including indications, effects, dosages, routes, methods, and frequency and duration of administration and any relevant hazards, contraindications, side effects, and precautions under which practitioners licensed by law to administer such drug can use the drug for the purposes for which it is intended, including all purposes for which it is to be advertised, or represented, in accordance with § 201.105 of this chapter, and information concerning hazards, contraindications, side effects, and precautions relevant with respect to any uses for which such drug is to be prescribed.
(2) The application fails to show that the labeling and advertising of such drug will offer the drug for use only under those conditions for which it is offered in the labeling that is part of the application.
(3) The application fails to show that all labeling that furnishes or purports to furnish information for professional use of such drug will contain, in the same language and emphasis, the information for use including indications, effects, dosages, routes, methods, and frequency and duration of administration and any relevant warnings, hazards, contraindications, side effects, and precautions, which is contained in the labeling that is part of the application in accordance with § 201.105 of this chapter.
(e) The information contained in an application will be considered insufficient to determine whether a new animal drug is safe and effective for use when there is a refusal or failure upon written notice to furnish inspectors authorized by the Food and Drug Administration an adequate opportunity to inspect the facilities, controls, and records pertinent to the application.
(f) On the basis of preliminary consideration of an application or supplemental application containing typewritten or other draft labeling in lieu of final printed labeling, an applicant may be informed that such application is approvable when satisfactory final printed labeling identical in content to such draft copy is submitted.
(g) When an application has been found incomplete on the basis of a need for the kind of information described in § 514.6, such application shall be considered withdrawn without prejudice to future filing on the date of issuance of the letter citing the inadequacies contained in the application, unless within 30 days the sponsor chooses to avail himself of the opportunity for hearing as prescribed by § 514.111.
§ 514.105

§ 514.111
Refusal to approve an application.
(a) The Commissioner shall, within 180 days after the filing of the application, inform the applicant in writing of his intention to issue a notice of opportunity for a hearing on a proposal to refuse to approve the application, if the Commissioner determines upon the basis of the application, or upon the basis of other information before him with respect to a new animal drug, that:
(1) The reports of investigations required to be submitted pursuant to section 512(b) of the act do not include adequate tests by all methods reasonably applicable to show whether or not such drug is safe for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling thereof; or
(2) The results of such tests show that such drug is unsafe for use under such conditions or do not show that such drug is safe for use under such conditions; or
(3) The methods used in and the facilities and controls used for the manufacture, processing, and packing of such drug are inadequate to preserve its identity, strength, quality, and purity; or
(4) Upon the basis of the information submitted to the Food and Drug Administration as part of the application, or upon the basis of any other information before it with respect to such drug, it has insufficient information to determine whether such drug is safe for use under such conditions. In making this determination the Commissioner shall consider, among other relevant factors:
(i) The probable consumption of such drug and of any substance formed in or on food because of the use of such drug;
(ii) The cumulative effect on man or animal of such drug, taking into account any chemically or pharmacologically related substances;
(iii) Safety factors which, in the opinion of experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the safety of such drugs, are appropriate for the use of animal experimentation data; and
(iv) Whether the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling are reasonably certain to be followed in practice; or
(5) Evaluated on the basis of information submitted as part of the application and any other information before the Food and Drug Administration with respect to such drug, there is lack of substantial evidence as defined in § 514.4.
(6) Failure to include an appropriate proposed tolerance for residues in edible products derived from animals or a withdrawal period or other restrictions for use of such drug if any tolerance or withdrawal period or other restrictions for use are required in order to assure that the edible products derived from animals treated with such drug will be safe.
(7) Based on a fair evaluation of all material facts, the labeling is false or misleading in any particular; or
(8) Such drug induces cancer when ingested by man or animal or, after appropriate tests for evaluation of the safety of such drug, induces cancer in man or animal, except that this subparagraph shall not apply with respect to such drug if the Commissioner finds that, under the conditions of use specified in proposed labeling and reasonably certain to be followed in practice:
(i) Such drug will not adversely affect the animal for which it is intended; and
(ii) No residue of such drug will be found (by methods of examination prescribed or approved by the Commissioner by regulations) in any edible portion of such animal after slaughter or in any food yielded by, or derived from the living animals.
(9) The applicant fails to submit an adequate environmental assessment under § 25.40 of this chapter or fails to provide sufficient information to establish that the requested action is subject to categorical exclusion under § 25.30 or § 25.33 of this chapter.
(10) The drug fails to satisfy the requirements of subpart E of part 500 of this chapter.
(11) Any nonclinical laboratory study that is described in the application and that is essential to show that the drug is safe for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in its proposed labeling, was not conducted in compliance with the good
laboratory practice regulations as set forth in part 58 of this chapter and no reason for the noncompliance is provided or, if it is, the differences between the practices used in conducting the study and the good laboratory practice regulations do not support the validity of the study.
(12) The drug will be produced in whole or in part in an establishment that is not registered and not exempt from registration under section 510 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and part 207 of this chapter.
(b) The Commissioner, as provided in § 514.200 of this chapter, shall expeditiously notify the applicant of an opportunity for a hearing on the question of whether such application is approvable, unless by the 30th day following the date of issuance of the letter informing the applicant of the intention to issue a notice of opportunity for a hearing the applicant:

Withdrawal of approval of applications.
(a) The Secretary may suspend approval of an application approved pursuant to section 512(c) of the act and give the applicant prompt notice of his action and afford the applicant the opportunity for an expedited hearing on a finding that there is an imminent hazard to the health of man or of the animals for which such new animal drug or animal feed is intended.
(b) The Commissioner shall notify in writing the person holding an application approved pursuant to section 512(c) of the act and afford an opportunity for a hearing on a proposal to withdraw approval of such application if he finds:
(1) That the application contains any untrue statement of a material fact; or
(2) That the applicant has made any changes from the standpoint of safety or effectiveness beyond the variations provided for in the application unless he has supplemented the application by filing with the Secretary adequate information respecting all such changes and unless there is in effect an approval of the supplemental application, or such changes are those for which written authorization or approval is not required as provided for in § 514.8. The supplemental application shall be treated in the same manner as the original application.
(3) That in the case of an application for use of a new animal drug approved or deemed approved pursuant to section 512(c) of the act:
(i) Experience or scientific data show that such drug is unsafe for use under the conditions of use upon the basis of which the application was approved; or
(ii) New evidence not contained in such application or not available to the Secretary until after such application was approved, or tests by new methods, or tests by methods not deemed reasonably applicable when such application was approved, evaluated together with the evidence available to the Secretary when the application was approved, shows that such drug is not shown to be safe for use under the conditions of use upon the basis of which the application was approved or that section 512 (d)(1)(H) of the act applies to such drug; or
(iii) On the basis of new information before him with respect to such drug, evaluated together with the evidence available to him when the application was approved, there is a lack of substantial evidence that such drug will have the effect it purports or is represented to have under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling thereof.
(4) That any nonclinical laboratory study that is described in the application and that is essential to show that the drug is safe for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in its proposed labeling, was not conducted in compliance with the good laboratory practice regulations as set forth in part 58 of this chapter and no
reason for the noncompliance is provided or, if it is, the differences between the practices used in conducting the study and the good laboratory practice regulations do not support the validity of the study.
(c) The Commissioner may notify in writing the person holding an application approved pursuant to section 512(c) of the act and afford an opportunity for a hearing on a proposal to withdraw approval of such application if he finds:
(1) That the applicant has failed to establish a system for maintaining required records, or has repeatedly or deliberately failed to maintain such records or to make required reports in accordance with a regulation or order under section 512(l)(1) of the act, or the applicant has refused to permit access to, or copying, or verification of, such records as required by section 512(l)(2) of the act; or
(2) That on the basis of new information before him evaluated together with the evidence before him when the application was approved, the methods used in, or the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture, processing, and packing of such drug or animal feed are inadequate to assure and preserve its identity, strength, quality, and purity and were not made adequate within a reasonable time after receipt of written notice from the Secretary specifying the matter complained of; or
(3) That on the basis of new information before him, evaluated together with the evidence before him when the application was approved, the labeling of such drug, based on a fair evaluation of all material facts, is false or misleading in any particular and was not corrected within a reasonable time after receipt of written notice from the Secretary specifying the matter complained of.
(d) Approval of an application pursuant to section 512(c) of the act will be withdrawn on the basis of a request for its withdrawal submitted in writing by a person holding an approved new animal drug application on the grounds that the drug subject to such application is no longer being marketed and information is included in support of this finding, provided none of the conditions cited in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section pertain to the subject drug.

§ 514.116
Notice of withdrawal of approval of application.
When an approval of an application submitted pursuant to section 512 of the act is withdrawn by the Commissioner, he will give appropriate public notice of such action by publication in the
Federal Register.
§ 514.117
Adequate and well-controlled studies.
(a)
Purpose.
The primary purpose of conducting adequate and well-controlled studies of a new animal drug is to distinguish the effect of the new animal drug from other influences, such as spontaneous change in the course of the disease, normal animal production performance, or biased observation. One or more adequate and well-controlled studies are required to establish, by substantial evidence, that a new animal drug is effective. The characteristics described in paragraph (b) of this section have been developed over a period of years and are generally recognized as the essentials of an adequate and well-controlled study. Well controlled, as used in the phrase adequate and well controlled, emphasizes an important aspect of adequacy. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers these characteristics in determining whether a study is adequate and well controlled for purposes of section 512 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 360b). Adequate and well-controlled studies,
in addition to providing a basis for determining whether a new animal drug is effective, may also be relied upon to support target animal safety. The report of an adequate and well-controlled study should provide sufficient details of study design, conduct, and analysis to allow critical evaluation and a determination of whether the characteristics of an adequate and well-controlled study are present.
(b)
Characteristics.
An adequate and well-controlled study has the following characteristics:
(1) The protocol for the study (protocol) and the report of the study results (study report) must include a clear statement of the study objective(s).
(2) The study is conducted in accordance with an appropriate standard of conduct that addresses, among other issues, study conduct, study personnel, study facilities, and study documentation. The protocol contains a statement acknowledging the applicability of, and intention to follow, a standard of conduct acceptable to FDA. The study report contains a statement describing adherence to the standard.
(3) The study is conducted with a new animal drug that is produced in accordance with appropriate manufacturing practices, which include, but are not necessarily limited to, the manufacture, processing, packaging, holding, and labeling of the new animal drug such that the critical characteristics of identity, strength, quality, purity, and physical form of the new animal drug are known, recorded, and reproducible, to permit meaningful evaluations of and comparisons with other studies conducted with the new animal drug. The physical form of a new animal drug includes the formulation and physical characterization (including delivery systems thereof, if any) of the new animal drug as presented to the animal. The protocol and study report must include an identification number which can be correlated with the specific formulation and production process used to manufacture the new animal drug used in the study.
(4) The study uses a design that permits a valid comparison with one or more controls to provide a quantitative evaluation of drug effects. The protocol and the study report must describe the precise nature of the study design, e.g., duration of treatment periods, whether treatments are parallel, sequential, or crossover, and the determination of sample size. Within the broad range of studies conducted to support a determination of the effectiveness of a new animal drug, certain of the controls listed below would be appropriate and preferred depending on the study conducted:
(i)
Placebo concurrent control.
The new animal drug is compared with an inactive preparation designed to resemble the new animal drug as far as possible.
(ii)
Untreated concurrent control.
The new animal drug is compared with the absence of any treatment. The use of this control may be appropriate when objective measurements of effectiveness, not subject to observer bias, are available.
(iii)
Active treatment concurrent control.
The new animal drug is compared with known effective therapy. The use of this control is appropriate when the use of a placebo control or of an untreated concurrent control would unreasonably compromise the welfare of the animals. Similarity of the new animal drug and the active control drug can mean either that both drugs were effective or that neither was effective. The study report should assess the ability of the study to have detected a difference between treatments. The evaluation of the study should explain why the new animal drugs should be considered effective in the study, for example, by reference to results in previous placebo-controlled studies of the active control.
(iv)
Historical control.
The results of treatment with the new animal drug are quantitatively compared with experience historically derived from the adequately documented natural history of the disease or condition, or with a regimen (therapeutic, diagnostic, prophylactic) whose effectiveness is established, in comparable animals. Because historical control populations usually cannot be as well assessed with respect to pertinent variables as can concurrent control populations, historical control designs are usually reserved for special circumstances. Examples include studies in which the effect of the
new animal drug is self-evident or studies of diseases with high and predictable mortality, or signs and symptoms of predictable duration or severity, or, in the case of prophylaxis, predictable morbidity.
(5) The study uses a method of selecting animals that provides adequate assurances that the animals are suitable for the purposes of the study. For example, the animals can reasonably be expected to have animal production characteristics typical of the class(es) of animals for which the new animal drug is intended, there is adequate assurance that the animals have the disease or condition being studied, or, in the case of prophylactic agents, evidence of susceptibility and exposure to the condition against which prophylaxis is desired has been provided. The protocol and the study report describe the method of selecting animals for the study.
(6) The study uses a method to assign a treatment or a control to each experimental unit of animals that is random and minimizes bias. Experimental units of animals are groups of animals that are comparable with respect to pertinent variables such as age, sex, class of animal, severity of disease, duration of disease, dietary regimen, level of animal production, and use of drugs or therapy other than the new animal drug. The protocol and the study report describe the method of assignment of animals to an experimental unit to account for pertinent variables and method of assignment of a treatment or a control to the experimental units. When the effect of such variables is accounted for by an appropriate design, and when, within the same animal, effects due to the test drug can be obtained free of the effects of such variables, the same animal may be used for both the test drug and the control using the controls set forth in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.
(7) The study uses methods to minimize bias on the part of observers and analysts of the data that are adequate to prevent undue influences on the results and interpretation of the study data. The protocol and study report explain the methods of observation and recording of the animal response variables and document the methods, such as “blinding” or “masking,” used in the study for excluding or minimizing bias in the observations.
(8) The study uses methods to assess animal response that are well defined and reliable. The protocol and study report describe the methods for conducting the study, including any appropriate analytical and statistical methods, used to collect and analyze the data resulting from the conduct of the study, describe the criteria used to assess response, and, when appropriate, justify the selection of the methods to assess animal response.
(9) There is an analysis and evaluation of the results of the study in accord with the protocol adequate to assess the effects of the new animal drug. The study report evaluates the methods used to conduct, and presents and evaluates the results of, the study as to their adequacy to assess the effects of the new animal drug. This evaluation of the results of the study assesses, among other items, the comparability of treatment and control groups with respect to pertinent variables and the effects of any interim analyses performed.
(c)
Field studies.
(1) Field conditions as used in this section refers to conditions which closely approximate the conditions under which the new animal drug, if approved, is intended to be applied or administered.
(2) Studies of a new animal drug conducted under field conditions shall, consistent with generally recognized scientific principles and procedures, use an appropriate control that permits comparison, employ procedures to minimize bias, and have the characteristics generally described in paragraph (b) of this section. However, because field studies are conducted under field conditions, it is recognized that the level of control over some study conditions need not or should not be the same as the level of control in laboratory studies. While not all conditions relating to a field study need to be or should be controlled, observations of the conditions under which the new animal drug is tested shall be recorded in sufficient detail to permit evaluation of the study. Adequate and well-controlled field studies shall balance the need to control study conditions
with the need to observe the true effect of the new animal drug under closely approximated actual use conditions.
(d)
Waiver.
The Director of the Center for Veterinary Medicine (the Director) may, on the Director's own initiative or on the petition of an interested person, waive in whole or in part any of the criteria in paragraph (b) of this section with respect to a specific study. A petition for a waiver is required to set forth clearly and concisely the specific criteria from which waiver is sought, why the criteria are not reasonably applicable to the particular study, what alternative procedures, if any, are to be, or have been employed, and what results have been obtained. The petition is also required to state why the studies so conducted will yield, or have yielded, substantial evidence of effectiveness, notwithstanding nonconformance with the criteria for which waiver is requested.
(e)
Uncontrolled studies.
Uncontrolled studies or partially controlled studies are not acceptable as the sole basis for the approval of claims of effectiveness or target animal safety. Such studies, carefully conducted and documented, may provide corroborative support of adequate and well-controlled studies regarding effectiveness and may yield valuable data regarding safety of the new animal drug. Such studies will be considered on their merits in light of the characteristics listed here. Isolated case reports, random experience, and reports lacking the details which permit scientific evaluation will not be considered.

(2) If the Commissioner determines upon review of the data and information submitted in the objections and request for a hearing that a hearing is not justified because no genuine and substantial issue of fact precludes the refusal to approve the application or the withdrawal of approval of the application (for example, the applicant has not identified any adequate and well-controlled clinical investigations to support the claims of effectiveness), the Commissioner will enter an order denying the hearing and stating the final findings and conclusions.
(3) If the Commissioner determines upon review of the data and information submitted in the objections and request for a hearing that a hearing is justified, the Commissioner will publish a notice setting forth the following:
(i) The regulation or order that is the subject of the hearing;
(ii) A statement specifying any part of the regulation or order that has been stayed by operation of law or in the Commissioner's discretion;
(iii) The parties to the hearing;
(iv) The specific issues of fact for resolution at the hearing;
(v) The presiding officer, or a statement that the presiding officer will be designated in a later notice; and
(vi) The date, time, and place of the prehearing conference, or a statement that the date, time, and place will be announced in a later notice. However, in the case of a denial of approval, the hearing must not occur more than 90 days after expiration of the 30-day time period in which to request a hearing, unless the presiding officer and the applicant otherwise agree; and in the case of withdrawal of approval, the hearing will occur as soon as practicable.
(d) The hearing will be open to the public; however, if the Commissioner finds that portions of the application which serve as a basis for the hearing contain information concerning a method or process entitled to protection as a trade secret, the part of the hearing involving such portions will not be public, unless the respondent so specifies in the request for a hearing.

(1) Withdraws the application; or
(2) Waives the opportunity for a hearing; or
(3) Agrees with the Commissioner on an additional period to precede issuance of such notice of hearing.
[64 FR 63204, Nov. 19, 1999, as amended at 72 FR 69121, Dec. 6, 2007]
§ 515.22
Suspension and/or revocation of approval of a medicated feed mill license.
(a) The Secretary of Health and Human Services may suspend a medicated feed mill license approved under section 512(m)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) and give the person holding the medicated feed mill license application prompt notice of this action and afford the applicant the opportunity for an expedited hearing on a finding that there is an imminent hazard to the health of man or of the animals for which such animal feed is intended.
(b) The Commissioner of Food and Drugs (the Commissioner) shall notify in writing the person holding an application approved under section 512(m)(2) of the act and afford an opportunity for a hearing on a proposal to revoke approval of such application if the Commissioner finds:
(1) That the application contains any untrue statement of a material fact; or
(2) That the applicant has made any changes that would cause the application to contain any untrue statements of material fact or that would affect the safety or effectiveness of the animal feeds manufactured at the facility unless the applicant has supplemented the application by filing a supplemental application under § 515.11.
(c) The Commissioner may notify in writing the person holding an application approved under section 512(m)(2) of the act and afford an opportunity for a hearing on a proposal to revoke approval of such application if the Commissioner finds:
(1) That the applicant has failed to establish a system for maintaining required records, or has repeatedly or deliberately failed to maintain such records or to make required reports in accordance with a regulation or order under sections 512(m)(5)(A) or 504(a)(3)(A) of the act, or the applicant has refused to permit access to, or copying, or verification of, such records as required by sections 512(m)(5)(B) or 504(a)(3)(B) of the act; or
(2) That on the basis of new information before him, evaluated together with the evidence before him when such license was issued, the methods used in, or the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture, processing, packing, and holding of such animal feed are inadequate to assure and preserve the identity, strength, quality, and purity of the new animal drug therein, and were not made adequate within a reasonable time after receipt of written notice from the Commissioner specifying the matter complained of; or
(3) That on the basis of new information before him, evaluated together with the evidence before him when such license was issued, the labeling of any animal feeds, based on a fair evaluation of all material facts, is false or misleading in any particular and was not corrected within a reasonable time after receipt of written notice from the Commissioner specifying the matter complained of; or
(4) That on the basis of new information before him, evaluated together with the evidence before him when such license was issued, the facility has manufactured, processed, packed, or held animal feed bearing or containing a new animal drug adulterated under section 501(a)(6) of the act, and the facility did not discontinue the manufacture, processing, packing, or holding of such animal feed within a reasonable time after receipt of written notice from the Commissioner specifying the matter complained of.
§ 515.23
Voluntary revocation of medicated feed mill license.
A license issued under section 512(m)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) will be revoked on the basis of a request for its revocation submitted in writing by a responsible individual holding such license on the grounds that the facility no longer manufactures any animal feed covered under § 558.4(b) of this chapter. A written request for such revocation shall be construed as a waiver of the opportunity for a hearing as otherwise provided for in this section. Revocation of approval of a medicated feed mill license under the provisions of this paragraph shall be without prejudice.
§ 515.24
Notice of revocation of a medicated feed mill license.
When a license approved under section 512 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) is revoked by the Commissioner of Food and Drugs (the Commissioner), the Commissioner will give appropriate public notice of such action by publication in the
Federal Register.
§ 515.25
Revocation of order refusing to approve a medicated feed mill license application or suspending or revoking a license.
The Commissioner of Food and Drugs (the Commissioner), upon his/her own initiative or upon request of an applicant stating reasonable grounds therefor and if the Commissioner finds that the facts so require, may issue an order approving a medicated feed mill license application that previously has had its approval refused, suspended, or revoked.
§ 515.26
Services of notices and orders.
All notices and orders under this part 515 and section 512 of the Federal Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) pertaining to medicated feed mill licenses shall be served:

# Subpart C—Hearing Procedures
§ 515.30
Contents of notice of opportunity for a hearing.
(a) The notice to the applicant of opportunity for a hearing on a proposal by the Commissioner of Food and Drugs (the Commissioner) to refuse to approve a medicated feed mill license application or to revoke the approval of a medicated feed mill license will specify the grounds upon which the Commissioner proposes to issue this order. On request of the applicant, the Commissioner will explain the reasons for the action. The notice of opportunity for a hearing will be published in the
Federal Register
and will specify that the applicant has 30 days after issuance of the notice within which the Commissioner is required to file a written appearance electing whether:
(1) To avail himself of the opportunity for a hearing; or
(2) Not to avail himself of the opportunity for a hearing.
(b) If the applicant fails to file a written appearance in answer to the notice of opportunity for hearing, this failure will be construed as an election not to avail himself of the opportunity for the hearing, and the Commissioner without further notice may enter a final order.
(c) If the applicant elects to avail himself of the opportunity for a hearing, the applicant is required to file a written appearance requesting the hearing within 30 days after the publication of the notice, giving the reason why the application should not be refused or the medicated feed mill license should not be revoked, together with a well-organized and full-factual analysis of the information the applicant is prepared to prove in support of his opposition to the Commissioner's proposal. A request for a hearing may not rest upon mere allegations or denials, but must set forth specific facts showing there is a genuine and substantial issue of fact that requires a hearing. When it clearly appears from the information in the application and from the reasons and factual analysis in the request for the hearing that no genuine and substantial issue of fact precludes the refusal to approve the application or the revocation of approval of the application, the Commissioner will enter an order on this information, stating his/her findings and conclusions. If a hearing is requested and is justified by the applicant's response to the notice of opportunity for a hearing, the issues will be defined, an Administrative Law Judge will be named, and the Judge shall issue a written notice of the time and place at which the hearing will commence. In the case of denial of approval, such time shall be not more than 90 days after the expiration of such 30 days unless the Administrative Law Judge and the applicant otherwise agree; and, in the case of withdrawal of approval, such time shall be as soon as practicable.
(d) The hearing will be open to the public; however, if the Commissioner finds that portions of the application which serve as a basis for the hearing contain information concerning a method or process entitled to protection as a trade secret, the part of the hearing involving such portions will not be public, unless the respondent so specifies in the appearance.
§ 515.31
Procedures for hearings.
Hearings relating to new animal drugs under section 512(m)(3) and (m)(4) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) shall be governed by part 12 of this chapter.

# Subpart D—Judicial Review
§ 515.40
Judicial review.
The transcript and record shall be certified by the Commissioner of Food and Drugs (the Commissioner). In any case in which the Commissioner enters an order without a hearing under
§ 314.200(g) of this chapter, the request(s) for hearing together with the data and information submitted and the Commissioner's findings and conclusions shall be included in the record certified by the Commissioner.

# Subpart A—General Provisions
§ 516.1
Scope.
(a) This part implements section 573 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 360ccc-2) and contains the following subparts:
(1) Subpart A—General Provisions.
(2) Subpart B—Designation of a Minor Use or Minor Species New Animal Drug.
(3) Subpart C [Reserved]
(4) Subpart D [Reserved]
(b) References in this part to regulatory sections of the Code of Federal Regulations are to Chapter I of Title 21, unless otherwise noted.
§ 516.2
Purpose.
This part establishes standards and procedures for implementing section 573 of the act, including designation of minor use or minor species new animal drugs and associated exclusive marketing rights.
§ 516.3
Definitions.
(a) The definitions and interpretations contained in section 201 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 321) apply to those terms when used in this part.
(b) The following definitions of terms apply to all subparts of part 516:
Active moiety
means the molecule or ion, excluding those appended portions of the molecule that cause the drug to be an ester, salt (including a salt with hydrogen or coordination bonds), or other noncovalent derivative (such as a complex, chelate, or clathrate) of the molecule, responsible for the pharmacological action of the drug substance.
Functionally superior
means that a drug has been shown to provide a significant therapeutic or physiologic advantage over that provided by a conditionally-approved or approved MUMS drug, that is otherwise the same drug, in one or more of the following ways:
(i) The drug has been shown to be more effective, as assessed by effect on a clinically meaningful endpoint in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials, than a conditionally approved or approved MUMS drug, that is otherwise the same drug. Generally, this would represent the same kind of evidence needed to support a comparative effectiveness claim for two different drugs; in most cases, direct comparative clinical trials will be necessary; or
(ii) The drug has been shown to be safer than a conditionally-approved or approved MUMS drug, that is otherwise the same drug, in a substantial portion of the target population, for example, by the elimination of an ingredient or contaminant that is associated with relatively frequent adverse effects. In some cases, direct comparative clinical trials will be necessary.
Infrequently
, as used in the minor use definition, means a disease or condition that is uncommon or that occurs only sporadically on an annualized basis.
Limited geographical areas
, as used in the minor use definition, means regions of the United States distinguished by physical, chemical, or biological factors that limit the distribution of a disease or condition.
Major species
means cattle, horses, swine, chickens, turkeys, dogs, and cats.
Minor species
means animals, other than humans, that are not major species.
Minor use
means the intended use of a drug in a major species for an indication that occurs infrequently and in only a small number of animals or in limited geographical areas and in only a small number of animals annually.
MUMS drug
means a new animal drug, as defined in section 201 of the act, intended for a minor use or for use in a minor species.
Same dosage form
means the same as one of the dosage form categories specified in the following parts of this chapter:
(i) Part 520: Oral dosage form new animal drugs (excluding use in animal feeds as specified in part 558 of this chapter).
(ii) Part 522: Implantation or injectable dosage form new animal drugs.
(iii) Part 524: Ophthalmic and topical dosage form new animal drugs.
(iv) Part 526: Intramammary dosage forms.
(v) Part 529: Certain other dosage form new animal drugs.
(vi) Part 558: New animal drugs for use in animal feeds.
Same drug
means a MUMS drug for which designation, indexing, or conditional approval is sought that meets the following criteria:
(i) If it is a MUMS drug composed of small molecules and contains the same active moiety as a prior designated, conditionally-approved, or approved
MUMS drug, even if the particular ester or salt (including a salt with hydrogen or coordination bonds) or other noncovalent derivative such as a complex, chelate or clathrate is not the same, it is considered the same drug; except that, if the prior MUMS drug is conditionally approved or approved and the second MUMS drug is shown to be functionally superior to the conditionally approved or approved MUMS drug for the same intended use, it is not considered the same drug.
(ii) If it is a MUMS drug composed of large molecules (macromolecules) and contains the same principal molecular structural features (but not necessarily all of the same structural features) as a prior designated, conditionally approved, or approved MUMS drug, it is considered the same drug; except that, if the prior MUMS drug is conditionally approved or approved and the second MUMS drug is shown to be functionally superior to the conditionally approved or approved MUMS drug for the same intended use, it is not considered the same drug. This criterion will be applied as follows to different kinds of macromolecules:
(A) Two protein drugs would be considered the same if the only differences in structure between them were due to post-translational events or infidelity of translation or transcription or were minor differences in amino acid sequence; other potentially important differences, such as different glycosylation patterns or different tertiary structures, would not cause the drugs to be considered different unless the subsequent drug is shown to be functionally superior.
(B) Two polysaccharide drugs would be considered the same if they had identical saccharide repeating units, even if the number of units were to vary and even if there were postpolymerization modifications, unless the subsequent drug is shown to be functionally superior.
(C) Two polynucleotide drugs consisting of two or more distinct nucleotides would be considered the same if they had an identical sequence of purine and pyrimidine bases (or their derivatives) bound to an identical sugar backbone (ribose, deoxyribose, or modifications of these sugars), unless the subsequent drug is shown to be functionally superior.
(D) Closely related, complex partly definable drugs with similar pharmacologic intent would be considered the same unless the subsequent drug is shown to be functionally superior.
Same intended use
means an intended use of a MUMS drug, for which designation, indexing, or conditional approval is sought, that is determined to be the same as (or not different from) a previously designated, conditionally approved, or approved intended use of a MUMS drug. Same intended use is established by comparing two intended uses and not by simply comparing the specific language by means of which the intent is established in labeling in accordance with the following criteria:
(i) Two intended uses are considered the same if one of the intended uses falls completely within the scope of the other.
(ii) For intended uses associated with diseases or conditions with multiple causative organisms, two intended uses are not considered the same when they involve different causative organisms or different subsets of causative organisms of that disease or condition when the causative organisms involved can reliably be shown to be clinically significant causes of the disease or condition.
(iii) Two intended uses of a drug are not considered the same if they involve different intended species or different definable subpopulations (including “production classes”) of a species.
Small number of animals
means equal to or less than 50,000 horses; 80,000 dogs; 150,000 cats; 310,000 cattle; 1,450,000 pigs; 14,000,000 turkeys; and 72,000,000 chickens.
Sponsor
means the person requesting designation for a MUMS drug who must be the real party in interest of the development and the intended or actual production and sales of such drug (in this context, the sponsor may be an individual, partnership, organization, or association). Sponsor also means the person responsible for an investigation of a new animal drug (in this context, the sponsor may be an individual, partnership, corporation, or Government agency or may be a manufacturer, scientific institution, or an
investigator regularly and lawfully engaged in the investigation of new animal drugs). Sponsor also means the person submitting or receiving approval for a new animal drug application (in this context, the sponsor may be an individual, partnership, organization, or association). In all contexts, the sponsor is responsible for compliance with applicable provisions of the act and regulations.

Scope of this subpart.
This subpart implements section 573 of the act. Specifically, this subpart sets forth the procedures and requirements for submissions to FDA of requests for designation of a new animal drug for a minor use or a minor species.
§ 516.12
Purpose.
This subpart establishes standards and procedures for determining eligibility for designation and the associated incentives and benefits described in section 573 of the act, including a 7-year period of exclusive marketing rights.
§ 516.13
Definitions.
The following definitions of terms apply only in the context of subpart B of this part:
Director
means the Director of the Office of Minor Use and Minor Species Animal Drug Development of the FDA Center for Veterinary Medicine.
Intended use
means the intended treatment, control or prevention of a disease or condition, or the intention to affect the structure or function of the body of animals within an identified species, subpopulation of a species, or collection of species.
MUMS-designated drug
means a new animal drug, as defined in section 201 of the act, intended for a minor use or for use in a minor species that has been designated under section 573 of the act.
MUMS-drug exclusive marketing rights
or
exclusive marketing rights
means that, effective on the date of FDA conditional approval or approval as stated in the approval letter of an application for a MUMS-designated drug, no conditional approval or approval will be given to a subsequent application for the same drug, in the same dosage form, for the same intended use for 7 years, except as otherwise provided by law or in this subpart.
§ 516.14
Submission of requests for designation.
All correspondence relating to a request for designation of a MUMS drug must be addressed to the Director of the Office of Minor Use and Minor Species Animal Drug Development. Submissions not including all elements specified in § 516.20 will be returned to the sponsor without review.
§ 516.16
Eligibility to request designation.
The person requesting designation must be the sponsor and the real party in interest of the development and the intended or actual production and sales of the drug or the permanent-resident U.S. agent for such a sponsor.
§ 516.20
Content and format of a request for MUMS-drug designation.
(a) A sponsor that submits a request for designation of a new animal drug intended for a minor use or minor species must submit each request in the form and containing the information required in paragraph (b) of this section. While a request for designation may involve multiple intended uses, each request for designation must constitute a separate submission. A sponsor may request MUMS-drug designation of a previously unapproved drug, or a new intended use or dosage form for an already conditionally approved or approved drug. Only one sponsor may receive MUMS-drug designation of the same drug, in the same dosage form, for the same intended use.
(b) A sponsor must submit two copies of a completed, dated, and signed request for designation that contains the following information:
(1) A request for designation of a new animal drug for a minor use or use in
a minor species, which must be specific.
(2) The name and address of the sponsor; the name of the sponsor's primary contact person and/or permanent-resident U.S. agent including title, address, and telephone number; the established name (and proprietary name, if any) of the active pharmaceutical ingredient of the drug; and the name and address of the source of the active pharmaceutical ingredient of the drug.
(3) A description of the proposed intended use for which the drug is being or will be investigated.
(4) A description of the drug and dosage form.
(5) A discussion of the scientific rationale for the intended use of the drug; specific reference, including date(s) of submission, to all data from nonclinical laboratory studies, clinical investigations, copies of pertinent unpublished and published papers, and other relevant data that are available to the sponsor, whether positive, negative, or inconclusive.
(6) A specific description of the product development plan for the drug, its dosage form, and its intended use.
(7) If the drug is intended for a minor use in a major species, documentation in accordance with § 516.21, with appended authoritative references, to demonstrate that such use is a minor use.
(8) A statement that the sponsor submitting the request is the real party in interest of the development and the intended or actual production and sales of the product.
(9) A statement that the sponsor acknowledges that, upon granting a request for MUMS designation, FDA will make information regarding the designation publicly available as specified in § 516.28.
[72 FR 41017, July 26, 2007, as amended at 75 FR 69588, Nov. 15, 2010; 77 FR 18685, Mar. 28, 2012]
§ 516.21
Documentation of minor use status.
So that FDA can determine whether a drug qualifies for MUMS-drug designation as a minor use in a major species under section 573 of the act, the sponsor shall include in its request to FDA for MUMS-drug designation under § 516.20 documentation demonstrating that the use is limited to a small number of animals (annualized). This documentation must include the following information:
(a) The estimated total number of animals to which the drug could potentially be administered on an annual basis for the treatment, control, or prevention of the disease or condition for which the drug is being developed, including animals administered the drug as part of herd or flock treatment, together with a list of the sources (including dates of information provided and literature citations) for the estimate.
(b) The estimated total number of animals referred to in paragraph (a) of this section may be further reduced to only a subset of the estimated total number of animals if administration of the drug is only medically justified for this subset. To establish this, requestors must demonstrate that administration of the drug to animals subject to the disease or condition for which the drug is being developed other than the subset is not medically justified. The sponsor must also include a list of the sources (including dates of information provided and literature citations) for the justification that administration of the drug to animals other than the targeted subset is medically inappropriate.
[72 FR 41017, July 26, 2007, as amended at 74 FR 43050, Aug. 25, 2009]
§ 516.22
Permanent-resident U.S. agent for foreign sponsor.
Every foreign sponsor that seeks MUMS-drug designation shall name a permanent resident of the United States as the sponsor's agent upon whom service of all processes, notices, orders, decisions, requirements, and other communications may be made on behalf of the sponsor. Notifications of changes in such agents or changes of address of agents should preferably be provided in advance, but not later than 60 days after the effective date of such changes. The permanent-resident U.S. agent may be an individual, firm, or domestic corporation and may represent any number of sponsors. The name and address of the permanent-resident U.S. agent shall be provided to
the Director of the Office of Minor Use and Minor Species Animal Drug Development.
§ 516.23
Timing of requests for MUMS-drug designation.
A sponsor may request MUMS-drug designation at any time in the drug development process prior to the submission of an application for either conditional approval or approval of the MUMS drug for which designation is being requested.
§ 516.24
Granting MUMS-drug designation.
(a) FDA may grant the request for MUMS-drug designation if none of the reasons described in § 516.25 for refusal to grant such a request apply.
(b) When a request for MUMS-drug designation is granted, FDA will notify the sponsor in writing and will give public notice of the MUMS-drug designation in accordance with § 516.28.
§ 516.25
Refusal to grant MUMS-drug designation.
(a) FDA will refuse to grant a request for MUMS-drug designation if any of the following reasons apply:
(1) The drug is not intended for use in a minor species or FDA determines that there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate that the drug is intended for a minor use in a major species.
(2) The drug is the same drug in the same dosage form for the same intended use as one that already has a MUMS-drug designation but has not yet been conditionally approved or approved.
(3) The drug is the same drug in the same dosage form for the same intended use as one that is already conditionally approved or approved. A drug that FDA has found to be functionally superior is not considered the same drug as an already conditionally approved or approved drug even if it is otherwise the same drug in the same dosage form for the same intended use.
(4) The sponsor has failed to provide:
(i) A credible scientific rationale in support of the intended use,
(ii) Sufficient information about the product development plan for the drug, its dosage form, and its intended use to establish that adherence to the plan can lead to successful drug development in a timely manner, and
(iii) Any other information required under § 516.20.
(b) FDA may refuse to grant a request for MUMS-drug designation if the request for designation contains an untrue statement of material fact or omits material information.
§ 516.26
Amendment to MUMS-drug designation.
(a) At any time prior to conditional approval or approval of an application for a MUMS-designated drug, the sponsor may apply for an amendment to the designated intended use if the proposed change is due to new and unexpected findings in research on the drug, information arising from FDA recommendations, or other unforeseen developments.
(b) FDA will grant the amendment if it finds:
(1) That the initial designation request was made in good faith;
(2) That the amendment is intended to make the MUMS-drug designated intended use conform to the results of new and unexpected findings in research on the drug, information arising from FDA recommendations, or other unforeseen developments; and
(3) In the case of a minor use, that as of the date of the submission of the amendment request, the amendment would not result in the intended use of the drug no longer being considered a minor use.
§ 516.27
Change in sponsorship.
(a) A sponsor may transfer sponsorship of a MUMS-designated drug to another person. A change of sponsorship will also transfer the designation status of the drug which will remain in effect for the new sponsor subject to the same conditions applicable to the former sponsor provided that at the time of a potential transfer, the new and former sponsors submit the following information in writing and obtain permission from FDA:
(1) The former sponsor shall submit a letter to FDA that documents the transfer of sponsorship of the MUMS-designated drug. This letter shall specify the date of the transfer. The former sponsor shall also certify in writing to
FDA that a complete copy of the request for MUMS-drug designation, including any amendments to the request, and correspondence relevant to the MUMS-drug designation, has been provided to the new sponsor.
(2) The new sponsor shall submit a letter or other document containing the following information:
(i) A statement accepting the MUMS-drug designated file or application;
(ii) The date that the change in sponsorship is intended to be effective;
(iii) A statement that the new sponsor has a complete copy of the request for MUMS-drug designation, including any amendments to the request and any correspondence relevant to the MUMS-drug designation;
(iv) A statement that the new sponsor understands and accepts the responsibilities of a sponsor of a MUMS-designated drug established elsewhere in this subpart;
(v) The name and address of a new primary contact person or permanent resident U.S. agent; and
(vi) Evidence that the new sponsor is capable of actively pursuing approval with due diligence.
(b) No sponsor may relieve itself of responsibilities under the act or under this subpart by assigning rights to another person without:
(1) Assuring that the new sponsor will carry out such responsibilities; and
(2) Obtaining prior permission from FDA.
§ 516.28
Publication of MUMS-drug designations.
FDA will periodically update a publicly available list of MUMS-designated drugs. This list will be placed on file at the FDA Dockets Management Staff, and will contain the following information for each MUMS-designated drug:
(a) The name and address of the sponsor;
(b) The established name and trade name, if any, of the drug;
(c) The dosage form of the drug;
(d) The species and the proposed intended use for which MUMS-drug designation was granted; and
(e) The date designation was granted.
[72 FR 41017, July 26, 2007, as amended at 88 FR 45066, July 14, 2023]
§ 516.29
Termination of MUMS-drug designation.
(a) The sponsor of a MUMS-designated drug must notify FDA of any decision to discontinue active pursuit of conditional approval or approval of such MUMS drug. FDA must terminate the designation upon such notification.
(b) A conditionally-approved or approved MUMS-designated drug sponsor must notify FDA at least 1 year before it intends to discontinue the manufacture of such MUMS drug. FDA must terminate designation upon such notification.
(c) MUMS designation shall terminate upon the expiration of any applicable period of exclusive marketing rights under this subpart.
(d) FDA may terminate designation if it independently determines that the sponsor is not actively pursuing conditional approval or approval with due diligence. At a minimum, due diligence must be demonstrated by:
(1) Submission of annual progress reports in a timely manner in accordance with § 516.30 that demonstrate that the sponsor is progressing in accordance with the drug development plan submitted to the agency under § 516.20 and
(2) Compliance with all applicable requirements of part 511 of this chapter.
(e) Designation of a conditionally approved or approved MUMS-designated drug and the associated exclusive marketing rights may be terminated if the sponsor is unable to provide sufficient quantities of the drug to meet the needs for which it is designated.
(f) FDA may also terminate MUMS-drug designation for any drug if the agency finds that:
(1) The request for designation contained an untrue statement of material fact; or
(2) The request for designation omitted material information required by this subpart; or
(3) FDA subsequently finds that the drug in fact had not been eligible for MUMS-drug designation at the time of submission of the request;
(4) The same drug, in the same dosage form, for the same intended use becomes conditionally approved or approved for another sponsor; or
(5) FDA withdraws the conditional approval or approval of the application for the new animal drug.
(g) For a conditionally approved or approved drug, termination of MUMS-drug designation also terminates the sponsor's exclusive marketing rights for the drug but does not withdraw the conditional approval or approval of the drug's application.
(h) Where a drug has been MUMS-designated for a minor use in a major species, its designation will not be terminated on the grounds that the number of animals to which the drug could potentially be administered on an annual basis for the treatment, control, or prevention of the disease or condition for which the drug is being developed, including animals administered the drug as part of herd or flock treatment, subsequently increases.
(i) When a MUMS-drug designation is terminated, FDA will notify the sponsor in writing and will give public notice of the termination of the MUMS-drug designation.
§ 516.30
Annual reports for a MUMS-designated drug.
Within 14 months after the date on which a MUMS drug is granted designation and annually thereafter until approval, the sponsor of a MUMS-designated drug shall submit a brief progress report on the drug to the investigational new animal drug file addressed to the Director of the Office of Minor Use and Minor Species Animal Drug Development that includes the following information:
(a) A short account of the progress of drug development including a description of studies initiated, ongoing, and completed, and a short summary of the status or results of such studies;
(b) A description of the investigational plan for the coming year, as well as any anticipated difficulties in development, testing, and marketing; and
(c) A brief discussion of any changes that may affect the MUMS-designated drug status of the product. For example, situations in which testing data demonstrate that the proposed intended use is inappropriate due to unexpected issues of safety or effectiveness.
§ 516.31
Scope of MUMS-drug exclusive marketing rights.
(a) After conditional approval or approval of an application for a MUMS-designated drug in the dosage form and for the intended use for which MUMS-drug designation has been granted, FDA will not conditionally approve or approve another application or abbreviated application for the same drug in the same dosage form for the same intended use before the expiration of 7 years after the date of conditional approval or approval as stated in the approval letter from FDA, except that such an application can be conditionally approved or approved sooner if, and at such time as, any of the following occurs:
(1) FDA terminates the MUMS-drug designation and associated exclusive marketing rights under § 516.29; or
(2) FDA withdraws the conditional approval or approval of the application for the drug for any reason; or
(3) The sponsor with exclusive marketing rights provides written consent to FDA to conditionally approve or approve another application before the expiration of 7 years; or
(4) The sponsor fails to assure a sufficient quantity of the drug in accordance with section 573 of the act and § 516.36.
(b) If an application for a MUMS drug cannot be approved until the expiration of the period of exclusive marketing of a MUMS-designated drug, FDA will so notify the sponsor in writing.
§ 516.34
FDA recognition of exclusive marketing rights.
(a) FDA will send the sponsor (or the permanent-resident U.S. agent, if applicable) timely written notice recognizing exclusive marketing rights when an application for a MUMS-designated drug has been conditionally approved or approved. The written notice will inform the sponsor of the requirements for maintaining MUMS-designated drug exclusive marketing rights for the full 7-year term. This notice will generally be contained in the letter conditionally approving or approving the application.
(b) When an application is conditionally approved or approved for a
MUMS-designated drug that qualifies for exclusive marketing rights, FDA will publish this information in the
Federal Register
at the time of the conditional approval or approval. This notice will generally be contained in the notice of conditional approval or approval of the application.
§ 516.36
Insufficient quantities of MUMS-designated drugs.
(a) Under section 573 of the act, whenever FDA has reason to believe that sufficient quantities of a conditionally-approved or approved, MUMS-designated drug to meet the needs for which the drug was designated cannot be assured by the sponsor, FDA will so notify the sponsor of this possible insufficiency and will offer the sponsor the following options, one of which must be exercised by a time that FDA specifies:
(1) Provide FDA information and data regarding how the sponsor can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the MUMS-designated drug within a reasonable time to meet the needs for which the drug was designated; or
(2) Provide FDA in writing the sponsor's consent for the conditional approval or approval of other applications for the same drug before the expiration of the 7-year period of exclusive marketing rights.
(b) If, within the time that FDA specifies, the sponsor fails to consent to the conditional approval or approval of other applications and if FDA finds that the sponsor has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the MUMS-designated drug to meet the needs for which the drug was designated, FDA will issue a written order terminating designation of the MUMS drug and the associated exclusive marketing rights. This order will state FDA's findings and conclusions and will constitute final agency action. An order terminating designation and associated exclusive marketing rights may issue whether or not there are other sponsors that can assure the availability of alternative sources of supply. Such an order will not withdraw the conditional approval or approval of an application. Once terminated under this section, neither designation, nor exclusive marketing rights may be reinstated.
§ 516.52
Availability for public disclosure of data and information in requests.
(a) FDA will not publicly disclose the existence of a request for MUMS-drug designation under section 573 of the act prior to final FDA action on the request unless the existence of the request has been previously publicly disclosed or acknowledged.
(b) Whether or not the existence of a pending request for designation has been publicly disclosed or acknowledged, no data or information in the request are available for public disclosure prior to final FDA action on the request.
(c) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, upon final FDA action on a request for designation, the public availability of data and information in the request will be determined in accordance with part 20 of this chapter and other applicable statutes and regulations.
(d) In accordance with § 516.28, FDA will make a cumulative list of all MUMS-drug designations available to the public and update such list periodically. In accordance with § 516.29, FDA will give public notice of the termination of all MUMS-drug designations.

(c)
Reporting requirements
—(1)
Three-day indexed drug field alert report.
The holder must inform the appropriate FDA District Office or local FDA resident post of any product or manufacturing defects that may result in serious adverse drug events within 3 working days of first becoming aware that such a defect may exist. The holder may initially provide this information by telephone or other electronic communication means, with prompt written followup. The mailing cover must be plainly marked “3-Day Indexed Drug Field Alert Report.”
(2)
Fifteen-day indexed drug alert report.
The holder must submit a report on each serious, unexpected adverse drug event, regardless of the source of the information. The holder must submit the report within 15 working days of first receiving the information. The mailing cover must be plainly marked “15-Day Indexed Drug Alert Report.”
(3)
Annual indexed drug experience report.
The holder must submit this report every year on the anniversary date of the letter granting the request for addition of the new animal drug to the index, or within 60 days thereafter. The report must contain data and information for the full reporting period. Any previously submitted information contained in the report must be identified as such. The holder may ask FDA to change the date of submission and, after approval of such request, file such reports by the new filing date. The report must contain the following:
(i) The number of distributed units of each size, strength, or potency (e.g., 100,000 bottles of 100 5-milligram tablets; 50,000 10-milliliter vials of 5- percent solution) distributed during the reporting period. This information must be presented in two categories: Quantities distributed domestically and quantities exported. This information must include any distributor-labeled product.
(ii) If the labeling has changed since the last report, include a summary of those changes and the holder's and distributor's current package labeling, including any package inserts. For large-size package labeling or large shipping cartons, submit a representative copy (e.g., a photocopy of pertinent areas of large feed bags). If the labeling has not
changed since the last report, include a statement of such fact.
(iii) A summary of any changes made during the reporting period in the methods used in, and facilities and controls used for, manufacture, processing, and packing. This information must be presented in the same level of detail that it was presented in the request for determination of eligibility for indexing. Do not include changes that have already been submitted under § 516.161.
(iv) Nonclinical laboratory studies and clinical data not previously reported under this section.
(v) Adverse drug experiences not previously reported under this section.
(vi) Any other information pertinent to safety or effectiveness of the indexed drug not previously reported under this section.
(4)
Distributor's statement.
At the time of initial distribution of an indexed drug by a distributor, the holder must submit a report containing the following:
(i) The distributor's current product labeling. This must be identical to that in the index listing except for a different and suitable proprietary name (if used) and the name and address of the distributor. The name and address of the distributor must be preceded by an appropriate qualifying phrase such as “manufactured for” or “distributed by.”
(ii) A signed statement by the distributor stating:
(A) The category of the distributor's operations (e.g., wholesale or retail);
(B) That the distributor will distribute the drug only under the indexed drug labeling;
(C) That the distributor will promote the indexed drug only for use under the conditions stated in the index listing; and
(D) If the indexed drug is a prescription new animal drug, that the distributor is regularly and lawfully engaged in the distribution or dispensing of prescription products.
(5)
Other reporting.
FDA may by order require that a holder submit information in addition to that required by this section or that the holder submit the same information but at different times or reporting periods.
§ 516.167
Removal from the index.
(a) After due notice to the holder of the index listing and an opportunity for an informal conference as described in § 516.123, FDA shall remove a new animal drug from the index if FDA finds that:
(1) The same drug in the same dosage form for the same intended use has been approved or conditionally approved;
(2) The expert panel failed to meet the requirements in § 516.141;
(3) On the basis of new information before FDA, evaluated together with the evidence available to FDA when the new animal drug was listed in the index, the benefits of using the new animal drug for the indexed use do not outweigh its risks to the target animal, taking into account the harm caused by the absence of an approved or conditionally-approved new animal drug for the minor species in question;
(4) Any of the conditions in § 516.133(a)(2), (5), or (6) are present;
(5) The manufacture of the new animal drug is not in accordance with current good manufacturing practices;
(6) The labeling, distribution, or promotion of the new animal drug is not in accordance with the index listing;
(7) The conditions and limitations of use associated with the index listing have not been followed; or
(8) Any information used to support the request for addition to the index contains any untrue statement of material fact.
(b) The agency may partially remove an indexing listing if, in the opinion of the agency, such partial removal would satisfactorily resolve a safety or effectiveness issue otherwise warranting removal of the listing under section 572(f)(1)(B) of the act.
(c) FDA may immediately suspend a new animal drug from the index if FDA determines that there is a reasonable probability that the use of the drug would present a risk to the health of humans or other animals. The agency will subsequently provide due notice and an opportunity for an informal conference as described in § 516.123.
(d) A decision of FDA to remove a new animal drug from the index following an informal conference, if any,
shall constitute final agency action subject to judicial review.
§ 516.171
Confidentiality of data and information in an index file.
(a) For purposes of this section, the index file includes all data and information submitted to or incorporated by reference into the index file, such as data and information related to investigational use exemptions under § 516.125, requests for determination of eligibility for indexing, requests for addition to the index, modifications to indexed drugs, changes in ownership, reports submitted under § 516.165, and master files. The availability for public disclosure of any record in the index file shall be handled in accordance with the provisions of this section.
(b) The existence of an index file will not be disclosed by FDA before an index listing has been made public by FDA, unless it has previously been publicly disclosed or acknowledged by the requestor.
(c) If the existence of an index file has not been publicly disclosed or acknowledged, no data or information in the index file are available for public disclosure.
(d) If the existence of an index file has been publicly disclosed or acknowledged before an index listing has been made public by FDA, no data or information contained in the file will be available for public disclosure before such index listing is made public, but the agency may, at its discretion, disclose a brief summary of such selected portions of the safety and effectiveness data as are appropriate for public consideration of a specific pending issue, e.g., at an open session of a Food and Drug Administration advisory committee or pursuant to an exchange of important regulatory information with a foreign government.
(e) After FDA sends a written notice to the requestor granting a request for addition to the index, the following data and information in the index file are available for public disclosure unless extraordinary circumstances are shown:
(1) All safety and effectiveness data and information previously disclosed to the public, as defined in § 20.81 of this chapter.
(2) A summary or summaries of the safety and effectiveness data and information submitted with or incorporated by reference in the index file. Such summaries do not constitute the full information described under section 572(c) and (d) of the act on which the safety or effectiveness of the drug may be determined. Such summaries will be based on the draft Freedom of Information summary submitted under § 516.145, which will be reviewed and, where appropriate, revised by FDA.
(3) A protocol for a test or study, unless it is shown to fall within the exemption established for trade secrets and confidential commercial information in § 20.61 of this chapter.
(4) Adverse reaction reports, product experience reports, consumer complaints, and other similar data and information, after deletion of the following:

(f) The following data and information in an index file are not available for public disclosure unless they have been previously disclosed to the public as defined in § 20.81 of this chapter, or they relate to a product or ingredient that has been abandoned and they no longer represent a trade secret or confidential commercial or financial information as defined in § 20.61 of this chapter:
(1) Manufacturing methods or processes, including quality control procedures.
(2) Production, sales, distribution, and similar data and information, except that any compilation of such data and information aggregated and prepared in a way that does not reveal data or information which is not available for public disclosure under this provision is available for public disclosure.
(3) Quantitative or semiquantitative formulas.
(g) Subject to the disclosure provisions of this section, the agency shall regard the contents of an index file as confidential information unless specifically notified in writing by the holder of the right to disclose, to reference, or otherwise utilize such information on behalf of another named person.
(h) For purposes of this regulation, safety and effectiveness data include all studies and tests of an animal drug on animals and all studies and tests on the animal drug for identity, stability, purity, potency, and bioavailability.
(i) Safety and effectiveness data and information that have not been previously disclosed to the public are available for public disclosure at the time any of the following events occurs unless extraordinary circumstances are shown:
(1) No work is being or will be undertaken to have the drug indexed in accordance with the request.
(2) A final determination is made that the drug cannot be indexed and all legal appeals have been exhausted.
