# Explanation
The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
Title 1 through Title 16
as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27
as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41
as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50
as of October 1
The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.

# LEGAL STATUS
The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

# HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, April 1, 2025), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

# EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.

# OMB CONTROL NUMBERS
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request.
Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.

# PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.

# “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.

# INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
What is incorporation by reference?
Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
What is a proper incorporation by reference?
The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
(b) The matter incorporated is adequately summarized in the preamble of the final rule and is available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?
If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or email fr.inspection@nara.gov.

# CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES
A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR
Index and Finding Aids.
This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.
An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

# REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

Existing projects.
For a mortgage being insured under section 223(f) of the Act, if the application provides for the completion of repairs, replacements and/or improvements (repairs), the Commissioner will charge an inspection fee equal to one percent (1%) of the cost of the repairs.

If the amount of the commitment issued or increase in mortgage granted is less than the amount applied for, the Commissioner shall refund the excess amount of the application and commitment fees submitted by the applicant. If an application is rejected before it is assigned for processing, or in such other instances as the Commissioner may determine, the entire application and commitment fee or any portion thereof may be returned to the applicant.

# Commitment Applications
§ 200.45

Preapplication conference.
Except for mortgages insured under section 241(f) or 242 of the Act, the local HUD Office will determine whether participation in such a conference is required as a condition to submission of an initial application for either a site appraisal and market analysis (SAMA) letter (for new construction), a feasibility letter (for substantial rehabilitation), or for a firm commitment. The project sponsor may elect (after the preapplication conference if required) to submit an application for a SAMA or a feasibility letter (as appropriate), or for a firm commitment for insurance depending upon the completeness of the drawings, specifications and other required exhibits. An application for a SAMA or feasibility letter may be submitted by the project sponsor. An application for a firm commitment for insurance must be submitted by both the project sponsor and an approved mortgagee. Applications shall be submitted to the local HUD Office on HUD-approved forms. No application will be considered unless accompanied by all exhibits required by the form and program handbooks. At the option of the local HUD Office, the SAMA/Feasibility letter stage of processing can be combined with the firm commitment stage of processing.
(b)
Firm commitment requirement.
An application for a firm commitment must be made by an approved mortgagee for any project for which a mortgagor seeks mortgage insurance under the Act.
(c)
Staged applications.
Staged applications leading to an application for firm commitment shall be made as determined appropriate by the Commissioner, and in accordance with such terms and conditions established by the Commissioner. The intermediate stages to firm commitment may include a site appraisal and market analysis (SAMA) letter stage or a feasibility letter stage and a conditional commitment. The conditional commitment stage applies only to mortgages to be insured pursuant to section 223(f) of the Act.
(d)
Effect of SAMA letter, feasibility letter, and firm commitment
—(1)
SAMA letter.
(i) The issuance of a SAMA letter indicates completion of the site appraisal and market analysis stage to determine initial acceptability of the site and recognition of a specific market need. The SAMA letter is not a commitment to insure a mortgage for the proposed project and does not bind the Commissioner to issue a firm commitment to insure. The SAMA letter precedes the later submission of acceptable plans and specifications for the proposed project and is limited to advising the applicant as to the following determinations of the Commissioner, which shall not be changed to the detriment of an applicant, if the application for a firm commitment is received before expiration of the SAMA letter:
(A) The land value fully improved (with off-site improvements installed);
(B) The acceptability of the proposed project site, the proposed composition, number and size of the units and the market for the number of proposed units. Where the application is not acceptable as submitted, but can be made acceptable by a change in the number, size, or composition of the units, the SAMA letter may establish the specific lesser number of units which would be acceptable and any acceptable alternative plan for the composition and size of units; and
(C) The acceptability of the unit rents proposed. Where rent levels are unacceptable, the SAMA letter may establish specific rents which are acceptable.
(ii) After receiving a SAMA letter, the sponsor shall submit design drawings and specifications in a timeframe prescribed by the Commissioner. The Commissioner will review and comment on design development and the drawings and specifications. The comments will be provided to the sponsor for use in preparing a firm commitment application.
(2)
Feasibility letter.
The issuance of a feasibility letter indicates approval of the preliminary work write-up and outline specifications and completion of
technical processing involving the estimated rehabilitation cost of the project, the “as is” value of the site, the detailed estimates of operating expenses and taxes, the specific unit rents, the vacancy allowance, and the estimated mortgage amount. The issuance of a feasibility letter is not a commitment to insure a mortgage for the proposed project and does not bind the Commissioner to issue a firm commitment to insure. Determinations found in a feasibility letter are not to be binding upon the Department and may be changed in whole or in part at any later point in time. The letter may even be unilaterally terminated by the Commissioner if found necessary.
(3)
Conditional commitment.
The issuance of a Section 223(f) conditional commitment indicates completion of technical processing involving the estimated value of the property, the detailed estimates of rents, operating expenses and taxes and an estimated mortgage amount.
(e)
Term of SAMA letter, feasibility letter, and conditional commitment.
A SAMA letter, a feasibility letter, and a conditional commitment shall be effective for whatever term is specified in the respective letter or commitment.
(f)
Rejection of an application.
A significant deviation in an application from the Commissioner's terms or conditions in an earlier stage application commitment or agreement shall be grounds for rejection. The fees paid to such date shall be considered as having been earned notwithstanding such rejection.

§ 200.121
Requirements and effectiveness.
(a) Multifamily mortgagees, which are required by 24 CFR part 207 to report mortgage delinquencies, defaults, reinstatements, assignment elections, withdrawals of assignment elections, and related information, must submit this information electronically, over the Internet, in accordance with the following schedule of effectiveness:
(1) Mortgagees having 70 or more insured mortgage loans must comply with this section by no later than March 1, 1999;
(2) Mortgagees having from 26 to 69 insured mortgage loans must comply with this section by no later than January 1, 2000;

(b) Any appraisals, inspections, environmental assessments, and technical or financial evaluations conducted by or for the Commissioner are performed to determine the maximum insurable mortgage, and to protect the Commissioner and the FHA insurance funds. Such appraisals, inspections, assessments and evaluations neither create nor imply a duty or obligation from HUD to the mortgagor, or to any other party, and are not to be regarded as a warranty by HUD to the mortgagor, or any other party, of the value or condition of the property.
(c) For all new construction as well as structural repairs and/or renovations of existing properties, to the extent that an inspection is required to determine if construction quality of a one- to four-unit property is acceptable as security for an FHA-insured loan, the following requirements apply:

For both new and existing construction, the lender shall, in order to ensure compliance with FHA requirements:
(i) Select a Residential Combination Inspector (or its successor designation) or a Combination Inspector (or its successor designation) certified by the International Code Council (or its successor organization) who is licensed or certified as a home inspector in accordance with the applicable State and local requirements governing the licensing or certification of those jurisdictions that license or certify such inspectors in the respective jurisdiction. The lender shall provide a certification from such inspector that the new construction and/or structural repair or renovation work is completed satisfactorily and in compliance with any applicable building code.
(ii) In the absence of such Residential Combination Inspector and Combination Inspector, the lender shall obtain an inspection performed by a third party, who is a registered architect, a professional engineer, or a trades person or contractor, and who has met the licensing and bonding requirements of the State in which the property is located. The lender shall provide a certification from such inspector that the inspector is licensed and bonded under applicable State law, and that the new construction and/or structural repair or renovation work is completed satisfactorily and in compliance with any applicable building code.

(a)
Payment of final interest on maturing or called debentures.
If the notice of maturity or call for redemption shall so provide, the final installment of interest payable on any debentures at maturity or earlier redemption date may be paid with the principal in accordance with the assignments on the debentures instead of by separate check drawn to the order of the registered payee and forwarded to him at his address of record.
(b)
Closing of transfer books.
If the call for redemption shall so provide, the books maintained by the Treasury Department may be closed against transfers and denominational exchanges in debentures for three full months preceding any interest payment date with respect to any debentures called for redemption on such interest payment date.

§ 200.159
Relief on account of lost, stolen, destroyed, mutilated or defaced debentures.
The statutes of the United States and the regulations of the Treasury Department governing relief on account of the

Debentures shall, at the option of the Commissioner and with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, be redeemable at par plus accrued interest on any semiannual interest payment date on 3 months' notice of redemption given in such manner as the Commissioner shall prescribe. The debenture interest on the debentures called for redemption shall cease on the semiannual interest payment date designated in the call notice. The Commissioner may include with the notice of redemption an offer to purchase the debentures at par plus accrued interest at any time during the period between the notice of redemption and the redemption date. If the debentures are purchased by the Commissioner after such call and prior to the named redemption date, the debenture interest shall cease on the date of purchase.
§ 200.161
Administration of debenture transactions.
The Secretary of the Treasury or the Acting Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and empowered, on behalf of the Commissioner, to administer the regulations governing any transactions and operations in debentures, to do all things necessary to conduct such transactions and operations, and to delegate such authority at his discretion to other officers, employees, and agents of the U.S. Treasury Department. At his discretion the Secretary, the Under Secretary, or any Assistant Secretary of the Treasury acting by direction of the Secretary, is authorized to waive any such regulation on behalf of the Commissioner in any particular case where a similar regulation of the Treasury Department with respect to United States bonds or interest thereon would be waived.
§ 200.162
Certificates of claim.
The certificate of claim issued to the mortgagee at the time debentures are issued constitutes an agreement by the FHA that after the FHA has recovered its investment in a particular property any excess over and above such investment is available for payment on the certificate of claim.

§ 200.200
What is the Appraiser Roster?
(a)
Appraiser Roster.
HUD maintains a list of appraisers. A mortgagee must select only an appraiser from this list
for the appraisal of a property that is to be the security for an FHA-insured single family mortgage.
(b)
Disclaimer.
Since an appraisal is performed to determine the maximum insurable mortgage and to also protect the FHA insurance funds, the inclusion of an appraiser on the Appraiser Roster does not create or imply a warranty or endorsement to a prospective homebuyer or to any other organization or individual by HUD of the listed appraiser nor does it represent a warranty of any appraisal performed by the listed appraiser. The inclusion of an appraiser on the Appraiser Roster means only that a listed appraiser has met the qualifications and conditions, prescribed by the Secretary, for inclusion on the Appraiser Roster.
§ 200.202
How do I apply for placement on the Appraiser Roster?
(a) Application. To apply for placement on the Appraiser Roster, you must submit an application to HUD.

(2) You must not be listed on:

(ii) HUD's Limited Denial of Participation List; or
(iii) HUD's Credit Alert Verification Reporting System.

(2)
Procedure for removal.
If you are a listed appraiser and HUD decides to remove you for cause from the Appraiser Roster, the following procedure applies to you unless you have been issued a final debarment, suspension, or limited denial of participation, in which case you are subject to paragraph (a)(3) of this section:
(i) You will be given written notice of your proposed removal. The notice will include the reasons for your proposed removal and the duration of your proposed removal.
(ii) You will have 20 days from the date of your notice of proposed removal to submit a written response appealing the proposed removal and to request a
conference. A request for a conference must be in writing and must be submitted along with a written response.
(iii) Within 30 days of receiving your written response, or if you have requested a conference, within 30 days after the completion of your conference, a HUD official, designated by the Secretary, will review your appeal and will send you a final decision either affirming, modifying, or canceling your removal from the Appraiser Roster. HUD may extend this time upon giving you notice. The HUD official designated by the Secretary to review your appeal will not be someone involved in HUD's initial removal decision nor will it be someone who reports to a person involved in that initial decision.
(iv) If you do not submit a written response, your removal will be effective 20 days after the date of HUD's initial removal notice.

(b)
Reinstatement.
If an appraiser who has been removed from the Roster wants to be reinstated on the Roster, the appraiser must follow the procedures and requirements contained in this subpart for placement on the Roster. Before an appraiser is eligible to reapply for placement on the Roster, the appraiser shall comply with the terms of any applicable remedial training education requirements, and the time period for the appraiser's removal from the Roster shall have expired.
(c)
Automatic suspension from Appraiser Roster
—(1)
Appraisers subject to state disciplinary action.
An appraiser whose state certification in any state has been revoked, suspended, or surrendered as a result of a state disciplinary action is automatically suspended from the Appraiser Roster and prohibited from conducting FHA appraisals in any state until HUD receives evidence demonstrating that the state-imposed sanction has been lifted.
(2)
Expirations not due to state disciplinary action.
An appraiser whose certification in a state has expired is automatically suspended from the Appraiser Roster in that state and may not conduct FHA appraisals in that state until HUD receives evidence that demonstrates renewal, but may continue to perform FHA appraisals in other states in which the appraiser is certified.
(d)
Education requirements.
Where there is evidence that an appraiser is deficient in FHA appraisal requirements, HUD may require an appraiser to undergo professional training.
(e)
Other action.
Nothing in this section prohibits HUD from taking any other action against an appraiser, as provided under 2 CFR part 2424, or from seeking any other remedy against an appraiser, available to HUD by statute or otherwise.

The purpose of this subpart is to set forth the Department's equal opportunity regulations for affirmative fair housing marketing under FHA subsidized and unsubsidized housing programs.
§ 200.605
Authority.
The regulations in this subpart are issued pursuant to the authority to issue regulations granted to the Secretary by section 7(d) of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965, 42 U.S.C. 3535(d), and implement the functions, powers, and

[40 FR 20080, May 8, 1975]
§ 200.610
Policy.
It is the policy of the Department to administer its FHA housing programs affirmatively, as to achieve a condition in which individuals of similar income levels in the same housing market area have a like range of housing choices available to them regardless of their race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status or national origin. Each applicant for participation in FHA subsidized and unsubsidized housing programs shall pursue affirmative fair housing marketing policies in soliciting buyers and tenants, in determining their eligibility, and in concluding sales and rental transactions.
[40 FR 20080, May 8, 1975, as amended at 58 FR 41337, Aug. 3, 1993]
§ 200.615
Applicability.
The affirmative fair housing marketing requirements, as set forth in paragraphs (a) through (f) of § 200.620, shall apply to all applicants for participation in FHA subsidized and unsubsidized housing programs whose application is hereafter approved for development or rehabilitation of:
(a) Multifamily projects and manufactured home parks of five or more lots, units or spaces, and initial submissions by a lender for an application for mortgage insurance on a single family property, where the property is located in a subdivision and the builder or developer intends to sell five or more properties in the subdivision; or
(b) Dwelling units, when the applicant's participation in FHA housing programs had exceeded or would thereby exceed development of five or more such dwelling units during the year preceding the application, except that there shall not be included in a determination of the number of dwelling units developed by an applicant those in which a single family dwelling is constructed or rehabilitated for occupancy by a mortgagor on property owned by the mortgagor and in which the applicant had no interest prior to entering into the contract for construction or rehabilitation.

§ 200.620
Requirements.
With respect to all FHA subsidized or unsubsidized programs in which the applicant hereafter participates (except for housing for which a conditional commitment has been issued prior to the effective date of these regulations), the applicant shall meet the following requirements or, if he contracts marketing responsibility to another party, be responsible for that party's carrying out the requirements:
(a) Carry out an affirmative program to attract buyers or tenants, regardless of sex, handicap or familial status, of all minority and majority groups to the housing for initial sale or rental. An affirmative marketing program shall be in effect for each multifamily project throughout the life of the mortgage. Such a program shall typically involve publicizing to minority persons the availability of housing opportunities regardless of race, color, religion, sex, handicap or familial status or national origin, through the type of media customarily utilized by the applicant, including minority publications or other minority outlets which are available in the housing market area. All advertising shall include either the Department-approved Equal Housing Opportunity logo or slogan or statement and all advertising depicting persons shall depict persons of majority and minority groups, including both sexes.
(b) Maintain a nondiscriminatory hiring policy in recruiting from both minority and majority groups, including both sexes and the handicapped, for staff engaged in the sale or rental of properties.
(c) Instruct all employees and agents in writing and orally in the policy of nondiscrimination and fair housing.
(d) Specifically solicit eligible buyers or tenants reported to the applicant by the Area or Insuring Office.
(e) Prominently display in all offices in which sale or rental activity pertaining to the project or subdivision takes place the Department-approved Fair Housing Poster and include in any
printed material used in connection with sales or rentals, the Department-approved Equal Housing Opportunity logo or slogan or statement.
(f) Post in a conspicuous position on all FHA project sites a sign displaying prominently either the Department-approved Equal Housing Opportunity logo or slogan or statement.

§ 200.625
Affirmative fair housing marketing plan.
Each applicant for participation in FHA housing programs to which these regulations apply shall provide on a form to be supplied by the Department information indicating his affirmative fair housing marketing plan to comply with the requirements set forth in § 200.620.

§ 200.810
Single family insurance and coinsurance.
(a)
General.
(1) The requirements of this section apply to any one-to four-family dwelling which was constructed before 1978 and is the subject of an application for mortgage insurance under section 203(b) or other sections of the National Housing Act relating to the insurance or coinsurance of mortgages on one-to-four-family dwellings. Such other sections include:
(i) Section 244 (coinsurance);
(ii) Section 213 (cooperative housing insurance);
(iii) Section 220 (rehabilitation and neighborhood conservation housing insurance);
(iv) Section 221 (housing for moderate income and displaced families);
(v) Section 222 (mortgagor insurance for servicemen);
(vi) Section 809 (armed services housing for civilian employees);
(vii) Section 810 (armed services housing in impacted areas);
(viii) Section 234 (mortgage insurance for condominiums);
(ix) Section 235 (mortgage assistance payments for home ownership and project rehabilitation);
(x) Section 237 (special mortgage insurance for low and moderate income families); and
(xi) Section 240 (mortgage insurance on loans for purchase of fee simple title from lessors).
(2) [Reserved]
(3) Applications for insurance in connection with a refinancing transaction where an appraisal is not required under the applicable procedures established by the Commissioner are excluded from the coverage of this section. Any housing assisted under the programs set out in this section for which no new activity is applied for or required is not covered by this section.
(b)
Appraisal.
The appraiser shall, when appraising a dwelling constructed prior to 1978, inspect the dwelling for defective paint surfaces.
(c)
Treatment of defective paint surfaces.
For defective paint surfaces, treatment shall be provided to defective areas. Treatment of hazards shall consist of covering or removing defective paint surfaces. Covering may be accomplished by such means as adding a layer of wallboard to the wall surface. Depending on the wall condition, wallcoverings which are permanently attached may be used. Covering or replacing trim surfaces is also permitted. Paint removal may be accomplished by such methods as scraping, heat treatment (infra-red or coil type heat guns) or chemicals. Machine sanding and use of propane or gasoline torches (open-flame methods) are not permitted. Washing and repainting without thorough removal or covering does not constitute adequate treatment. In the case of defective paint spots, scraping and repainting the defective area is considered adequate treatment. Treatment of a defective paint surface is not required if such a surface is found to not be a lead-based paint surface by a lead-based paint inspector certified pursuant to procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency at 40 CFR part 745.
(d)
Home equity conversion mortgage insurance.
The requirements of this section, as modified by the following sentence, apply to a dwelling which is the subject of an application for mortgage insurance under section 255 of the National Housing Act (home equity conversion insurance) unless the mortgagor provides the certification described in § 206.45(d) of this title. The defective paint surface may be treated after the mortgage is endorsed for insurance, provided that the defective paint surface is treated as expeditiously as possible in accordance with the repair work provisions contained in § 206.47 of this title.

[58 FR 60248, Nov. 15, 1993]
§ 200.925a
Multifamily and care-type minimum property standards.
(a)
Construction standards.
Multifamily or care-type properties shall comply with the minimum property standards contained in the handbook identified in § 200.929(b)(2). In addition, each such property shall, for the Department's purposes, comply with:
(1) The applicable State of local building code, if the property is located within a jurisdiction which has a building code accepted by the Secretary under § 200.925a(d); or
(2)(i) The applicable State or local building code, and
(ii) Those portions of the codes identified in § 200.295c which are designated by the HUD Field Office serving the jurisdiction in which the property is to be located, if the property is located in a jurisdiction which has a building code partially accepted by the Secretary; or
(3) The appropriate codes, as identified in § 200.925c(c), if the property is not located within a jurisdiction which has a building code accepted by the Secretary.
(b)
Conflicting standards.
The minimum property standards contained in the handbook identified in § 200.929(b)(2) do not preempt state or local standards, nor do they alter or affect a builder's obligation to comply with any state or local requirements. However, a property shall be eligible for benefits only if it complies with all applicable minimum property standards, including referenced standards.
(c)
Standard for evaluating local building codes.
The Secretary shall compare the portions of a local or State building code applicable to residential or institutional occupancy, as appropriate, submitted under § 200.925a(d) to the list of construction related areas contained in § 200.925b.
(1) A State or local code will be accepted if it regulates each area on the list.
(2) A State or local building code will be partially accepted if it regulates
most of the areas on the list. However, no code may be partially accepted if it fails to regulate the subarea for seismic design (see § 200.925b(c)(5)), or if it fails to regulate subareas in more than one of the following major areas listed in § 200.925b: fire safety, light and ventilation, structural loads and seismic design, foundation systems, materials standards, construction components, glass, mechanical, plumbing, electrical, and elevators.
(3) For purposes of this paragraph, a state or local code regulates an area if it establishes a standard concerning that area. However, for earthquake loads (see § 200.925b(c)(5)), ASCE 7-88 is mandatory.
(d)
Review process and acceptance
—(1)
Jurisdictions without previously accepted building codes.
The following submission requirements apply to developers and other interested parties in jurisdictions without building codes, jurisdictions with building codes which have never been submitted for acceptance, and jurisdictions with building codes which have been submitted for acceptance and neither accepted nor partially accepted by the Secretary.
(i) Developers or other interested parties must comply with one of the following by the time of application for insurance or other benefits:
(A) The developer or other interested party may choose to comply with the appropriate codes as identified in § 200.925c. If the developer or other interested party so chooses, then the multifamily or care-type property shall be constructed in accordance with one of the model codes designated in paragraph (c)(1), (2) or (3) of § 200.925c and with any other code or codes identified in the same paragraph. In such instances, the developer or other interested party shall notify the Department of the code or group of codes with which it intends to comply by the time of application for insurance or other benefits; or
(B) The developer or other interested party may choose to comply with the State or local building code, if such code is acceptable to the Secretary. To obtain the Secretary's acceptance, the developer or other interested party shall submit the material specified in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section to the HUD Field Office serving the jurisdiction in which the property is to be constructed. Such material may be submitted at any time; provided, however, that it must be submitted no later than the time of application for mortgage insurance or other benefits.
(ii) If, under paragraph (d)(1)(i)(B) of this section, the developer or other interested party chooses to comply with the State or local building code as prescribed in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, it shall submit the following material to the HUD field Office serving the jurisdiction in which the property is to be constructed:
(A) A copy of the jurisdiction's building code, including all applicable service codes, appendices and referenced standards; and
(B) A copy of the statute, ordinance, regulation, or order establishing the code, if such statute, ordinance, regulation or order is not contained in the building code itself.
However, the developer or other interested party need not submit any document already on file in the Field Office.
(2)
Jurisdictions with previously accepted or partially accepted building codes.
The following submission requirements apply to developers and other interested parties in any jurisdiction with a building code which has been accepted or partially accepted by the Secretary:
(i) At the time of application for mortgage insurance or other benefits, the developer or other interested party shall submit to the HUD Field Office serving the jurisdiction in which the property is to be constructed.
(A) A certificate stating that, since its acceptance by the Secretary, the jurisdiction's building code has not been changed; or
(B)(

) A copy of all changes to the jurisdiction's building code, including all applicable service codes and appendices, which have been made since the date of the code's acceptance by the Secretary. However, the developer or other interested party need not submit any part already in the possession of the Field Office; and
(
2
) A copy of the statute, ordinance regulation, or order making such changes in the code.
(3)
Notification of decision.
The Secretary shall review the material submitted under paragraphs (d) (1)(ii) and (2)(i). Following that review, the Secretary shall issue a written notice (except in the case of a previously accepted code which hasn't been changed) to the submitting party stating whether the State or local building code has been accepted, partially accepted, or whether the Secretary's previous acceptance or partial acceptance has been continued; the basis for the Secretary's decision; and a notification of the submitting party's right to present its views concerning the denial of acceptance if the code is neither accepted nor partially accepted. The Secretary may, in his discretion, permit either an oral or written presentation of views.
(i) If a developer or other interested party is notified that a State or local building code has not been accepted, then the multifamily or care-type properties eligible for HUD benefits in that jurisdiction shall be constructed in accordance with the appropriate codes indicated in § 200.925c(c). In such instances, the developer or other interested party shall notify the HUD Field Office of the code or codes with which it chooses to comply, in accordance with § 200.925a(d)(1)(i)(A).
(ii) If a developer or other interested party is notified that a State or local building code has been partially accepted, then the multifamily or care-type properties eligible for HUD benefits in that jurisdiction shall be constructed in accordance with the applicable State or local building code, plus those additional requirements identified in the written notice issued by the Secretary under § 200.925a(d)(3). The written notice shall identify, in accordance with appendix J of the Handbook identified in § 200.929(b)(2), those portions of the codes listed at § 200.925c(a) with which the property must comply.
(iii) Each Regional Office will maintain a current list of jurisdictions with accepted building codes and a current list of jurisdictions with partially accepted building codes. The lists will state the most recent date of each code's acceptance or partial acceptance and will be available to any interested party upon request. In addition, the list of jurisdictions whose codes have been partially accepted shall identify those portions of the codes listed at § 200.925c(a) with which the property must comply.

§ 200.926
Minimum property standards for one and two family dwellings.
(a)
Construction standards
—(1)
Applicable structures.
The standards identified or contained in this section, and in §§ 200.926a-200.926e, apply to single family detached homes, duplexes, three-unit homes, and to living units in a structure where the units are located side-by-side in town house fashion. Section 200.926d(c)(4) also applies to four-unit homes.
(2)
Applicability of standards to new construction.
The standards referenced in paragraph (a)(1) of this section are applicable to structures which are:
(i) Approved for insurance or other benefits prior to the start of construction, including approval under the Direct Endorsement process described in § 203.5 of this chapter, or under the Lender Insurance process described in § 203.6 of this chapter;
(ii) Approved for insurance or other benefits based upon participation in an insured warranty program; or
(iii) Insured as new construction based upon a Certificate of Reasonable Value issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs.
(b)
Conflicting standards.
The requirements contained in § 200.926d do not preempt local or State standards, nor do they alter or affect a builder's obligation to comply with any local or State requirements. However, a property shall be eligible for benefits only if it complies with the requirements of this subpart, including any referenced standards. When any of the requirements identified in § 200.926c are in conflict with a partially accepted local or state code, the conflict will be resolved by the HUD Field Office servicing the jurisdiction in which the property is to be located.
(c)
Standard for evaluating local or state building codes.
The Secretary shall compare a local building code submitted under paragraph (d) of this section or a State code to the list of construction related areas contained in § 200.926a.
(1) A local or State code will be accepted if it regulates each area and subarea on the list.
(2) A State or local building code will be partially accepted if it regulates most of the areas on the list. However, no code may be partially accepted if it fails to regulate the subarea for seismic design (see § 200.926a(c)(5)), or if it fails to regulate subareas in more than one of the following major areas listed in § 200.926a: fire safety, light and ventilation, structural loads and seismic design, foundation systems, materials standards, construction components, glass, mechanical, plumbing, and electrical.
(3) For purposes of this paragraph, a local or State code regulates an area or subarea if it establishes a standard concerning that area or subarea. However, for earthquake loads (see § 200.926a(c)(5)), ASCE 7-88 is mandatory.
(d)
Code selection.
Any materials required to be submitted under this section must be submitted by the time the lender or other interested party applies for mortgage insurance or other benefits.
(1)

§ 200.926d
Construction requirements.
(a)
Application
—(1)
General.
These standards cover the agency requirements for accessibility to physically handicapped people, variations to standards, real estate entity, trespass and utilities, site conditions, access, site design, streets, dedication of utilities, drainage and flood hazard exposure, special construction and product acceptance, thermal requirements, and water supply systems.
(2)
Requirements for accessibility to physically handicapped people.
The HUD Field Office will advise project sponsors as to the extent accessibility will be required for new construction of one- and two-family dwellings on a project-by-project basis.
(i)
Technical standards. See
HUD Handbook, 4910.1, Sections 100-1.3b and 100-1.3c.
(3)
Variations to standards
—(i)
New materials and technologies. See
paragraph (d) of this section. Alternatives, nonconventional or innovative methods and materials shall be equivalent to these standards in the areas of structural soundness, durability, economy of maintenance or operation and usability.
(ii)
Variation procedures.
Variations from the requirements of any standard with which the Department requires compliance shall be made in the following ways:
(A) For a particular design or construction method to be used on a single case or project, the decision is the responsibility of the Field Office. Headquarters concurrence is not required.
(B) Where a variation is intended to be on a repetitive basis, a recommendation for a Local Acceptable Standard, substantiating data, and background information shall be submitted by the Field Office to the Director, Office of Manufactured Housing and Regulatory Functions.
(iii) Variances which require individual analysis and decision in each instance are not considered as repetitive variances even though one particular standard is repeatedly the subject of variation. Such variances are covered by paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(A) of this section.
(b)
General acceptability criteria
—(1)
Real estate entity.
The property shall comprise a single plot except that a primary plot with a secondary plot for an appurtenant garage or for other use contributing to the marketability of the property will be acceptable provided the two plots are in such proximity as to comprise a readily marketable real estate entity.
(2)
Service and facilities
—(i)
Trespass.
Each living unit shall be one that can be used and maintained individually without trespass upon adjoining properties, except when the windowless wall of a detached dwelling is located on a side lot line. A detached dwelling may be located on a side lot line if:
(A) legal provision is made for permanent access for the maintenance of the exterior portion of the lot line wall, and
(B) the minimum distances from the dwelling to the dwellings on the abutting properties are not less than the sum of the side yard distances computed as appropriate for the type of opposing walls. (minimum distance 10 ft).
(ii)
Utilities.
Utility services shall be independent for each living unit, except that common services such as water, sewer, gas and electricity may be provided for living units under a single mortgage or ownership. Separate utility service shut-off for each unit shall be provided. For living units under separate ownership, common utility services may be provided from the main to the building line when protected by an easement or covenant and maintenance agreement acceptable to HUD, but shall not pass over, under or through any other living unit. Individual utilities serving a living unit may not pass over, under or through another living unit under the same mortgage unless provision is made for repair and maintenance of utilities without trespass or when protected by an easement or covenant providing permanent access for maintenance and repair of the utilities. Building drain cleanouts shall be accessible from the exterior where a single drain line within the building serves more than one unit.
(3)
Site conditions.
(i) The property shall be free of those foreseeable hazards and adverse conditions which may affect the health and safety of occupants or the structural soundness of
the improvements, or which may impair the customary use and enjoyment of the property. The hazards include toxic chemicals, radioactive materials, other pollution, hazardous activities, potential damage from soil or other differential ground movements, ground water, inadequate surface drainage, flood, erosion, or other hazards located on or off site. The site must meet the standards set forth in 24 CFR part 51, and HUD Handbook 4910.1, section 606 for termite and decay protection.
(ii) When special conditions exist or arise during construction which were unforeseen and which necessitate precautionary or hazard mitigation measures, the HUD Field Office shall require corrective work to mitigate potential adverse effects from the special conditions as necessary. Special conditions include rock formations, unstable soils or slopes, high ground water levels, springs, or other conditions which may adversely affect a property. It shall be the builder's responsibility to ensure proper design, construction and satisfactory performance where these conditions are present.
(4)
Access.
(i) Each property shall be provided with vehicular or pedestrian access by a public or private street. Private streets shall be protected by permanent easement.
(ii) Each living unit shall have a means of access such that it is unnecessary to pass through any other living unit.
(iii) The rear yard shall be accessible without passing through any other living unit.
(iv) For a townhouse type dwelling, access to the rear yard may be by means of alley, easement, passage through the dwelling, or other means acceptable to the HUD Field Office.
(c)
Site design
—(1)
General.
(i) A site design shall be provided which includes an arrangement of all site facilities necessary to create a safe, functional, healthful, durable and energy efficient living environment.
(ii) With the exception of paragraph (c)(4) of this section, these site design standards apply only in communities that have not adopted criteria for site development applicable to one and two family dwellings.
(iii) Single family detached houses situated on individual lots located on existing streets with utilities need not comply with the requirements of paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) of this section.
(2)
Streets.
(i) Existing or proposed streets on the site shall connect to private or public streets and shall provide all-weather access to all buildings for essential and emergency use, including access needed for deliveries, service, maintenance and fire equipment.
(ii) Streets shall be designed for dedication for public use and maintenance or, when approved by the HUD Field Office, may be retained as private streets where protected by permanent easements.
(3)
Dedication.
Utilities shall be located to permit dedication to the local government or appropriate public body.
(4)
Drainage and flood hazard exposure
—(i)
Residential structures located in Special Flood Hazard Areas.
The elevation of the lowest floor (including basements and other permanent enclosures) shall be at least two feet above the base flood elevation (see 24 CFR 55.8(b) for appropriate data sources).
(ii)
Residential structures located in FEMA-designated “coastal high hazard areas.”
Where FEMA has determined the base flood level without establishing stillwater elevations, the bottom of the lowest structural member of the lowest floor (excluding pilings and columns) and its horizontal supports shall be at least two feet above the base flood elevation.
(iii)
New construction.
(A) In all cases in which a Direct Endorsement (DE) mortgagee or a Lender Insurance (LI) mortgagee seeks to insure a mortgage on a one- to four-family dwelling that is newly constructed (including a newly erected manufactured home) that was processed by the DE or LI mortgagee, the DE or LI mortgagee must determine whether the property improvements (dwelling and related structures/equipment essential to the value of the property and subject to flood damage) are located on a site that is within a Special Flood Hazard Area, as designated on maps of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. If so, the DE mortgagee, before submitting the application for insurance to HUD, or the LI mortgagee, before
submitting all the required data regarding the mortgage to HUD, must obtain:
(
1
) A final Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA);
(
2
) A final Letter of Map Revision (LOMR); or
(
3
) A signed Elevation Certificate documenting that the lowest floor (including basements and other permanent enclosures) of the property improvements is at least two feet above the base flood elevation as determined by FEMA's best available information (or documenting that the lowest floor meets HUD's elevation standard for newly erected manufactured housing in 24 CFR 203.43f or 24 CFR part 3285, as applicable).
(B) Under the DE program, these mortgages are not eligible for insurance unless the DE mortgagee submits the LOMA, LOMR, or Elevation Certificate to HUD with the mortgagee's request for endorsement.
(iv)
Streets.
Streets must be usable during runoff equivalent to a 10-year return frequency. Where drainage outfall is inadequate to prevent runoff equivalent to a 10-year return frequency from ponding over 6 inches deep, streets must be made passable for commonly used emergency vehicles during runoff equivalent to a 25-year return frequency, except where an alternative access street not subject to such ponding is available.
(v)
Crawl spaces.
Crawl spaces must not pond water or be subject to prolonged dampness.
(d)

shall be sent to an administrator-approved laboratory and tested in accordance with the applicable standard. The frequency of testing shall be described in the specific building product program. The administrator shall periodically visit the manufacturer's facility to assure that the initially accepted quality control procedures are being followed.
(9)
Product decertification.
If a failure should occur in any test, the laboratory shall notify the administrator and the manufacturer. The manufacturer shall notify the administrator if a retest if requested. If a retest is not requested, validation shall be withdrawn. If the manufacturer requests a retest, the administrator shall select new samples and submit them to the same or another laboratory at the manufacturer's expense, for retest of only the test requirement(s) in which the failure(s) occurred. If the specified number of specimens pass the retest, the product can continue to be validated and listed. If the designated number of specimens described in the UM Bulletin fail, the administrator shall decertify the product. The manufacturer may request that a new selection be made of the product after correction or modifications and be subjected to the initial acceptance testing procedure or to a program of retesting established by the administrator. The administrator may decertify the product on the basis of inadequate quality control by the manufacturer. The administrator shall notify the manufacturer, HUD headquarters and the HUD Field Offices of any decertification within 7 days. When the product is decertified the manufacturer shall remove labels, tags or marks from all production and inventory in his/her control determined to be in noncompliance.
(10)
Challenge response.
Any person or organization may submit a sample of a manufacturer's certified product to the administrator in substantiation of a claim of noncompliance. Submission shall be made to the administrator that validated the manufacturer's product. The administrator shall notify the manufacturer that its product has been challenged and shall make arrangements to obtain test samples of the challenged product. An estimate of the cost of the special sample selection and testing shall be made to the complainant. The complainant shall pay the estimated cost of the investigation in advance of any testing of the challenged product, unless HUD believes the complaint to be in the public's interest. HUD may conduct its own investigation when deemed necessary based upon a complaint or a product failure. The administrator shall submit the sample of the challenged product to an approved laboratory of the administrator's choice with the request to test compliance of only the challenged requirement(s). If the samples tested prove that the product failed to meet the standard, the product shall be decertified immediately. The manufacturer whose product is decertified shall reimburse the administrator for all costs of the investigation and the administrator shall refund the complainant's advance payment.

[70 FR 43242, July 26, 2005, as amended at 72 FR 73494, Dec. 27, 2007]
§ 200.1505
Warning letter.
(a)
In general.
HUD may issue a warning letter, which specifies problems or violations identified by HUD, to a MAP lender.
(b)
Effect of warning letter.
The warning letter:
(1) Does not suspend a lender's MAP privileges;
(2) May impose a higher level of review of the lender's underwriting by HUD;
(3) May direct the taking of a corrective action; and
(4) May require a meeting in a designated HUD office with the principal owners or officers, or both, of the MAP lender to discuss the specified problems and violations, and possible corrective actions.
(c)
Relationship to other sanctions.
The issuance of a warning letter is not subject to the MAP Lender Review Board procedures in accordance with § 200.1535, and is not a prerequisite to the probation, or suspension, or termination of MAP privileges.
§ 200.1510
Probation.
(a)
In general.
Only the MAP Lender Review Board (or Board) may place a lender on probation, in accordance with the procedures of § 200.1535.
(b)
Effect of probation.
(1) Probation is intended to be corrective in nature and not punitive. As a result, release from probation is conditioned upon the lender meeting a specific requirement or requirements, such as replacement of a staff member. A lender's failure to take prompt corrective action after being placed on probation may be the basis for a recommendation of either suspension or termination. Any such recommendation shall, when possible, go to a MAP Lender Review Board composed of the same members who issued the original probation.
(2) During the probation period, a MAP lender:
(i) Shall be removed from the MAP-Approved Lender list posted on HUD's website;
(ii) May not submit, and HUD may not accept, materials after the close of business of the date of the probation letter for a new application under MAP for multifamily mortgage insurance from HUD; and
(iii) May continue to process any existing application for multifamily mortgage insurance submitted to a Multifamily Hub or Program Center before the date of the probation letter.
(3) The MAP Lender Review Board may impose a higher level of review of the lender's underwriting by HUD;
(4) Probation is nationwide in effect.
(c)
Duration of probation.
(1) Probation continues until all specific corrective actions required by the MAP Lender Review Board (for example, exclusion of a specific staff member from work on MAP loans) are taken by the MAP lender. When all corrective actions have been taken, the MAP lender shall notify the Board. Once the Board is satisfied that the corrective actions have occurred, the probation period shall end.
(2) A false statement that corrective action has been taken constitutes a false certification and may constitute a violation of 18 US.C. 1001.
(3) When probation is lifted, the lender's name shall be promptly reinstated on the MAP-Approved Lender list posted on HUD's Web site.
§ 200.1515
Suspension of MAP privileges.
(a)
In general.
Only the MAP Lender Review Board may suspend a lender's eligibility for MAP, in accordance with the procedures of § 200.1535.
(b)
Effect of suspension.
(1) A suspension may impose any conditions that may be imposed by probation.
(2) During the suspension period a MAP lender:
(i) Shall be removed from the MAP-approved lender list posted on HUD's Web site;
(ii) May not submit, and the HUD field office may not accept, materials after the close of business of the date of the suspension letter for a new application for multifamily mortgage insurance from HUD; and
(iii) May continue to process any existing application for multifamily mortgage insurance submitted to a Multifamily Hub or Program Center before the date of the suspension letter.
(3) The MAP Lender Review Board may impose a higher level of review of the lender's underwriting by HUD;
(4) Suspension is nationwide in effect.
(c)
Duration of suspension.
(1) Suspension may not exceed 12 months, except where conditions are imposed. If both a time period and conditions are imposed, a suspension shall terminate only when:
(i) The time period of the suspension has expired;
(ii) The MAP lender has submitted a certification of compliance with those conditions to the Board; and
(iii) The Board has notified the MAP lender it has received the certification of compliance and is satisfied that the corrective actions have occurred.
(2) When suspension is lifted, the lender's name shall be promptly reinstated on the MAP-Approved Lender list posted on HUD's Web site.
§ 200.1520
Termination of MAP privileges.
(a)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, only the MAP Lender Review Board may terminate a lender's MAP privileges, in accordance with the procedures of § 200.1535.
(b)
Administrative termination.
HUD will notify a lender of immediate termination of MAP privileges when either of the following circumstances is present:
(1) Failure by the MAP lender to maintain its status as an FHA-approved lender; or
(2) Failure by the MAP lender to maintain a minimum level of MAP lender activity, as evidenced by failure to submit either a pre-application package or firm commitment application at least once every 12 months.
(c)
Effect of termination.
(1) The terminated lender shall be removed from the MAP-Approved Lender list on HUD's Web site.
(2) A terminated lender may not submit, and the HUD field office may not accept, materials after the close of business of the date of the termination letter for new multifamily mortgage insurance from HUD.
(3) Any MAP pre-application or MAP application in process may no longer be processed under MAP by the terminated lender. The lender will either:
(i) Immediately transfer the transaction to the traditional application processing (TAP) procedure. HUD will completely reprocess all stages of the transaction; or
(ii) Immediately transfer the project to a new MAP lender. The new MAP lender must completely reprocess all stages of the transaction. At no time can the new MAP lender assign the pre-application, the firm application, the mortgage insurance commitment, or the insured construction loan back to the original MAP lender.
(4) HUD will not endorse any MAP loan processed by the terminated lender unless a firm commitment was issued before the date of termination.
(i) Firm commitments involving new construction or substantial rehabilitation must be immediately transferred to a new MAP lender. At no time can the new MAP lender assign the firm mortgage insurance commitment, or the insured construction loan, back to the original MAP lender.
(ii) Firm commitments issued for Section 223(f) projects may be transferred before final endorsement to any approved FHA lender or kept in the lender's portfolio.
(iii) For those construction loans that have been initially endorsed, the
MAP lender will lose its MAP privileges for construction loan administration. HUD will assume all the construction loan administration duties it normally performs for TAP processing.
(iv) The original lender may service a transferred loan once it is finally endorsed.
(5) Termination is nationwide in effect.
(6) When a MAP lender loses its MAP lender status as a result of termination, the lender's status to process transactions using TAP is unaffected, provided that the lender has maintained its status as an FHA-approved multifamily lender.
(d)
Reinstatement.
An application for reinstatement of MAP authority may not be made until at least 12 months after the date of termination. The requirements for reinstatement shall be the same as for initial qualification, and the applicant must show that the problems that led to termination have been resolved.
§ 200.1525
Settlement agreements.
(a) HUD staff, as authorized, may negotiate a settlement agreement with a MAP lender before or after the issuance of a warning letter or referral to the MAP Lender Review Board. Once a matter has been referred to the MAP Lender Review Board, only the Board may approve a settlement agreement.
(b) Settlement agreements may provide for:
(1) Cessation of any violation;
(2) Correction or mitigation of the effects of any violation;
(3) Removal of lender staff from positions involving origination, underwriting, and/or construction loan administration;
(4) Actions to collect sums of money wrongfully or incorrectly paid by the MAP lender to a third party;
(5) Implementation or revision of a quality control plan or other corrective measure acceptable to HUD; and
(6) Modification of the duration or provisions of any administrative sanction deemed to be appropriate by HUD.

§ 200.1530
Bases for sanctioning a MAP lender.
It is HUD policy that approved MAP lenders are expected to comply at all times with HUD's underwriting and construction loan administration requirements and not to take any action that presents a risk to HUD's insurance funds. A MAP lender's improper underwriting and construction loan administration activities may lead to a warning letter or other sanction from HUD. Examples of such activities include, but are not limited to, the following:
(a)
Minor offenses that may be the basis for a warning letter include:
(1) Failure to provide required exhibits or the submission of incomplete or inaccurate exhibits. Although the MAP lender will be permitted to correct minor errors or provide additional information, substantial inaccuracies or lack of significant information will result in a return of the application and retention of any fee collected;
(2) Repeated failure to complete processing to firm commitment unrelated to an underwriting analysis that demonstrates that the process should not proceed to firm commitment;
(3) Preparation of an underwriting summary that is not supported by the appropriate documentation and analysis;
(4) Failure to notify the HUD processing office promptly of changes in the mortgage loan application for a firm commitment submitted, such as changes in rents, numbers of units, or gross project area;
(5) Failure to meet MAP closing requirements or construction loan administration requirements;
(6) Business practices that do not conform to those generally accepted by prudent lenders or that show irresponsibility; and
(7) Failure to cooperate with a Lender Qualifications and Monitoring Division review by HUD.
(b)
Serious offenses that might be a basis for a warning letter or probation, suspension, or termination include:
(1) Receipt of multiple warning letters over any one-year period. In determining which sanction to pursue as a result of prior warning letters, HUD will consider the facts and circumstances surrounding those warning letters and the corrective actions, if any, undertaken by the lender;
(2) Fraud or material misrepresentation in the lender's participation in FHA multifamily programs;
(3) Lender collusion with, or influence upon, third party contractors to modify reports affecting the contractor's independent evaluation;
(4) A violation of MAP procedures by a third party contractor, which the MAP lender knew, or should have known, was occurring and which, if performed by the MAP lender itself, would constitute a ground for a sanction under this chapter;
(5) Evidence that a lender's inadequate or inaccurate underwriting was a cause for assignment of an FHA-insured mortgage and claim for insurance benefits to HUD;
(6) Identity-of-interest violations as defined by Chapter 2 of the MAP Guide;
(7) Payment by, or receipt of a payment by, a MAP lender of any kickback or other consideration, directly or indirectly, which would affect the lender's independent evaluation, or represent a conflict of interest, in connection with any FHA-insured mortgage transaction;
(8) Failure to comply with any agreement, certification, undertaking, or condition of approval listed in a MAP lender's application for approval;
(9) Noncompliance with any requirement or directive of the MAP Lender Review Board;
(10) Violation of the requirements of any contract with HUD, or violation of the requirements in any statute or regulation;
(11) Submission of false information, or a false certification, to HUD in connection with any MAP mortgage transaction;
(12) Failure of a MAP lender to respond in a timely manner to inquiries from the MAP Lender Review Board in accordance with this subpart;
(13) Indictment or conviction of a MAP lender or any of its officers, directors, principals, or employees for an offense that reflects on the responsibility, integrity, or ability of the lender to participate in the MAP initiative;
(14) Employing or retaining an officer, partner, director, or principal at the time when the person was suspended, debarred, ineligible, or subject to an LDP under 2 CFR part 2424, or otherwise prohibited from participation in HUD programs, when the MAP lender knew or should have known of the prohibition;
(15) Employing or retaining an employee who is not an officer, partner, director, or principal, and who is or will be working on HUD-FHA program matters, at a time when that person was suspended, debarred, ineligible, or subject to an LDP under 2 CFR part 2424, or otherwise prohibited from participation in HUD programs, when the MAP lender knew or should have known of the prohibition;
(16) Failure to cooperate with an audit or investigation by the HUD Office of Inspector General or an inquiry by HUD into the conduct of the MAP lender's FHA-insured loans; and
(17) Failure to fund MAP mortgage loans or any misuse of mortgage loan proceeds.
[70 FR 43242, July 26, 2005, as amended at 72 FR 73494, Dec. 27, 2007]

§ 201.1
Purpose.
These regulations implement the provisions of section 2 of title I of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1703). They contain the requirements under which an approved financial institution may obtain insurance on loans made for the alteration, repair or improvement of property, for the purchase of a manufactured home and/or the lot on which to place such home, for the purchase and installation of fire safety equipment in existing health care facilities, and for the preservation of historic structures. The insurance granted by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall be available only for loans involving property located within a State, as that term is defined in § 201.2. The insurance can cover up to 10 percent of the amount of all insured Title I loans in the financial institution's portfolio, as reflected in the
total amount of insurance coverage contained at any time in an insurance coverage reserve account established by the Secretary, less amounts for insurance claims paid. As limited by the amount of insurance coverage in such a reserve account, the insurance can cover up to 90 percent of the loss of any individual loan.
[50 FR 43523, Oct. 25, 1985, as amended at 61 FR 19795, May 2, 1996]
§ 201.2
Definitions.
As used in the regulations in this part the term:
Act
means the National Housing Act, 12 U.S.C. 1703.
Actuarial method
means the method of allocating payments made on a loan between the outstanding balance of the principal amount borrowed and the interest due on a loan obligation, under which a payment is applied first to the accrued interest, and any remainder is subtracted from, or any deficiency is added to, the unpaid balance of the obligation.
Borrower
means one who applies for and receives a loan insured under this part. The term may also include any co-maker or co-signer or any assumptor who is obligated for the repayment of a loan obligation insured under this part.
Combination loan
means a loan made for the purchase or refinancing in a single transaction of a manufactured home and a manufactured home lot, and may also include a garage, patio, carport, or other comparable appurtenance.
Dealer
means, in the case of property improvement loans, a seller, contractor, or supplier of goods or services. In the case of manufactured home loans,
dealer
means one who engages in the business of manufactured home retail sales.
Dealer loan
means a loan where a dealer, having a direct or indirect financial interest in the transaction between the borrower and the lender, assists the borrower in preparing the credit application or otherwise assists the borrower in obtaining the loan from the lender. In the case of a property improvement loan, the lender may disburse the loan proceeds solely to the borrower, or jointly to the borrower and the dealer or other parties to the transaction. In the case of a manufactured home loan, the lender may disburse the loan proceeds solely to the dealer or the borrower, or jointly to the borrower and the dealer or other parties to the transaction.
Debtor
means the borrower, any co-maker or co-signer, and any assumptor who is liable for the repayment of a defaulted loan obligation insured under this part.
Default
means a failure by the borrower to make any payment due under the note, when such failure continues for a period of 30 days. For the purpose of these regulations, the “date of default” shall be considered as 30 days after the first failure to make an installment payment on the note which is not covered by subsequent payments, when applied to the overdue installments in the order in which they became due.
Direct loan
means a loan for which a borrower makes application directly to a lender without any assistance from a dealer. The credit application, signed by the borrower, may be filled out by the borrower or by a person acting at the direction of the borrower who does not have a financial interest in the loan transaction. The lender may disburse the loan proceeds solely to the borrower or jointly to the borrower and other parties to the transaction. If a dealer takes legal action required by State law in order for the lender to obtain a valid and enforceable lien against the property, such action by the dealer will not convert an otherwise direct loan to a dealer loan.
Discount points
means a fee charged by the lender, separate from interest but part of the total finance charges on the loan, that is part of the lender's total yield on the loan needed to maintain a competitive position with other types of investments. One discount point equals one percent of the principal amount of the loan. As discount points on the loan increase, the interest rate can be expected to decrease in a fairly consistent relationship.
Existing structure
means a dwelling, including a manufactured home, that was completed and occupied at least 90 days prior to an application for a Title I loan, or a nonresidential structure
that was a completed building with a distinctive functional use prior to an application for a Title I loan. However, these occupancy and completion requirements shall not apply to:
(1) Loans having a principal obligation of $1000 or less; or
(2) Residential structures which have been damaged by conditions determined by the President to warrant relief under the provisions of title 42, chapter 68, of the United States Code.
Fire safety equipment loan
means a loan made to finance the purchase and installation of any device or construction feature which is recognized in the latest edition of the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Minimum Property Standards for Care Type Housing (HUD Handbook 4920.1) or the Fire Safety Code of the National Fire Protection Association, and which is designed to reduce the risk of death, personal injury, or property damage resulting from a fire in a health care facility.
Furniture
means movable articles of personal property relating to a home or dwelling, such as beds, chairs, sofas, lamps, tables, rugs, etc.; however, furniture does not include:
(1) Items built into the home or dwelling such as wall-to-wall carpeting or heating or cooling equipment; or
(2) Large appliances such as refrigerators, ovens, ranges, dishwashers, clothes washers or clothes dryers.
Health care facility
means a proprietary facility or facility of a private nonprofit corporation or association, licensed or regulated by the State or by the municipality or other political subdivision in which the facility is located, and operated as one or more of the following:
(1) A nursing home for the accommodation of convalescents or other persons who are not acutely ill and not in need of hospital care, but who require skilled nursing care and related medical services performed under the general direction of persons licensed by the law of the State where the facility is located to provide such care or services;
(2) An intermediate health care facility for the accommodation of persons who, because of incapacitating infirmities, require minimum but continuous care, but not continuous medical care or nursing services;
(3) An extended health care facility for inpatient care for convalescents or chronic disease patients who require skilled nursing care and related medical services; or
(4) Other comparable health care facility.
Historic preservation loan
means a loan to finance the preservation (restoration or rehabilitation) of an historic residential structure which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places or which is certified by the Secretary of the Interior as conforming with National Register criteria.
Lender
means a financial institution that:
(1) Holds a valid Title I contract of insurance and is approved by the Secretary under 24 CFR part 202 to originate, purchase, hold, service, and/or sell loans insured under this part; or
(2) Is under suspension or holds a Title I contract of insurance that has been terminated, but that remains responsible for servicing or selling Title I loans that it holds and is authorized to file insurance claims on such loans.
Loan
means a disbursement of proceeds (funds) or an advance of credit to or for the benefit of a borrower who promises to repay the principal amount of such disbursement or advance, plus interest, if any, at a stated annual rate over time, with the borrower's obligation evidenced by the borrower's execution of a note.
Loan
also means a purchase by a lender of a note evidencing such obligation, or a refinancing of an existing obligation with or without an additional disbursement of proceeds or advance of credit.
Manufactured home
means a transportable structure, comprised of one or more modules, each built on a permanent chassis, with or without a permanent foundation, designed for occupancy as a principal residence by a single family. For purposes of the annual adjustments to loan limits under this part, a manufactured home may be a single-section home comprised of one module or a multi-section home comprised of two or more modules. A new manufactured home shall comply with the minimum property standards prescribed by the Secretary to assure its
livability and durability that are published as the Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards implementing the National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974, 42 U.S.C. 5401-5426, at 24 CFR part 3280. To qualify for a manufactured home loan insured under this part, an existing manufactured home must have been constructed in accordance with standards published at 24 CFR part 3280 and must meet standards similar to the minimum property standards applicable to existing homes insured under title II of the Act, as prescribed by the Secretary.
Manufactured home improvement loan
means a loan made to finance the alteration, repair or improvement of an existing manufactured home which is classified as personalty by the State or locality in which the property is located. The proceeds of a manufactured home improvement loan may also be used for improvements to the homesite, as long as the borrower is the owner of the home and the underlying real estate.
Manufactured home loan
means a loan for the purchase or refinancing of a manufactured home and/or the lot on which to place such home. Unless otherwise indicated, the term includes manufactured home purchase loans, manufactured home lot loans, and combination loans.

A manufactured home lot may consist of platted or unplatted land, a lot in a recorded or unrecorded subdivision or in an improved area of such subdivision, or a lot in a planned unit development. A manufactured home lot may also consist of an interest in a manufactured home condominium project (including any interest in the common areas) or a share in a cooperative association which owns and operates a manufactured home park.
Manufactured home purchase loan
means a loan for the purchase or refinancing of a manufactured home exclusive of any lot or site, and may also include a garage, patio, carport, or other comparable appurtenance.
Manufacturer's invoice
means a document issued by a manufacturer and provided with a manufactured home to a retail dealer which separately details the wholesale (base) prices at the factory for specific models or series of manufactured homes and itemized options (large appliances, built-in items and equipment), plus actual itemized charges for freight from the factory to the dealer's lot or the homesite (including any rental of wheels and axles) and for any sales taxes to be paid by the dealer. The invoice may recite such prices and charges on an itemized basis or by stating an aggregate price or charge, as appropriate, for each category. The manufacturer shall certify on the invoice, or on a supplement which is attached to and made a part of the invoice, as follows:
The undersigned certifies under applicable criminal and civil penalties for fraud and misrepresentation that: (1) The wholesale (base) prices for the manufactured home and itemized options, the charges for freight and dealer-paid sales taxes, and all other statements in this invoice are true and accurate; (2) all such prices reflect the actual dealer costs at the factory, as quoted in the applicable current manufacturer's wholesale (base) price list; (3) except for any payments of volume incentives or special benefits related to this transaction, all such prices and charges exclude any costs of trade association fees or charges, discounts, bonuses, refunds, rebates, prizes, loan discount points or other financing charges, or anything else of more than nominal value which will inure to the benefit of the dealer and/or home purchaser at any date; and (4) the manufacturer has not made and will not make any payments to or for the benefit of the dealer and/or home purchaser that are not disclosed on this invoice or invoice supplement.

means a loan to finance the alteration, repair, improvement, or conversion of an existing structure used or to be used as an apartment house or a dwelling for two or more families. The multifamily structure may not be owned by a corporation, partnership, or trust, unless the prior approval of the Secretary is obtained for an exception to this requirement.
Nonresidential property improvement loan
means a loan made to finance the construction of a new exclusively nonresidential structure or the alteration, repair or improvement of an existing
structure that is nonresidential. Such a structure may be temporarily used for residential purposes while the borrower constructs a new dwelling to replace a dwelling previously occupied by the borrower that was destroyed or damaged by conditions determined by the President to warrant relief under the provisions of title 42, chapter 68, of the U.S.C., provided that the credit application is filed within one year from the date of such a determination.

§ 201.5
Waivers.
Waiver of lender's noncompliance.
The Secretary may waive a lender's noncompliance with any provision of this part, subject to statutory limitations, when it is determined that enforcement of the regulations would impose an injustice upon a lender which has substantially complied with the regulations in good faith and refunded or credited any excess charge made, and when such waiver does not involve an increase in the Secretary's obligation beyond that which would have been involved if the lender was in full compliance with the regulations.

Qualified mortgage.
A mortgage insured under section 2 of title I of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1703), except for mortgage transactions exempted under § 203.19(c)(2), is a safe harbor qualified mortgage that meets the ability to repay requirements in 15 U.S.C. 1639c(a).
(b)
Effect of indemnification on qualified mortgage status.
An indemnification demand or resolution of a demand that relates to whether the loan satisfied relevant eligibility and underwriting requirements at the time of consummation may result from facts that could allow a change to qualified mortgage status, but the existence of an indemnification does not per se remove qualified mortgage status.

Manufactured home loan eligibility.
(a)
Borrower eligibility.
To be eligible for a manufactured home loan (whether a manufactured home purchase loan, a manufactured home lot loan, or a combination loan), the borrower must become the owner of the particular property which is to be financed with such a loan. Where the loan involves a manufactured home which is classified as realty, ownership of the home must be in fee simple. Where the loan involves a manufactured home lot, ownership of the lot must be in fee simple, except where the lot consists of a share in a cooperative association which owns and operates a manufactured home park.
(b)
Eligible use of loan proceeds.
(1) The loan proceeds may be used for the purchase or refinancing of a manufactured home, a suitably developed lot on which to place a manufactured home already owned by the borrower, or a manufactured home and a suitably developed lot for the home in combination. The loan proceeds may also be used to refinance an existing manufactured home already owned by the borrower in connection with the purchase of a manufactured home lot, or to refinance a lot already owned by the borrower in connection with the purchase of a manufactured home. Where the proceeds are for a manufactured home purchase loan or combination loan, the home must be the borrower's principal residence. Where the proceeds are for a manufactured home lot loan, the borrower's manufactured home must be placed on the lot and occupied as the borrower's principal residence within six months after the date of the loan.
(2) A manufactured home financed with an insured loan under this part may be either:
(i) A new home, which is one that is purchased by the borrower within 18 months after the date of manufacture and has not been previously occupied; or
(ii) An existing home, which is one that does not meet the criteria for a new home. In order to be eligible for financing with an insured loan under this part, the manufactured home, its warranty and the site on which the home is placed must meet the requirements of paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section.
(3) The proceeds of a loan to purchase a new manufactured home or a new manufactured home and lot shall not be used to purchase furniture or wheels and axles, and the cost of these items shall not be included in the total principal obligation calculated under § 201.10 (b)(1) or (d)(1).
(4) The proceeds of a manufactured home purchase loan may be used for the purchase, construction or installation of a garage, carport, patio or other comparable appurtenance to the manufactured home, as stated in the retail purchase contract and as approved by
the Secretary. The proceeds of a combination loan may be used for the purchase, construction or installation of a permanent foundation, garage, carport, patio or other comparable appurtenance to the manufactured home.
(5) The Secretary will establish a list of items and activities that may not be financed with the proceeds of any manufactured home loan. If a lender has any doubt as to the eligibility of any item or activity, it shall request a specific ruling by the Secretary before making a loan.
(c)
Construction, transportation and installation requirements.
(1) The manufactured home shall be certified by the manufacturer under applicable criminal and civil penalties for fraud and misrepresentation to have been constructed in compliance with the National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974, 42 U.S.C. 5401-5426, so as to conform to all applicable Federal construction and safety standards, as evidenced by a label or tag affixed to the manufactured home in accordance with 24 CFR 3280.8.
(2) During any period of transportation from the factory to the borrower's homesite, the structural integrity of the manufactured home shall be maintained so that it will be livable and durable.
(3) The installation or erection of the manufactured home on the homesite shall comply with the manufacturer's requirements for anchoring, support, stability and maintenance. Any permanent foundation shall be constructed in accordance with the current edition of HUD's Permanent Foundations Guide for Manufactured Housing (HUD Handbook 4930.3).
(4) For any manufactured home purchase loan or combination loan involving a sale of the manufactured home by a dealer, the dealer shall inspect the manufactured home, as installed or erected on the homesite, for structural damage or other defects resulting from the transportation and installation of the home. The dealer shall also test the performance of the home's plumbing, mechanical and electrical systems to assure that they are fully operational.
(d)
Manufacturer's warranty requirements.
(1) To induce the Secretary to insure a title I loan under this part for the purchase of a new manufactured home and to induce a borrower to purchase such a home, the home manufacturer shall furnish the borrower with a written warranty, duly executed by an authorized representative of the manufacturer on a HUD-approved form. The warranty shall be provided without cost to the borrower. The effective date of the warranty shall be the date of delivery of the manufactured home to the borrower, regardless of when the warranty was executed by the manufacturer or was delivered to the borrower.
(2) The warranty shall obligate the home manufacturer to take appropriate action to correct any nonconformity with the standards prescribed in paragraph (c)(1) of this section or any defects in materials or workmanship which become evident within one year after the date of delivery. This warranty shall be in addition to, and not in derogation of, all other rights and privileges which the borrower may have under any other law or instrument during such period or thereafter. A copy of the warranty shall be retained in the lender's loan file.
(3) Prior to making a loan involving a new manufactured home, the lender shall investigate whether the home manufacturer is substantially complying with its warranty obligations on other homes financed by the lender under any program. If the lender knows, because of consumer complaints, dealer comments or other information concerning the manufacturer received in the course of business, that consumers have complained about warranty performance, the lender shall ascertain whether such complaints have been resolved. The lender's findings shall be documented in the loan file. Such documentation may reference information or materials contained in other files of the lender, provided that the file contains a written certification signed by a responsible loan officer under applicable criminal and civil penalties for fraud and misrepresentation that the lender's findings are supported by such other information or materials.
(4) If the lender concludes under paragraph (d)(3) of this section that a manufacturer may not be honoring its
warranties, the lender shall immediately notify the Secretary in writing, with documentation of the facts and circumstances.
(e)
Manufactured homesite standards.
(1) To assure the suitability of the homesite, the manufactured home shall be placed on a leased site in a manufactured home park or on an individual manufactured home lot or other site owned or leased by the borrower that meets the following standards. A manufactured home may be placed on a site within Indian trust or otherwise restricted lands if the borrower owns or leases the site, or if the borrower obtains written permission acceptable to the Secretary from the trustee or the tribal authority who controls the use of the site.
(2) The manufactured homesite shall be served by adequate public or community water and sewerage systems, unless appropriate local officials certify that either or both such systems are unavailable to provide an adequate level of service to the manufactured homesite. If either or both such systems are not available, the manufactured homesite shall comply with local or State minimum lot area requirements for the provision of onsite water supply and/or sewage disposal.
(3) When the manufactured home is to be placed on a leased site in a manufactured home park, the lender shall obtain certifications from the appropriate State or local government officials that the park complies with minimum standards relating to vehicular access, water supply, sewage disposal, utility connections, and other aspects of park development. Where minimum State and local standards for park development are not established or enforced, the lender shall obtain a certification from a registered civil engineer that the park meets minimum standards for park development prescribed by the Secretary.
(4) When the manufactured home is to be placed on an individual manufactured home lot or other site owned or leased by the borrower (or on an Indian land site under paragraph (e)(1) of this section), the lender shall obtain certifications from the appropriate local government officials that:
(i) The site complies with local zoning ordinances and regulations, if any;
(ii) Adequate vehicular access from a public right-of-way is available to the site;
(iii) Adequate water supply and sewage disposal facilities are available to or on the site; and
(iv) Any other minimum local standards and requirements for site suitability are met. Where minimum local standards for water supply and sewage disposal are not established or enforced, the lender shall obtain a certification from a registered civil engineer that the site meets minimum standards for water supply and sewage disposal prescribed by the Secretary.

§ 201.22
Credit requirements for borrowers.
(a)
Credit application and review.
(1) Before making a loan insured under this part, the lender shall exercise prudence and diligence to determine whether the borrower and any co-maker or co-signer is solvent and an acceptable credit risk, with a reasonable ability to make payments on the loan obligation. All documentation supporting this determination and relating to the lender's review of the credit of the borrower and of any co-maker or co-signer shall be retained in the loan file.
(2) The lender shall obtain a separate dated credit application on a HUD-approved form, executed by the borrower and any co-maker or co-signer under applicable criminal and civil penalties for fraud and misrepresentation, for each loan made. The lender shall verify that the borrower's Social Security Number is valid, through such documentation as may be prescribed by the Secretary.
(3) The lender shall conduct a credit investigation based on the credit application, and shall obtain written verification of or otherwise document the current employment and current income of the borrower and any co-maker or co-signer. If the borrower or
any co-maker or co-signer has changed employment within the past two years, the lender shall obtain written verification of or otherwise document the person's prior employment and prior income during the two-year period. If the borrower or any co-maker or co-signer was self-employed during any period of the previous two years, the lender shall obtain documentation of the person's income during such period of self-employment.
(4) The lender shall also determine the total amount of the borrower's existing and proposed title I loans to ensure that the loan amounts in § 201.10 are not exceeded.
(5) As part of its credit investigation, the lender shall obtain a consumer credit report stating the credit accounts and payment history of the borrower and of any co-maker or co-signer. Subject to state or local law, the lender shall check with the inquirers concerning all credit inquiries reported within the previous 90 days to determine whether the borrower or the co-maker or co-signer has incurred debts not listed on the credit application. If a consumer credit report is not available or is incomplete, the loan file shall contain other documentation of the lender's diligent investigation of the credit of the borrower or of the co-maker or co-signer.
(6) If the consumer credit report does not contain the necessary information, the lender shall obtain written verification that the borrower is not over 30 days delinquent on any senior mortgages or deeds of trust on the property being improved with a property improvement loan.
(7) The lender shall verify, in such manner as the Secretary may prescribe, whether the borrower is in default or a claim has been paid in connection with any loan obligation owed to or insured or guaranteed by the Federal Government.
(8) For any loan with a total principal balance in excess of $5,000, the lender shall obtain written verification of the source of all funds of the borrower required for the borrower's initial payment, if such payment will be in excess of five percent of the loan.
(9) Before making a final determination on the creditworthiness of the borrower, the lender shall conduct a face-to-face or telephone interview with the borrower and any co-maker or co-signer to resolve any discrepancies in the information on the credit application and to assure that the information is accurate and complete.
(10) After a thorough credit investigation and in the absence of information to the contrary, the lender may rely upon all statements of fact made by the borrower or any co-maker or co-signer in a credit application.
(b)
Income requirements.
(1) For any Title I loan, the credit application and review must establish that the borrower's income will be adequate to meet the periodic payments required by the loan, as well as the borrower's other housing expenses and recurring charges. For a borrower's income to be considered adequate, housing expenses and total fixed expenses generally may not exceed maximum percentages of effective gross income established by the Secretary. If these expense-to-income ratios are exceeded, the borrower's income may be considered adequate only if the lender determines and documents in the loan file the existence of compensating factors concerning the borrower's creditworthiness that support approval of the loan.
(2) In determining whether the borrower's income is adequate, the following definitions are applicable:
(i)
Effective gross income
is defined as continuing income from all sources that is reasonably expected to be available during the first two years of the loan obligation, without any deduction for income taxes or other items.
(ii)
Total fixed expenses
is the sum of the borrower's housing expenses and other recurring charges.
(iii)
Housing expenses
includes all payments for principal, interest, loan or mortgage insurance charges, ground rent or leasehold charges, real estate taxes, hazard insurance, and homeowners association or condominium fees, but does not include utility costs.
(iv)
Other recurring charges
include all payments on automobile loans, furniture loans, student loans, installment loans, revolving charge accounts, alimony or child support, and any other debt for which the obligation is
expected to continue for six months or more.
(c)
Evidence of delinquency, default or misrepresentation.
Except with the prior approval of the Secretary the lender shall not approve a loan if the lender has knowledge of any of the following circumstances:
(1) The borrower is past due more than 30 days as to the payment of principal or interest under the original terms of a loan obligation owed to or insured or guaranteed by the Federal Government, unless the debt has since been discharged or satisfied; or
(2) The borrower has previously made material misstatements of fact on applications for loans or other assistance.

§ 201.23
Borrower's initial payment.
(a)
General requirement.
The borrower shall be responsible for the payment in cash of any costs that will not be paid, or are not eligible to be paid, from the proceeds of the loan. Such costs payable by the borrower may include any required downpayment, any discount points to be paid by the borrower to the lender, any other fees and charges that may not be financed, and any other costs in excess of the loan amount. No part of such costs payable by the borrower may be loaned, advanced, or paid to or for the benefit of the borrower by the dealer, the manufacturer, or any other party to the loan transaction. If the borrower obtains all or any part of such costs through a gift or a loan from some other source, the borrower must disclose the source of such gift or loan on the credit application. Any such loan must be secured by property or collateral owned by the borrower independently of the property securing repayment of the Title I loan, unless the prior approval of the Secretary is obtained for an exception to this requirement. The lender shall consider any such loan obligation in performing the credit investigation. Documentation of any initial payment shall be retained by the lender in the loan file.
(b)
Manufactured home purchase loans.
In the case of a manufactured home purchase loan, the borrower shall make a minimum cash downpayment of at least five percent of the purchase price of the home. The borrower's equity in an existing manufactured home and any movable appurtenances may be traded-in on a new home and accepted in lieu of full or partial cash downpayment, but without any cash payment to the borrower. The existing manufactured home being traded-in shall be clearly identified, and the borrower's equity in the home shall be based upon the retail value of the home and appurtenances (as determined by a HUD-approved appraisal), less the total of all loans outstanding on the home and appurtenances.
(c)
Manufactured home lot loans.
In the case of a manufactured home lot loan, the borrower shall make a minimum cash downpayment of at least five percent of the total of the purchase price and development costs for the lot.
(d)
Combination loans.
In the case of a combination loan, the borrower shall make a minimum cash downpayment of at least five percent of the purchase price of the manufactured home and lot. If the borrower already owns a manufactured home or a lot on which a manufactured home is to be placed, the borrower's equity in such home or lot may be accepted in lieu of full or partial cash downpayment on a combination loan, but without any cash payment to the borrower.

The lien shall be a first lien, superior to any other lien on that property, and shall be evidenced by a properly recorded financing statement, a properly recorded security instrument executed by the borrower and any other owner of the property, or another acceptable instrument, such as a certificate of title issued by the State and containing a recitation of the lender's lien interest in the manufactured home.
(c)
Recording and perfection of security.
The lender shall assure that the legal description of the property as recited in the security instrument is accurate, and that the security instrument creates a valid and enforceable lien on the property in the jurisdiction in which the property is located.

(a)
Fees and charges that may be financed in a property improvement loan.
The Secretary will establish a list of fees and charges that may be included in a property improvement loan.

§ 201.27
Requirements for dealer loans.
(a)
Dealer approval and supervision.
(1) The lender shall approve only those dealers which, on the basis of experience and information, the lender considers to be reliable, financially responsible, and qualified to satisfactorily perform their contractual obligations to borrowers and to comply with the requirements of this part. However, in no case shall the lender approve a dealer that is unable to meet the following minimum qualifications:
(i)
Net worth.
All property improvement and manufactured home dealers shall have and maintain a net worth of not less than $32,000 and $63,000, respectively. The required net worth must be maintained in assets acceptable to the Secretary.
(ii)
Business experience.
All property improvement loan and manufactured home dealers must have demonstrated business experience as a property improvement contractor or supplier, or in manufactured home retail sales, as applicable.
(2) The lender's approval of a dealer shall be documented on a HUD-approved form, signed and dated by the dealer and the lender under applicable criminal and civil penalties for fraud and misrepresentation, and containing information supplied by the dealer on its trade name, places of business, type of ownership, type of business, and names and employment history of the owners, principals, officers, and salespersons. The dealer shall furnish a current financial statement prepared by someone who is independent of the dealer and is qualified by education and experience to prepare such statements, together with such other documentation as the lender deems necessary to support its approval of the dealer. The lender shall obtain a commercial credit report on the dealer and consumer credit reports on the owners, principals, and officers of the dealership.
(3) The lender shall require each dealer to apply annually for reapproval. The dealer shall furnish the same documentation as is required under paragraph (a)(2) of this section to support its application for reapproval. In no case shall the lender reapprove a dealer that is unable to meet the minimum net worth requirements in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
(4) The lender shall supervise and monitor each approved dealer's activities with respect to loans insured under
this part. The lender shall visit each approved dealer's places of business at least once in every six months to review its Title I performance and compliance. The lender shall maintain a file on each approved dealer which contains the executed dealer approval form and supporting documentation required under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, together with information on the lender's experience with Title I loans involving the dealer. Each dealer file shall contain information about borrower defaults on Title I loans over time, records of completion or site-of-placement inspections conducted by the lender or its agent, copies of letters concerning borrower complaints and their resolution, and records of the lender's periodic review visits to the dealer's premises. The lender may also require that the dealer furnish records on individual loan transactions, if needed to enable the lender to review the dealer's Title I performance and compliance.
(5) If a dealer does not satisfactorily perform its contractual obligations to borrowers, does not comply with Title I program requirements, or is unresponsive to the lender's supervision and monitoring requirements, the lender shall terminate the dealer's approval and immediately notify the Secretary with written documentation of the facts. A dealer whose approval is terminated under these circumstances shall not be reapproved without prior written approval from the Secretary. The lender may in its discretion terminate the approval of a dealer for other reasons at any time.
(6) The lender shall require each approved (or reapproved) dealer to provide written notification of any material change in its trade name(s), place(s) of business, type of ownership, type of business, or principal individuals who control or manage the business. The dealer shall furnish such notification to the lender within 30 days after the date of any material change.
(7) As a condition of manufactured home dealer approval (or reapproval), the lender may require a manufactured home dealer to execute a written agreement that, if requested by the lender, the dealer will resell any manufactured home repossessed by the lender under a title I insured manufactured home purchase loan approved by the lender as a dealer loan involving that dealer.
(b)
Provision for full or partial recourse.
In the case of a dealer-originated manufactured home purchase loan or combination loan, the lender and the dealer may agree to a provision in the loan documents for partial or full recourse against the dealer, to reduce or eliminate the lender's loss in the event of foreclosure or repossession. Such recourse provision shall specify that, for a default occurring within a period of not more than three years from the date of the loan, the dealer shall reimburse the lender for a fixed percentage of the unpaid amount of the loan obligation, after deducting the proceeds from the sale of the property and any amounts received or retained by the lender after the date of default. However, the extent of the dealer's liability may not exceed 100 percent of the unpaid amount of the loan obligation prior to such deductions. When a claim is filed, the lender shall notify the Secretary if the loan was subject to a recourse agreement and whether the recourse agreement has been honored. If without the lender's approval a dealer has failed to honor its recourse obligation, the lender shall notify the Secretary and shall assign the recourse obligation to the Secretary in filing an insurance claim.

§ 201.28
Flood and hazard insurance, and Coastal Barriers properties.
(a)
Flood insurance.
No property improvement loan or manufactured home loan shall be eligible for insurance under this part if the property securing repayment of the loan is located in a special flood hazard area identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), unless the community in which the area is situated is participating in the National Flood Insurance Program, flood insurance under the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)
is available with respect to such property improvements, and flood insurance on the property is obtained by the borrower in compliance with section 102 of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 (42 U.S.C. 4012a). Such insurance shall be in the form of the standard policy issued under the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) or private flood insurance, as defined in 24 CFR 203.16a. Such insurance shall be obtained at any time during the term of the loan that the lender determines that the secured property is located in a special flood hazard area identified by FEMA and shall be maintained by the borrower for the remaining term of the loan, or until the lender determines that the property is no longer in a special flood hazard area, or until the property is repossessed or foreclosed upon by the lender. The amount of such insurance shall be at least equal to the unpaid balance of the Title I loan, and the lender shall be named as the loss payee for flood insurance benefits. A lender may determine that a private flood insurance policy meets the definition of private flood insurance, as defined in 24 CFR 203.16a, without further review of the policy, if the compliance aid statement provided in 24 CFR 203.16a(c) is included within the policy or as an endorsement to the policy.
(b)
Hazard insurance.
No manufactured home purchase loan or combination loan shall be eligible for insurance under this part unless hazard insurance on the manufactured home is obtained by the borrower and the lender is named as a loss payee of insurance benefits. Such insurance shall be maintained by the borrower for the full term of the loan or until the property is repossessed or foreclosed by the lender, and in an amount at least equal to the unpaid balance of the loan, except that the amount of insurance coverage shall be not less than the actual cash value of the home where State law precludes a higher amount. If the borrower fails to maintain such insurance, the lender shall obtain it at the borrower's expense. If the home is not insured against hazards and sustains damage which would normally be covered by such insurance during the borrower's ownership, the appraised value of the home for claim purposes will be adjusted in accordance with § 201.51(b)(3). Upon acquiring title to the property through repossession or foreclosure, the lender shall maintain hazard insurance upon the property in the amount prescribed above until its disposition and sale.
(c)
Coastal barriers properties.
No title I insurance shall be made available under this part for any property improvement loan or manufactured home loan except pursuant to a loan application approved before October 18, 1982, with respect to any property within the Coastal Barriers Resources System established by the Coastal Barriers Resources Act (16 U.S.C. 3501).

§ 201.29
Ineligible participants.
No loan may be insured under this part where the lender has been advised in writing by HUD or otherwise knows that any participant in the transaction as a dealer, home manufacturer, contractor, supplier, or broker, or as its agent or representative, has been suspended or debarred, or has otherwise been determined by HUD to be ineligible to participate in the title I program.

Insurance charge.
(a)
Insurance charge.
For each eligible property improvement loan and manufactured home loan reported and acknowledged for insurance, the lender shall pay to the Secretary an insurance charge equal to 1.00 percent of the loan amount, multiplied by the number of years of the loan term. The insurance charge shall be paid in the manner prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section; however, no charge shall be made for a period of 14 days or less, and a charge for a full month shall be made for a period of more than 14 days. There shall be no abatement or refund of an insurance charge except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section.
(b)
Payment of insurance charge.
(1) For any loan having a maturity of 25 months or less, payment of the entire insurance charge prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section is due on the 25th calendar day after the date the Secretary acknowledges the loan report.

(ii) For any loan having a maturity in excess of 25 months, payment shall be made in annual installments of 1.00 percent of the loan amount until the insurance charge is paid.
(3) All insurance charges are considered earned when paid.
(4) The Secretary may require that loan insurance charges be remitted electronically. Instructions implementing this requirement shall be communicated to all affected lenders.
(c)
Penalty charge and interest.
Insurance charges not received from the lender by the due date specified in paragraph (b) of this section shall be assessed a penalty charge of four percent of the amount of the payment. Insurance charges received from the lender more than 30 days after the due date specified in paragraph (b) of this section shall also be assessed daily interest at the current United States Treasury value of funds rate, as published periodically in the
Federal Register.
However, no penalty charge or daily interest shall be assessed if the Secretary fails to acknowledge receipt of the loan report or fails to issue a proper billing to the lender for the insurance charges.
(d)
Adjustment on notes transferred.
Where there is a transfer of loan obligations between lenders and the insurance charges on such obligations have already been paid, any adjustment of such charges shall be made by the lenders involved. Any unpaid installments of the insurance charge shall be paid by the purchasing lender.
(e)
Refund or abatement of insurance charges.
A lender shall be entitled to a refund or abatement of insurance charges only in the following instances:
(1) Where the loan obligation has been refinanced, the unearned portion of the charge on the original obligation shall be credited to the charge on the refinanced loan.
(2) Where the loan obligation is prepaid in full or an insurance claim is filed, charges falling due after such prepayment or claim shall be abated.
(3) When a loan (or portion thereof) is found to be ineligible for insurance, charges paid on the ineligible portion shall be refunded, except where the Secretary determines that there was fraud or misrepresentation by the lender in the loan transaction. Such refund shall be made only if a claim is denied
by the Secretary or the ineligibility is reported by the lender promptly upon discovery and confirmed by the Secretary. In no event shall a charge be refunded on the basis of loan ineligibility where the application for refund is made after the loan is paid in full. If a loan or claim has been denied and is subsequently resubmitted, the refunded amount of the insurance charge plus any accrued insurance charge shall be repaid.
(f)
Lender passing insurance charge on to borrower.
The insurance charge may be passed on to the borrower, provided that such charge is fully disclosed to the borrower.

Establishment.
The Secretary shall establish an insurance coverage reserve account for each lender. The amount of insurance coverage in each reserve account shall equal 10 percent of the amount disbursed, advanced, or expended by the lender in originating or purchasing eligible loans registered for insurance under this part, less the amount of all insurance claims approved for payment in connection with losses on such loans.
(b)
Transfer of insured loans.
The lender shall not sell, assign or otherwise transfer any insured loan or loan reported for insurance to a transferee lender not approved to originate and purchase title I loans under a valid title I contract of insurance. Nothing contained herein shall be construed to prevent the pledging of such a loan as collateral security under a trust agreement, or otherwise, in connection with a bona fide loan transaction.
(c)
Transfer of insurance coverage.
Not more than $5,000 in insurance coverage shall be transferred to or from a lender's reserve account during any fiscal year (October 1 through September 30) without the prior approval of the Secretary.

(1) In all cases involving the sale, assignment or transfer of loans sold without recourse, guaranty, guarantee, or repurchase agreement, the Secretary shall transfer insurance coverage to the reserve account established for the transferee lender in an amount equal to 10 percent of the actual purchase price or the net unpaid principal balance, whichever is lesser, but not to exceed the amount of insurance coverage in the transferor lender's reserve account prior to the transfer. Insurance coverage shall be added to the existing amount of insurance coverage in the transferee lender's reserve account. The Secretary may transfer insurance coverage with earmarking when a determination is made that it is in the Secretary's interest to do so.
(2) In cases involving the transfer of loans sold with recourse or under a guaranty, guarantee or repurchase agreement, no insurance coverage will be transferred and no reports will be required.
(3) An existing insured property improvement loan or manufactured home loan may not be refinanced by a lender different from the originating or purchasing lender of record, unless the loan has been sold, assigned, or transferred to the new lender under paragraph (c) of this section and the Secretary has transferred insurance coverage for the loan under the applicable requirements of this paragraph.
(d)
Recovery shall not affect insurance coverage reserve account.
Amounts which may be recovered by the Secretary after payment of an insurance claim shall not be added to the amount of insurance coverage remaining in a lender's reserve account.

# Subpart E—Loan Administration
§ 201.40
Post-disbursement loan requirements.
(a)
Discovery of misstatements of fact.
If, after a loan has been made, the lender discovers any material misstatement of fact or that the loan
proceeds have been misused by the borrower, dealer or any other party, it shall promptly report this to the Secretary. In such case, the insurance of the loan shall not be affected unless such material misstatement of fact or misuse of loan proceeds was caused by or was knowingly sanctioned by the lender or its employees (see § 201.31(e)(3)), provided that the validity of any lien on the property has not been impaired.
(b)
Requirements on property improvement loans.
(1) After receiving the proceeds of a direct property improvement loan, and after the work is completed to the borrower's satisfaction, the borrower shall submit a completion certificate to the lender, on a HUD-approved form and signed by the borrower under applicable criminal and civil penalties for fraud and misrepresentation, certifying that:
(i) The improvements have been completed,
(ii) the amount borrowed has been spent on improvements eligible under § 201.20(b) and in accordance with the contract or cost estimate furnished to the lender prior to disbursement of the loan proceeds, and
(iii) The borrower has not obtained the benefit of and will not receive any cash payment, rebate, cash bonus, sales commission, or anything of more than nominal value from any contractor or supplier as an inducement for the consummation of the loan transaction.
(2) The borrower shall submit the completion certificate promptly upon the work's completion, but not later than six months after the disbursement of the loan proceeds, with one six-month extension if necessary. If the borrower fails to submit the completion certificate within these time limits, an on-site inspection shall be conducted in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.
(3) The borrower is not required to submit a completion certificate when the property improvement loan is made by or on behalf of a State or local government agency or a nonprofit organization, the loan proceeds are held in an escrow account pending completion of the improvements, and the loan proceeds are disbursed from the escrow account in stages, with the written approval of the borrower and based upon the percentage of work completed.
(c)
Inspection requirement on property improvement loans.
The lender or its agent shall conduct an on-site inspection on any property improvement loan where the principal obligation is $7,500 or more, and on any direct property improvement loan where the borrower fails to submit a completion certificate as required under paragraph (b) of this section. On a dealer loan, the inspection shall be completed within 60 days after the date of disbursement. On a direct loan, the inspection shall be completed within 60 days after receipt of the completion certificate, or as soon as the lender determines that the borrower is unwilling to cooperate in submitting the completion certificate. The purpose of the inspection is to verify the eligibility of the improvements and whether the work has been completed. If the borrower will not cooperate in permitting an on-site inspection, the lender shall report this fact to the Secretary.
(d)
Inspection requirement on dealer manufactured home loans.
For any manufactured home purchase loan or combination loan involving the sale of a manufactured home by a dealer, the lender (or an agent of the lender that is not a manufactured home dealer) shall conduct a site-of-placement inspection within 60 days after the date of disbursement to verify that:
(1) The terms and conditions of the purchase contract have been met;
(2) The manufactured home and any itemized options and appurtenances included in the purchase price of the home or financed with the loan proceeds have been delivered and installed; and
(3) The placement certificate executed by the borrower and the dealer is in order.

§ 201.41
Loan servicing.
(a)
Generally.
The lender shall service loans in accordance with accepted practices of prudent lending institutions. It shall have adequate facilities
for contacting the borrower in the event of default, and shall otherwise exercise diligence in collecting the amount due. The lender shall remain responsible to the Secretary for proper collection efforts, even though actual loan servicing and collection may be performed by an agent of the lender. The lender shall have an organized means of identifying, on a periodic basis, the payment status of delinquent loans to enable collection personnel to initiate and follow-up on collection activities, and shall document its records to reflect its collection activities on delinquent loans.
(b)
Partial payments.
The lender shall accept any partial payment (inclusive of late charges) under an executed modification agreement or an acceptable repayment plan, and either apply it to the borrower's account or hold it in a trust account pending disposition. When partial payments held for disposition aggregate a full monthly installment, they shall be applied to the borrower's account, thus advancing the date of the oldest unpaid installment. If a partial payment is received more than 60 days after the date of default and was not submitted under a repayment plan or a modification agreement, the partial payment may be returned to the borrower, with a letter of explanation.
§ 201.42
Bankruptcy, insolvency or death of borrower.
(a)
Bankruptcy or insolvency.
The lender shall file a proof of claim with the court having jurisdiction when the lender has timely information that a borrower is involved in bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings, except that a proof of claim need not be filed if the court notifies the lender that the borrower has no assets and a proof of claim should not be filed. The notice of bankruptcy and a copy of the proof of claim (or the notice from the court that a proof of claim is not required) shall be retained in the loan file.
(b)
Death of a borrower.
The lender shall file a proof of claim with the court having jurisdiction when the lender has timely information that a borrower is deceased, unless the lender determines that there will not be a probate proceeding. A copy of the proof of claim (or documentation as to why a proof of claim was not filed) shall be retained in the loan file.
(c)
Responsibility of the lender after insurance claim is filed.
After the Secretary pays an insurance claim, the Secretary will notify the bankruptcy or probate court, as appropriate, that the loan has been assigned to the United States and will request substitution as the party to whom the claim is owed. Until the insurance claim is paid, the lender shall take all steps necessary to protect the interests of the holder of the note in any bankruptcy or probate proceeding.
[54 FR 36266, Aug. 31, 1989]
§ 201.43
Administrative reports and examinations.

# Subpart F—Default Under the Loan Obligation
§ 201.50
Lender efforts to cure the default.
(a)
Personal contact with the borrower before acceleration and foreclosure or repossession.
The lender shall undertake foreclosure or repossession of the property securing a Title I loan that is in default only after the lender has serviced the loan in a timely manner and with diligence in accordance with the requirements of this part, and has taken all reasonable and prudent measures to induce the borrower to bring the loan account current. Before taking action to accelerate the maturity of the loan, the lender or its agent shall contact the borrower and any co-maker or co-signer, either in a face-to-face meeting or by telephone, to discuss the reasons for the default and to seek its cure. If the borrower and the co-makers or co-signers cannot be located, will not discuss the default, or will not agree to its cure, the lender may proceed to take action under paragraph (b) of this section. The lender shall document the results of its efforts
to contact the borrower and any co-maker or co-signer, and shall place in the loan file a copy of any modification agreement or repayment plan that has been offered.
(b)
Notice of default and acceleration.
Unless the borrower cures the default or agrees to a modification agreement or repayment plan, the lender shall provide the borrower with written notice that the loan is in default and that the loan maturity is to be accelerated. In addition to complying with applicable State or local notice requirements, the notice shall be sent by certified mail and shall contain:
(1) A description of the obligation or security interest held by the lender;
(2) A statement of the nature of the default and of the amount due to the lender as unpaid principal and earned interest on the note as of the date 30 days from the date of the notice;
(3) A demand upon the borrower either to cure the default (by bringing the loan current or by refinancing the loan) or to agree to a modification agreement or a repayment plan, by not later than the date 30 days from the date of the notice;
(4) A statement that if the borrower fails either to cure the default or to agree to a modification agreement or a repayment plan by the date 30 days from the date of the notice, then, as of the date 30 days from the date of the notice, the maturity of the loan is accelerated and full payment of all amounts due under the loan is required;
(5) A statement that if the default persists the lender will report the default to an appropriate credit reporting agency; and
(6) Any other requirements prescribed by the Secretary.
(c)
Reinstatement of the loan.
The lender may rescind the acceleration of maturity after full payment is due and reinstate the loan only if the borrower brings the loan current, executes a modification agreement, or agrees to an acceptable repayment plan.
(d)
Notice to credit reporting agency.
If the loan maturity is accelerated and the loan is not reinstated, the lender shall report the default to an appropriate credit reporting agency.

§ 201.51
Proceeding against the loan security.
(a)
Property improvement loans.
(1) After acceleration of maturity on a secured property improvement loan, the lender may either proceed against the loan security under its title I security instrument or make claim under its contract of insurance. If the lender proceeds against the loan security, it may submit an insurance claim only if it complies with the requirements of paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
(2) The lender may proceed against the secured property under its Title I security instrument and later submit a claim under its contract of insurance only with the prior approval of the Secretary. The Secretary's decision will be based upon all relevant factors, including but not limited to the appraised value and the amount of all outstanding loan obligations on the property, the estimated costs of foreclosure and disposition, and the anticipated time to dispose of the property. In proceeding against the secured property, the lender shall comply with all applicable State and local laws, and shall take all actions necessary to preserve its rights, if any, to obtain a valid and enforceable deficiency judgment against the borrower.
(3) After acceleration of maturity on a defaulted unsecured property improvement loan, the lender may submit a claim under its contract of insurance.
(b)
Manufactured home loans.
(1) After acceleration of maturity on a defaulted manufactured home loan, the lender shall proceed against the loan security by foreclosure or repossession, as appropriate, in compliance with all applicable State and local laws, and shall acquire good, marketable title to the property securing the loan. The lender shall also take all actions necessary under State and local law to preserve its rights, if any, to obtain a valid and enforceable deficiency judgment against the borrower.
(2) Prior to foreclosure or repossession, the lender or its agent shall make a visual inspection of the property and prepare a report on its condition for placement in the loan file. If the lender determines that the property has been abandoned, the lender shall take such steps as are permitted under State or local law to repossess or foreclose upon the property, without waiting for the notice period under § 201.50(b) to run.
(3) The lender shall obtain a HUD-approved appraisal of the property as soon after repossession as possible, or earlier with the permission of the borrower. This appraisal shall be performed on the homesite, unless the site owner requires that the home be removed before the appraisal can be performed, and it should reflect the retail value of comparable manufactured homes in similar condition and in the same geographic area where the repossession occurred. When the manufactured home is without hazard insurance and has sustained, at any time prior to the sale or disposition of the home, damage which would normally be covered by such insurance, the lender shall report this situation in submitting an insurance claim, and the appraised value shall be based upon the retail value of comparable homes in good condition and in the same geographic area, without any deduction for such damage.

§ 201.52
Acquisition by voluntary conveyance or surrender.
The lender may accept a voluntary conveyance of title to or ownership of the property securing a manufactured home loan which is in default, provided that (a) the lender accepts the conveyance in full satisfaction of the borrower's obligation, and (b) no claim is submitted under its contract of insurance. The lender may accept voluntary surrender of the property without satisfaction of the borrower's obligation, provided that if the lender intends thereafter to submit a claim under its contract of insurance, the lender shall acquire title to or ownership of the property and then dispose of and sell the property in compliance with State and local law, so as to assure that it can assign a valid and enforceable obligation, including any deficiency against the borrower, to the Secretary when submitting its claim. If the lender accepts a voluntary conveyance of title or a voluntary surrender of the property, the notice of default and acceleration under § 201.50(b) shall not be required.
[50 FR 43523, Oct. 25, 1985, as amended at 61 FR 19799, May 2, 1996]
§ 201.53
Disposition of manufactured home loan property.
Where the lender obtains title to property securing a manufactured home loan by repossession or foreclosure, the property shall be sold for the best price obtainable before making an insurance claim. In the case of a combination loan, the manufactured home and lot shall be sold in a single transaction and the manufactured home may not be removed from the lot, unless the prior approval of the Secretary is obtained for a different procedure. The best price obtainable shall be the greater of:
(a) The actual sales price of the property, after deducting the cost of repairs, furnishings, and equipment needed to make the property marketable, and after deducting the cost of transportation, set-up, and anchoring if the manufactured home is moved to a new homesite; or
(b) The appraised value of the property before repairs (as determined by a HUD-approved appraisal obtained in accordance with § 201.51(b)(3)).
[50 FR 43523, Oct. 25, 1985, as amended at 61 FR 19799, May 2, 1996]
§ 201.54
Insurance claim procedure.
(a)
Claim application.
A claim for reimbursement for loss on any eligible loan shall be made on a HUD-approved form, executed by a duly qualified officer of the lender under applicable criminal and civil penalties for fraud and misrepresentation. The insurance claim shall be fully documented and itemized, and shall be accompanied by all documents and materials required by the Secretary for claim review. The
claim submission shall contain original copies of all notes, security instruments, assumption agreements, releases of liability for repayment of the loan, judgments obtained by the lender against the borrower, and any related documents and forms, except where State or local law requires their retention by the lender or a governmental body such as a court. As appropriate, the claim application shall be supported by the following:
(1) Documentation of the lender's efforts to effect recourse against any dealer in accordance with any recourse agreement under § 201.27(b) between the lender and the dealer and contained in the loan documents;
(2) Certification under applicable criminal and civil penalties for fraud and misrepresentation that the lender has complied with all applicable State and local laws in carrying out any foreclosure or repossession, including copies of all notices served upon the borrower or published in connection with such foreclosure or repossession; and
(3) Where a borrower has declared bankruptcy or insolvency or is deceased, copies of the documentation required to be retained in the loan file under § 201.42.
(b)
Maximum claim period.
(1) An insurance claim shall be filed not later than the following dates:
(i) For property improvement loans—nine months after the date of default.
(ii) For manufactured home loans—three months after the date of sale of the property securing the loan, but not to exceed 18 months after the date of default.
(2) The Secretary may extend the claim filing period in a particular case, but only if the lender shows clear evidence that the delay in claim filing was in the interest of the Secretary or was caused by one of the following:
(i) Litigation related to the loan;
(ii) Management control of the lender or the Title I loan portfolio was assumed by a Federal or State agency; or
(iii) The borrower had experienced a loss of income or other financial difficulties directly attributable to a major disaster declared by the President, and additional time was needed to provide forbearance on a property improvement loan.
(3) If a borrower is a “person in military service” as that term is defined in the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940 and is in default on a loan insured under this part, any period of military service after the date of default shall be excluded in computing the maximum time period for filing an insurance claim.
(c)
Resubmitted and supplemental claims.
(1) Any insurance claim which is resubmitted with an appeal of a claim denial or a request for a waiver of the regulations in accordance with § 201.5(b) shall be filed within six months after the date of the claim denial.
(2) Any supplemental insurance claim shall be filed within six months after the date of payment on the initial claim. A reprocessing fee, in an amount prescribed by the Secretary, will be charged for any supplemental claim.
(d)
Assignment of lender's rights to the United States.
Upon the filing of the insurance claim, the lender shall assign its entire interest in the loan note (or in a judgment in lieu of the note), in any security held, and in any claim filed in probate, bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings, to the United States of America. The assignment shall be made in the form provided in paragraph (f) of this section, provided that if this form is not valid or generally acceptable in the jurisdiction involved, a form which is valid and generally acceptable in the jurisdiction where the judgment or security was taken shall be used. If the security interest has been assigned to the United States, the assignment shall be recorded in that jurisdiction prior to filing the insurance claim, unless the Secretary determines that recordation by the lender in that jurisdiction is impractical.
(e)
Valid and enforceable obligation when assigned.
The loan obligation evidenced by the note must be both valid and enforceable against the debtor at the time the note is assigned to the United States of America. If the Secretary has reason to believe that the obligation may not be either valid or enforceable against the borrower, the Secretary may either deny the claim and reassign the loan note to the lender, or require the lender to repurchase
the paid claim and accept reassignment of the note. The lender will be notified of the reasons for the claim denial or repurchase. If the lender subsequently obtains a valid and enforceable judgment against the borrower for the unpaid balance of the loan, the lender may resubmit the claim with an assignment of the judgment.
(f)
Form of assignment.
A lender shall use the following form of assignment, or one generally acceptable in the jurisdiction involved, properly dated, to assign the lender's entire interest in a loan note, judgment, real estate mortgage, deed of trust, conditional sales contract, chattel mortgage, mechanic's lien, or any security, in making an insurance claim:
All right, title, and interest of the undersigned is hereby assigned (without warranty, except that the loan qualifies for insurance) to the United States of America (HUD).
(Financial Institution)
By:
Title:
Date:
If the assignment does not appear on the note or other instrument that is assigned, it shall be duly executed on an allonge which is attached to such note or other instrument.
(g)
Denial of insurance claim.
The Secretary may deny a claim for insurance in whole or in part based upon a violation of these regulations, unless a waiver of compliance with the regulations is granted under § 201.5.
(h)
Incontestability of insurance claim payment.
Any insurance claim payment on a title I loan shall be final and incontestable after two years from the date the claim was certified for payment by the Secretary, in the absence of fraud or misrepresentation on the part of the lender, unless a demand for repurchase of the loan obligation is made on behalf of the United States prior to the expiration of the two-year period.

§ 201.55
Calculation of insurance claim payment.
The lender will be reimbursed in an amount not to exceed 90 percent of its loss on any eligible loan up to the amount of insurance coverage in the lender's insurance coverage reserve account established by the Secretary under § 201.32, if the insurance claim is made in accordance with the requirements of this part.

§ 202.3
Approval status for lenders and mortgagees.
(a)
Initial approval.
A lender or mortgagee may be approved for participation in the Title I or Title II programs upon filing a request for approval on a form prescribed by the Secretary and signed by the applicant. The approval form shall be accompanied by such documentation as may be prescribed by the Secretary.
(1) Approval is signified by:
(i) The Secretary's agreement that the lender or mortgagee is considered approved under the Title I or Title II programs, except as otherwise ordered by the Mortgagee Review Board or an officer or subdivision of the Department to which the Mortgagee Review Board has delegated its power, unless the lender or mortgagee voluntarily relinquishes its approval;
(ii) Consent by the lender or mortgagee to comply at all times with the general approval requirements of § 202.5, and with additional requirements governing the particular class of lender or mortgagee for which it was approved as described under subpart B at §§ 202.6 through 202.10; and
(iii) Under the Title I program, the issuance of a Contract of Insurance constitutes an agreement between the Secretary and the lender and which
governs participation in the Title I program.
(2) Limitations on approval:
(i) Separate approval as lender or mortgagee is required for participation in the Title I or Title II programs, respectively. Application must be made, and approval will be granted, on the basis of one or both categories of programs, as is appropriate.
(ii) Separate approval as mortgagee is required for the Single Family Mortgage Insurance Programs and for the Multifamily Mortgage Insurance Programs. Application must be made, and approval will be granted, on the basis of either or both categories, as is appropriate.
(iii) In addition to the requirements for approval as a Title II mortgagee, the Secretary may from time to time issue eligibility requirements for participation in specific programs, such as the Direct Endorsement program.
(iv) A Title II mortgagee may be approved to operate either on a nationwide basis or on a geographically restricted basis in only those areas designated by the Secretary.
(v) A Title I lender may originate loans or purchase advances of credit only within a geographic lending area approved by the Secretary. Expansion of this lending area shall be subject to a determination by the Secretary that the lender is able to originate loans in compliance with part 201 of this chapter within such expanded area.
(3)
Authorized agents.
A mortgagee approved under §§ 202.6, 202.7, or 202.10 as a nonsupervised mortgagee, supervised mortgagee, or governmental or similar institution approved as a Direct Endorsement mortgagee under 24 CFR 203.3 may, with the approval of the Secretary, designate a nonsupervised or supervised mortgagee with Direct Endorsement approval under 24 CFR 203.3 as authorized agent for the purpose of underwriting loans. The application for mortgage insurance may be submitted in the name of the FHA-approved mortgagee or its designated authorized agent under this paragraph.
(b)
Recertification.
On each anniversary of the approval of a lender or mortgagee, the Secretary will determine whether recertification, i.e., continued approval, is appropriate. The Secretary will review the yearly verification report required by § 202.5(m) and other pertinent documents, ascertain that all application and annual fees have been paid, and request any further information needed to decide upon recertification.
(c)
Termination
—(1)
Termination of the Title I Contract of Insurance
—(i)
Notice.
A Contract of Insurance may be terminated in accordance with its terms by the Secretary or by the Secretary's designee upon giving the lender at least 5 days prior written notice.
(ii)
Informal meeting.
If requested, and before expiration of the 5-day notice period, a lender shall be entitled to an informal meeting with the Department official taking action to terminate the Contract of Insurance.
(iii)
Effect of termination.
Termination of a Contract of Insurance shall not affect:
(A) The Department's obligation to provide insurance coverage with respect to eligible loans originated before the termination, unless there was fraud or misrepresentation;
(B) A lender's obligation to continue to pay insurance charges or premiums and meet all other obligations, including servicing, associated with eligible loans originated before termination; or
(C) A lender's right to apply for and be granted a new Title I Contract of Insurance, provided that the requirements for approval under this part are met.
(2)
Credit Watch Termination
—(i)
Scope and frequency of review.
The Secretary will review, on an ongoing basis, the number of defaults and claims on mortgages originated, underwritten, or both, by each mortgagee in the geographic area served by a HUD field office. HUD will make this rate information available to mortgagees and the public through electronic means and will issue instructions for accessing this information through a Mortgagee Letter. For this purpose, and for all purposes under paragraph (c) of this section, a mortgage is considered to be originated in the same federal fiscal year in which its amortization commences. The Secretary may also review the insured mortgage performance of a mortgagee's branch offices individually and may terminate the authority of
the branch or the authority of the mortgagee's overall operation.
(ii)
Credit Watch Status.
Mortgagees are responsible for monitoring their default and claim rate performance. A mortgagee is considered to be on Credit Watch Status if, at any time, the mortgagee has a rate of defaults and claims on insured mortgages originated, underwritten, or both, in an area which exceeds 150 percent of the normal rate and its origination approval agreement has not been terminated.
(iii)
Notice of termination
—(A)
Notice of termination of origination approval agreement.
The Secretary may notify a mortgagee that its origination approval agreement will terminate 60 days after notice is given, if the mortgagee had a rate of defaults and claims on insured mortgages originated in an area which exceeded 200 percent of the normal rate and exceeded the national default and claim rate for insured mortgages.
(B)
Notice of termination of direct endorsement approval.
The Secretary may notify a mortgagee that its direct endorsement approval under 24 CFR part 203 will terminate 60 days after notice is given, if the mortgagee had a rate of defaults and claims on insured mortgages underwritten in an area which exceeded 200 percent of the normal rate and exceeded the national default and claim rate for insured mortgages. The termination of a mortgagee's direct endorsement approval pursuant to this section is separate and apart from the termination of a mortgagee's direct endorsement approval under 24 CFR part 203.
(C)
No need for prior action by Mortgagee Review Board.
The termination notices described in paragraphs (c)(2)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section may be given without prior action by the Mortgagee Review Board.
(D)
Underserved areas.
Before the Secretary sends the termination notice, the Secretary shall review the Census tract concentrations of the defaults and claims. If the Secretary determines that the excessive rate is the result of mortgage lending in underserved areas, as defined in 24 CFR 81.2, the Secretary may determine not to terminate the mortgagee's origination approval agreement and/or direct endorsement approval.
(iv)
Request for informal conference.
Prior to termination the mortgagee may submit a written request for an informal conference with the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Single Family Housing or that official's designee. HUD must receive the written request no later than 30 calendar days after the date of the proposed termination notice. Unless HUD grants an extension, the informal conference must be held no later than 60 calendar days after the date of the proposed termination notice. After considering relevant reasons and factors beyond the mortgagee's control that contributed to the excessive default and claim rates, the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Single Family Housing or designee may withdraw the termination notice.
(v)
Limitation on the establishment of new branches.
Upon receipt of a proposed termination notice of its origination approval agreement, the mortgagee shall not establish a new branch or new branches for the origination of FHA-insured mortgages in the area or areas that are covered by the proposed termination notice. As of January 18, 2005, a mortgagee that is in receipt of a notice of proposed termination may not establish any new branch in the location or locations cited in the proposed termination notice until either:
(A) The proposed termination notice is withdrawn or
(B) The Secretary reinstates the mortgagee's origination approval agreement, in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section.
(vi)
Effects of termination
—(A)
Termination of origination approval agreement.
If a mortgagee's origination approval agreement is terminated, it may not originate single family insured mortgages unless the origination approval agreement is reinstated by the Secretary in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section, notwithstanding any other provision of this part except § 202.3(c)(2)(vii)(A).
(B)
Termination of direct endorsement approval.
If a mortgagee's direct endorsement approval is terminated, it may not underwrite single family insured mortgages for the area(s) identified in the termination notice, unless
the direct endorsement approval is reinstated by the Secretary in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section, notwithstanding any other provision of this part except § 202.3(c)(2)(vii)(A).
(vii)
Rights and obligations in the event of termination.
Termination of the origination approval agreement and/or direct endorsement approval shall not affect:
(A) The eligibility of the mortgage for insurance, absent fraud or misrepresentation, if the mortgagor and all terms and conditions of the mortgage had been approved before the termination by the Direct Endorsement or Lender Insurance mortgagee or were covered by a firm commitment issued by the Secretary; however, no other mortgages originated or underwritten after the date of termination by the mortgagee shall be insured unless the mortgagee's origination approval agreement and/or direct endorsement approval is reinstated by the Secretary;
(B) The right of a mortgagee whose direct endorsement approval has been terminated to transfer cases to another mortgagee with direct endorsement approval for the area covered by the termination.
(C) A mortgagee's obligation to continue to pay insurance premiums and meet all other obligations, including servicing, associated with insured mortgages;
(D) A mortgagee's right to apply for reinstatement of the origination approval agreement and/or direct endorsement approval in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section; or
(E) A mortgagee's right to purchase insured mortgages or to service its own portfolio or the portfolios of other mortgagees with which it has a servicing contract.
(d)
Withdrawal and suspension of approval.
Lender or mortgagee approval may be suspended or withdrawn by the Mortgagee Review Board as provided in part 25 of this title.
(e)
Reinstatement
—(1)
General.
A mortgagee whose origination approval agreement and/or direct endorsement approval has been terminated under paragraph (c) of this section may apply for reinstatement if:
(i) The origination approval agreement and/or direct endorsement approval for the affected branch or branches has been terminated for at least six months; and
(ii) The mortgagee continues to be an approved mortgagee meeting the general standards of § 202.5 and the specific requirements of §§ 202.6, 202.7, 202.8 or 202.10, and 202.12.
(2)
Application for reinstatement.
The mortgagee's application for reinstatement must:
(i) Be in a format prescribed by the Secretary and signed by the mortgagee;
(ii) Be accompanied by an independent analysis of the terminated office's operations and identifying the underlying cause of the mortgagee's unacceptable default and claim rate. The independent analysis must be prepared by an independent Certified Public Accountant (CPA) qualified to perform audits under the government auditing standards issued by the General Accounting Office; and
(iii) Be accompanied by a corrective action plan addressing each of the issues identified in the independent analysis described in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section, along with evidence demonstrating that the mortgagee has implemented the corrective action plan.

# Subpart A—Eligibility Requirements and Underwriting Procedures

# Direct Endorsement, Lender Insurance, and Commitments
§ 203.1
Underwriting procedures.
The three underwriting procedures for single family mortgages are:
(a)
Direct Endorsement.
This procedure, which is described in § 203.5, is available for mortgagees that are eligible under § 203.3.
(b)
Lender insurance.
This procedure, which is described in § 203.6, is available for mortgagees that are eligible for the Direct Endorsement program under § 203.5, and that are also approved according to § 203.4.
(c)
Issuing of commitments through HUD offices.
Processing through HUD offices as described in § 203.7, with issuance of commitments, is available only for mortgages that are not eligible for Direct Endorsement processing under § 203.5(b) or to the extent required in § 203.3(b)(4), § 203.3(d)(1), or as determined by the Secretary.
[62 FR 30225, June 2, 1997]
§ 203.3
Approval of mortgagees for Direct Endorsement.
(a)
Direct Endorsement approval.
To be approved for the Direct Endorsement program set forth in § 203.5, a mortgagee must be an approved mortgagee meeting the requirements of §§ 202.13, 202.14 or 202.17 and this section.
(b)
Special requirements.
The mortgagee must establish that it meets the following qualifications.
(1) The mortgagee has five years of experience in the origination of single family mortgages. The Secretary will approve a mortgagee with less than five years experience in the origination of single family mortgages if a principal officer has had a minimum of five years of managerial experience in the origination of single family mortgages.
(2) The mortgagee has on its permanent staff an underwriter that is authorized by the mortgagee to bind the mortgagee on matters involving the origination of mortgages through the Direct Endorsement procedure and that is registered with the Secretary and such registration is maintained with the Secretary. The technical staff may be employees of the mortgagee or may be hired on a fee basis from a roster maintained by the Secretary. The mortgagee shall use appraisers permitted by § 203.5(e).
(3) [Reserved]
(4) The mortgagee must submit initially 15 mortgages processed in accordance with §§ 203.5 and 203.255. Separate approval is required to originate mortgages under part 206 of this chapter through the Direct Endorsement program unless at least 50 mortgages closed by the mortgagee have been insured under part 206 of this chapter prior to September 15, 1995. Other mortgagees who have not closed at least 50 mortgages under part 206 of this chapter must submit five (5) Home Equity Conversion Mortgages, processed in accordance with §§ 203.3 and 203.255. The documents required by
§ 203.255 will be reviewed by the Secretary and, if acceptable, commitments will be issued prior to endorsement of the mortgages for insurance. If the underwriting and processing of these 15 mortgages (or the 5 Home Equity Conversion Mortgages) is satisfactory, then the mortgagee may be approved to close subsequent mortgages and submit them directly for endorsement for insurance in accordance with the process set forth in § 203.255. Unsatisfactory performance by the mortgagee at this stage constitutes grounds for denial of participation in the program, or for continued pre-endorsement review of a mortgagee's submissions. If participation in the program is denied, such denial is effective immediately and may be appealed in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. Unsatisfactory performance solely with respect to mortgages under 24 CFR part 206 may, at the option of the Secretary, be grounds for denial of participation or for continued pre-endorsement review for 24 CFR part 206 mortgages without affecting the mortgagee's processing of mortgages under other parts.
(5) The mortgagee shall promptly notify those HUD offices which have granted approval under this section of any changes that affect qualifications under this section.
(c) [Reserved]
(d)
Mortgagee sanctions.
Depending upon the nature and extent of the noncompliance with the requirements applicable to the Direct Endorsement process, as determined by the Secretary, the Secretary may take any of the following actions:
(1)
Probation.
The Secretary may place a mortgagee on Direct Endorsement probation for a specified period of time for the purpose of evaluating the mortgagee's compliance with the requirements of the Direct Endorsement procedure. Such probation is distinct from probation imposed by the Mortgagee Review Board under part 25 of this chapter. During the probation period specified by this section, the mortgagee may continue to process Direct Endorsement mortgages, subject to conditions required by the Secretary. The Secretary may require the mortgagee to:
(i) Process mortgages in accordance with paragraph (b)(4) of this section;
(ii) Submit to additional training;
(iii) Make changes in the quality control plan required by § 202.5(h) of this chapter; and
(iv) Take other actions, which may include, but are not limited to, periodic reporting to the Secretary, and submission to the Secretary of internal audits.
(2)
Termination of Direct Endorsement approval.
(i) A mortgagee's approval to participate in the Direct Endorsement program may be terminated in a particular jurisdiction by the local HUD office or on a nationwide basis by HUD Central Office. The HUD office instituting the termination action shall provide the mortgagee with written notice of the grounds for the action and of the right to an informal hearing before the office initiating the termination action. Such hearing shall be expeditiously arranged, and the mortgagee may be represented by counsel. Any termination instituted under this section is distinct from withdrawal of mortgagee approval by the Mortgagee Review Board under part 25 of this title.
(ii) After consideration of the materials presented, the decision maker shall advise the mortgagee in writing whether the termination is rescinded, modified or affirmed.
(iii) The mortgagee may appeal such decision to the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Single Family Housing or his or her designee. A decision by the Deputy Assistant Secretary or designee shall constitute final agency action.
(iv) Termination of an origination approval agreement under part 202 of this chapter for a mortgagee or one or more branch offices automatically terminates Direct Endorsement approval for the mortgagee or the branch office or offices without any further requirement to comply with this paragraph.
(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 2502-0005)

§ 203.4
Approval of mortgagees for Lender Insurance.
Each mortgagee that chooses to participate in the Lender Insurance program must use the Lender Insurance process to insure all of the mortgages that it underwrites, unless the mortgages are ineligible for the Direct Endorsement program as provided in § 203.5(b), or unless HUD determines that the mortgages are ineligible for the Lender Insurance program.
(a)
Direct Endorsement approval.
To be approved for the Lender Insurance program described in § 203.6, a mortgagee must be unconditionally approved for the Direct Endorsement program as provided in § 203.3.
(b)
Performance: Claim and default rate.
(1) In addition to being unconditionally approved for the Direct Endorsement program, a mortgagee must have had an acceptable claim and default rate (as described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section) for at least 2 years prior to its application for participation in the Lender Insurance program, and must maintain such a claim and default rate in order to retain Lender Insurance approval.
(2) HUD may approve a mortgagee that is otherwise eligible for Lender Insurance approval, but has an acceptable claim and default record of less than 2 years, if:
(i) The mortgagee is an entity created by a merger, acquisition, or reorganization completed less than 2 years prior to the date of the mortgagee's application for Lender Insurance approval;
(ii) One or more of the entities participating in the merger, acquisition, or reorganization had Lender Insurance approval at the time of the merger, acquisition, or reorganization;
(iii) All of the lending institutions participating in the merger, acquisition, or reorganization that had Lender Insurance approval at the time of the merger, acquisition, or reorganization had an acceptable claim and default record for the 2 years preceding the mortgagee's application for Lender Insurance approval; and
(iv) The claim and default record of the mortgagee derived by aggregating the claims and defaults of the entities participating in the merger, acquisition, or reorganization, for the 2-year period prior to the mortgagee's application for Lender Insurance approval, constitutes an acceptable rate of claims and defaults, as defined by this section.
(3) A mortgagee has an acceptable claim and default rate if its rate of claims and defaults is at or below 150 percent of the average rate for insured mortgages in the state(s) in which the mortgagee operates.
(c)
Reviews.
HUD will monitor a mortgagee's eligibility to participate in the Lender Insurance program on an ongoing basis.
(d)
Termination of approval.
(1) HUD may immediately terminate the mortgagee's approval to participate in the Lender Insurance program, in accordance with section 256(d) of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1715z-21(d)), if the mortgagee:
(i) Violates any of the requirements and procedures established by the Secretary for mortgagees approved to participate in HUD's Lender Insurance program, Direct Endorsement program, or the Title II Single Family mortgage insurance program; or
(ii) If HUD determines that other good cause exists.
(2) Such termination will be effective upon receipt of HUD's notice advising of the termination. Within 30 days after receiving HUD's notice of termination, a mortgagee may request an informal conference with the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Single Family Housing or designee. The conference will be conducted within 30 days after HUD receives a timely request for the conference. After the conference, the Deputy Assistant Secretary (or designee) may decide to affirm the termination action or to reinstate the mortgagee's Lender Insurance program approval. The decision will be communicated to the mortgagee in writing, will be deemed a final agency action, and, pursuant to section 256(d) of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1715z-21(d)), is not subject to judicial review.
(3) Lender Insurance authority is automatically terminated for a mortgagee whose nationwide Direct Endorsement approval under § 203.3(d)(2) is
terminated, without imposing any further requirement on the mortgagee to comply with this paragraph.
(4) Any termination instituted under this section is distinct from withdrawal of mortgagee approval by the Mortgagee Review Board under 24 CFR part 25.
(e)
Reinstatement.
A mortgagee whose Lender Insurance authority is terminated under this section may apply for reinstatement if the Lender Insurance authority for the mortgagee has been terminated for at least 6 months. In addition to addressing the criteria for Lender Insurance approval specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the application for reinstatement must be accompanied by a corrective action plan addressing the issues resulting in the termination of the mortgagee's Lender Insurance authority, along with evidence that the mortgagee has implemented the corrective action plan. HUD may grant the mortgagee's application for reinstatement if the mortgagee's application is complete and HUD determines that the underlying causes for the termination have been satisfactorily remedied.
[62 FR 30226, June 2, 1997, as amended at 62 FR 65182, Dec. 10, 1997; 77 FR 3604, Jan. 25, 2012]
§ 203.5
Direct Endorsement process.
(a)
General.
Under the Direct Endorsement program, the Secretary does not review applications for mortgage insurance before the mortgage is executed or issue conditional or firm commitments, except to the extent required by § 203.3(b)(4), § 203.3(d)(1), or as determined by the Secretary. Under this program, the mortgagee determines that the proposed mortgage is eligible for insurance under the applicable program regulations, and submits the required documents to the Secretary in accordance with the procedures set forth in § 203.255. This subpart provides that certain functions shall be performed by the Secretary (or Commissioner), but the Secretary may specify that a Direct Endorsement mortgagee shall perform such an action without specific involvement or approval by the Secretary, subject to statutory limitations. In each case, the Direct Endorsement mortgagee's performance is subject to pre-endorsement and post-endorsement review by the Secretary under § 203.255 (c) and (e).
(b)
Eligible programs.
(1) All single family mortgages authorized for insurance under the National Housing Act must be originated through the Direct Endorsement program, except the following:
(i) Mortgages underwritten for insurance by mortgagees that have applied for participation in, and have been approved for, the Lender Insurance program;
(ii) Mortgages authorized under sections 203(n), 203(p), 213(d), 221(h), 221(i), 225, 233, 237, 809, or 810 of the National Housing Act, or any other insurance programs announced by
Federal Register
notice; or
(iii) As provided in § 203.1.
(2) The provision contained in § 221.55 of this chapter regarding deferred sales to displaced families is not available in the Direct Endorsement program.
(c)
Underwriter due diligence.
A Direct Endorsement mortgagee shall exercise the same level of care which it would exercise in obtaining and verifying information for a loan in which the mortgagee would be entirely dependent on the property as security to protect its investment. Mortgagee procedures that evidence such due diligence shall be incorporated as part of the quality control plan required under § 202.5(h) of this chapter. The Secretary shall publish guidelines for Direct Endorsement underwriting procedures in a handbook, which shall be provided to all mortgagees approved for the Direct Endorsement procedure. Compliance with these guidelines is deemed to be the minimum standard of due diligence in underwriting mortgages.
(d)
Mortgagor's income.
The mortgagee shall evaluate the mortgagor's credit characteristics, adequacy and stability of income to meet the periodic payments under the mortgage and all other obligations, and the adequacy of the mortgagor's available assets to close the transaction, and render an underwriting decision in accordance with applicable regulations, policies and procedures.
(e)
Appraisal.
(1) A mortgagee shall have the property appraised in accordance with such standards and requirements as the Secretary may prescribe. A mortgagee must select an appraiser whose name is on the FHA Appraiser Roster, in accordance with 24 CFR part 200, subpart G.
(2) The mortgagee shall not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, age, or disability in the selection of an appraiser.
(3) A mortgagee and an appraiser must ensure that an appraisal and related documentation satisfy FHA appraisal requirements, and both bear responsibility for the quality of the appraisal in satisfying such requirements. A Direct Endorsement Mortgagee that submits, or causes to be submitted, an appraisal or related documentation that does not satisfy FHA requirements is subject to administrative sanction by the Mortgagee Review Board pursuant to parts 25 and 30 of this title.
[57 FR 58346, Dec. 9, 1992; 58 FR 13537, Mar. 12, 1993, as amended at 59 FR 50463, Oct. 3, 1994; 60 FR 42759, Aug. 16, 1995; 61 FR 36263, July 9, 1996; 62 FR 20088, Apr. 24, 1997; 62 FR 30226, June 2, 1997; 69 FR 43509, July 20, 2004; 77 FR 51469, Aug. 24, 2012]
§ 203.6
Lender Insurance process.
Under the Lender Insurance program, a mortgagee approved for the program conducts its own pre-insurance review, insures the mortgage, and agrees to indemnify HUD in accordance with § 203.255(f).
[62 FR 30226, June 2, 1997]
§ 203.7
Commitment process.
For single family mortgage programs that are not eligible for Direct Endorsement processing under § 203.5, or for Lender Insurance processing under § 203.6, the mortgagee must submit an application for mortgage insurance in a form prescribed by the Secretary prior to making the mortgage loan. If:
(a) A mortgage for a specified property has been accepted for insurance through issuance of a conditional commitment by the Secretary or a certificate of reasonable value by the Department of Veterans Affairs, and
(b) A specified mortgagor and all other proposed terms and conditions of the mortgage meet the eligibility requirements for insurance as determined by the Secretary, the Secretary shall approve the application for insurance by issuing a firm commitment setting forth the terms and conditions of insurance.
[57 FR 58346, Dec. 9, 1992; 58 FR 13537, Mar. 12, 1993, as amended at 62 FR 30226, June 2, 1997]
§ 203.8
Approval of mortgagees for Direct Endorsement Lender Review and Approval Process (DELRAP).
(a)
General.
Each mortgagee that chooses to participate in the review and approval of Condominium Projects, as set forth in § 203.43b, must be granted authority to participate in the Direct Endorsement Lender Review and Approval Process (DELRAP).
(b)
DELRAP Authority
—(1)
Eligibility.
To be granted DELRAP authority, as described in § 203.43b, a mortgagee must be unconditionally approved for the Direct Endorsement program as provided in § 203.3 and meet the following requirements:
(i) Have staff with at least one year of experience in underwriting mortgages on condominiums and/or Condominium Project approval;
(ii) Have originated no fewer than 10 condominium loans in projects approved by the Commissioner;
(iii) Have an acceptable quality control plan that includes specific provisions related to DELRAP; and
(iv) Ensure that staff members that participate in the approval of a Condominium Project using DELRAP authority meet the above requirements in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section or are supervised by staff that meet such requirements.
(2)
Conditional DELRAP Authority.
Mortgagees will be granted conditional DELRAP authority upon provision of notice to the Commissioner of the intent to use DELRAP. Mortgagees with conditional DELRAP authority must submit all recommended Condominium Project approvals, denials, and recertifications to FHA for review. If FHA agrees with the mortgagee's recommendation, it will advise the mortgagee that it may proceed with the recommended decision on the Condominium Project.
(3)
Unconditional DELRAP Authority.
Mortgagees will be granted unconditional DELRAP authority after completing at least five (5) DELRAP reviews, or such lower number of DELRAP reviews as HUD may specify, to the satisfaction of HUD, and may then exercise DELRAP authority to approve projects in accordance with requirements of HUD.
(c)
Reviews.
HUD will monitor a mortgagee's performance in DELRAP on an ongoing basis.
(1) If the review shows that there are no material deficiencies, subsequent project approvals, denials, or recertifications may be selected for post-action review based on a percentage as determined by the Commissioner.
(2) If the review shows that there are material deficiencies in the mortgagee's DELRAP performance, the mortgagee may be returned to conditional DELRAP status.
(3) If additional reviews continue to show material deficiencies in the mortgagee's DELRAP performance, the mortgagee's authority to participate in DELRAP may be terminated or other action taken against the mortgagee or responsible staff reviewer.

(2) Such termination will be effective upon the date of receipt of HUD's notice advising of the termination.
(3) Notwithstanding any provisions of this section, the Commissioner reserves the right to take administrative action, including revocation of DELRAP authority, against any mortgagee and staff reviewer because of unacceptable performance.

A mortgagee whose DELRAP authority is terminated under this section may request reinstatement if the mortgagee's DELRAP authority has been terminated for at least 6 months. In addition to addressing the eligibility criteria specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the application for reinstatement must be accompanied by a corrective action plan addressing the issues that led to the termination of the mortgagee's DELRAP authority, along with evidence that the mortgagee has implemented the corrective action plan. The Commissioner may grant conditional DELRAP authority if the mortgagee's application is complete and the Commissioner determines that the underlying causes for the termination have been satisfactorily remedied. The mortgagee will be required to complete successfully at least five DELRAP reviews in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section in order to receive unconditional DELRAP authority as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.

A mortgagee must provide a prospective FHA mortgagor with an informed consumer choice disclosure notice if, in the mortgagees's judgment, the prospective FHA mortgagor may
qualify for similar conventional mortgage products offered by the mortgagee. The mortgagee should base this judgment on the mortgagee's initial assessment of the prospective FHA mortgagor's eligibility for a conventional mortgage product. If a mortgagee is unsure about a prospective FHA mortgagor's eligibility for a conventional mortgage product, the mortgagee should provide the prospective FHA mortgagor with an informed consumer choice disclosure notice.

In general.
(1) The requirements of this section apply if a mortgage is to cover property improvements that:
(i) Are located in an area designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) as a floodplain area having special flood hazards;
(ii) Are otherwise determined by the Commissioner to be subject to flood hazard; or
(iii) Are not otherwise covered by the flood insurance standard for condominium projects established under § 203.43b(d)(6)(iii) or (i)(1).
(2) No mortgage may be insured that covers property improvements located in an area that has been identified by FEMA as an area having special flood hazards unless the community in which the area is situated is participating in the National Flood Insurance Program and flood insurance under the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) is available with respect to such property improvements. Such requirement for flood insurance shall be effective one year after the date of notification by FEMA to the chief executive officer of a flood prone community that such community has been identified as having special flood hazards.
(3) For purposes of this section, property improvement means a dwelling and related structures/equipment essential to the value of the property and subject to flood damage.
(b)
Flood insurance obligation.
The mortgagor and mortgagee shall be obligated, by a special condition to be included in the mortgage commitment, to obtain and maintain either NFIP flood insurance or private flood insurance coverage on the property improvements.
(c)
Insurance policy.
A mortgagee may accept a flood insurance policy in the form of the standard policy issued under the NFIP or a private flood insurance policy as defined in this section, and the mortgagee shall be named as the loss payee for flood insurance benefits. A mortgagee may determine that a private flood insurance policy meets the definition of private flood insurance in this section, without further review of the policy, if the following statement is included within the policy or as an endorsement to the policy: “This policy meets the definition of private flood insurance contained in 24 CFR 203.16a(e) for FHA-insured mortgages.”
(d)
Duration and amount of coverage.
The flood insurance must be maintained during such time as the mortgage is insured in an amount at least equal to the lowest of the following:
(1) 100 percent replacement cost of the insurable value of the improvements, which consists of the development or project cost less estimated land cost; or
(2) The maximum amount of NFIP insurance available with respect to the particular type of property; or
(3) The outstanding principal balance of the loan.
(e)
Private flood insurance defined.
The term “private flood insurance” means an insurance policy that:
(1) Is issued by an insurance company that is:
(i) Licensed, admitted, or otherwise approved to engage in the business of insurance in the State or jurisdiction in which the insured building is located, by the insurance regulator of that State or jurisdiction; or
(ii) In the case of a policy of difference in conditions, multiple peril, all risk, or other blanket coverage insuring nonresidential commercial property, is recognized, or not disapproved, as a surplus lines insurer by the insurance regulator of the State or jurisdiction where the property to be insured is located;
(2) Provides flood insurance coverage that is at least as broad as the coverage provided under a standard flood insurance policy under the National Flood Insurance Program for the same type of property, including when considering deductibles, exclusions, and conditions offered by the insurer. To be at least as broad as the coverage provided under a standard flood insurance policy under the National Flood Insurance Program, the policy must, at a minimum:
(i) Define the term “flood” to include the events defined as a “flood” in a standard flood insurance policy under the National Flood Insurance Program;
(ii) Contain the coverage specified in a standard flood insurance policy under the National Flood Insurance Program, including that relating to building property coverage; personal property coverage, if purchased by the insured mortgagor(s); other coverages; and increased cost of compliance coverage;
(iii) Contain deductibles no higher than the specified maximum, and include similar non-applicability provisions, as under a standard flood insurance policy under the National Flood Insurance Program, for any total policy coverage amount up to the maximum available under the NFIP at the time the policy is provided to the lender;
(iv) Provide coverage for direct physical loss caused by a flood and may only exclude other causes of loss that are excluded in a standard flood insurance policy under the National Flood Insurance Program. Any exclusions other than those in a standard flood insurance policy under the National Flood Insurance Program may pertain only to coverage that is in addition to the amount and type of coverage that could be provided by a standard flood insurance policy under the National Flood Insurance Program or have the effect of providing broader coverage to the policyholder; and
(v) Not contain conditions that narrow the coverage provided in a standard flood insurance policy under the National Flood Insurance Program;
(3) Includes all of the following:
(i) A requirement for the insurer to give 45 days' written notice of cancellation or non-renewal of flood insurance coverage to:
(A) The insured;
(B) The mortgagee, if any; and
(C) Federal Housing Administration (FHA), in cases where the mortgagee has assigned the loan to FHA in exchange for claim payment;
(ii) Information about the availability of flood insurance coverage under the National Flood Insurance Program;
(iii) A mortgage interest clause similar to the clause contained in a standard flood insurance policy under the National Flood Insurance Program; and
(iv) A provision requiring an insured to file suit not later than 1 year after the date of a written denial of all or part of a claim under the policy; and
(4) Contains cancellation provisions that are as restrictive as the provisions contained in a standard flood insurance policy under the National Flood Insurance Program.

The documentation should include a listing of actual sales prices in the area for all or nearly all new and existing 1-family homes and condominiums, over a period of time varies with sales volume, as follows:
(i) For 500 or more sales per month, a one-month reporting period;
(ii) For 250 through 499 sales per month, a two-month reporting period.
(iii) For less than 250 sales per month, a three-month reporting period.
The listing should contain a brief address for each property, its county location, its sale price, the month and year of its sale, and whether it is new or existing. In areas where the ratio of existing sales to new sales is three-to-one or greater, an increase in the mortgage limit may be based on 95 percent of the average of the new and the existing median sales prices. In these areas, the documentation referred to in this paragraph may also include separate median sales prices for both the new and existing homes.
(2) Requests for an increased mortgage limit based upon documentation of median house prices for the area should be sent to the appropriate HUD field office.
(c) In the case of an area where the Commissioner determines that the median one-family house price does not reasonably reflect the sales prices of newly constructed homes because of an existing stock whose value is static or declining, the Commissioner may give greater weight to the sales prices of new homes in determining median house price in such area. Without limiting the discretion of the Commissioner in fashioning appropriate methods of implementing the foregoing authority in particular circumstances based upon a demonstration of good cause satisfactory to the Commissioner, in areas where evidence satisfactory to the Commissioner indicates that existing home sales outnumber
new home sales by three-to-one or better, the
median sales price
will be calculated as the greater of (1) the average of the median sales price for new and existing homes, and (2) the composite median price of all sales.

(2)
Annual percentage rate
is the measure of the cost of credit, expressed as a yearly rate, that relates the amount and timing of value received by the mortgagor to the amount and timing of payments made and is the rate required to be disclosed by the mortgagee under 12 CFR 1026.18, pertaining to disclosure of finance charges for mortgages.
(3)
Points and fees
has the meaning given to “points and fees” in 12 CFR 1026.32(b)(1) as of January 10, 2014.

(b)
Qualified mortgage
—(1)
Limit.
For a single family mortgage to be insured under title II of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1701
et seq.
), except for mortgages for manufactured housing and mortgages under paragraph (c) of this section, the total points and fees payable in connection with a loan used to secure a dwelling shall not exceed the CFPB's limit on points and fees for qualified mortgage in its regulations at 12 CFR 1026.43(e)(3) as of January 10, 2014. Any changes made by the CFPB to the limit on points and fees may be adopted by HUD through publication of a notice and after providing FHA-approved mortgagees with time, as may be determined necessary, to implement.
(2)
Rebuttable presumption qualified mortgage.
(i) A single family mortgage insured under title II of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1701
et seq.
), except for mortgages for manufactured housing and mortgages under paragraph (c) of this section, that has an annual percentage rate that exceeds the average prime offer rate for a comparable mortgage, as of the date the interest rate is set, by more than the combined annual mortgage insurance premium and 1.15 percentage points for a first-lien mortgage is a rebuttable presumption qualified mortgage that is presumed to comply with the ability to repay requirements in 15 U.S.C. 1639c(a).
(ii) To rebut the presumption of compliance, it must be proven that the mortgage exceeded the points and fees limit in paragraph (b)(1) of this section
or that, despite the mortgage having been endorsed for insurance under the National Housing Act, the mortgagee did not make a reasonable and good-faith determination of the mortgagor's repayment ability at the time of consummation, by failing to evaluate the mortgagor's income, credit, and assets in accordance with HUD underwriting requirements.
(3)
Safe harbor qualified mortgage.
(i) A mortgage for manufactured housing that is insured under Title II of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1701

(4)
Effect of indemnification on qualified mortgage status.
An indemnification demand or resolution of a demand that relates to whether the loan satisfied relevant eligibility and underwriting requirements at the time of consummation may result from facts that could allow a change to qualified mortgage status, but the existence of an indemnification does not per se remove qualified mortgage status.
(c)
Exempted transactions.
The following transactions are exempted from the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section:
(1) Home Equity Conversion Mortgages under section 255 of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1715z-20); and

Such payments shall be held in an escrow subject to § 203.550.
(b) The mortgagor shall not be required to pay premiums for fire or other hazard insurance which protects only the interests of the mortgagee, or for life or disability income insurance, or fees charged for obtaining information necessary for the payment of property taxes. The foregoing does not apply to charges made or penalties exacted by the taxing authority, except that a penalty assessed or interest charged by a taxing authority for failure to timely pay taxes or assessments shall not be charged by the mortgagee to the mortgagor if the mortgagee had sufficient funds in escrow for the account of the mortgagor to pay such taxes or assessments prior to the date on which penalty or interest charges are imposed.
(c) Mortgages involving a principal obligation not in excess of $9,000 may contain a provision requiring the mortgagor to pay to the mortgagee an annual service charge at such rate as may be agreed upon between the mortgagee and the mortgagor, but in no case shall such service charge exceed one-half of one percent per annum.

§ 203.26
Mortgagor's payments when mortgage is executed.

(vi) Such other reasonable and customary charges as may be authorized by the Commissioner.
(4) Reasonable and customary charges in the nature of discounts.
(5) Interest from the date of closing or the date on which the mortgagee disburses the mortgage proceeds to the account of the mortgagor or the mortgagor's creditors, whichever is later, to the date of the beginning of amortization.
(b)-(c) [Reserved]
(d) Before the insurance of any mortgage, the mortgagee shall furnish to the Secretary a signed statement in a form satisfactory to the Secretary listing any charge, fee or discount collected by the mortgagee from the mortgagor. All charges, fees or discounts are subject to review by the Secretary both before and after endorsement under § 203.255.

The mortgage must be executed with respect to a project which, in the opinion of the Commissioner, is economically sound, except that this section shall not apply in each of the following instances:
(a) To a mortgage of the character described in § 203.18(d) and with respect to such a mortgage, the Commissioner shall determine that the mortgage is an acceptable risk giving consideration to the need for providing adequate housing for families of low and moderate income, particularly in suburban and outlying areas or small communities.
(b) To a mortgage of the character described in § 203.18 (e).
(c) To a mortgage of the character described in § 203.43a.

When is an increased mortgage limit permitted for these areas?
For Alaska, Guam, Hawaii or the Virgin Islands, the Commissioner may increase the maximum mortgage amount permitted by section 203(b)(2)(A) of the National Housing Act when authorized by section 214 of that Act, through the procedures described in § 203.18(h).
(b) If a party believes that the otherwise applicable mortgage limit needs to be increased to reflect the extent to which high costs make it infeasible to construct dwellings without sacrificing sound standards of construction, design or livability, the party may submit documentation in support of an alternative mortgage limit. This documentation should include actual or estimated costs of such items as design, construction, materials, and labor. In addition, actual sales prices of new homes may be submitted, together with any other documentation requested by the Commissioner. Requests for alternative mortgage limits, together with supporting documentation should be sent to the appropriate HUD field office. The field office will forward the request and supporting material, with the field office's recommendation, to the Commissioner for determination.
(c) If the Alaska Housing Authority, or the Government of Guam, Hawaii, or the Virgin Islands or any agency or instrumentality of those entities, is the mortgagor or the mortgagee, or the mortgagor is regulated or restricted as to rents or sales, charges, capital structure, rate of return, and methods of operation to such an extent and in such manner as the Commissioner determines advisable to provide reasonable rental and sales prices and a reasonable return on the investment, any mortgage otherwise eligible for insurance under this subpart may be insured:
(1) In any case where the Alaska Housing Authority, or the government of Guam, Hawaii, the Virgin Islands, or any agency or instrumentality of those entities, is the mortgagor, without regard to any requirement that the mortgagor occupy the dwelling as a principal residence or a secondary residence (as these terms are defined in § 203.18(f)), or meet loan-to-value or comparable limitations based on the failure of the mortgagor to meet this occupancy requirement;
(2) Without regard to any requirement that the mortgagor has paid on account of the property a prescribed percentage of the appraised value of the property; or
(3) Without regard to any requirement that the mortgagor certify that the mortgaged property is free and clear of all liens other than the mortgage offered for insurance and that there will not be any unpaid obligations contracted in connection with the mortgage transaction or the purchase of the mortgaged property.
(d) The provisions of § 203.28 requiring economic soundness shall not be applicable to mortgages covering property located in Alaska, in Guam, in Hawaii, or in the Virgin Islands, but the Commissioner shall find that the property or project is an acceptable risk, giving consideration to the acute housing
shortage in Alaska, Guam, Hawaii, or the Virgin Islands.

Mortgagor of a principal residence in military service cases.

(1) The Commissioner is satisfied that the inability of the mortgagor to meet the occupancy requirement is by reason of his or her entry into military service after the filing of an application for insurance; and
(2) The mortgagor expresses an intent (in such form as the Commissioner may prescribe), to meet the occupancy requirement upon his or her discharge from the service.
(b) A serviceperson will also be considered to meet the occupancy requirement referred to in paragraph (a) of this section for mortgage insurance purposes, if the following conditions are satisfied:
(1) The serviceperson and his or her family expect to meet the occupancy requirement referred to in paragraph (a) of this section for two or more years. The Commissioner may shorten this period to one year, if (i) the serviceperson's family will occupy the property for at least one year and (ii) the serviceperson is assigned to a combat zone or other hazardous duty area where the family cannot accompany him or her; and
(2) The property is located in an area in which the prospects of resale are reasonable.

(i) The junior mortgage shall not provide for any payment of principal or interest until the property securing the junior mortgage is sold or the insured mortgage is refinanced, at which time the junior mortgage shall become due and payable;
(ii) The total amount of repayments under the junior mortgage shall not exceed the least of:
(A) One-half of the mortgagor's equity interest in the property at the time of sale or refinancing;

# Eligible Properties
§ 203.37
Nature of title to realty.
A mortgage, to be eligible for insurance, must be on real estate held in fee simple, or on leasehold under a lease for not less than 99 years which is renewable, or under a lease having a period of not less than 10 years to run beyond the maturity date of the mortgage.
[49 FR 21319, May 21, 1984]
§ 203.37a
Sale of property.
(a)
Sale by owner of record
—(1)
Owner of record requirement.
To be eligible for a mortgage insured by FHA, the property must be purchased from the owner of record and the transaction may not involve any sale or assignment of the sales contract.
(2)
Supporting documentation.
The mortgagee shall obtain documentation verifying that the seller is the owner of record and must submit this documentation to HUD as part of the application for mortgage insurance, in accordance with § 203.255(b)(12). This documentation may include, but is not limited to, a property sales history report, a copy of the recorded deed from the seller, or other documentation (such as a copy of a property tax bill, title commitment, or binder) demonstrating the seller's ownership.
(b)
Time restrictions on re-sales
—(1)
General.
The eligibility of a property for a mortgage insured by FHA is dependent on the time that has elapsed between the date the seller acquired the property (based upon the date of settlement) and the date of execution of the sales contract that will result in the FHA mortgage insurance (the re-sale date). The mortgagee shall obtain documentation verifying compliance with the time restrictions described in this paragraph and must submit this documentation to HUD as part of the application for mortgage insurance, in accordance with § 203.255(b).
(2)
Re-sales occurring 90 days or less following acquisition.
If the re-sale date is 90 days or less following the date of acquisition by the seller, the property is not eligible for a mortgage to be insured by FHA.
(3)
Re-sales occurring between 91 days and 180 days following acquisition.
(i) If the re-sale date is between 91 days and 180 days following acquisition by the seller, the property is generally eligible for a mortgage insured by FHA.
(ii) However, HUD will require that the mortgagee obtain additional documentation if the re-sale price is 100 percent over the purchase price. Such documentation must include an appraisal from another appraiser. The mortgagee may also document its loan file to support the increased value by establishing that the increased value results from the rehabilitation of the property.
(iii) HUD may revise the level at which additional documentation is required under § 203.37a(b)(3) at 50 to 150 percent over the original purchase price. HUD will revise this level by
Federal Register
notice with a 30 day delayed effective date.
(4)
Authority to address property flipping for re-sales occurring between 91 days and 12 months following acquisition.
(i) If the re-sale date is more than 90 days after the date of acquisition by the seller, but before the end of the twelfth month after the date of acquisition, the property is eligible for a mortgage to be insured by FHA.
(ii) However, HUD may require that the lender provide additional documentation to support the re-sale value of the property if the re-sale price is 5 percent or greater than the lowest sales price of the property during the preceding 12 months (as evidenced by the contract of sale). At HUD's discretion, such documentation must include, but is not limited to, an appraisal from another appraiser. HUD may exclude re-sales of less than a specific dollar amount from the additional value documentation requirements.
(iii) If the additional value documentation supports a value of the property that is more than 5 percent lower than the value supported by the first appraisal, the lower value will be used to calculate the maximum mortgage amount under § 203.18. Otherwise, the value supported by the first appraisal will be used to calculate the maximum mortgage amount.
(iv) HUD will announce its determination to require additional value documentation through issuance of a
Federal Register
notice. The requirement for additional value documentation may be established either on a nationwide or regional basis. Further, the
Federal Register
notice will specify the percentage increase in the re-sale price that will trigger the need for additional documentation, and will specify the acceptable types of documentation. The
Federal Register
notice may also exclude re-sales of less than a specific dollar amount from the additional value documentation requirements. Any such
Federal Register
notice, and any subsequent revisions, will be issued at least thirty days before taking effect.
(v) The level at which additional documentation is required under § 203.37a(b)(4) shall supersede that under § 203.37a(b)(3).
(5)
Re-sales occurring more than 12 months following acquisition.
If the re-sale date is more than 12 months following the date of acquisition by the seller, the property is eligible for a mortgage insured by FHA.
(c)
Exceptions to the time restrictions on sales.
The time restrictions on sales described in paragraph (b) of this section do not apply to:
(1) Sales by HUD of Real Estate-Owned (REO) properties under 24 CFR part 291 and of single family assets in revitalization areas pursuant to section 204 of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1710);
(2) Sales by another agency of the United States Government of REO single family properties pursuant to programs operated by these agencies;
(3) Sales of properties by nonprofit organizations approved to purchase HUD REO single family properties at a discount with resale restrictions;
(4) Sales of properties that were acquired by the sellers by inheritance;
(5) Sales of properties purchased by an employer or relocation agency in connection with the relocation of an employee;
(6) Sales of properties by state- and federally-chartered financial institutions and government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs);
(7) Sales of properties by local and state government agencies; and
(8) Only upon announcement by HUD through issuance of a notice, sales of properties located in areas designated by the President as federal disaster areas. The notice will specify how long the exception will be in effect.
(d)
Sanctions and indemnification.
Failure of a mortgagee to comply with the requirements of this section may result in HUD requesting indemnification of the mortgage loan, or seeking other appropriate remedies under 24 CFR part 25.

(d)
Exception for eligible governmental or nonprofit programs—specific policies.
For purposes of paragraph (c) of this section, restrictions of the following types are permitted for eligible governmental or nonprofit programs, provided that a violation of legal restrictions on conveyance may not be grounds for acceleration of the insured mortgaged or for an increase in the interest rate, or for voiding a conveyance of the mortgagor's interest in the property, terminating the mortgagor's interest in the property, or subjecting the mortgagor to contractual liability other than requiring repayment (at a reasonable rate of interest) of assistance provided to make the property affordable as low- or moderate-income housing:

(iii) If a one-time mortgage insurance premium (MIP) was financed as part of the existing mortgage referred to in paragraphs (c)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section, the amount of the premium refund to which the mortgagor is entitled must be deducted in determining the original principal amount and the unpaid principal balance of the existing mortgage under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section and the outstanding balance of the existing mortgage under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section. However, the maximum amount of the
refinancing mortgage computed in accordance with this paragraph (c)(1) may be increased by the amount of the one-time MIP (if any) associated with the refinancing mortgage;
(2) It must have a term which does not exceed the unexpired term of the existing mortgage, except that in any case where the Commissioner determines that an extension of the term of the mortgage will inure to the benefit of the applicable insurance fund, taking into consideration the outstanding insurance liability under the existing insured mortgage, the term may be extended to the lesser of (i) 30 years or (ii) the unexpired term of the existing mortgage, plus 12 years;

(1) That the conditions of the area in which the property is located prevent the application of certain eligibility requirements of this subpart.
(2) That the area is reasonably viable, and there is a need in the area for adequate housing for families of low and moderate income.

In determining whether to accept legal phasing, HUD will assess the potential risk to the insurance fund and other factors that HUD may publish in notices. Phases must meet HUD's requirements for approval in paragraph (d) of this section and must at a minimum be:
(1) In a vertical building, contiguous, with all units built out and having a certificate of occupancy; or
(2) In a detached or semi-detached development, where all homes in the phase are built out and have a certificate of occupancy;
(f) The Secretary will publish any generally applicable change in the upper and lower limits of the ranges of percentages in paragraphs (d)(6)(vii) through (ix) of this section in a notice published for 30 days of public comment. After considering the comments, the Department will publish a final notice announcing the new overall upper and lower limits of the range of percentages being implemented, and the date on which the new standard becomes effective.
(g) The Secretary may grant an exception to any specifically prescribed requirements within paragraph (d)(6) of this section on a case-by-case basis in HUD's discretion, provided that:
(1) In the case of an exception to the approval requirements for the commercial/nonresidential space percentage that HUD establishes under paragraph (d)(6)(vii) of this section, any request for such an exception and the determination of the disposition of such request may be made, at the option of
the requester, under the Direct Endorsement Lender Review and Approval process or under the HUD review and approval process through the applicable field office of the Department; and
(2) In determining whether to allow such an exception, factors relating to the economy for the locality in which the project is located or specific to the project, including the total number of family units in the project, shall be considered. A DELRAP lender, in determining whether to grant a requested exception, shall follow any procedures that HUD may establish.
(h)
Application for Condominium Project approval and Renewal of Approval.
(1) In order to become approved, an application for Condominium Project approval, in accordance with the requirements of the Commissioner, must be submitted to either HUD or a DELRAP mortgagee, if consistent with the mortgagee's DELRAP approval.
(2) The application will be reviewed and if all eligibility criteria have been met, the Condominium Project will be approved and placed on the list of HUD-approved Condominium Projects.
(3) Unless otherwise specified in writing by HUD, Condominium Projects are approved for a period of 3 years from the date of placement on the list of approved condominiums. HUD may rescind a Condominium Project's approval at any time if the project fails to comply with any requirement for approval.
(4) Eligible parties may request renewal of the approval of an approved Condominium Project by submitting a request for recertification no earlier than 6 months prior to expiration of the approval or no later than 6 months after expiration of the approval. HUD shall specify the format for the recertification request, which shall allow the request to be supported by updating previously submitted information, rather than resubmission of all information. However, if the request for recertification is not submitted within 6 months after the expiration of the Condominium Project's approval, a complete, new approval application is required.
(i)
Single-Unit Approval
—(1)
Single-Unit Approvals.
Mortgagees must ensure that the Condominium Unit is located in a Condominium Project that meets the eligibility requirements for approval as set forth in paragraph (d) of this section as modified by this paragraph, except that HUD may provide that Single-Unit Approvals may be approved by meeting a subset of these standards, or less stringent standards, as stated by notice. In addition, a unit may be eligible for Single-Unit Approval if it:
(i) Is not in a Condominium Project that is on the list of FHA-approved Condominium Projects; and
(ii) Is not in a project that has been identified by HUD as subject to adverse determination for significant issues that affect the viability of the project; and
(iii) Is in a project that is complete under paragraph (d)(4) of this section;
(iv) Is not a manufactured home; and
(v) Is in a project that has at least five (5) dwelling units.
(2)
Limit on Single-Unit Approvals.
HUD may suspend the issuance of new FHA case numbers for mortgages in Condominium Projects with Single-Unit Approvals where the number of FHA-insured mortgages exceeds the maximum insurance concentration established by HUD. Such acceptable maximum insurance concentration shall be within a range between 0 to 20 percent of units with FHA-insured mortgages for Condominium Projects with 10 or more units, with the exact percentage within that range to be determined by HUD through notice; or shall not exceed two FHA-insured mortgages for Condominium Projects with fewer than 10 units.
(j)
Site Condominium.
Site Condominiums must meet all of the requirements of paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(5) of this section for approval, except that insurance and maintenance costs of the individual units must be the sole responsibility of the unit owner.

(3) As a direct result of the community's temporarily impaired economic condition, owners of homes in the community occupied as principal residences (as defined in § 203.18(f)(1)) have been involuntarily unemployed or underemployed and have, thus, incurred substantial reductions in income that significantly impair their ability to continue timely payment of their mortgages;

A mortgage covering a one- to four-family residence located on Indian land shall be eligible for insurance pursuant to section 248 of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1715z-13), notwithstanding otherwise applicable requirements related to marketability of title, if the mortgage meets the requirements of this subpart as modified by this section and is made by an Indian Tribe or on a leasehold estate, by an Indian who will occupy it as a principal residence. Mortgage insurance on cooperative shares is not authorized under this section.
(a)
Exemptions.
(1) The provisions of subparts I, J, and M of part 200, and § 203.30, shall not apply to approval of mortgagors for mortgages insured under this section if the Indian tribe to which the prospective mortgagor belongs is subject to the Indian Civil Rights Act.

Before HUD will insure a mortgage on Indian land, the tribe having jurisdiction over such property must certify to the HUD Field Office that it has adopted and will enforce procedures for eviction of defaulted mortgagors where the insured mortgage has been foreclosed.
(c)

The lease must be on a form prescribed by HUD.
The mortgage must be on a form which meets the requirements of § 203.17(a)(2). Before HUD will insure any mortgage under this section, the mortgagee must demonstrate that the Bureau of Indian Affairs, U.S. Department of Interior, has approved both the lease and mortgage.

(2) The mortgagor and the mortgagee execute a building loan agreement, approved by the Commissioner, setting forth the terms and conditions under which advances will be made;
(3) The advances are made only as provided in the commitment or the approval by the Direct Endorsement underwriter;

A mortgagee other than the Secretary must obtain tribal consent before obtaining title through a foreclosure sale. Tribal consent must be obtained on any subsequent transfer from the purchaser, including the Secretary, at foreclosure sale. The lease may not be terminated by the lessor without HUD's approval while the mortgage is insured or held by the Secretary.

First lien.
The first lien requirement under this part is implemented where the mortgage is filed in the
State recording system and is a first lien under that system, even though the leasehold interest securing the mortgage is located on Indian land and filed with Bureau of Indian Affairs, U.S. Department of the Interior. Any tribal government whose courts have jurisdiction to hear foreclosures must also:
(1) Enact a law satisfactory to the Commissioner providing for the satisfaction of FHA-insured and Secretary-held mortgages before other obligations (other than tribal leasehold taxes against the property assessed after the property is mortgaged) are satisfied; or

The initial and subsequent deposits shall be used to pay obligations incurred by HUD in connection with the insurance of mortgages under this section and any associated costs, including refunds of insurance premiums to mortgagors. If the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands agrees to make deposits in amounts acceptable to HUD, then the Secretary may agree to use a portion of the premiums received for insurance of mortgages under this section solely for payment of such obligations and associated costs.
(f)
Recordation.
The mortgagee must certify that the mortgage has been recorded with the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands.
(g)
Construction advances.
Advances made by the mortgagee during construction are eligible for insurance, according to the procedures in §§ 203.5, 203.6, or 203.7 (as applicable), if the Secretary determines that no feasible financing alternative is available and if:
(1) The mortgagor and the mortgagee execute a building loan agreement, approved by the Secretary, setting forth the terms and conditions under which advances will be made;
(2) The advances are made only as provided in the commitment or the approval by the Direct Endorsement or Lender Insurance underwriter;
(3) The principal amount of the mortgage is held by the mortgagee in an interest bearing account, trust, or escrow for the benefit of the mortgagor, pending advancement to the mortgagor or to his or her creditors as provided in the loan agreement; and
(4) The mortgage bears interest on the amount advanced to the mortgagor or to his or her creditors and on the amount held in an account or trust for the benefit of the mortgagor.
(h)
Form of lease.
The form of lease must be approved by both HUD and the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands (DHHL). The lease may not be terminated by DHHL without the approval of the Secretary while the mortgage is insured or held by the Secretary.
(i)
Eligibility of mortgagor.
In addition to the eligibility requirements contained in this subpart, possession of a lease of Hawaiian home lands issued under section 207(a) of the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act of 1920 (42 Stat.110) that has been certified by the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands as being valid, current, and not in default, shall be sufficient to certify eligibility to receive a mortgage to be insured under this section.

§ 203.43j
Eligibility of mortgages on Allegany Reservation of Seneca Nation of Indians.
A mortgage on a leasehold estate covering a one- to four-family residence located on the Allegany Reservation of the Seneca Nation of Indians in
the State of New York is eligible for insurance if the mortgage meets the requirements of this subpart as modified by this section.
(a)
Title.
This section applies only to a mortgage which:
(1) Does not meet the requirements of § 203.37;
(2) Is on a leasehold under a lease with a termination date in February 1991, which provides for renewal in accordance with the Act of February 19, 1875 (18 Stat. 330) and the Act of September 30, 1890 (26 Stat. 558).
A mortgage may not be on a leasehold created by a lease which is executed after the effective date of this section as a renewal or replacement of a lease described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. A mortgage may not be secured by any other right of occupancy created in lieu of a leasehold after the effective date of this section by agreement of the Seneca Nation, court order, law or any other means.
(b)
Provisions of mortgage.
The Secretary will prescribe special mortgage provisions in the form of a mortgage rider in order better to secure the mortgagee, including:
(1) Authorization for the mortgagee to exercise the option of lease renewal if the mortgagor fails to do so, and to recover from the mortgagor authorized expenses incurred to obtain lease renewal; and
(2) Making a mortgagor failure to take steps necessary for less renewal an event of default under the mortgage.
(c)
Secretary agreement with mortgagor.
The mortgagor must enter into an agreement with the Secretary and such other parties as the Secretary may require regarding actions to be taken to obtain either a renewal of the lease or a new lease.
(d)
Certification.
The borrower must certify that it has received disclosures, in a form prescribed by the Secretary, explaining the status of the lease and the consequences of nonrenewal. The disclosure shall include a discussion of the fact that a mortgagor who does not obtain a lease renewal and loses the right of occupancy will remain liable for the outstanding balance of the mortgage.
(e)
Purchase for principal residence.
The mortgagor must be a purchaser who intends to occupy the property as a principal residence (as defined in § 203.18(f)(1)), or a current owner-occupant refinancing a mortgage which is now due or which will become due before the lease termination date in February 1991.
(f)
Relationship of income to housing expense.
For purposes of § 203.33(a), the total prospective housing expense shall include the Secretary's estimate of future lease payments during the term of the mortgage rather than lease payments in effect at the time of application.
(g)
Suspension of commitments.
The Secretary may suspend the issuance of commitments to insure mortgages under this section, for the entire period during which commitments could otherwise be issued for insurance under this section (i.e., through February 18, 1991) or for such lesser period as the Secretary may specify, by providing thirty days notice of suspension in the
Federal Register.
Regardless of its duration, a suspension to be imposed prior to February 19, 1990, will be based on a determination by the Secretary that, for mortgages insured during a specified period, the rate of monetary defaults (as measured by 90 day delinquencies) for mortgages insured under this section exceeds the rate of such monetary defaults for all insured mortgages on one- to four-family properties in the State of New York. A suspension to be imposed after February 18, 1990, will be based on a consideration by the Secretary of the probable costs to the Special Risk Insurance Fund of further commitments to insure under this section, as measured by such factors as the current and projected rate and amount of claims payments, together with other significant current and projected costs as determined by the Secretary, including a review of the actual and projected monetary default rate (as measured by 90 day delinquencies) and the actual and projected rate of lease renewal through negotiation and arbitration.

Eligibility of graduated payment mortgages.
A mortgage containing provisions for varying rates of amortization corresponding to anticipated variations in family income shall be eligible for insurance under this subpart subject to compliance with the additional requirements of this section.

However, if the mortgagor is a veteran, the mortgage amount, when added to all accrued mortgage interest which will be unpaid under a financing plan approved by the Secretary, shall not exceed the applicable limits prescribed for veterans in § 203.18(a).
(d) The mortgage must contain complete amortization provisions satisfactory to the Secretary requiring monthly payments by the mortgagor not in excess of his reasonable ability to pay as determined by the Secretary.

§ 203.49
Eligibility of adjustable rate mortgages.
A mortgage containing the provisions for periodic adjustments by the mortgagee in the effective rate of interest charged shall be eligible for insurance under this subpart subject to compliance with the additional requirements of this section. This section shall apply only to mortgage loans described under sections 203(b), 203(h) and 203(k) of the National Housing Act.
(a)
Types of mortgages insurable.
The types of adjustable rate mortgages that are insurable are those for which the interest rate may be adjusted annually by the mortgagee, beginning after one, three, five, seven, or ten years from the date of the mortgagor's first debt service payment.
(b)
Interest-rate index
—(1)
CMT and SOFR indices.
Changes in the interest rate charged on an adjustable rate mortgage must correspond either to changes in the weekly average yield on U.S. Treasury securities, adjusted to a constant maturity of one year (CMT); to the 30-day average Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (or a successor administrator); or to an alternative SOFR tenor approved by the Secretary. The Secretary may publish approved SOFR tenors as alternatives to the 30-day average SOFR tenor through notice.
(2)
Transition for existing mortgages indexed to LIBOR.
Mortgages with an existing adjustable interest rate indexed to the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) must be transitioned to the spread-adjusted SOFR replacement index approved by the Secretary by the next interest rate adjustment date for the mortgage on or after the Replacement Date, which means the first London banking day after June 30, 2023, unless the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System determines that any LIBOR tenor will cease to be published or cease to be representative on a different date. In such case, Replacement Date means the first business day following the date announced by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Notice of the transition to the SOFR replacement index must be sent to the borrower in accordance with the mortgage documents. The Secretary will publish through Mortgagee Letter any additional requirements for the transition of existing mortgages.
(3)
Changes in the mortgage interest rate.
Except as otherwise provided in this section, each change in the mortgage interest rate must correspond to the upward and downward change in the index.
(c)
Amortization provisions.
The mortgage must contain amortization provisions satisfactory to the Secretary, allowing for periodic adjustments in the rate of interest charged corresponding to changes in the interest rate index.
(d)
Frequency of interest rate changes.
(1) The interest rate adjustments must occur annually, calculated from the date of the mortgagor's first debt service payment, except that, for these types of mortgages, the first adjustment shall be no sooner or later than the following:
(i) One-year adjustable rate mortgages—no sooner than 12 months or later than 18 months;
(ii) Three-year adjustable rate mortgages—no sooner than 36 months or later than 42 months;
(iii) Five-year adjustable rate mortgages—no sooner than 60 months or later than 66 months;
(iv) Seven-year adjustable rate mortgages—no sooner than 84 months or later than 90 months; and
(v) Ten-year adjustable rate mortgages—no sooner than 120 months or later than 126 months.
(2) To set the new interest rate, the mortgagee will determine the change between the initial (
i.e.,
base) index figure and the current index figure, or will add a specific margin to the current index figure. The initial index figure shall be the most recent figure available before the date of mortgage loan origination. The current index figure shall be the most recent index figure available 30 days before the date of each interest rate adjustment, except that for forward mortgages originated on or after January 10, 2015, 30 days shall mean 45 days.
(e)
Method of rate changes.
Interest rate changes may only be implemented through adjustments to the mortgagor's monthly payments.
(f)
Magnitude of changes.
The adjustable rate mortgage initial contract interest rate shall be agreed upon by the mortgagee and the mortgagor. The first adjustment to the contract interest rate shall take place in accordance with the schedule set forth under paragraph (d) of this section. Thereafter, for all adjustable rate mortgages, the adjustment shall be made annually and shall occur on the anniversary date of the first adjustment, subject to the following conditions and limitations:
(1) For one- and three-year adjustable rate mortgages, no single adjustment to the interest rate shall result in a change in either direction of more than one percentage point from the interest rate in effect for the period immediately preceding that adjustment. Index changes in excess of one percentage point may not be carried over for inclusion in an adjustment for a subsequent year. Adjustments in the effective rate of interest over the entire term of the mortgage may not result in a change in either direction of more than five percentage points from the initial contract interest rate.
(2) For five-, seven-, and ten-year adjustable rate mortgages, no single adjustment to the interest rate shall result in a change in either direction of more than two percentage points from the interest rate in effect for the period immediately preceding that adjustment. Index changes in excess of two percentage points may not be carried over for inclusion in an adjustment in a subsequent year. Adjustments in the effective rate of interest over the entire term of the mortgage may not result in a change in either direction of more than six percentage points from the initial contract rate.
(3) At each adjustment date, changes in the index interest rate, whether increases or decreases, must be translated into the adjusted mortgage interest rate, except that the mortgage may provide for minimum interest rate change limitations and for minimum increments of interest rate changes.
(g)
Pre-Loan Disclosure.
The mortgagee is required to make available to the mortgagor, at the time of loan application, a written explanation of the features of an adjustable rate mortgage consistent with the disclosure requirements applicable to variable rate mortgages secured by a principal dwelling under the Truth in Lending Act, 15 U.S.C. 1601
et seq.
(h)
Disclosures.
The mortgagee of an adjustable rate mortgage shall provide mortgagors with the disclosures in the timing, content, and format required by the regulations implementing the Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. 1601
et seq.
) at 12 CFR 1026.20(c) and (d).

§ 203.52
Acceptance of individual residential water purification equipment.
If a property otherwise eligible for insurance under this part does not have access to a continuing supply of safe and potable water without the use of a water purification system, the requirements of this section must be complied with as a condition to acceptance of the mortgage for insurance. The mortgagee must provide appropriate documentation with the submission for insurance endorsement to address each of the requirements of this section.
(a)
Equipment.
Water purification equipment must be approved by a nationally recognized testing laboratory acceptable to the local or state health authority.
(b)
Certification by local (or state) health authority.
A local (or state) health authority certification must be submitted to HUD which certifies that:
(1) A point-of-entry or point-of-use water purification system is currently in operation on the property. If the system in operation employs point-of-use equipment, the purification system must be employed on each water supply source (faucet) serving the property. Where point-of-entry systems are used, separate water supply systems carrying untreated water for flushing toilets may be constructed.
(2) The system is sufficient to assure an uninterrupted supply of safe and potable water adequate to meet household needs.
(3) The water supply, when treated by the equipment, meets the requirements of the local (or state) health authority, and has been determined to meet local or state quality standards for drinking water. If neither state nor local standards are applicable, then quality shall be determined in accordance with standards set by the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) pursuant to the Safe Drinking Water Act. (EPA standards are prescribed in the National Primary Drinking Water requirements, 40 CFR parts 141 and 142.)
(4) There exists a Plan providing for the monitoring, servicing, maintenance, and replacement of the water equipment, which Plan meets the requirements of paragraph (f) of this section.
(c)
Mortgagor notice and certification.
(1) The prospective mortgagor must have received written notification, before the mortgagor signed a sales contract, that the property has a hazardous water supply that requires treatment in order to remain safe and acceptable for human consumption. The notification to the mortgagor must identify specific contaminants in the water supply serving the property, and the related health hazard arising from the presence of those contaminants.
(2) The mortgagor must have received, with the notification described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, a written good faith estimate of the maintenance and replacement costs of the equipment necessary to assure continuing safe drinking water.
(3) A copy of the notification statement (including cost estimates), dated before the date of the sales contract, and signed by the prospective mortgagor to acknowledge its receipt, must accompany the submission for insurance endorsement. If a sales contract is signed in advance of the disclosure required by this paragraph, another sales contract must be executed after the information is provided to the prospective mortgagor and he or she has acknowledged receipt of the disclosure.
(4) The prospective mortgagor must sign a certification, substantially in the form set out in this paragraph (c)(4), at the time the application for mortgage credit approval is signed. This certification must be submitted to HUD:
Mortgagor's Certificate. I hereby acknowledge and understand that the home I am purchasing has a water purification system which I am responsible for maintaining.
I understand that the individual water supply is unsafe for consumption unless the system is operating properly. I am aware that if I do not properly maintain the system, the water supply will not be purified or treated properly, thereby rendering the water supply unsafe for consumption.
I also understand that the Department of Housing and Urban Development does not warrant the condition of the property, will not give me any money for repairs to the water purification system, and has relied upon the local (or state) health authority to assure that the water supply, when processed by properly maintained equipment, is acceptable for human use and consumption.
[Mortgagor's signature and date]
(d)
Service contract.
Before mortgage closing, the mortgagor must enter into a service contract with an organization or individual specifically approved by the local (or state) health authority to carry out the provisions of the required Plan for servicing, maintenance, repair and replacement of the water purification equipment. A copy of the signed service contract must be provided to HUD.
(e)
Escrow for maintenance and replacement.
The mortgagee must establish and maintain an escrow account which provides for the accumulation of funds paid with the mortgagor's monthly mortgage payment adequate to assure proper servicing, maintenance, repair and replacement of the water purification equipment. The amount to be collected and escrowed by the mortgagee shall be based upon information provided by the manufacturer for the maintenance and replacement of the water purification equipment and for other charges anticipated by the service contractor. The initial monthly escrow amount shall be stated in the Plan. Disbursements from the account will be limited to costs associated with the normal servicing, maintenance, repair or replacement of the water purification equipment. Disbursements may only be made to the service contractor or its successor, to equipment suppliers, to the local (or state) health authority for the performance of testing or other required services, or to another entity approved by the health authority. So long as water purification remains necessary and the mortgage is insured by HUD, the mortgagee must maintain the escrow account.
(f)
Approved Plan.
A Plan, in the form of a contract entered into by the mortgagor and mortgagee and approved by the local (or state) health authority, must set out conditions that must be met by the parties as a condition to insurance of the mortgage by HUD. To be approved by the health authority:
(1) The Plan must set forth the respective responsibilities to be assumed by the mortgagor and the mortgagee, as well as the other entities who will implement the Plan, i.e., the health authority and the service contractor. In particular:
(i) The Plan must set out the responsibilities of the health authority for monitoring and enforcing performance of the service contractor, including any successor contractor that the health authority may later have occasion to name. By its approval of the Plan, the health authority documents its acceptance of these responsibilities, and the Plan should so indicate;
(ii) The Plan must provide for the monitoring of the operation of the water purification equipment, as well as for servicing (including disinfecting), and for repairing and replacing the system, as frequently as necessary, taking into consideration the system's design, anticipated use, and the type and level of contaminants present. Installation, servicing, repair and replacement of the water purification system must be performed by an individual or organization approved for the purpose by the local (or state) health authority and identified in the Plan. In meeting the requirements of paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section, the Plan may incorporate by reference specific terms and conditions of the service contract required under paragraph (d) of this section.
(iii) Under the Plan, responsibility for monitoring the performance of the service contractor and for assuring that the water purification system is properly serviced, repaired, and replaced rests with the local (or state) health authority that has given its approval to the Plan. The Plan must confer on the health authority all powers necessary to effect compliance by the service contractor. The health authority's powers shall include the authority to notify the mortgagor of any noncompliance by the service contractor. The plan must provide that, upon any notification of noncompliance received from the health authority, the mortgagor shall have the right to discharge the service contractor for cause and to appoint a successor organization or individual as service contractor; and
(iv) The Plan must provide for the mortgagor to make periodic escrow payments necessary for the servicing, maintenance, repair and replacement of the water purification system, and for the mortgagee to disburse funds from the escrow account as required, to the appropriate party or parties.
(2) The Plan must provide that if the dwelling served by the water purification system is refinanced, or is sold or otherwise transferred with a HUD-insured mortgage, the Plan will:
(i) Continue in full force and effect;
(ii) Impose an obligation on the mortgagor to notify any subsequent purchaser or transferee of the necessity for the water purification system and for its proper maintenance, and of the obligation to make escrow payments; and
(iii) Require the mortgagor to furnish the purchaser with a copy of the Plan, before any sales contract is signed.
(g)
Periodic analysis.
Any Plan developed in accordance with this section must provide that an analysis of the water supply shall be obtained from the local (or state) health authority no less frequently than annually, but more frequently, if determined at any time to be necessary by the health authority or by the service contractor.

Mortgages with firm commitments.
For applications for insurance involving mortgages not eligible to be originated under the Direct Endorsement program under § 203.5, or under the Lender Insurance program under § 203.6, the Secretary will either endorse the mortgage for insurance by issuing a Mortgage Insurance Certificate, provided that the mortgagee is in compliance with the firm commitment, or will electronically acknowledge that the mortgage has been insured.
(b)
Endorsement with Direct Endorsement processing.
For applications for insurance involving mortgages originated under the Direct Endorsement program under § 203.5, the mortgagee shall submit to the Secretary, within 60 days after the date of closing of the loan or such additional time as permitted by the Secretary, properly completed documentation and certifications as listed in this paragraph (b):
(1) Property appraisal upon a form meeting the requirements of the Secretary (including, if required, any additional documentation supporting the appraised value of the property under § 203.37a), or a HUD conditional commitment (for proposed construction only), or a Department of Veterans Affairs certificate of reasonable value, and all accompanying documents required by the Secretary;
(2) An application for insurance of the mortgage in a form prescribed by the Secretary;

The following requirements are also applicable to the use of the TOTAL Mortgage Scorecard:
(i) Mortgagees and vendors must certify to compliance with these requirements:
(A)
Permissible users.
Only automatic underwriting systems (AUSs) developed, operated, owned, or used by FHA-approved Direct Endorsement mortgagees, Fannie Mae, or Freddie Mac, may access TOTAL, and only FHA-approved mortgagees will be able to obtain risk-assessments using TOTAL;
(B)
Limitation on use.
Results from TOTAL must not be used as the basis for rejecting any mortgage applicant. Mortgagees must provide full manual underwriting for mortgage applicants when TOTAL returns a “refer” risk score.
(C)
Vendor and mortgagee requirements.
Both mortgagees and vendors must:
(
1
) Use TOTAL to process FHA and other loan products specified by the FHA Commissioner only and for no other purpose;
(
2
) Implement quality control procedures for TOTAL usage and provide, at FHA's request, reports and loan samples that enable FHA to evaluate program operation;
(
3
) Not use TOTAL to direct mortgagors into other non-FHA product offerings (this requirement does not relieve a mortgagee from its obligations under § 203.10 concerning informed consumer choice for prospective FHA mortgagors);
(
4
) Not disassemble, decompile, reverse engineer, derive or otherwise reproduce any part of the source code or algorithm in TOTAL;
(
5

(ii)
Loss of privilege to use TOTAL.
Mortgagees and AUS vendors found to violate the requirements applicable to the use of TOTAL may have their access to TOTAL and all associated privileges terminated upon appropriate notice in accordance with the following procedure:
(A)
Notice.
HUD will provide a mortgagee or vendor with a 30-day notice of a violation and loss of privilege. The notice will state the nature of the violation, the effective date of the loss of the privilege, and the duration of the loss of the privilege. The notice will become effective on the date provided in the notice, unless the mortgagee or vendor appeals the violation and loss of privilege in accordance with paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(B) of this section.
(B)
Appeal.
A party receiving a notice of violation may appeal to the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Single Family Housing (DAS-SFH), or his or her designee, before the effective date of the notice by providing evidence to refute the violation. The loss of privilege is stayed until the DAS-SFH, or designee, notifies the party that the loss of privilege has been affirmed, rescinded, or modified.
(6) Where applicable, a certificate under oath and contract regarding use of the dwelling for transient or hotel purposes;
(7) Where applicable, a certificate of intent to occupy by military personnel;

(9) Where an individual water or sewer system is being used, an approval letter from the local health authority indicating approval of the system in accordance with § 200.926d(f) of this chapter;
(10) For proposed construction if the mortgage (excluding financed mortgage insurance premium) exceeds a 90 percent loan to value ratio, evidence that the mortgagee qualifies for a higher ratio loan under one of the applicable provisions in the appropriate regulations;
(11) A mortgage certification on a form prescribed by the Secretary, stating that the authorized representative of the mortgagee who is making the certification has personally reviewed the mortgage documents and the application for insurance endorsement, and certifying that the mortgage complies with the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section. The certification shall incorporate each of the mortgagee certification items that apply to the mortgage loan submitted for endorsement, as set forth in the applicable handbook or similar publication that is distributed to all Direct Endorsement mortgagees;

(13) The documentation required under § 203.37a providing that:
(i) The seller is the owner of record; and
(ii) That more than 90 days elapsed between the date the seller acquired the property (based upon the date of settlement) and the date of execution of the sales contract that will result in the FHA mortgage insurance.
(14) Such other documents as the Secretary may require.
(c)
Pre-endorsement review for Direct Endorsement.
Upon submission by an approved mortgagee of the documents required by paragraph (b) of this section, the Secretary will review the documents and determine that:
(1) The mortgage is executed on a form which meets the requirements of the Secretary;
(2) The mortgage maturity meets the requirements of the applicable program;

In addition, the Secretary is authorized to determine if there is any information indicating that any certification or required document is false, misleading, or constitutes fraud or misrepresentation on the part of any party, or that the mortgage fails to meet a statutory or regulatory requirement. If, following this review, the mortgage is determined to be eligible, the Secretary will endorse the mortgage for insurance by issuance of a Mortgage Insurance Certificate. If the mortgage is determined to be ineligible, the Secretary will inform the mortgagee in writing of this determination, and include the reasons for the determination and any corrective actions that may be taken.
(d)
Submission by mortgagee other than originating mortgagee.
If the originating mortgagee assigns the mortgage to another approved mortgagee before pre-endorsement review under paragraph (c) of this section, the assignee may submit the required documents for pre-endorsement review in the name of the originating mortgagee. All certifications must be executed by the originating mortgagee (or its underwriter, if appropriate). The purchasing mortgagee may pay any required mortgage insurance premium, late charge and interest.
(e)
Post-Endorsement review for Direct Endorsement.
Following endorsement for insurance, the Secretary may review all documents required by paragraph (b) of this section. If, following this review, the Secretary determines that the mortgage does not satisfy the requirements of the Direct Endorsement program, the Secretary may place the mortgagee on Direct Endorsement probation, or terminate the authority of the mortgagee to participate in the Direct Endorsement program pursuant to § 203.3(d), or refer the matter to the Mortgagee Review Board for action pursuant to part 25 of this title.
(f)
Lender insurance
—(1)
Pre-insurance review.
For applications for insurance involving mortgages originated under the Lender Insurance program under § 203.6, the mortgagee is responsible for performing a pre-insurance review that would otherwise be performed by HUD under § 203.255(c) on the documents that would otherwise be submitted to HUD under § 203.255(b). The mortgagee's staff that performs the pre-insurance review must not be the same staff that originated the mortgage or underwrote the mortgage for insurance.
(2)
Recordkeeping.
Mortgagees must maintain records, including origination files, in a manner and for a time period to be prescribed by the Assistant Secretary for Housing—Federal Housing Commissioner, and must make them available to authorized HUD staff upon request.
(3)
Insuring the mortgage.
If, following this review, the mortgage is determined to be eligible, the mortgagee will electronically submit all required data to HUD regarding the mortgage. HUD's electronic system will acknowledge that the mortgage has been insured. HUD's electronic system may also issue a notice to the mortgagee that the mortgage has been selected for post-insurance technical review, and that the HUD case binder must be sent to the identified HUD office.
(g)
Indemnification
—(1)
General.
By insuring the mortgage, a Lender Insurance mortgagee agrees to indemnify HUD, in accordance with this paragraph.
(2)
Definition of origination.
For purposes of indemnification under this paragraph, the term “origination” means the process of creating a mortgage, starting with the taking of the initial application, continuing with the processing and underwriting, and ending with the mortgagee endorsing the mortgage note for FHA insurance.
(3)
Serious and material violation.
The mortgagee shall indemnify HUD for an FHA insurance claim paid within 5
years of mortgage insurance endorsement, if the mortgagee knew or should have known of a serious and material violation of FHA origination requirements, such that the mortgage loan should not have been approved and endorsed by the mortgagee and irrespective of whether the violation caused the mortgage default. Such a serious and material violation of FHA requirements in the origination of the mortgage may occur if the mortgagee failed to, among other actions:
(i) Verify the creditworthiness, income, and/or employment of the mortgagor in accordance with FHA requirements;
(ii) Verify the assets brought by the mortgagor for payment of the required down payment and/or closing costs in accordance with FHA requirements; or
(iii) Address property deficiencies identified in the appraisal affecting the health and safety of the occupants or the structural integrity of the property in accordance with FHA requirements, or
(iv) Ensure that the appraisal of the property serving as security for the mortgage loan satisfies FHA appraisal requirements, in accordance with § 203.5(e).
(4)
Fraud or misrepresentation.
The mortgagee shall indemnify HUD for an insurance claim if the mortgagee knew or should have known that fraud or misrepresentation was involved in connection with the origination of the mortgage, regardless of whether the fraud or misrepresentation caused the mortgage default and regardless of when an insurance claim is filed.
(5)
Demand for indemnification.
The demand for indemnification will be made by either the Secretary or the Mortgagee Review Board. Under indemnification, the Lender Insurance mortgagee agrees to either abstain from filing an insurance claim, or reimburse FHA if a subsequent holder of the mortgage files an insurance claim and FHA suffers a financial loss.

For purposes of this paragraph (d), the term
eligible non-occupant mortgagor

If at any time during default the mortgagor is a “Person in military service,” as such term is defined in the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940, the period during which the mortgagor is in such service shall be excluded in computing the period within which the mortgagee shall commence foreclosure or acquire the property by other means as provided in § 203.355 of this subpart. No postponement or delay in the prosecution of foreclosure proceedings during the period the mortgagor is in such military service shall be construed as failure on the part of the mortgagee to exercise reasonable diligence in prosecuting
such proceedings to completion as required by this subpart.

(2) If the mortgagee acquires title to the mortgaged property pursuant to a bid at foreclosure sale in an amount equal to the Commissioner's adjusted fair market value, the mortgagee may elect to retain title to the property and to file a claim for the insurance benefits computed as provided in § 203.401(b).
(3) If a party other than the mortgagee acquires title to the mortgaged property either pursuant to a bid at foreclosure sale or through the redemption of the property in an amount not less than the Commissioner's adjusted fair market value, the mortgagee may file a claim for the insurance benefits computed as provided in § 203.401(b).
(4) If the mortgagee acquires title to the mortgaged property pursuant to a bid at foreclosure sale in an amount in excess of the Commissioner's adjusted fair market value, the mortgagee is deemed to have elected to retain title to the property and is limited to filing a claim for the insurance benefits computed as provided in § 203.401(b). In the event the mortgagee can show good cause for having bid an amount in excess of the Commissioner's adjusted fair market value, the Commissioner may, at his discretion, waive the provisions of this subparagraph and allow the mortgagee to convey title to the Commissioner and file a claim for the insurance benefits computed as provided in § 203.401(a). A mortgagee which has elected to follow the provisions of this section pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section and bids an amount in excess of the Commissioner's adjusted fair market value shall not be subject to the provisions of this subparagraph, and may elect to retain or convey title in filing a claim for the insurance benefits.
(5) In any other case, the mortgagee may file a claim for insurance benefits only upon conveyance of title to the mortgaged property to the Commissioner.
(h) If the Commissioner provides timely notice of the Commissioner's adjusted fair market value in accordance with paragraph (e), the Commissioner may require the mortgagee to advertise the upcoming sale in addition to the standard legal notices which may be required by state law.
(i) Where a mortgagee files a claim for the insurance benefits without conveying title to the property to the Commissioner, as authorized by this section:
(1) Sections 203.358 through 203.367 shall not be applicable.
(2) The mortgagee shall assign to the Commissioner, without recourse or warranty, any or all claims which the mortgagee has acquired in connection with the mortgage transaction and as a result of the foreclosure proceedings or other means by which the mortgagee or party other than the mortgagee acquired such property, except such claims as may have been released with the approval of the Commissioner.
(3) The mortgagee shall forward to the Commissioner:
(i) Fiscal data pertaining to the mortgage transaction;
(ii) The original credit and security instruments, if available, or a deficiency judgment, if any, duly assigned or endorsed by the mortgagee, without recourse, to the Commissioner; and
(iii) Any additional information or data which the Commissioner may require.
(4) The mortgagee shall retain all cash amounts held or deposited for the account of the mortgagor or to which the mortgagee is entitled under the mortgage transaction that have not been applied in reduction of the principal mortgage indebtedness. Cash amounts shall be itemized and deducted from the claim pursuant to § 203.403. Receipts for disbursements are to be retained by the mortgagee and are to be made available upon request by the Commissioner.
(5) The mortgagee shall file its claim:
(i) Within 30 days after the mortgagee acquired good marketable title to the property; or
(ii) Within 30 days after a party other than the mortgagee acquired good marketable title to the property; or
(iii) In redemption States, within 30 days after the mortgagor or another party redeemed the property or the redemption period has expired; or
(iv) Within such other time as may be determined by the Commissioner.
(6) In any case in which the insurance benefits paid include, pursuant to § 203.402(c), hazard insurance premiums paid by the mortgagee, the portion of the hazard insurance premium allocable to the period after acquisition of title by the mortgagee or a third party shall be deducted from the mortgage insurance benefits otherwise payable.

Deficiency judgments.
(a)
Mortgages insured on or after March 28, 1988.
(1) For mortgages insured pursuant to firm commitments issued on or after March 28, 1988, or pursuant to direct endorsement processing where the credit worksheet was signed by the mortgagee's underwriter on or after March 28, 1988, the Secretary may require the mortgagee diligently to pursue a deficiency judgment in connection with any foreclosure. With respect to claims filed for insurance benefits on such mortgages, any judgment obtained by the mortgagee must be assigned to the Secretary.
(2) In cases where the Secretary requires the pursuit of a deficiency judgment and provides the mortgagee with the Secretary's estimate of the fair market value of the property, less adjustments, in accordance with § 203.368(e) of this part, the mortgagee must tender a bid at the foreclosure sale in that amount, and must take all other appropriate steps in accordance with State law to obtain a deficiency judgment.
(b)
Mortgages insured before March 28, 1988.
For mortgages insured pursuant to firm commitments issued before March 28, 1988, or pursuant to direct endorsement processing where the credit worksheet was signed by the mortgagee's underwriter before March 28, 1988, the Secretary may request that the mortgage diligently pursue a deficiency judgment in connection with the foreclosure. With respect to claims filed for insurance benefits on such mortgages, any judgment obtained by the mortgagee must be assigned to the Secretary.
(c) In cases where pursuit of a deficiency judgment is requested or required under this section, the Commissioner, where the Commissioner determines it appropriate under State law requirements, may extend the otherwise applicable period of time within which a deficiency judgment (and other claims against the mortgagor) and related credit documents must be assigned to the Commissioner under § 203.360, § 203.367 or § 203.368 of this subpart.
(d) In addition to meeting the requirements of § 203.356, in cases where the Commissioner determines it necessary because of State law requirements, the Commissioner may also require (or request, as the Commissioner may determine) the mortgagee to provide the Commissioner with notice of the mortgagee's intent to institute foreclosure proceedings a reasonable amount of time before proceedings are instituted, in order that the Commissioner may be able effectively to require or request the mortgagee, in appropriate cases, to seek a deficiency judgment.

§ 203.371
Partial claim.
(a)

(b)
Requirements.
The following conditions must be met for payment of a partial claim:

The mortgagee shall provide HUD with the original security instrument, required by paragraph (c) of this section, no later than 6 months following the date of execution. If the mortgagee experiences a delay from the recording authority, it may request an extension of time, in writing, from HUD. If the mortgagee does not provide the original of the note and security instrument within the prescribed deadlines, the mortgagee shall be required to reimburse the amount of the claim paid, including the incentive.

[Reserved]
§ 203.377
Inspection and preservation of properties.
The mortgagee, upon learning that a property subject to a mortgage insured under this part is vacant or abandoned, shall be responsible for the inspection of such property at least monthly, if the loan thereon is in default. When a mortgage is in default and a payment thereon is not received within 45 days of the due date, and efforts to reach the mortgagor by telephone within that period have been unsuccessful, the mortgagee shall be responsible for a visual inspection of the security property to
determine whether the property is vacant. The mortgagee shall take reasonable action to protect and preserve such security property when it is determined or should have been determined to be vacant or abandoned until its conveyance to the Secretary, if such action does not constitute an illegal trespass. “Reasonable action” includes the commencement of foreclosure within the time required by § 203.355(b) of this part.

§ 203.378

The mortgagee shall not be liable for damage to the property by waste committed by the mortgagor, its heirs, successors or assigns in connection with mortgage insurance claims paid on or after July 2, 1968.
(c)
Mortgagee responsibility.
The mortgagee shall be responsible for:
(1) Damage by fire, flood, earthquake, hurricane, or tornado;
(2) Damage to or destruction of security properties on which the loans are in default and which properties are vacant or abandoned, when such damage or destruction is due to the mortgagee's failure to take reasonable action to inspect, protect and preserve such properties as required by § 203.377 of this part, as to all mortgages insured on or after January 1, 1977; and
(3) As to all mortgages insured under firm commitments issued on or after November 19, 1992, or under direct endorsement processing where the credit worksheet was signed by the mortgagee's underwriter on or after November 19, 1992, any damage of whatsoever nature that the property has sustained while in the possession of the mortgage if the property is conveyed to the Secretary without notice to and approval by the Secretary as required by § 203.379 of this part.
(d)
Limitation.
The mortgagee's responsibility for property damage shall not exceed the amount of its insurance claim as to a particular property.
[36 FR 34508, Dec. 22, 1971. Redesignated and amended at 41 FR 49735, Nov. 10, 1976; 57 FR 47973, Oct. 20, 1992; 58 FR 32057, June 8, 1993; 61 FR 36265, July 9, 1996; 61 FR 36453, July 10, 1996]
§ 203.379
Adjustment for damage or neglect.
(a) If the property has been damaged by fire, flood, earthquake, hurricane, or tornado, or, for mortgages insured on or after January 1, 1977, the property has suffered damage because of the mortgagee's failure to take action as required by § 203.377, the damage must be repaired before conveyance of the property or assignment of the mortgage to the Secretary, except under the following conditions:
(1) If the prior approval of the Secretary is obtained, there will be deducted from the insurance benefits the Secretary's estimate of the cost of repairing the damage or any insurance recovery received by the mortgagee, whichever is greater.
(2) If the property has been damaged by fire and was not covered by fire insurance at the time of the damage, or the amount of insurance coverage was inadequate to repair fully the damage, only the amount of insurance recovery received by the mortgagee, if any, will be deducted from the insurance benefits, provided the mortgagee certifies, at the time that a claim is filed for insurance benefits, that:
(i) At the time the mortgage was insured, the property was covered by fire insurance in an amount at least equal to the lesser of 100 percent of the insurable value of the improvements, or the principal loan balance of the mortgage; and
(ii) The insurer later cancelled this coverage or refused to renew it for reasons other than nonpayment of premium; and
(iii) The mortgagee made diligent though unsuccessful efforts within 30 days of any cancellation or non-renewal of hazard insurance, and at least annually thereafter, to secure other coverage or coverage under a FAIR
Plan, in an amount described in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, or if coverage to such an extent was unavailable at a reasonable rate, the greatest extent of coverage that was available at a reasonable rate; and
(iv) The extent of coverage obtained by the mortgagee in accordance with paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section was the greatest available at a reasonable rate, or if the mortgagee was unable to obtain insurance, none was available at a reasonable rate; and
(v) The mortgagee took the actions required by § 203.377 of this part.
(3) The certification requirements set out in paragraph (a)(2) of this section apply to any mortgage insured by HUD on or after September 22, 1980, for which a claim has not been filed before September 30, 1986. Any mortgage insured on or after September 22, 1980, for which a claim has been filed before September 30, 1986, but the claim has not been settled before that date, will be governed by § 203.379(b) (1986) Edition as it existed immediately before September 30, 1986.
(4)(i) As used in this section,
reasonable rate
means a rate that is not in excess of the rate or advisory rate set by the principal State-licensed rating organization for essential property insurance in the voluntary market, or if coverage is available under a FAIR Plan, the FAIR Plan rate.
(ii) If a State has neither a FAIR Plan nor a State-licensed rating organization for essential property insurance in the voluntary market, the mortgagee must provide to the HUD Field Office having jurisdiction, information concerning the lowest rates available from an insurer for the types of coverage involved, with a request for a determination of whether the rate is reasonable. HUD will determine the rate to be reasonable if it approximates the rate assessed for comparable insurance coverage applicable to similarly situated properties in a State that offers a FAIR Plan or maintains a State-licensed rating organization.
(b) For mortgages insured under firm commitments issued on or after November 19, 1992, or under direct endorsement processing where the credit worksheet was signed by the mortgagee's underwriter on or after November 19, 1992, the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section apply and, in addition, if the property has been damaged during the time of the mortgagee's possession by events other than fire, flood, earthquake, hurricane, or tornado, or if it was damaged notwithstanding reasonable action by the mortgagee as required by § 203.377 of this part, the mortgagee must provide notice of such damage to the Secretary and may not convey until directed to do so by the Secretary. The Secretary will either:
(1) Allow the mortgagee to convey the property damaged; or
(2) Require the mortgagee to repair the damage before conveyance, and the Secretary will reimburse the mortgagee for reasonable payments not in excess of the Secretary's estimate of the cost of repair, less any insurance recovery.
(c) In the event the damaged property is conveyed to the Secretary without prior notice or approval as provided in paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section, the Secretary may:
(1) After notice, reconvey the property to the mortgagee and the mortgagee must reimburse the Secretary in accordance with §§ 203.363 and 203.364 of this part, or
(2) Require the mortgagee to reimburse the Secretary for the greater of the Secretary's estimate of the cost of repair or any insurance recovery.

(ii) As to mortgages insured or for which commitments to insure were issued on or after January 2, 1977, undamaged due to failure of the mortgagee to take action as required by § 203.377; and

The mortgagee shall cancel any hazard insurance policy as of the date of the filing for record of the deed to the Commissioner subject to the following conditions:
(a) The amount of the return premium due the mortgagee because of such cancellation may be calculated on a “short-rate” basis and reported on fiscal data supporting the application for debentures and the amount shall be deducted from the total amount claimed.
(b) If the mortgagee's calculation of the return premium is less than the actual return, the amount of the difference between the actual refund and the calculated amount shall be remitted to the Commissioner, accompanied by the carrier's or agent's statement.
(c) If the mortgagee's calculation of the return premium is more than the actual return, the mortgagee may file with the Commissioner a claim, supported by the carrier's or agent's statement of the amount of the refund, whereupon the Commissioner shall issue a check to the mortgagee in settlement of the claim.

(c)
Abstract and legal opinion.

(a)
Mortgages sold by the Secretary.

In such instances, the Secretary will not object to title by reason of any such defect.
(b)
Property sold by the Secretary.
(1) If a property held by the Secretary is sold by the Secretary who also insures a mortgage financing the sale, and the mortgage is later reassigned to the Secretary or the property covered by the mortgage is later conveyed to the Secretary, the Secretary will not object to title by reason of any lien or other adverse interest that was senior to the mortgage on the date the mortgage was filed for record, except where the lien or other adverse interest arose from a lien or interest that had already been recorded against the mortgagor.

§ 203.391
Title objection waiver with reduced insurance benefits.
Payment of an insurance claim will not automatically be refused solely because the title evidence reveals a condition of title not taken into consideration in the original appraisal and not covered by the provisions of § 203.389 of this part, or not otherwise waived in writing by the Secretary. In such instances, the Secretary may, at his or her option, approve the payment of a claim if the mortgagee agrees to accept a reduction in insurance benefits considered adequate by the Secretary to compensate for any anticipated loss to the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund as a result of the existence of the title condition at the time of claim.

(2) If a party other than the mortgagee acquires title to the mortgaged property pursuant to a bid at foreclosure sale not less in amount than the Commissioner's adjusted fair market value, the amount of the insurance benefits shall be determined by deducting the proceeds of the foreclosure sale distributed to the mortgagee from the original principal balance of the mortgage (as increased by the amount of open-end advances made by the mortgagee and approved by the Commissioner) which was unpaid on the date of the foreclosure proceedings, and adding to the difference, if any, all applicable items set forth in § 203.402 and subtracting therefrom all applicable items set forth in § 203.403; provided, however, that appropriate adjustment shall be
made for any such items covered by the proceeds of the foreclosure sale.
(3) If the mortgagee acquires title to the mortgaged property pursuant to a bid not less in amount than the Commissioner's adjusted fair market value, and the mortgagor or another party redeems the property, the amount of the insurance benefits shall be determined by deducting the amount paid to redeem the property and received by the mortgagee from the original principal balance of that mortgage (as increased by the amount of open-end advances made by the mortgagee and approved by the Commissioner) which was unpaid on the date of the institution of foreclosure proceedings, and adding to the difference, if any, all applicable items set forth in § 203.402 and subtracting therefrom all applicable items set forth in § 203.403; provided however, that appropriate adjustments shall be made for any such items covered by that amount paid by the mortgagor or other party to redeem the property.

# Source:
41 FR 49736, Nov. 10, 1976, unless otherwise noted.

# General Requirements
§ 203.500
Mortgage servicing generally.
This subpart identifies servicing practices of lending institutions that HUD considers acceptable for mortgages insured by HUD. Failure to comply with this subpart shall not be a basis for denial of insurance benefits, but failure to comply will be cause for imposition of a civil money penalty, including a penalty under § 30.35(c)(2), or withdrawal of HUD's approval of a mortgagee. It is the intent of the Department that no mortgagee shall commence foreclosure or acquire title to a property until the requirements of this subpart have been followed.
[70 FR 21578, Apr. 26, 2005]
§ 203.501
Loss mitigation.
Mortgagees must consider the comparative effects of their elective servicing actions, and must take those appropriate actions which can reasonably be expected to generate the smallest financial loss to the Department. Such actions include, but are not limited to, deeds in lieu of foreclosure under § 203.357, pre-foreclosure sales under § 203.370, partial claims under § 203.414, assumptions under § 203.512, special forbearance under §§ 203.471 and 203.614, and recasting of mortgages under § 203.616. HUD may prescribe conditions and requirements for the appropriate use of these loss mitigation actions, concerning such matters as owner-occupancy, extent of previous defaults, prior use of loss mitigation, and evaluation of the mortgagor's income, credit and property.
[59 FR 50145, Sept. 30, 1994, as amended at 61 FR 35019, July 3, 1996]
§ 203.502
Responsibility for servicing.
(a) After January 10, 1994, servicing of insured mortgages must be performed by a mortgagee that is approved by HUD to service insured mortgages. The servicer must fully discharge the servicing responsibilities of the mortgagee as outlined in this part. The mortgagee shall remain fully responsible to the Secretary for proper servicing, and the actions of its servicer shall be considered to be the actions of the mortgagee. The servicer also shall be fully responsible to the Secretary for its actions as a servicer.
(b) Whenever servicing of any mortgage is transferred from one mortgagee or servicer to another, notice of the transfer of service shall be delivered:
(1) By the transferor mortgagee or servicer to the mortgagor. The notification shall be delivered not less than 15 days before the effective date of the transfer and shall contain the information required in § 3500.21(e)(2) of this title; and
(2) By the transferee mortgagee or servicer:
(i)
To the mortgagor.
The notification shall be delivered not less than 15 days before the effective date of the transfer and shall contain the information required in § 3500.21(e)(2) of this title; and
(ii)
To the Secretary.
This notification shall be delivered within 15 days of the transfer, in a format prescribed by the Secretary.

§ 203.508
Providing information.
(a) Mortgagees shall provide loan information to mortgagors and arrange for individual loan consultation on request. The mortgagee must establish written procedures and controls to assure prompt responses to inquiries. One or more of the following means of making information readily available to mortgagors is required:
(1) An office staffed with competent personnel located within 200 miles of the property, capable of providing timely responses to requests for information. Complete records need not be maintained in such an office if the staff is able to secure needed information and pass it on to the mortgagor.
(2) Toll-free telephone service at an office capable of providing needed information.
(b) All mortgagors must be informed of the system available for obtaining answers to loan inquiries, the office from which needed information may be obtained and reminded of the system at least annually. Toll-free telephone service need not be provided to a mortgagor other than at the office designated to serve the mortgagor nor other than from the immediate vicinity of the security property.
(c) Within thirty days after the end of each calendar year, the mortgagee shall furnish to the mortgagor a statement of the interest paid, and of the taxes disbursed from the escrow account during the preceding year. At the mortgagor's request, the mortgagee shall furnish a statement of the escrow account sufficient to enable the mortgagor to reconcile the account.
(d) Mortgagees must respond to HUD requests for information concerning individual accounts.
(e) Each servicer of a mortgage shall deliver to the mortgagor a written notice of any assignment, sale, or transfer of the servicing of the mortgage. The notice must be sent in accordance with the provisions of § 3500.21(e)(1) of this title and shall contain the information required by § 3500.21(e)(2) of this title. Servicers must respond to mortgagor inquiries pertaining to the transfer of servicing in accordance with § 3500.21(f) of this title.

§ 203.510
Release of personal liability.
(a)
Procedures.
The mortgagee shall release a selling mortgagor from any personal liability for payment of the mortgage debt, if release is permitted by § 203.258 of this part, in accordance with the following procedures:
(1) The mortgagee receives a request for a creditworthiness determination for a prospective purchaser of all or part of the mortgaged property;
(2) The mortgagee or servicer performs a creditworthiness determination under § 203.512(b)(1) of this part if the mortgagee or servicer is approved for participation in the Direct Endorsement program, or the mortgagee requests a creditworthiness determination by the Secretary;
(3) The prospective purchaser is determined to be creditworthy under the standards applicable when a release of the selling mortgagor is intended;
(4) The prospective purchaser assumes personal liability by agreeing to pay the mortgage debt; and
(5) The mortgagee provides the selling mortgagor with a release of personal liability on a form approved by the Secretary.
(b)
Release after 5 years.
(1) If a selling mortgagor is not released under the procedures described in paragraph (a) of this section, either because no request for a creditworthiness determination is submitted under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, or because there is no affirmative determination of creditworthiness under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, then the selling mortgagor is automatically released from any personal liability for payment of the mortgage debt because of section 203(r) of the National Housing Act if:
(i) The purchasing mortgagor has assumed personal liability by agreeing to pay the mortgage debt;
(ii) Five years have elapsed after the assumption; and
(iii) The purchasing mortgagor is not in default under the mortgage at the end of the five-year period.
(2) If the conditions of this paragraph (b) for a release are satisfied, the mortgagee shall provide a written release upon request to the selling mortgagor.
(3) This paragraph (b) only applies to a mortgage originated pursuant to an application by the mortgagor on or after December 1, 1986 on a form approved by the Secretary.
(c)
Mortgagee to provide notice.
A mortgagee shall inform mortgagors (including prospective mortgagors seeking information) about the procedures for release of personal liability by providing a notice approved by the Secretary when required by the Secretary.
[58 FR 42649, Aug. 11, 1993]
§ 203.512
Free assumability; exceptions.
(a)
Policy of free assumability with no restrictions.
A mortgagee shall not impose, agree to or enforce legal restrictions on conveyance, as defined in § 203.41(a)(3) of this part, or restrictions on assumption of the insured mortgage, unless specifically permitted by this part or contained in a junior lien granted to the mortgagee after settlement on the insured mortgage.
(b)
Credit review.
If approval is required by the mortgage, the mortgagee shall not approve the sale or other transfer of all or part of the mortgaged property, or the sale or transfer of a beneficial interest in a trust owning all or part of the property, whether or not any person acquires personal liability under the mortgage in connection with the sale or other transfer, unless:
(1) At least one of the persons acquiring ownership is determined to be creditworthy under applicable standards prescribed by the Secretary;
(2) The selling mortgagor retains an ownership interest in the property; or
(3) The transfer is by devise or descent.
(c)
Investors and secondary residences.
The mortgagee shall not approve the sale of other transfer or mortgaged property to a person who cannot be approved as a substitute mortgagor as provided in § 203.258 of this part because the property will not be a primary residence or a secondary residence permitted by that section.
(d)
Due-on-sale clause.
Each mortgage shall contain a due-on-sale clause permitting acceleration, in a form prescribed by the Secretary. If a sale or other transfer occurs without mortgagee approval and a prohibition in paragraphs (b) or (c) of this section applies, a mortgagee shall enforce this section by requesting approval from the Secretary to accelerate the mortgage, provided that acceleration is permitted by applicable law. The mortgagee shall accelerate if approval is granted. This paragraph applies only if the application by the mortgagor on a form approved by the Secretary is dated on or after December 1, 1986.

# Payments, Charges and Accounts
§ 203.550
Escrow accounts.
(a) It is the mortgagee's responsibility to make escrow disbursements before bills become delinquent. Mortgagees must establish controls to insure that bills payable from the escrow fund or the information needed to pay such bills is obtained on a timely basis. Penalties for late payments for items payable from the escrow account must not be charged to the mortgagor unless it can be shown that the penalty was the direct result of the mortgagor's error or omission. The mortgagee shall use the procedures set forth in § 3500.17 of this title, implementing Section 10
of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (12 U.S.C. 2609), to compute the amount of the escrow, the methods of collection and accounting, and the payment of the bills for which the money has been escrowed.
(b) [Reserved]
(c) In the case of escrow accounts created for purposes of § 203.52 or § 234.64 of this chapter, mortgagees may estimate escrow requirements based on the best information available as to probable payments that will be required to be made from the account on a periodic basis throughout the period during which the account is maintained.
(d) The mortgagee shall not institute foreclosure when the only default of the mortgagor occupant is a present inability to pay a substantial escrow shortage, resulting from an adjustment pursuant to this section, in a lump sum.
(e) When the contract of mortgage insurance is terminated voluntarily or because of prepayment in full, sums in the escrow account to pay the mortgage insurance premiums shall be remitted to HUD with a form approved by the Secretary for reporting the voluntary termination of prepayment. Upon prepayment in full sums held in escrow for taxes and hazard insurance shall be released to the mortgagor promptly.

§ 203.552
Fees and charges after endorsement.
(a) The mortgagee may collect reasonable and customary fees and charges from the mortgagor after insurance endorsement only as provided below. The mortgagee may collect these fees or charges from the mortgagor only to the extent that the mortgagee is not reimbursed for such fees by HUD.
(1) Late charges as set forth in § 203.25;
(2) Charges for processing or reprocessing a check returned as uncollectible; (Where bank policy permits, the mortgagee must deposit a check for collection a second time before assessing a bad check charge);
(3) Fees for processing a change of ownership of the mortgaged property;
(4) Fees and charges for arranging a substitution of liability under the mortgage in connection with the sale or transfer of the property;
(5) Charges for processing a request for credit approval of an assumptor or substitute mortgagor;

(7) Charges for modification of the mortgage involving a recorded agreement for extension of term or reamortization;
(8) Fees and charges for processing a partial release of the mortgaged property;
(9) Attorney's and trustee's fees and expenses actually incurred (including the cost of appraisals pursuant to § 203.368(e) and cost of advertising pursuant to § 203.368(h)) when a case has been referred for foreclosure in accordance with the provisions of this part after a firm decision to foreclose if foreclosure is not completed because of a reinstatement of the account. (No attorney's fee may be charged for the services of the mortgagee's or servicer's staff attorney or for the services of a collection attorney other than the attorney handling the foreclosure.)
(10) The service charge provided for by § 203.23(c) and escrow charges in accordance with § 203.23(a);
(11) A trustee's fee if the security instrument in deed-of-trust states provides for payment of such a fee for execution of a satisfactory, release, or trustee's deed when the deed of trust is paid in full; and
(12) Such other reasonable and customary charges as may be authorized by the Secretary. (This shall not include:
(i) Charges for servicing activities of the mortgagee or servicer;
(ii) Fees charged by independent tax servicer organizations which contract to furnish data and information necessary for the payment of property taxes,
(iii)
Satisfaction, termination,
or
reconveyance
fees when a mortgage is
paid in full (other than as provided in paragraph (a)(11) of this section), or
(iv) The fee for recordation of a satisfaction of the mortgage in states where recordation is the responsibility of the mortgagee.)
(13) Where permitted by the security instrument, attorney's fees and expenses actually incurred in the defense of any suit or legal proceeding wherein the mortgagee shall be made a party thereto by reason of the mortgage; (No attorney's fee may be charged for the services of the mortgagee's or servicer's staff attorney.)
(14) Property preservation expenses incurred pursuant to § 203.377.
(b)
reasonable and customary
fees must be predicated upon the actual cost of the work performed including out-of-pocket expenses. Directors of HUD Area and Insuring Offices are authorized to establish maximum fees and charges which are reasonable and customary in their areas. Except as provided in this part, no fee or charge shall be based on a percentage of either the face amount of the mortgage or the unpaid principal balance due on the mortgage.
[41 FR 49736, Nov. 10, 1976, as amended at 52 FR 1330, Jan. 13, 1987; 61 FR 35019, July 3, 1996; 62 FR 60130, Nov. 6, 1997]
§ 203.554
Enforcement of late charges.
(a) A mortgagee shall not commence foreclosure when the only default on the part of the mortgagor is the failure to pay a late charge or charges (§ 203.25), except as provided in § 203.556.
(b) A late charge attributable to a particular installment payment due under the mortgage shall not be deducted from that installment. However, if the mortgagee thereafter notifies the mortgagor of his obligation to pay a late charge, such a charge may be deducted from any subsequent payment or payments submitted by the mortgagor or on his behalf if this is not inconsistent with the terms of the mortgage. Partial payments shall be treated as provided in § 203.556.
(c) A payment may be returned because of failure to include a late charge only if the mortgagee notifies the mortgagor before imposition of the charge of the amount of the monthly payment, the date when the late charge will be imposed and either the amount of the late charge or the total amount due when the late charge is included.
(d) During the 60-day period beginning on the effective date of transfer of the servicing of a mortgage, a late charge shall not be imposed on the mortgagor with respect to any payment on the loan. No payment shall be treated as late for any other purpose if the payment is received by the transferor servicer, rather than the transferee servicer that should receive the payment, before the due date (including any applicable grace period allowed under the mortgage documents) applicable to such payment.
[42 FR 15680, Mar. 23, 1977, as amended at 59 FR 65448, Dec. 19, 1994]
§ 203.556
Return of partial payments.
(a) For the purpose of this section, a partial payment is a payment of any amount less than the full amount due under the terms of the mortgage at the time the payment is tendered, including late charges.
(b) Except as provided in this section, the mortgagee shall accept any partial payment and either apply it to the mortgagor's account or identify it with the mortgagor's account and hold it in a trust account pending disposition. When partial payments held for disposition aggregate a full monthly installment they shall be applied to the mortgagor's account, thus advancing the date of the oldest unpaid installment but not the date on which the account first became delinquent.
(c) If the mortgage is not in default, a partial payment may be returned to the mortgagor with a letter of explanation.
(d) If the mortgage is in default, a partial payment may be returned to the mortgagor with a letter of explanation in any of the following circumstances:
(1) When payment aggregates less than 50 percent of the amount then due;
(2) The payment is less than the amount agreed to in a forbearance plan, whether or not reduced to writing;
(3) The property is occupied by a tenant who is paying rent and the rentals
are not being applied to the mortgage payments;
(4) Foreclosure has been commenced. (Foreclosure is commenced when the first action required for foreclosure under applicable law is taken.)
(e) Under the following circumstances the mortgagee may return any partial payment received more than 14 days after the mortgagee has mailed to the mortgagor a statement of the full amount due, including late charges, and a notice of intention to return any payment less than such amount.
(1) Four or more monthly installments are due and unpaid, or
(2) A delinquency of any amount has continued for at least six months since the account first became delinquent.

§ 203.558
Handling prepayments.
(a)
Handling prepayments for FHA-insured mortgages closed on or after January 21, 2015.
With respect to FHA-insured mortgages closed on or after January 21, 2015, notwithstanding the terms of the mortgage, the mortgagee shall accept a prepayment at any time and in any amount. The mortgagee shall not require 30 days' advance notice of prepayment, even if the mortgage instrument purports to require such notice. Monthly interest on the debt must be calculated on the actual unpaid principal balance of the loan as of the date the prepayment is received, and not as of the next installment due date.
(b)
Handling prepayments for FHA-insured mortgages closed before January 21, 2015.
(1) With respect to FHA mortgages insured before August 2, 1985, if a prepayment is offered on other than an installment due date, the mortgagee may refuse to accept the prepayment until the first day of the month following expiration of the 30-day notice period as provided in the mortgage, or may require payment of interest to that date, but only if the mortgagee so advises the mortgagor, in a form approved by the Commissioner, in response to the mortgagor's inquiry, request for payoff figures, or tender of prepayment. If the installment due date (the first day of the month) falls on a nonbusiness day, the mortgagor's notice of intention to prepay or the prepayment shall be timely if received on the next business day.
(2) With respect to FHA mortgages insured on or after August 2, 1985, but closed before January 21, 2015, the mortgagee shall not require 30 days' advance notice of prepayment, even if the mortgage instrument purports to require such notice. If the prepayment is offered on other than an installment due date, the mortgagee may refuse to accept the prepayment until the next installment due date (the first day of the month), or may require payment of interest to that date, but only if the mortgagee so advises the mortgagor, in a form approved by the Commissioner, in response to the mortgagor's inquiry, request for payoff figures, or tender of prepayment.
(3) If the mortgagee fails to meet the full disclosure requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section, the mortgagee may be subject to forfeiture of that portion of the interest collected for the period beyond the date that prepayment in full was received and to such other actions as are provided in part 25 of this title.
(c)
Mortgagee annual notice to mortgagors.
Each mortgagee, with respect to a mortgage under this part, shall provide to each of its mortgagors not less frequently than annually a written notice, in a form approved by the Commissioner, containing a statement of the amount outstanding for prepayment of the principal amount of the mortgage. With respect to FHA-insured mortgages closed before January 21, 2015, the notice shall describe any requirements the mortgagor must fulfill to prevent the accrual of any interest on the principal amount after the date of any prepayment. This paragraph shall apply to any outstanding mortgage insured on or after August 22, 1991.
[79 FR 50837, Aug. 26, 2014]

# Mortgagee Action and Forbearance
§ 203.600
Mortgage collection action.
Subject to the requirements of this subpart, mortgagees shall take prompt action to collect amounts due from mortgagors to minimize the number of

§ 203.602
Delinquency notice to mortgagor.
The mortgagee shall give notice to each mortgagor in default on a form supplied by the Secretary or, if the mortgagee wishes to use its own form, on a form approved by the Secretary, no later than the end of the second month of any delinquency in payments under the mortgage. If an account is reinstated and again becomes delinquent, the delinquency notice shall be sent to the mortgagor again, except that the mortgagee is not required to send a second delinquency notice to the same mortgagor more often than once each six months. The mortgagee may issue additional or more frequent notices of delinquency at its option.

§ 203.605
Loss mitigation performance.
(a)
Duty to mitigate.
Before four full monthly installments due on the mortgage have become unpaid, the mortgagee shall evaluate on a monthly basis all of the loss mitigation techniques provided at § 203.501 to determine which is appropriate. Based upon such evaluations, the mortgagee shall take the appropriate loss mitigation action. Documentation must be maintained for the initial and all subsequent evaluations and resulting loss mitigation actions. Should a claim for mortgage insurance benefits later be filed, the mortgagee shall maintain this documentation in the claim review file under the requirements of § 203.365(c).
(b)
Assessment of mortgagee's loss mitigation performance.
(1) HUD will measure and advise mortgagees of their loss mitigation performance through the Tier Ranking System (TRS). Under the TRS, HUD will analyze each mortgagee's loss mitigation efforts portfolio-wide on a quarterly basis, based on 12 months of performance, by computing ratios involving loss mitigation attempts, defaults, and claims. Based on the ratios, HUD will group mortgagees in four tiers (Tiers 1, 2, 3, and 4), with Tier 1 representing the highest or best ranking mortgagees and Tier 4 representing the lowest or least satisfactory ranking mortgagees. The precise methodology for calculating the TRS ratios and for determining the tier stratification (or cutoff points) will be provided through
Federal Register
notice. Notice of future TRS methodology or stratification changes will be published in the
Federal Register
and will provide a 30-day public comment period.
(2) Before HUD issues each quarterly TRS notice, HUD will review the number of claims paid to the mortgagee. If HUD determines that the lender's low TRS score is the result of a small number of defaults or a small number of foreclosure claims, or both, as defined by notice, HUD may determine not to designate the mortgagee as Tier 3 or Tier 4, and the mortgagee will remain unranked.
(3) Within 30 calendar days after the date of the TRS notice, a mortgagee that scored in Tier 4 may appeal its ranking to the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Single Family or the Deputy Assistant Secretary's designee and request an informal HUD conference. The only basis for appeal by the Tier 4 mortgagee is disagreement with the data used by HUD to calculate the mortgagee's ranking. If HUD determines that the mortgagee's Tier 4 ranking was based on incorrect or incomplete data, the mortgagee's performance will be recalculated and the mortgagee will receive a corrected tier ranking score.
(c)
Assessment of civil money penalty.
A mortgagee that is found to have failed to engage in loss mitigation as required under paragraph (a) of this section shall be liable for a civil money penalty as provided in § 30.35(c) of this title.
[70 FR 21578, Apr. 26, 2005]
§ 203.606
Pre-foreclosure review.
(a) Before initiating foreclosure, the mortgagee must ensure that all servicing requirements of this subpart have been met. The mortgagee may not commence foreclosure for a monetary default unless at least three full monthly installments due under the mortgage are unpaid after application of any partial payments that may have been accepted but not yet applied to the mortgage account. In addition, prior to initiating any action required by law to foreclose the mortgage, the mortgagee shall notify the mortgagor in a format prescribed by the Secretary that the mortgagor is in default and the mortgagee intends to foreclose unless the mortgagor cures the default.
(b) If the mortgagee determines that any of the following conditions has been met, the mortgagee may initiate
foreclosure without the delay in foreclosure required by paragraph (a) of this section:
(1) The mortgaged property has been abandoned, or has been vacant for more than 60 days.
(2) The mortgagor, after being clearly advised of the options available for relief, has clearly stated in writing that he or she has no intention of fulfilling his or her obligation under the mortgage.
(3) The mortgaged property is not the mortgagor's principal residence and it is occupied by tenants who are paying rent, but the rental income is not being applied to the mortgage debt.
(4) The property is owned by a corporation or partnership.
[52 FR 6915, Mar. 5, 1987, as amended at 61 FR 35020, July 3, 1996]
§ 203.608
Reinstatement.
The mortgagee shall permit reinstatement of a mortgage, even after the institution of foreclosure proceedings, if the mortgagor tenders in a lump sum all amounts required to bring the account current, including foreclosure costs and reasonable attorney's fees and expenses properly associated with the foreclosure action, unless: (a) The mortgagee has accepted reinstatement after the institution of foreclosure proceedings within two years immediately preceding the commencement of the current foreclosure action, (b) reinstatement will preclude foreclosure following a subsequent default, or (c) reinstatement will adversely affect the priority of the mortgage lien.
§ 203.610
Relief for mortgagor in military service.
The mortgagee shall specifically give consideration to affording the mortgagor the benefit of relief authorized by §§ 203.345 and 203.346, if the mortgagor is
person in the military service
as that term is defined in the Soldiers and Sailors Civil Relief Act of 1940, as amended.
§ 203.614
Special forbearance.
If the mortgagee finds that a default is due to circumstances beyond the mortgagor's control, as defined by HUD, the mortgagee may grant special forbearance relief to the mortgagor in accordance with the conditions prescribed by HUD.
[61 FR 35020, July 3, 1996]
§ 203.616
Mortgage modification.
The mortgagee may modify a mortgage for the purpose of changing the amortization provisions by recasting the total unpaid amount due for a term not exceeding 480 months. The mortgagee must notify HUD of such modification in a format prescribed by HUD within 30 days of the execution of the modification agreement.

# Occupied Conveyance
§ 203.670
Conveyance of occupied property.
(a) It is HUD's policy to reduce the inventory of acquired properties in a manner that expands homeownership opportunities, strengthens neighborhoods and communities, and ensures a maximum return to the mortgage insurance fund.
(b) The Secretary will accept conveyance of an occupied property containing one to four residential units if the Secretary finds that:
(1) An individual residing in the property suffers from a temporary, permanent, or long-term illness or injury that would be aggravated by the process of moving from the property, and that the individual meets the eligibility criteria in § 203.674(a);
(2) State or local law prohibits the mortgagee from evicting a tenant residing in the property who is making regular monthly payments to the mortgagor, or prohibits eviction for other similar reasons beyond the control of the mortgagee; or
(3) It is in the Secretary's interest to accept conveyance of the property occupied under § 203.671, the property is habitable as defined in § 203.673, and, except for conveyances under § 203.671(d), each occupant who intends to remain in the property after the conveyance meets the eligibility criteria in § 203.674(b).
(c) HUD consents to accept good marketable title to occupied property where 90 days have elapsed since the mortgagee notified HUD of pending acquisition, the Department has notified the mortgagee that it was considering a request for continued occupancy, and no subsequent notification from HUD has been received by the mortgagee.
[53 FR 874, Jan. 14, 1988, as amended at 56 FR 46967, Sept. 16, 1991; 58 FR 54246, Oct. 20, 1993; 61 FR 36266, July 9, 1996]
§ 203.671
Criteria for determining the Secretary's interest.

(a) Occupancy of the property is essential to protect it from vandalism from time of acquisition to the time of preparation for sale.
(b) The average time in inventory for HUD's unsold inventory in the residential area in which the property is located exceeds six months.
(c) With respect to multi-unit properties, the marketability of the property would be improved by retaining occupancy of one or more units.
(d) The high cost of eviction or relocation expenses makes eviction impractical.
[45 FR 59563, Sept. 10, 1980, as amended at 56 FR 46967, Sept. 16, 1991; 58 FR 54246, Oct. 20, 1993]

Residential areas.
(a) For the purposes of occupied conveyance considerations, a residential area is any area which constitutes a local economic market for the purchase and sale of residential real estate. In making determinations of residential areas, substantial weight shall be given to delineations of such areas commonly used by persons active in the real estate industry in the affected area.
(b) HUD shall establish such residential areas within six (6) months of the publication of these regulations when HUD's current established patterns of dealing with the disposition of its acquired home property inventory and related recordkeeping does not coincide with paragraph (a) of this section. Under such circumstances the Secretary shall apply such established patterns in defining residential areas until the standards in paragraph (a) of this section are implemented.

§ 203.673
Habitability.
(a) For purposes of § 203.670, a property is habitable if it meets the requirements of this section in its present condition, or will meet these requirements with the expenditure of not more than five percent of the fair market value of the property. The cost of hazard reduction or abatement of lead-based paint hazards in the property, as required by the Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Prevention Act (42 U.S.C. 4821-4846), and the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992 (42 U.S.C. 4851-4856), and implementing regulations in part 35 of this title, is excluded from these repair cost limitations.

(c) If repairs, including lead-based paint hazard reduction or abatement, are to be made while the property is occupied, the occupant must hold the Secretary and the Department harmless against any personal injury or property damage that may occur during the process of making repairs. If temporary relocation of the occupant is necessary during repairs, no reimbursement for relocation expenses will be provided to the occupant.

(4) The occupant's total housing cost (rent plus utility costs to be paid by the occupant) will not exceed 38 percent of the occupant's net effective income (gross income less Federal income taxes). However, a higher percentage may be permitted if the occupant has been paying at least the required rental amount for the dwelling, or if there are other compensating factors (e.g., where the occupant is able to rely on cash savings or on contributions from family members to cover total housing costs).

For an adjustable interest rate HECM, the principal limit increase may be made available to the borrower each month thereafter except that the availability during the First 12-Month Disbursement Period may be restricted. Although the principal limit of a fixed interest rate HECM will continue to increase at the rate provided by the Commissioner, no further funds may be made available for the borrower to draw against after closing. The principal limit may decrease because of insurance or condemnation proceeds applied to the outstanding loan balance under § 206.209(b).

§ 206.21
Interest rate.
(a)
Fixed interest rate.
A fixed interest rate is agreed upon by the borrower and mortgagee.
(b)
Adjustable interest rate.
An initial expected average mortgage interest rate, which defines the mortgagee's margin, is agreed upon by the borrower and mortgagee as of the date of loan closing, or as of the date of rate lock-in, if the expected average mortgage interest rate was locked in prior to closing. The interest rate shall be adjusted in one of two ways depending on the option selected by the borrower, in accordance with paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section. Whenever an interest rate is adjusted, the new interest rate applies to the entire loan balance. The difference between the initial interest rate and the index figure applicable when the firm commitment is issued shall equal the margin used to determine interest rate adjustments. If the expected average mortgage interest rate is locked in prior to closing, the difference between the expected average mortgage interest rate and the value of the appropriate index at the time of rate lock-in shall equal the margin used to determine interest rate adjustments.
(1)
Annual adjustable interest rate HECMs.
A mortgagee offering an annual adjustable interest rate shall offer a mortgage with an interest rate cap structure that limits the periodic interest rate increases and decreases as follows:
(i)
Types of mortgages insurable.
The types of adjustable interest rate mortgages that are insurable are those for which the interest rate may be adjusted annually by the mortgagee, beginning after one year from the date of the closing.
(ii)
Interest rate index.
Changes in the mortgage interest rate charged on an adjustable interest rate mortgage must correspond to changes in the weekly average yield on U.S. Treasury securities (CMT) adjusted to a constant maturity of one year; to the 30-day average Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR); or to an alternative SOFR tenor approved by the Secretary. The
Secretary may publish approved SOFR tenors as alternatives to the 30-day average SOFR tenor through notice. The index type used to calculate the initial mortgage interest rate must be the same index type used to calculate the mortgage interest rate adjustments, except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. Commingling of index types for the mortgage interest rate and adjustments is not otherwise allowed, unless approved by the Secretary. Unless otherwise provided in this section, each periodic adjustment in the mortgage interest rate must correspond to the upward and downward change in the index, except that downward changes in the index will not result in an index figure that is less than zero.
(iii)
Frequency of interest rate changes.
(A) The interest rate adjustments must occur annually, calculated from the date of the closing, except that the first adjustment shall be no sooner than 12 months or later than 18 months.
(B) To set the new interest rate, the mortgagee will determine the change between the initial (
i.e.,
base) index figure and the current index figure, or will add a specific margin to the current index figure. The initial index figure shall be the most recent figure available before the date of mortgage loan origination. The current index figure shall be the most recent index figure available 30 days before the date of each interest rate adjustment.
(iv)
Magnitude of changes.
The adjustable interest rate mortgage initial contract interest rate shall be agreed upon by the mortgagee and the borrower. The first adjustment to the contract interest rate shall take place in accordance with the schedule set forth under paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section. Thereafter, for all annual adjustable interest rate mortgages, the adjustment shall be made annually and shall occur on the anniversary date of the first adjustment, subject to the following conditions and limitations:
(A) For all annual adjustable interest rate HECMs, no single adjustment to the interest rate shall result in a change in either direction of more than two percentage points from the interest rate in effect for the period immediately preceding that adjustment. Index changes in excess of two percentage points may not be carried over for inclusion in an adjustment for a subsequent year. Adjustments in the effective rate of interest over the entire term of the mortgage may not result in a change in either direction of more than five percentage points from the initial contract interest rate.
(B) At each adjustment date for annual adjustable interest rate HECMs, changes in the index interest rate, whether increases or decreases, must be translated into the adjusted mortgage interest rate, except that the mortgage may provide for minimum interest rate change limitations and for minimum increments of interest rate changes.
(2)
Monthly adjustable interest rate HECMs.
If a mortgage meeting the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section is offered, the mortgagee may also offer a mortgage which provides for monthly adjustments to the interest rate subject to the following requirements:
(i)
Interest rate index.
Changes in the interest rate charged on an adjustable interest rate mortgage shall correspond to changes in the weekly average yield on U.S. Treasury securities (CMT) adjusted to a constant maturity of one year, to the weekly average yield on CMT adjusted to one-month, or to an alternative SOFR index approved by the Secretary. The index type used to calculate the initial mortgage interest rate must be the same index type used to calculate the mortgage interest rate adjustments, except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. Commingling of index types for the mortgage interest rate and adjustments is not otherwise allowed, unless approved by the Secretary. Unless otherwise provided in this section, each periodic adjustment in the mortgage interest rate must correspond to the upward and downward change in the index, except that downward changes in the index will not result in an index figure that is less than zero.
(ii)
Frequency of interest rate changes.
(A) The interest rate adjustments must occur monthly, calculated from the date of the closing, except that the first adjustment shall be no sooner
than 30 days (28 days for February, as applicable) or later than three months from the date of the closing.
(B) To set the new interest rate, the mortgagee will determine the change between the initial (
i.e.,
base) index figure and the current index figure, or will add a specific margin to the current index figure. The initial index figure shall be the most recent figure available before the date of mortgage loan origination. The current index figure shall be the most recent index figure available 30 days (28 days for February, as applicable) before the date of each interest rate adjustment.
(iii)
Magnitude of changes.
The initial mortgage interest rate shall be agreed upon by the mortgagee and the borrower. Adjustments in the effective rate of interest over the entire term of the mortgage (the lifetime adjustment cap) may result in a change in either direction of no more than ten percentage points from the initial contract interest rate. The Secretary may change this lifetime adjustment cap through notice.
(3)
Transition for existing mortgages indexed to LIBOR.
Mortgages with an existing adjustable interest rate indexed to the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) must be transitioned to the spread-adjusted SOFR replacement index approved by the Secretary by the next interest rate adjustment date for the mortgage on or after the Replacement Date. Notice of the transition to the SOFR replacement index must be sent to the borrower in accordance with the mortgage documents. The Secretary will publish through Mortgagee Letter any additional requirements for the transition of existing mortgages.
(c)
Pre-loan disclosure.
(1) At the time the mortgagee provides the borrower with a loan application, a mortgagee shall provide a borrower with a written explanation of all adjustable interest rate features of a mortgage. The explanation must include the following items:
(i) The circumstances under which the rate may increase;
(ii) Any limitations on the increase; and
(iii) The effect of an increase.
(2) Compliance with pre-loan disclosure provisions of 12 CFR part 1026 (Truth in Lending) shall constitute full compliance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
(d)
Post-loan disclosure.
At least 25 days before any adjustment to the interest rate may occur, the mortgagee must advise the borrower of the following:
(1) The current index amount;
(2) The date of publication of the index; and
(3) The new interest rate.

§ 206.23
Shared appreciation.
(a)
Additional interest based on net appreciated value.
Any mortgage for which the mortgagee has chosen the shared premium option (§ 206.107) may provide for shared appreciation. At the time the mortgage becomes due and payable or is paid in full, whichever occurs first, the borrower shall pay an additional amount of interest equal to a percentage of any net appreciated value of the property during the life of the mortgage. The percentage of net appreciated value to be paid to the mortgagee, referred to as the appreciation margin, shall be no more than twenty-five percent, subject to an effective interest rate cap of no more than twenty percent.
(b)
Computation of mortgagee share.
The mortgagee's share of net appreciated value is computed as follows:
(1) If the outstanding loan balance at the time the mortgagee's share of net appreciated value becomes payable is less than the appraised value of the property at the time of loan origination, the mortgagee's share is calculated by subtracting the appraised value at the time of loan origination from the adjusted sales proceeds (
i.e.,
sales proceeds less transfer costs and capital improvement costs incurred by the borrower, but excluding any liens) and multiplying by the appreciation margin.
(2) If the outstanding loan balance is greater than the appraised value at the time of loan origination but less than the adjusted proceeds, the mortgagee's share is calculated by subtracting the
outstanding loan balance from the adjusted sales proceeds and multiplying by the appreciation margin.
(3) If the outstanding loan balance is greater than the adjusted sales proceeds, the net appreciated value is zero.
(4) If there has been no sale or transfer involving satisfaction of the mortgage at the time the mortgagee's share of net appreciated value becomes payable,
sales proceeds
for purposes of this section shall be the appraised value as determined in accordance with procedures approved by the Commissioner.
(c)
Effective interest rate.
To determine the effective interest rate, the amount of interest which accrued in the twelve months prior to the sale of the property or the prepayment is added to the mortgagee's share of the net appreciated value. The sum of the mortgagee's share of the net appreciated value and the interest, when divided by the sum of the outstanding loan balance at the beginning of the twelve-month period prior to sale or prepayment plus the payments to or on behalf of the borrower (but not including interest) in the twelve months prior to the sale or prepayment, shall not exceed an effective interest rate of twenty percent.
(d)
Disclosure.
At the time the mortgagee provides the borrower with a loan application for a mortgage with shared appreciation, the mortgagee shall disclose to the borrower the principal limit, payments and interest rate which are applicable to a comparable mortgage offered by the mortgagee without shared appreciation.

(v) All interest through the remainder of the payment term. The expected average mortgage interest rate shall be used for this purpose.
(2) The mortgagee shall make all monthly disbursements through the payment term even if the outstanding loan balance exceeds the principal limit because the actual average mortgage interest rate exceeds the expected average mortgage interest rate unless the HECM becomes due and payable under § 206.27(c). In the event of a deferral of due and payable status in accordance with § 206.27(c)(3), disbursements shall cease immediately upon the death of the borrower and no further disbursements are permissible.
(3) Mortgagees shall ensure that term monthly disbursements made to the borrower during the First 12-Month Disbursement Period do not exceed the Initial Disbursement Limit. If the sum of disbursements made during the First 12-Month Disbursement Period would exceed the Initial Disbursement Limit for that time period, the mortgagee shall decrease the monthly disbursements during the First 12-Month Disbursement Period to conform with the Initial Disbursement Limit; upon conclusion of the First 12-Month Disbursement Period, the borrower may request a payment plan recalculation.

The line of credit amount increases at the same rate as the total principal limit increases under § 206.3. The sum of disbursements made during the First 12-Month Disbursement Period shall not exceed the Initial Disbursement Limit. If a requested disbursement would exceed the Initial Disbursement Limit, the mortgagee may make a partial disbursement to the borrower for the amount that will not exceed the limit. Upon the conclusion of the First 12-Month Disbursement Period, the borrower may request subsequent disbursements up to the available principal limit.
(h)
Single Lump Sum payment option.
(1) Under the Single Lump Sum payment option, the Borrower's Advance shall be made by the mortgagee to the borrower in an amount that does not exceed the maximum allowable Borrower's Advance under paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
(2) If the borrower makes a partial prepayment of the outstanding loan balance any time after loan closing and before the contract of insurance is terminated, the mortgagee shall apply the funds from the partial prepayment in accordance with the Note.

after closing when paid to the Commissioner.

The mortgagee shall pay a late charge to the borrower for any late disbursement. If the mortgagee does not mail or electronically transfer a scheduled monthly disbursement to the borrower on the first business day of the month or make a line of credit disbursement within 5 business days of the date the mortgagee received the request, the late charge shall be 10 percent of the entire amount that should have been paid to the borrower for that month or as a result of that request. In no event shall the total late charge exceed five hundred dollars. For each additional day that the borrower does not receive payment, the mortgagee shall pay interest at the mortgage interest rate on the late payment. Any late charge and interest shall be paid from the mortgagee's funds and shall not be added to the outstanding loan balance.
(k)
No minimum payments.
A mortgagee shall not require, as a condition of providing a loan secured by a mortgage insured under this part, that the monthly payments under the term or tenure payment option or draws under the line of credit payment option exceed a minimum amount established by the mortgagee.

(ii) If repairs after closing under § 206.47 cannot be completed with the funds set aside for repairs, the mortgagee may advance additional funds to complete repairs from an existing line of credit. If a line of credit is not sufficient to make the advance or if no line of credit exists, future monthly disbursements shall be recalculated for use as a line of credit in accordance with § 206.25.
(iii) If repairs are not completed when required by the mortgage, the mortgagee shall stop monthly payments and the mortgage shall convert to the line of credit payment option. Until the repairs are completed, the mortgagee shall make no line of credit disbursements except as needed to pay for repairs required by the mortgage.
(2)
Fixed Interest Rate HECMs.
No unused set aside funds shall be made available to the borrower, except that
a borrower may be reimbursed for the cost of repair materials (not including labor), in accordance with § 206.47, under conditions established by the Commissioner.

The mortgage shall include a provision deferring the due and payable status that occurs because of the death of the last surviving borrower for an Eligible Non-Borrowing Spouse. It shall also contain provisions designed to ensure compliance with this part and provisions on the following additional matters:
(1) Disbursements by the mortgagee under the term or tenure payment options shall be mailed to the borrower or electronically transferred to an account of the borrower on the first business day of each month beginning with the first month after closing.

Such insurance shall be maintained in the amount and for the period of time that is necessary to protect the mortgagee's investment. Whether or not the mortgagee imposes a flood insurance requirement, the borrower shall at a minimum insure all improvements on the property, whether in existence at the time of origination or subsequently erected, against loss by floods to the extent required by the Commissioner. If the mortgagee imposes insurance requirements, all insurance shall be carried with companies acceptable to the mortgagee, and the insurance policies and any renewals shall be held by the mortgagee and shall include loss payable clauses in favor of and in a form acceptable to the mortgagee.
(3) The borrower shall not participate in a real estate tax deferral program or permit any liens to be recorded against the property, unless such liens are subordinate to the insured mortgage and, if applicable, any second mortgage held by the Commissioner.

(10) If State law limits the first lien status of the mortgage as originally executed and recorded to a maximum amount of debt or a maximum number of years, the borrower shall agree to execute any additional documents required by the mortgagee and approved by the Commissioner to extend the first lien status to an additional amount of debt and an additional number of years and to cause any other liens to be removed or subordinated.
(c)
Date the mortgage comes due and payable.

dies and the property is not the principal residence of at least one surviving borrower, except that the due and payable status shall be deferred in accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of this section if the requirements of the Deferral Period are met; or if a borrower conveys all of his or her title in the property and no other borrower retains title to the property. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a borrower retains title in the property if the borrower continues to hold title to any part of the property in fee simple, as a leasehold interest as set forth in § 206.45(a), or as a life estate.
(2) The mortgage shall state that the outstanding loan balance shall be due and payable in full, upon approval of the Commissioner, if any of the following occur:

(d)
Second mortgage to Commissioner.
Unless otherwise provided by the Commissioner, a second mortgage to secure any payments by the Commissioner as provided in § 206.121(c) must be given to the Commissioner before a Mortgage Insurance Certificate is issued for the mortgage. If the Commissioner does not require a second mortgage to be given to the Commissioner prior to the issuance of a Mortgage Insurance Certificate, the Commissioner may require a second mortgage to be given to the Commissioner at a later day in order to secure payments by the Commissioner as provided in § 206.121(c).

(b) Current HECM borrowers that plan to sell their existing residence and use the HECM for Purchase program to obtain a new principal residence must pay off the existing FHA-insured mortgage before the HECM for Purchase mortgage can be insured.
§ 206.35
Title of property which is security for HECM.
(a) A mortgagor is not required to be a borrower; however, any borrower is required to be on title to the property which serves as collateral for the HECM, and is therefore, by definition, also a mortgagor.
(b) The mortgagor shall hold title to the entire property which is the security for the mortgage. If there are multiple mortgagors, all the mortgagors must collectively hold title to the entire property which is the security for the mortgage. If one or more mortgagors hold a life estate in the property, for purposes of this section only, the term “mortgagor” shall include each holder of a future interest in the property (remainder or reversion) who has executed the mortgage.
(c) If Non-Borrowing Spouses and non-borrowing owners of the property will continue to hold title to the property which serves as collateral for the HECM, such Non-Borrowing Spouses and non-borrowing owners must sign the mortgage as mortgagors, evidencing their commitment of the property as security for the mortgage.
(d) All Non-Borrowing Spouses and non-borrowing owners shall sign a certification that:
(1) Consents to their spouse or other borrowing owner obtaining the HECM;
(2) Acknowledges the terms and conditions of the mortgage; and

through cumulative draws prior to the date of the HECM closing.
(b) Mortgagees must provide documentation satisfactory to the Commissioner as established by notice that the seasoning requirement was met.
(c)
Home Equity Lines of Credit.
The borrower may pay off, at closing, a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) that does not meet seasoning requirements from borrower funds, the HECM funds, or a combination of HECM funds and borrower funds, as long as the draw from HECM funds does not exceed the percentage approved by the Commissioner under the authority of § 206.25(a).
§ 206.37
